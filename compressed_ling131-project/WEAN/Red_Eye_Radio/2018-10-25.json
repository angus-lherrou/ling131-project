I wasn't talking about my opinion I was talking about right somebody else who told me\nWho is a supporter and we were talking about the possibilities of what could harm and move independence one way or another and the argument was it's not going to change me or anybody that I Know well I Know that's not the point\nThat it's not you're not you're not part of that you're you're already in the restaurant eating you need you need to build a business out this is this is exactly what the president can do\nAnd this is unique to this president by the way because the Republicans we'd been screaming for years can't get their message across and if they could get it across if they could go out there and promote that message a very simple message\nThen they could get that out and they could they could gain more seats instead of losing seats and this was back then not the right there early now we're talking about getting a message across to people who have not been fully convinced yet if you've been fully convinced\nWe've already made that point you're not the one that we're talking about you're not part of that group\nThe the Republicans but more importantly the president\nRight now are they are capable together of getting real things done and they need to give our\nMessage out there but there is this and and we continue to have to fight this all the time or we will get people to call well you guys think that you can convince everybody\nThat we don't know but that's never been the goal to convince everybody but there are people that look people [laughter] people\nA vow of every day it's not maybe not be the majority of the population that people learn every day and\nA teacher's politicians how many look look one of the great one of the greatest things some of the greatest callers we get are people that have called the show and I said you know I used to think this way and then I started ... you know listening to you guys and other people in this politician and this guy and\nYou know you you referenced some people and I gave them a listen to on economics and I realize I changed my mind completely ... people change their minds you're not trying to get everybody to change your mind them you're trying to get that that person in the middle and we were talking about specifically yesterday\nUndecided it's about it's the political strategy of all we grow\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai kid Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in pristine free own condition at what for Denise religion they're against it that's right over two hundred free on cars all makes all models and incredible prices love onto flood Otto John job now\nAnd we believe if you promote free markets conservative economics conservative principles and you explain it in a simple way a nation that largely remains and we're not talking\nTo you who is listening to the show you have taught us out you sought out shows like this you've sought out information like this so we're not referring to you you're already you're already aboard but when there are new people and we get them all the\nTime and you are able to introduce them to different ideas\nThere is a segment of the population that's willing to listen it might only be five percent but that five percent makes the difference in almost probably ... I Would guess Ninety five percent of elections out there and that is the goal the goal is to win\n\nThe goal is not to get an immediate satisfaction because our candidate you use a little bit more heated rhetoric than the other candidate we understand that and that's what I Love when people run if you guys don't understand the frustration out there\nYou're kidding me you're not if you liked it just would you like to sit in this chair for the last almost Thirty years Mm [laughter] oh no it's always it's always complete peace and quiet here yeah right that's what it is a conservative radio talk show hosts for the last Thirty years yeah\nIt's really a Tom [laughter] it's always a very old highlights scenario it's like doing yoga all the time at a table to him oh it's like sitting on a beach it's like\nThat just sitting there and I'm ... I I got friends in St Thomas sending their Virgin Islands St Thomas speech a what a nice day that's what it is day after\nDay here as cures and and so the goal is is is the goal to get that satisfaction of getting that hangs out every day at the other side that you disagree with that you believe is unfair and in some cases evil\nNo that's not our goal look after them on the issues go after them with with uh you know with everything you've got on the issues\nAnd spell out where their plan is wrong or what they're doing is wrong and and be very clear about it that's part of it\nBut the rhetoric is doesn't need to be looked at the point is is that you feel like there's this limited window and that the ... the window is closing and it just might here within two weeks and so the point being is that\nBecause we've been doing it so long and we've seen the do nothing Republicans time after time where they've had I mean mass of doors just wide open for them\nBut you've got to get a consistent message out think about where we are right now in terms of social media and communications we have the ability to communicate twenty four seven any given person\nCan be communicating ... you can set the messages are ahead of time to automatically go out while you're sleeping you can you can\nCommunicate right now around the clock get the message out while you've got the economic wins or create some more of those economic wins\nAnd you're building again the base you're trying to get more people into the base that aren't on board already\nWhat frustrates me is understanding the left uses the heat of heated rhetoric that they that they use they do that out of desperation and they can't win on the issues they're angry it's the only thing that they have left because they're they're angry and I understand\nThat on you know the other side on on the the side that I'm most closely relate to that it gets frustrating because they're always just so angry and they were spewing out their hatred towards you and you want to attack\nBack\nWe don't need to because the reason that they're doing it is because they don't have the substance of their ideas behind them and they're frustrated as hell and we don't need to act\nThe way that they do they need to that's the only way they've got nothing else they need to be that way we don't need to be that way some of us choose to be that way we don't need to be that way because we have the substance to back up our ideas that they\nWell well you know here's here's the you know where where they've gone as a party there former leader was in

thanks captain obvious we already know that\nDon't boo vote okay Kenny can you\nCan ... and ... and as we said a total lack of substance on actually hitting the the the issues that's the difference look at you know we talked about how we don't like pit political ideology on either side and but I Do understand\nThat because of political ideology on on the left is based purely on personality and on the right it's not I still don't like political idea I I just don't like political I dollar free we worship a candidate it's still always has bothered me but the fact is I Do understand if you have great admiration for somebody who is promoting certain principles and ideas\nRight that are that are specific\nAnd work and promote freedom and liberty yet then I get it but as you said you saw and I think you you made a great thing Obama was almost begging the other day for what you saw was the shell of the Democratic party which is the other night which is no ideas just imagery and symbolism

taking my call say um I just like to take exception to cheer premise of believe that President Trump's going to have a long term effect accomplish 'cause you know I mean it can be over to X number one you know he's got three branches or the all three branches of\nGovernment I'm like oh I bet you first by presidents come and do\nA a okay I'll I'll tell you what had because we're short on time John I'll tell you what the anti reverse I have a two year construction is on the Supreme Court good point yeah excellent point\nYeah I I don't I that's why I don't remember us in any segment today saying what you claim we said\nWell I Believe that get about maybe forty five minutes ago that you know this kind of revolution and you know they've got all the ... you got all the answers\nAnd I'll make is John John John John Saddam we said that the president and the Republicans were making progress and they are and so what we want them to do is be able to focus on that message and keep the message going it's that simple\nYeah saying I made about law and the ... or anything else like we didn't say anything but of course I could I could get you on that because I pointed out uh with Kavanaugh Anne Gorsuch you have to construction yeah you're\nRight on the ... or ...\nThat right and and and when we want we are that we were the ... we were the first to say that in the executive branch should we look at Obama most of what Obama done has been dismantled because if you don't use the legislature if you use executive orders ... uh in order to run your executive branch instead of trying to get legislation passed through by legislative branch yeah\nIt's not going to be long term but the tax cuts could be long term well\nAn inch here's the thing to what did you have with the tax cuts in in the uh the while not retaliatory but the the response from the Democrats was what\nNot that we're gonna take it back to you know thirty five percent we're going to we're going to take it to one eighty five percent remember right\nAlmost right away what we need to raise if we need to raise it to twenty five percent what ... what was the Republicans that weren't even saying twenty five percent during the whole discussion on it and we didn't think they would get anywhere close to Twenty one\nPercent so it's you know this this whole thing of of being long lasting a good economy is not going to be defeated because the American people want to keep it going I'm\nThe last administration tried that they've tried everything they could step in the way of private sector you didn't build that that was their attitude that was the attitude by the former administration but the the fact of the matter is is private sector built all of it the roads the bridges\nYou know so it it's just because\nThe problem is is with with if you're going to you know that if that are in the echo chamber of social media especially if that false information misleading information is going to be out there\nThan it is you know it it starts to become or build a narrative in the wrong direction if you start on the wrong premise everything that follows a may sound logical but it still is built on that false premise so\nYou know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review yeah they're doing but it was an oversight here in my opinion because that's not what the associated\nPress story all I can understand it because when I read is the first time mhm that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading here it says the ... and then I read it again I went oh that's not what the scent\nWhat Washington Post on there headline had it right there headline ... that the powder that was sent along with the words harm you know a along with the\nSuspicious package was harmless and and so the the point being is that\nThat the narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not pass that and you don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now\nPeople are\n... group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our high car buyers are tough\nReview to me is extremely credible ... at the time but I don't know maybe it's too late by mistake whatever or like I said when I first read it and that's what I told you as an earth are saying the bomb was harmless right this is in our personal meaning not on the air\nAnd then realized oh no that's not what they're saying if you read the sentence again they're separating the sentence and Associated Press separates the two yes\nAnd then says pipe bomb not again we don't know there is that's the one thing that we've talked about which again which is when we went through all the different questions that you would ask\nAnd the questions that and and that's why it's very important to find out you know whether they were you know ... whether they were active bombs that could have gone off and could have gone off and would have gone on a ... you know and and whether they would have gone off because of the time or or whatever\nOr were they set to go out and what they've gone off or where they just explosive materials that would not have gone off or would we find out that they actually were not explosive materials and actually weren't bombs that they were fake bombs because at that point you would look at it and the questions that you would ask as an investigator would\nBe different if they were all fake bombs than they were meant to just scare mhm or they were meant to be used as a political statement mhm well who would benefit if they were all fake bombs and they were sent for a political statement would be the next question that you would ask the right\nAnd so again we don't know and that's why we are when\nWe talked about you know CNN and others blaming Trump for all of this incredible divisiveness which caused this and as we said don't even realize the irony\nThat they're saying the divisiveness must stop but yet they create the maximum divisive this by blaming somebody for an incident where they don't have the fact they don't know\nWe have no idea yeah the motivation behind the the the uh the person\nOr persons nobody has any idea and they create this same divisiveness claiming that they're against the advice of this and it's exactly what they're doing how many times a week on the left doing that it's like [laughter] we're accusing us something which is exactly what we're doing\nYeah right well anyway specially without knowing all the facts here\n\nYou know they're trying to put a puzzle together with without all the pieces that we've got to in fact until they find we may never know the motivation if they don't find the person responsible and even if they do\nSometimes you don't know motivation you it takes a great deal of a detective work\nAnd I know sources of so they believe it's the same you know right people are ... percent or group of people based on them which area which again that that the number of the number of of\nAh devices that you sent out is more evidence that the FBI can can use I wouldn't be surprised at the FBI or wouldn't be at all surprised if they solve isn't solved it pretty quickly mhm\n\nYeah if you look at the nature of ah how this was sent a the the packaging the if you look at the um\nThe the one packaging for the the device that was sent to CNN or you know the multiple stamps went through USGS um each of these by the way\nDepending on who they are even Soros has his own private security go through you know he doesn't open his own male uh usually people at that level don't open you know anything themselves all of that sort and there's a great deal of security um but\nBut of course with uh the the Clintons that's the case the secret service for actually has their own sorting that they do so the male doesn't doesn't it's not delivered\nYou know to the doorstep or or in the mailbox like it would be for you and I of course that's that's that's something that's going and has been for a long time and place but but\nThe point being is that they have a a great\nDeal of resources that the secret service has a great deal of resources into and and finding out you know and and putting together the puzzle\nThere say there's a pretty good chance right now based on just having cameras everywhere these days that they know it may be where the facility or facilities were at these were\n... group wants your car any make any model flood pays more than anything around because we're a certified buying center at will buy yours even if you don't buy hours logged onto our car buyers are tough\nNow we haven't heard anything that said that they were armed and ready to go winds and\nCould have been triggered by a ... a phone or whatever I that would be the next question why not write\nWell because in in in ... ... is there a reason that you'd I'm I'm I'm not throwing out a conspiracy ... I've seen is there an investigating reason why you wouldn't do it\nWell and if they were armed or or or if they were at that at that point those were those devices were ready to go off I'm I'm Wondering about the level of security especially in the middle of New York city\nA right there in the building the CNN building a the those employees were allowed to go back it was it was after three o'clock some time but but they were allowed to go back in the building\nI'm ... and so does that tell us anything about the threat the level of threat based on what they know about these devices will find out in the coming days you know because if they were armed and they were ready to go off then\nAnd you suspect that there might be more would you allow people to go back in that building\nYou know it's one thing with the Clintons they ... they always have\nAs ex presidents do\nA secret service detail and they're always going to have that a great level security\nAh but if it's if you're talking about you know the media you have to assume right that the if the threat is real and if that were at that device word dangerous or we're\nReady to go off that there you would expect that there might be more or possibly in the system somewhere um but I don't know we really don't know it just that's the question that we have we're not going to speculate to the point of of conclusion because we actually there's really not much to go on you would just know that you've got\nA\n... ... you've got these devices you've got a we know who the targets were who they were sent you\nAnd and that's about it we ... we we've seen the pictures on on the on line and in the media\nAs to what the packaging was at least with the CNN device but again where the the FBI and the and uh everyone that's involved in the uh of course the investigation here they're putting the puzzle together you can't do that this is why I caution and I think it was\nWe can't you can't watch Fox News I don't care who they are they have the the the so called experts well here's what we're looking at\nEven the experts sitting in a studio can't tell you what they're really looking at it looks suspicious which we already know that's all we know about this entire situation\nSuspicious packages we don't know anything else that's it and when the FBI tells us or authorities tell us more than we can start having

write\nA twelve days away from uh the uh the mid term elections I went out and early voted yesterday ... uh uh went to the local community college was one of the early voting sites for me\nRight it was pouring rain and it just ... ... and when it was funny 'cause I've never even those campuses only five miles from my house I really just\nNever been to never drove through this community college right oh drove through what the science route front on them you know that that you could tell me okay this is early voting in political science all over the place\nAnd so I started driving around trying to find the building and saying I have no idea what building that's going to be in but when I but I Will know what when I see it became a political science will be all over the place right right yeah and they were the only thing is\nThey didn't have any parking\nIf you came in to vote it was all student parking at a college uh yeah yeah which and I just thought to myself because I ... that was one of the reasons I wasn't going to go there I was going to go to a courthouse right or were you know that was also about the same distance away from me maybe a little further ... more miles\nAnd I was going to go there and I said nah\nI Want to check out the the the campus because I've never been out of before so I had about a thousand foot ... pouring rain but when I got in there everybody friendly ... no matter what the ... is ... outside the anger the range that we see in the media every day\nEvery time I Walk into a polling place hey how you doing everybody's laughing joke

a tablet ignoring the tablet around you signed right on the tablet ... you know with a little pencil where I could guess I could have signed with my finger I said this is new they said yet makes it

hundred it's it's pretty big issue ... uh and the rate of construction\nEvery time we kept it it's almost as if it's not moving along at all and you and I are totally asking why why is it going so

south by tomorrow Easter by sixty five and I Ninety five in the Carolinas\nA chance to double down on immigration and issue the Democrats themselves remained vulnerable on why are the Democrats vulnerable on immigration\nBecause they have\nWe've been saying for years\nAnd this is what we said pretty much throughout the show yesterday and and the earlier this week as well they have to be positioned very clearly the question has to be asked where do you stand on the border\nThey must be forced to say it because it's very clear to most people but but they're going to have to answer the question what level of border enforcement do support\nWhat don't use the word comprehensive\nExactly what do you support we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support we know what you don't want what do you want\nHe said again I have argued elsewhere the party should have been raised an immigration compromise where the wall would be built\nIn exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong uh uh you know a Democrat any from a democratic pollster just you understand but that's really a lot of what we have said that we have ... as we've said yesterday and I believe the day before\nOn on the whole caravan thing this was a perfect opportunity for the Republicans and the president to back them into a corner\nAnd go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have a comprehensive\nImmigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means right what does that mean specifically what do you want and he talks about it here are I Would you be for the would you be for a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants that are here and then a wall is to be built and anybody who comes here in the future must go back and\n\nAre you for that but you can't we have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has\nBeen for the last Thirteen Years yeah because when you when I came on this show together the issue we had to go back and looked at this yesterday in the history of our show the first thing that we really discuss was a\nWas a like a Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy mhm which was the amnesty that was two thousand five\nJust if they they made the decision just a couple of weeks after you and I started working together right and so for Thirteen Years the Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration what would they do\nWhat with their plan be\nThinking about this and that by the way that say Republican failure mhm because the Republicans should be demanding every ... every time they talk about illegal immigration it should be the Democrats\n... ... it should be as we've said you make the accusation Democrats wide open borders and when they cry you our line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you wouldn't want a gun\nIssue than the challenge and that's what we've shown is saying here that again they haven't had to answer they haven't had to\nThey don't didn't they some of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that\nAnd there wasn't a massive response from\nDemocrats saying well that's ridiculous you don't get rid of ice you don't get rid of border enforcement in this country that's ridiculous that the American public and even Democrats a significant portion of Democrats one border security they may have compassion for people that are here\n\nAnd want to have compassion when it comes to even legal immigration but as we have brought it to your attention\nThe demographics that want the least legal immigration into this country are blacks and Hispanics ...\nWhen you look at the polling as to the number of when you go the demographics and you see the the numbers\nOf of\nMinorities in this country who want the lowest level of legal immigration that even from\nOf legal immigration that even from has never talked about mhm it's minorities the vast majority of them the huge vast majority of them who vote Democrat\nMhm no the American people Sam with the president on border enforcement they do he's winning that politically but the other side of it is is that\nThe Democrats have not been forced to choose say what they want at all you do with the president wants you know what the Republicans won\nAnd and I think that in the entire first off you have to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say and you have to you have to force them and backed them into a corner and and as I said uh get in their face yesterday rhetorically is what I said I don't mean physically but rhetorically and make them answer back them against the wall so they have no choice\nTo either you made your point that they're for open borders or they have to respond and give you the specifics that they do not\nThe second thing is sort of what Trump is doing already when he's talking about the caravan saying we'll pull well we're going to pull\nAid from you mhm but look\nIf you improve your country and you become more capitalistic will be the first ones here to help you write\n\nSo we can't take in the entire world but this is where you need to start focusing on those governments in those countries and saying we're here to help you help your own people from\nThat\nBut you need to embrace free markets you need to you need to do something that is\nBy the way also we when we talk about the imagery you know the the one picture that came out with the hunter and flag\n... and all that and so people start question well why do you want to come here right do you want to come here to become citizens or is it just to work and then you know go back and then we have to have that discussion as to well what do we want from people who come over here\nAs citizens but first before you even get to any of those other things that I'm Talking about you have to find out what the other major party actually once when it comes to illegal immigration and border enforcement we're not even to that point\nNo how can you have a discussion when only one side has sudden get has put forth plans of what they want and the other side won't go after they're part of the party than endorses open borders and just keeps quiet on it well silence is your consent\nYes silence is your consent saying get rid of ice is your consent we're not going to get rid of border enforcement in the United states so why are you preaching that\nNow That's Douglas shown whose looks like to me as the longtime Democrat who are about to use Claire McCaskill's verbiage or isn't a crazy Democrat or\nA says of course the rank and file Democrats the average person votes Democrat and they want border control sure in fact the constituency that votes most Democrat most the time\nActually to get out of illegal immigration in the legal immigration is a demographic that once the least legal immigration into this country\nLook you have a sanctuary city policies sanctuary state policy sanctuary county policy by Democrats have been promoting it for a long long time\nAnd now you have the you know abolish ice protest they they're saying it but they're not forced to say the words open borders\nThey should say they should be forced to say it because that's what they're promoting and if they're not where's the pushback if they're promoting border enforcement at any level\nTell me who and I mean the ... from the party that is actually saying that in promoting his Chuck Schumer promoting that Nancy Pelosi or they promoting that\nMay be a Joe Manchin we haven't heard him but we have you know there might be one or two maybe clear [laughter] you know she's not one of those crazy Democrats but where's the party\nSaying this is what we want because actually official political battle\nHow can we have and how can we have a debate on illegal immigration and border enforcement when the other side won't officially tell us what they would want what they want right except for those that are in the party that promote open borders and the elimination advice they won't even have the debate why right\n\nAnd that's what Republicans Republicans have a Thirteen Years the pound on Democrats for it and they failed miserably in that\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit light up of Lincoln M.

well [noise] uh latest [noise] here on the events from yesterday the FBI said [noise] ah last evening that it had to identify seven suspicious\nPackages addressed to prominence liberal and democratic political figures over the previous three days that contained quote potentially destructive devices and to quote\nThe bureau initially said it had recovered five packages that were similar in appearance and bore the return address of an office for representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida the packages were address to George Soros Hillary Clinton\nA former president Brock Obama former CIA director John Brennan a care of CNN and former attorney general Eric Holder the FBI shut it was possible\nThat additional packages were mailed to other locations\nUh this investigation is of the highest priority for the FBI Director Christopher Wray set in a statement we have committed the full strength of the FBI's resources in together with our partners on the joint terrorism task forces\nWe will continue to work to identify an arrest whoever's responsible for sending these packages we ask anyone who may have been permission to contact the FBI do not hesitate to call no piece of information is too small to help us with this investigation law enforcement officials involved\nIn the investigation told Fox News of the similarity between the packages has led them to believe that a single individual or group could be responsible\nIn addition to the five packages identified by the FBI US Capitol police were investigating a suspicious package address to representative Maxine Waters of California\nAt the Capitol Hill screening facility and Marilyn water set in a statement that the Capitol police have told her that her Washington DC office was the target a suspicious package that has been referred to the FBI late Wednesday the Los Angeles central male facility was evacuated after employees\nFound a suspicious package which the Associated Press reported was addressed to waters the FBI later confirmed that it had recovered two packages addressed to waters that were similar to the five and a reference and its earlier statement\nThe police department we did that a bomb squad had rendered the package at the male facility safe and investigation will be turned over to the FBI so that's the latest that we\nUh have a right now a again a the one thing\nWonder

like no they're not seeing what they're saying is it's the powder that came with the the the ... they're not saying that both were harmless right\nThey're saying the powder was harmless you know that that's what the source said the powder was harmless they didn't even mention about the suspected potentially explosive package they didn't say either way\nRight on that one so uh again that's you know that's what we deal with\nAnd you know we saw yesterday but you saw it again you saw from CNN you saw it from the the Democrats are you know we're picking where well you really couldn't pick and choose the facts because you didn't have any\nVery few very few windows ... we know these devices were sent we know who they were sent to we know what the authorities are told us already the problem when you start getting these so called experts in and and they are experts otherwise you but you can't be an expert about the situation unless you're investigating it yourself\nAnd there were plenty of them on television yesterday saying well it looks like see what you got here and what you got here okay there are certain things you can tell from the pictures you can tell while it was um you can tell the like the label\nOn the packaging that went to see Annette well we know it had Brennan's name on it we know it was addressed to CNN we can see certain things\nBut in terms of the the bomb experts that Ron well here's what it looks like it still doesn't tell us the facts what it appears to be and what it might be or what it actually is could be two different things\nWhat what gets me

against it and you you have this kind of surety or tried to proclaim\nAnd you're being the most divisive in that moment\nAnd it's so obvious and they seem to be completely and totally clueless are

October was Fox News we're ... was a tie a than the Missouri scout that has all the up by one in that and build a dead heat yeah it is it is is dead heat and so the fascinating thing about uh this radio ad\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood was born in east furniture never against that have the best financed reason unbeatable prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto job\nTalking about you know a Josh Hawley and the problems with him that\nUh the claim is he gets wind and works out during work hours which we found really interesting for a Senate race to be\nThe main accusation in an ad that clearly is a desperation at yeah they were just why not that he drinks or you want to he purchased wind purchased wind and went to work out right and when you're an attorney general which probably your\nHours you're probably a salaried workers were just state salaried employee yet yeah\nIt's you can use real real people but that's not what they did here they're trying to portray real people with the sentiment of people um and they probably couldn't find it to be\nWhat am I I Will set it aside I mean with if you look at the the issue that they were concerned about most in that at a uh it was terrorists yes and we've talked about the mid west it was something that we talked about yesterday ... that the the the the the farmer\nThat is some of the backbone of the Trump support Democrats are going directly out because of their loss of business because of the the the terrorists mostly due to the Chinese so\nIt is something we uh we ... we were you brought that up in the last couple of days when we talk about okay what might affect the Democrats to help them win or what might affect the Republicans to help them win what is the strategy that they're using but in that ad\nIt was terrorists twice here's the interest interesting question outside of farmers that that was targeted to in Missouri\nIf you went up to the average person on the street and said what do you think about terrorists do you think that have any idea what they were in a nation we're Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the three branches of government are\nYeah um you know it's it it really is about the presence I guess in the state of the industry of the particular we had a streak right and and and that is the case in infused farm states it even if you're not a farmer\nUm you know they lose her yeah right wow you know like you know to you know the effect on the farmers and they were in very vocal about it if you're in that said even if you're not a former\nAh you know again depending on the impacts and they they felt it was worth\nUh making that point ah which you know I Will see if if that point works or if any of this works er here within two weeks\n[laughter] it's\n... I I think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it it that positioning was I'm not going the way of of others in my party because keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her\nYou heard her say it she approve this message this is her campaign that she's not saying the people that are protesters\nShe's referring to her ... her party and we have to point out that we pointed out you know over the last several weeks these are the mainstream high ranking members of the party\nThat she's referring to here\nIn terms of the word crazy that's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to do the positioning hear that word is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree you know or you know with my my party in it knows approach or are you writing again it wasn't it ... the men\nHaving the conversation and say look she doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extreme as you know in there that she doesn't she's it was the term\nAs you brought up and so rightly it was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and then she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put in to that ad right\nWhere the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly\n... group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nMore independent undecided voters who they are looking to sway one way and it's it's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw Eric has what it is yes I got to let these people know I'm not part of the crazy Democrats right\nYeah because I think what they're thinking that's one of the things that's coming back in their polling is the independents that they're they're they're they're looking at holiday because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats might not part of the crazy Democrats right but it's using that\nTerm crazy Democrats specifically and not a you know not radical not at a extreme cause extreme if something is is a term that Democrats have used a lot\nAnd it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream if you will term word right ah but this is this is also something we pointed out weeks ago during the Kavanaugh thing\nIs that it doesn't matter that you're not a Cory Booker it doesn't matter\nThat you're not a ...\nA lizard with Warren or just you know pick a number of them that are in the Senate\nOr that are Democrats that could be you know I guess people are describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have a couple of times it because their actions and and we said this a few weeks ago their actions\nDo outside of their state\nIn terms of the race right they will\nUh taint the races and other states but especially of course those that are neck and neck and and I don't know I mean there's there maybe one or two but this this race is probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest\nAccording to the polls right now the latest polls we so that's the effect is that come out with Harris or or I was with Warren or any of them\nThey whatever they do is going to affect those races those other races and\nThose people in the ... the state of Missouri maybe looking at this going what or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with at some point a Kamala Harris or you know inside with\nAs you're crazy Democrats she'd as she just did as having us You're outside [laughter] and which is the\nPerfect example and that's the thing\nThat endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here that is likely that action yes one action we talked about it before the vote app and\nWhere does she go on this well she made a choice to go because she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that did support the no vote but it's not those Democrats and and it's you know it's it's that scale the tips\nYou know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side of goes to the other if she loses Democrats then it doesn't matter of the people in the middle are going to be with her and if she can't get them right now she acted as one of the crazy Democrats whip that no vote she condones that behavioral\nLetting we saw it during the cop Kavanaugh profit and that's why I'm Wondering what the effect would be again on an undecided independent and we've been getting ourselves into trouble because people when we've been talking about\nYou know how you're trying to win an election people think we're talking about how we think and how they should think and we're not we're talking about probably people who don't listen to our show mhm we're talking about the election strategy we're talking about the undecided independents right here in undecided independent\nWho is looked at the cabinet thing and so they're crazy I mean they're ... they're really crazy and I can't vote for her\nYou know a Claire McCaskill and that's and then that's what the ... coming back from that ad may be received by these people to say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats but you're willing to call your entire party crazy that you're that you belong with because you just want my vote right\nBut you actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them this just shows you the way that you will do you will call your own party crazy in order to get the vote and then you'll be trained me when you get into office\nAnd you'll vote with the crazy Democrat and with that vote on Kavanaugh that was also condoning their behavior him not you know all of that that's you know that's the evidence to back up their opinion yup coming to that conclusion
