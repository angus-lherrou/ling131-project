that they had to deal with we've gotten a lot of calls the night criticizing Devin according\nTo play and about him looking slow in this game and I just don't think people are factoring in what was on the other side at all I just don't think they are a let's get to listen to them according\nTo their own yard and the\nStronger one lovers and him running around him running away I'm just trying to get

dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine Vermont flood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nCouldn't give it to them all at one place so like they made a couple of plays in a red herring where we felt like we could have been better situations um and then other places you just got the long clay\nYou guys have a five and the red zone\nWhen the reason we're making some ways in his team and it was easier to send them in the red zone because I\nCan't say so far they can go behind and it it definitely takes a little bit away from the field it was kind of like\nThe closer they got even around like the twenty Fifteen was tough lesson as just held a guy like I'll center of the people in them outside and he runs all we can on the pile on I mean it was a place we say running down you know try to make a play late it's hard to catch up to\nExtend them recorded talking about the team speed up the Kansas City chiefs interesting point there you know they went to five and the red zone yeah and when the field and the short and it's easier to defend the chiefs because you can sort of keep\nAll of it in front of you left field for them to run it's a good point that's what it was an interesting question now you have to think that they did finish was getting to a five and the red zone yeah you're you're better off of the people like that that then is that that has that much speed especially in a guy like hill that I get 'em in the red zone\nWhether to run that some important stops there including a the interception by drawn Harmon or they did it needs some some good defense and stands in that are in the red zone then I and you know what it could have gone differently before they have to if it's not for turnover there yeah you know I mean that's something you got to factor into all\nThis well and the other thing too is if my homes isn't she had to read and missing guys are in that first quarter or we could be talking about a different outcome they're\nOn top the scene it'd be a touchdown he misses I'm\nMrs badly in fact he missed on a throw the cream on later on on I Want to tie reveals touchdowns he was not the intended receiver I'm right and I noticed that but I don't think he was throwing the football the ... street gang across in the corner of the end zone and you know went through his knees in right grab that bone was not intended\nFor him yeah yeah because ... got blown up on the plane and yeah he turns around and makes it it was every kill that made the point the touch them but yeah it does that look like that was a ton of proud to go to a re who's in Beverly Iraq\nThat's all he says a loser for waiting on hold for so long ago that if people were this is the first I was called you guys are called to the past but the people really quick with ... um I wanted to say be it'll I thought you'd mentioned this overs on UMass killing it should but the over every week um\n[noise] anyway with that being said I feel like just for me as a Ninety five persons that loves the station I really do enjoy guys\nJim I say I feel like they're under utilizing you I Would\nReally saying that they would use you had a number one is because on the weekends I like you guys it's a it's a good show and one thing but that being said\nThat big a let's just get yeah go ahead you know anyway patriots and as for me as a patriots fan I almost feel like this is a running theme at this point um I don't really look at them as a ... I feel like or whether it's further Brady or whatever I feel like they're really running the ball a lot more\nWhich I almost respect but you know I don't why why do you guys think about that but really quick I'll get off the phone 'cause I Know a ton of people way to talk to you guys um I think as a best voices to be honest on the stage of a bill\nWhich you would back with ... of the third wheel I thought that worked really well and jumbo I Hope that they upgrade your number one voice but that being said take another call and I'll listen to you while you're upset\nAll right ray Beverly so you and I have to flip flop is what has happened for ready to be happy I feel like it's more balanced then run heavy [laughter]\nI think it's more balanced but they're obviously you'd look they use the number one pick on a running back for a reason and I think it is to take measure appraisal is not as much on him but I like that they're they're doing this first after night or\nEighty three yards on the ground for the patriots sixty of them coming from Sony Michel I thought that early on they were putting an emphasis on making sure they were running to football and taking advantage of what was there for them\nUm I was hired by the good job of that in the first yeah and I was surprised that they were using it's it was mostly for one whole drive it was Kenyan Bonner that they will be yeah that was just going to be a return a barter enriched shower running on that Dr Michelle had was that uh he's\n... no that was the first touchdown I think a drive yeah I'll double checked out but I Believe that's the drive you're talking about no Kenyan\nBarter coming up out of nowhere you know where where's he then right well he's been signed cut\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nI got a question about this than I Am serious what is it what's the injury ankle watched right you know it's just turned an ankle if you have an ankle spraying and it's just a regular you know run of the mill ankles sprain\nDoes it require the emergency treatment right after the game is over I'm starting to wonder what the singer yeah yeah you know is there a ligament tears their ligament damage because he does not seem to have any sort of\nUm [noise] I don't know what to say\nLike off the line of scrimmage there's just no he's not Merced to go ... coming out of his breath it doesn't look right yeah and listen I'm I'm not bothered by it I think he's playing hurt I get a lot of credit for doing it you know like I Want them out there I think he's still very valuable even when he is her\nOh without a hugely valuable in this game tonight Nobel check made it a point to talk about it after the game is saying that is blocking early on in the game was was important and he was huge waste it big plays late in the game yeah like he's still valuable even if he is being draped in coverage in the short passing game\nBut he's absolutely not right I'm with you on that like you know the high ankle spring can always be an issue that can write a knack for weeks or is it something like that\nWe're never going to do the right something I Would ask something I mean not you're not going to get an answer but just what I'm saying ask among yourselves yeah you know what he's up with ...\nWhen I got to be nervous to go yeah I mean lets me nervous to share this one [laughter] Marty in the cab body\nHey what's going on what's up\nDid you ah Nazis high tower getting picked on all night where it's not all that\nSo I thought high power was excellent and the first day of other than the fact that it was because of pat ... homes missing\nOn a on career you would have given up a touched down in the first Dr what ended up and for that Mr none of them that the first time he was pretty disruptive I thought he was one of the better players defensively to collectively they were mostly bad and the second half the fun Gilmore is really good than I Do but I saw her I thought it was a positive\nI watched the film\nI Will will do what are we going to find on the film an\nInterception anymore to back here and a couple of tackles leaves with that one yeah that's what good offenses pick on line backers\nAnd he's older and slower yeah that's just back\nAnd it was scheme that helped on the interception but you have to have you have to be a veteran I I'm I got to be honest with you I'm stunned by our calls on this show tonight I Know I'm typically the negative one most of the I don't I don't think we've taken a out all that positive tone any point tonight well they did win the game I Know it felt like a roller coaster\nI think this was a hugely important when I thought we would have a different tone to the calls that I Know other than the defense sucks like no no I don't really think so I think it's a good\nTeam in the city of forty I'm not stunned by that I'm not even that like are you concerned about the patriots defends going forward because they gave a forty that team\nNo I'm not I'm Still at my baseline of concern from the defense which has been the same since week one oh yeah yeah that that's what I'm trying to say nothing changed me tonight when it comes on defense I think no differently of them because they gave a forty points\nNo me either no they that I'm Glad that they ...\nThe game was entertaining took a year off my life I'm sure but I'm Glad they got him with a when I expected this to be of shoot out like you did a you're crazy if you think the chief theme is going to put up you know thirty plus points tonight\nTim an adult borrow up next on the shots in star market patriots post game show Tim\nValue is still it's excellent high it's kind of threw me off their uh mostly uh below right\nThe biggest thing is the uh I don't want to say uh your ex cause for last year the pink backed into I'm sure you're friends with\nBut he goes back where he came from and what was the big news arrows says he this man makes them that's what he did so five years what are the big zero says\nHe merely film right seldom get beyond that because they've been slamming Tony from morning so nice because because they know the the ... the ratings but beyond that 'cause I go back and forth but I go may leave the station as you guys are the best\n... banks\nAlright but one thing I wanted to say was\nA\nJason ... when he first came on free season in going into the season it was like he may not make the team\nBut if you look at it after the first four five games actually\nHow would you like ... twenty Eighteen trunk of the year for only one Ninety nine Braun will say hello to forge twenty eight Ford F. one fifty best run for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a flood forward and he went into ...\nAnd he did have a shaky pretty soon it was right that is a man that pays it says I never thought we were going to get the performance we've gotten from them in the regular season\nBased on his pre season yeah what was the game he was completely flat footed in the end zone and one of those touchdowns he gave up it was maybe the second week maybe it was against eagles the eagles and it was built up here but he look bad and some of those games are like oh my God I didn't think we'd get this uh uh but\nWe have time for a couple of more calls that that was quite a bit to follow their it took me about a\nMinute to realize what the hell he was talking about them yeah I Know I I was confused in the beginning but then I sort of put it together they're talking\nAbout um yeah yeah the station you know Johnny and Texas Johnny\nHey guys how you do it in a good way today\nMouth shut out of a kid I like to bring back very\nI was about to say I just got off work and I you know I was like that's holding my little office just like a bad way the red so that kind of a you know a B the turn of the plus all here a little bit because I don't learn guys always ... or ... yeah it was a chip away at on the first play\nOh my God I Know he'll say gee what he did all that up like that and the retrospect it's probably a good thing 'cause they gave her but I dare I say I want to kind of defend India read a little ... you know I'm the first one to talk of what you start talking about you know\nClock that gay marriage but I thought the title search for the situation they were a lot of people will beat up on the end of it I don't have the time that I thought we did a\nFair look at it but I enjoy your guys post game show 'em over here attack or something like that so I enjoy the local flavor when I get it that Joe you got to look up to chime in on your show is that a good one\nAren't very good yeah other there was no like agree just oh you you idiots moment that I saw with Andy Reid tonight and typically you you get one of those are game when you go up against them no I\nI don't see any issues there in terms of his caught man and I used to know something like that\nI'll tell you what though is you mentioned time outs this is something I said during the game and it just jog my memory talking about the use of time outs by Kansas City or in terms of the why they were stupid department\nIf you go back to the end of the first half not to drive that Holmes through the pick\nBusted Dr before that when they came away with a twenty four yard field goal they had it first and goal to go at the patriots seven\nHundred up the middle for three then they ran that's stupid past the Sherman\nThe fold back yeah that got blown up from a an Arab or or north than yeah yeah\nYeah and it was flowers a snippet guy uh yeah yeah or Ron ... value call there that was dumb that was second goal to go from the war yard line they ended up losing two two yards on that because ... flowers actually creditors Sherman by the way a credit him for catching that football\nWhen he was being tackled as he caught it like I don't get all caught it and was able to turn in turn around\nA credit to him for being able to complete that play and he had no shot because we're just such a bad ... bad set up for him\nAnd I want to look back at this too because the patriots did the same damn thing later in the third quarter ... All right so it's selling them in the\nRed after that play I don't know if this was ... I don't know if people were able to pick up on pick up on this on TV but it was ... or so then at that point you've got a third goal to go off from the six at that point\nAnd they ran a pay rent and play it was an incomplete pass the walking but prior to that play them snapping a football as the play clock was winding down\nIt was a fire drill on the field yeah in homes hesitated and homes kept looking at the defense and I thought to myself if he's smart and this is something that comes with time this is something you get with the young young starter\nI thought as I watched that play out and he's smart he's calling a time out here yeah he should call a timeout in and get this right\nAnd they ran the play and there was nothing there and I thought oh that that for them could come back to bite them and they ended up kicking another field goal there and they were in the game late so I don't know if they're truly did but that could have been more points had he called the time I went to the sideline and got a ride because he didn't know what the hell is going\nYeah so I Wonder if he's you know they're like you said it's going to come with time so I Want to right now if he feels confident enough to do that you know something like that it's always deferred the coaches run the play no matter what because I feel like a more a more sees a quarterback would see that if they're confused and you just said you're\nA three time out at the time and that was six and a half minutes to go and a half I think that would have been a good\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explains it light out of Lincoln M.

over a decade now\nAnd I have also had my own successful local shows in Los Angeles including on Westwood one's affiliate in Los Angeles seven Ninety KBC board that sounds familiar saying that in fact I got so used to saying that\nThat I went to another station another network showed the engineers said to me you're markets are ... are in our practice run here and we did and I said the wrong full of the news station but I guess that's what happens when you're so used to it but we know the number here let's do it correctly eight six six Ninety red eye\nOf the same thing as eight six six nine o seven\nThirty three thirty nine and we'll be taking your calls in a little bit but first I Want to tell you what we've been doing the last couple of hours we've been trying to talk about the civil war between the left\nAnd the right and that's where I think has been occurring here for the last couple of years and I think it's the second civil war\nAnd you've been reacting to that on line I mean a through your calls but first of all let's get it straight if you don't already know the left liberals Democrats whatever you want to call them will do anything and everything to when\nThey have no limits and they have no guard rails as to what is acceptable\nThis isn't even the era of Ronald Reagan where he can be friends with speaker Tip O'Neill I mentioned this last hour and have a drink with him at night\nIn prison regular ask what had happened with all the vitriol during the day and Tip O'Neill way was speaking of the house at the time you said that's the daytime does that night we're way past that and you saw Senator Graham talking about that that these were his friends\nThat he he was saying all those things about because of what they've done their search for\nPower and oh yeah\nProbably now you can't even have a drink at night 'cause look what it may have done to judge Kevin uh\nIt has become an all out war anything as I said and everything goes now lying is commonplace as when I mention this with Harry Reid claiming Romney didn't pay any taxes someone's friends or someone told them that and it wasn't true and he was a cold on that he said well it would work didn't it\nWas a total insanity of the charge that Kavanaugh was part of the group allowing for women to be gang rape so much so that he ...\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model what pays more than any dealer around because we're a certified buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nLost the that is very clear again if you're on the right you don't want to serve the process of being a a a proven guilty just the accusation is not so she may not have been politically motivated forward but you used her you and your masters and deception used her\nThis is all just crazy and I I Love with Graham said he's going to get to the bottom of its suggesting that someone and find science officer one affords attorneys may have been responsible for strategically delaying the leak deploying to leak the harm Kavanaugh's chances\nAre it's just amazing as he said those actually Senator Hatch so this the goalpost moving never stops\nAnd here's my summation then we'll take your calls the only force is the way you and your cronies conducted the circus\nAnd maybe the crude across the ACLU the American civil liberties union yeah right they chimed in because they too are left this group before they our civil liberties group and so they came out against the nomination and I quote\n... board of directors deeply concerned about allegations raised in recent weeks has made a rare exception to his longstanding policy and voted to oppose the nomination of bread Kevin up they passed a resolution stating\nThey oppose the confirmation of judge Kevin of the Supreme Court there aren't credible allegations this is the ACLU allegations that judge Kevin O's engaged in serious misconduct you mean like Bill Clinton did you see anything then\nThat have not fanatical investigated by the Senate\nWhat would it be advocates adequate seven FBI check eight nine what is it\nDr Ford's credible testimony subsequent allegations of sexual misconduct\nYou mean the great thing that even the times wouldn't publish the an adequate investigation maybe they can investigate better and judge Kavanaugh's testament to the leaders of the doubt about it is a fitness to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court\nThis is not a decision take lightly we cannot remain silent under these extraordinary circumstances about a lifetime appointment of higher score to the land I'm trying to shorten it the standards for such an appointment on the burden is on the nominee the burden is on the nominee to prove that something didn't happen how exactly does one do that\nThe burden is not met as long as they're unresolved questions regarding the credible allegations of sexual assault assault yet it unresolved allegations so if they can never resolve it which they can't because there is no cooperation than while I can never be confirmed\nAnd it it goes on and on I I don't want to make your two depressed but there it is again based on allegations I Want to know I just want to know where in the past the ACLU watching someone convicted because of allegations\nBut this is what the Democrats and the left have no soul there is no place to go with all of this except down on the other and the loss of a piece of American tell me what you think of all of this application of the Simpson of innocence and the self righteousness of those on the left\nAnd the fool's on our side and if you agree with me that we're about or in the middle of a second civil war [noise]\nEight six six Ninety red eye or the same number

his together yeah yeah see I was yeah I was I was there what's on your mind Sally\nWell the thing that that there are several things one of them is that if Feinstein really wanted to get to the ...\nWhen that letter came in a month ahead of time they could have went through the background checks and done all that she wanted political theater and she used to me too movement to try to do this and it just made up\nOf fires and unbelievable\nI Am a survivor of a neat to see it happening to me and I didn't believe by the for for a minute now for a winner and they use that to make everybody I mean they just made a sham out of the whole thing and they said it back Thirty years in my opinion and I just I could just green\nAnd I hope that it motivates everybody\nOn the Republican side to get out there and and vote because to me that was or what they did check carbon now was absolutely gifts that come out I Can't even ... it's unbelievable to me that you would do that an innocent man for political gain that hits complete craziness\nYeah so I understand where yeah thanks Sally\nI understand where you're coming from was hard for me to watch when you know it was the Democrats turned to a question him or not the question them they just put on a show\nIt pretty disgusting and of course is grand pointed out he voted for uh you know liberal or left U.S Supreme court judges and they won in big numbers who we we often are the part where the stupid party and then in my opinion than the evil part I heard someone else said this\nAnd um we've had to learn that we're in a civil war\nAnd I want them to get someone who fill the greed with me wherever they go they may have dropped off let's go to Tyler in Reno nevada Tyler you're on with mark\nIt's Nevada mark and it's I\nI think that ah I've heard a lot are\nWay too much of rehashing of the last you know a couple of months of political he said she said and all the other nonsense [noise] one saying that the folks that listen to your show could do to help put the ball over the line so to speak for whoever candidate that you want to support\nIs to actually get off your fanny and go out and volunteer to sit at the polls on election day angry voters\nOr what we found time and time again I've been doing this since Barry Goldwater ran for office years ago or is that if you have a friendly face at the polls\nIf you have people going to the polls that are still kind of on the fence of where they're going to go you get a seven to twelve percent push\nAt those particular polling places where you have these friendly faces now it won't do any good if you got to curb margin that's all grumpy and you know wants to get in fights with everybody but the thing is is you just have a nice pleasant person there\nAre I always set up a little card table with a bullet candy a couple of smiley balloons and you know say hello to the kids that come out with their parents\nAnd you can make a significant difference in your community both on the down ticket people and on the main ones like I'm going to be out there for a Dean Heller a starting here in Reno or on the twentieth of October or we start early voting I [noise]\nI I think that uh everybody else if they would take a few days often participate at the polls they could really make a difference\nKnow you you make some good points to the ... that personal touch I've run for office of course in California last ah Republicans don't usually win in California\nBut um that personal touch makes a difference because they've done polls and and I've seen it in the audience is where they ask people have you ever met a candidate and they almost all say they never have and when they meet someone and you had a great point in their reasonable decent that's how you can get a vote\nWhat's your Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and ... all have in common they are all in for Steve real division of bought bought a new religion or against us that's right over two hundred ... all my whole models out incredible Russia's move on to John John now\nSaid you wanted to hear a comment about whether we're going through a civil war and I believe that there's a difference the civil war I think we are going to go through\nSomething similar to that but on the civil war both sides of very boisterous and we're willing to fight to the death for what they believed in what's happening now with the media and entertainment and the and the young people they and they don't they only hearing one side we're not organized\nConservatism that organized because when nice guys we believe in being in a civil\nBut this is not the time to be that way because the kids are watching and the nature of young people is that they want to be on the winning side they don't even know we exist we're older young kids in ... in school or you know in the high schools in the colleges the minute they have a conservative view\nThey screen that oh how could any person as a young person in ... in college\nBe strong enough to stand up against this title wave and the media and the entertainment um people at the songwriters of singers\nEveryone seems and is appearing to be liberal so all these young people they say well you know this is what we're supposed to be with the good side they\nThink they're on the good site and it being brainwashed they don't even know they're being brainwashed and we're letting this happen I feel as conservative we should be getting organized which should not be you know throwing rocks and and cocktails the windows like some of the antifa is you know group does\nBut we're not serving our records were being too quiet and I don't think every groan American that's a conservative is going to be able to go against the tide of these termites\nOf little liberals who just following the tide they want to be happy they want to go one friend invites the other friend I'm going here looking at protests are going to go down and I'm In New York city when President Trump comes in\nThere's like ... a protest it but I Would not go down there because I'm afraid of getting beat up and I might be the only one there was a different point of view we're being like um bullied\nTo just keep quiet and Chuck Schumer oh and and what's his name Cuomo what he just said lately that President Trump's he's trying to get all ... or any violence that goes on he's organizing his people to be violent there was something that happened at a metropolitan club I think they said\nNo no no no I did you hear what Cuomo said I couldn't believe it\nIs that he's President Trump this is the way the the Republicans handled things he\nGot them organized to do that he set them up on purpose\nTo go after the ... seats set them up President Trump didn't even know but the kids here this and they believe that it's very serious because it reminds me\nMy husband watches on TV the History Channel and my son watches that he's twenty Twenty one and they show how Hitler isolated the young people got him to summer camp they were separated from their parents they only heard\nWhat Hitler was saying and telling them you are strong we are good we will be ... feet and the kids will sharing

only one there and the police would be there to protect\nMake the children see that there's two ways of thinking but I don't think they know and we're letting it happen because they're trying to be polite but\nThey're they're gathering all the young people with the media and ... Taylor Swift and all these other singers Madonna I mean they're not thinking in schools are not teaching them to think independently in college if they don't think with the crowd there'll be just slashed\nWhat do you think did you do 'cause I don't think it's fair because that civil war the two sides were fighting equally\nWe are we should consider to be more passionate about the first thing I Want to say you you have on TV obviously you're very good\nWell here's some I have some optimism for you but you're basically right you may not have heard me say this and it's not a wonder that students come out and the the liberal because that's all they ever here it's a wonder though then have them come out as conservatives because they realize that if your doctor named them you get them

President Trump would've appointed they would have been out to get him that's why it's such a hypocritical a monstrosity to watch this so such a bunch of phone is there was Blumenthal I don't think I

him\nAnd that's why the ... it was held for months or weeks whatever it was\nA you got to know what's going on and that's why in the they don't care if the destroying anybody saw about power and

that Brett Kavanaugh I'm a I'm a former sheriff's investigator or marijuana interdiction here for a while and\nUh for the import is\nWas doing a lot of things during her testimony that the suspects do when they want to cover up their crime and cover up their life she's a psychologist or a little girl boy racing inflection at the end of this that the that the wires technique body language\nShrinking her head down toward her shoulders not sitting up straight that what these people and the guy quite you know always up for gay\nAlthough the effect do when they're trying to get away with something I I think ms forward as a liar\nI don't know what happened to that room and don't care because there is no physical evidence yet and in the country or we presume innocence will have guilt can be proven and there was no guilt proven toward Brett Kavanaugh it any way shape or form\nAnd that makes missiles toward a liar and that's that's really what she is in California\nWe have a move but what for twenty three counties that have declared that want to separate with Cal Oregon port there all day and the liars here are in charge of government uh they're in charge of every aspect of our politics and then last week fight nothing's ever gonna get better ...\nWell I certainly agree with your and a lot of people said this about fighting back because otherwise we're going to lose the country I mean what made this country special is is it risks now have left takes it over and good luck so Marty can remind him forget your name you know you use express the very well\nLet's go to well here's a good point let's go to Troy in Nashville Iran with mark\nI have um I uh I've got a little theory you know we've we've got these kids and you know there what ten twelve Fifteen Years old before they're released\n... and ... are you There God did you hear me now I can go ahead\nI'm Sorry I was saying you know kids to you when they start getting to the age of of even slightly pain\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against it have the best financed reason to think of all races in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on the boards also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nOr shouldn't losers in field day now these kids are twenty twenty five thirty years old and all they know it was Obama so now I've got a twenty two year old daughter and a twenty year old daughter and they're both hate Donald Trump\nOne of them refused to sit down and talk with me at all the other one I got to sit down and talk with her and I\nShowed her some facts kind of changed or a little bit and then and then I've got my ten year old that loves Trump and he goes to school and all the kids in his class\nThey dare Trump supporter so this generation that's coming that wasn't raised up in the mama I'm years I completed my ten year old knows more about politics than my twenty and twenty two year old daughter too\nYou know and and I think that uh these kids when they grew up you know and basically and the Obama years\nSo we've got this generation that we've got another generation that's coming up that uh is gonna be hopefully the generation that saves us you know so I just wanted to to you know kind of let you know about that or you know it's a generation gap that I see with my own kids from\nYou you got to get rid of your two older ones just\nTell me about it [laughter] you know and and that's been you know the other thing about cabin on\nAnd you've got this a huge silent majority [noise] um that ... year they're they're\nThey're afraid you talk about fighting and that's what the Democrats and the the liberals are doing they're I think I'm In the silent majority is you know they're afraid to say anything like that guy you know earlier said that uh he voted libertarian\nYou know instead of just coming out and saying hey I voted for Trump you know is it fair scare and you've got a small group of people\nWho were scared earned the majority and I think this ...\nAnd uh all the spin on it is really going to show at the polls with the we've got a huge silent majority I'm you know so\nWell I think they ... yeah yeah no I I think you're right how are you guys move me a little bit you know I came on pessimistic about losing the house I don't know\nJust listening to you and and by the way you try you also made a very good point which is and I said this before\nWho the president is makes a difference who the people young people grow up with that is what they hear and that's what they learn right that's why during the Obama administration to get a lot of young people only hears that side and now the Trump although we have the media against us which hurts a lot\nBut if they see the economy's doing well and their lives are improving the lives of their parents that starts to influence them in more people like that was in his own microcosm in his family\nThe ten year old is a Trump supporter and the ones who grew up with the Obama you can't even talk to them\nI Know that feeling [laughter] I Would have my own house so I Can't be hard on him let's go to a ... in Fresno, California Iran was mark [noise]\nHey how are you just [noise]\nYeah I think original argument was whether there was and to have a war going on [noise] yep

see within ... and groups like that maybe black lives matter or any groups that don't let people speak just because they disagree with him and uh what was that the New York state Republican Party or
