where they are located and we know a ton of you listen and you all know\nWhat NBC did was a complete hats job that isn't journalism an allegation and it sells\nWithout anything else to cooperate it is not a story it's not a story that a manger that a major newspaper or a major TV network\nShould ever run it lacks completely on any type of journalism ethics and they know it had that\nBeen someone

... completely ... of anonymous people are just sending letters hey I was abused right and then that's being like oh there's another lettering from somebody else what\nHave you paid attention to social media you can make these people don't even use their real name on social media most often right I mean it just and and it's\nTo me it it shows you know that NBC don't ever ever complain about President Trump\nUsing the term fake news and directing it at you right if you put out that kind of peace I trashed story yeah based on an allegation and you do an interview knowing going in there that this person is walking back everything\nThat they say\nAnd you can't find anybody to cooperate it you don't do with that story it's the same thing as I mentioned from my it was we talked about yesterday\nFrom Eric Brady at USA Today\nWhen he wrote will should Brett Kavanaugh will be coaching girls' teams not until the investigation is done and then talked about in his original article a credible source by the way just the note as I said on yesterday show\nI I I Know Eric Brady um was it used to knew him as a kid he was a really good friends with my neighbor across the street just\nSo people know right it's important see that's what you're doing to let people know that [noise]\n'cause somebody might find out in and I as I said last night I said you know I've I've uh since I knew him when he was young and you know we've kept in touch over the years just on Facebook\nA which is a space whose Facebook vows to lead it but that was a piece of trash article that he wrote and said you know claim it as a news story not an opinion that credible evidence\nThat there is no credible evidence against Kavanaugh it's a ... and and this is and that's why when you said that during the break it just it has hit home with me\nThey're never going to\nGet off the break here no no this is and it won't and when Trump is no longer president this is not going to end no because in fact they'll feel more empowered Trump is the one who calls him out the next guy or gal likely won't\nAnd here's what's interesting too so NBC goes with the interview from sweating they admit they can't find anything to back it up anybody else to back it up they go with the interview an interview\nThe story on the ... this is the prosecutor brought him to do the questioning at the hearing and the memo was released\nAnd on Monday\nNBC News decided that wasn't worth reporting now if Mitchell had reported\nThat my finding is that judge Kavanaugh is not worthy of being seated on the highest court that would have been the lead headline in fact it would have been an NBC News but right now if you're wondering NBC News why nightly news is that an all time low\nThat's it nobody believes you when they see right through you\n\nYour tax nothing more nothing less\nAnd it's shameful behavior yes oh stop feeling insulted when Trump says your fake news right you're not even worthy of his recognition frankly\nBecause you're nothing if you're going to put somebody up there you admit you can't backup independently as a news organization anything the woman is about to say you put her on the memo

this program there are times when somebody needs to just take the the\nHis Twitter account way for a few minutes and and there are times when he doesn't speak effectively were he said something that totally doesn't work the communications from this White House had been horrible but that's how bad and the NBC but it's all you don't\nOr you shut it you have an earned a writer for him because it's also what you get from the left that well because of this presidents and there were changing the way that we do thing yet we have it no we haven't shall we don't care less active communication when we we never we never change our standards of what we will do whether it's Obama\nWhether it's Bush whether it's Clinton while we were working together with Clinton [laughter] what whether it's a a Trump we don't care no or certain and it ended up to two idiots overnight can do it NBC you certainly have the ability to do it you don't want to do\nWe know they go out of their way to put somebody on do an actual interview with somebody and that they themselves as a news organization can't backup and one word she's saying but ignore part of the official process and that statement was part the Mitchell\nA release the memo was part of the official process they could take it and take it to another prosecutor and ask fat prosecutor well what did you think did you watch it did you what do you think of Kavanaugh's and Dr Ford's claims\nAnd what'd you say the same thing the memo did not even that\nThey completely skirted the entire thing\nAnd then you're going to have all these guys and gals chomping on cigars in the boardroom at NBC News trying to see what's going wrong wire ratings go well what's what's what's the problem here we're\nWell it's interesting because one of the one of the other stories that came out\nDuring the day on Monday is that you have the founder of CNN Ted Turner the fear that it has become too political this coming from a guy who's clearly on the left and as the founder of the network\nAnd then you have a the the uh the the former show runner really at the Greenfield Jeff Greenfield yeah or who ran CNN for years comes out and says\nThe people that work at CNN think that they're part of our act as if they're the quote a they they count themselves as part of the anti Trump\nResistance but we know this we see it it's it's very obvious but when you have other people that were you know there before that can look at it and say this is clear what's going on these people are active it's they're not journalists\nThey instead of opinion they're not even they won't even be a there they they like cowards hide behind the word analysis that's the new word for opinion right opinion at the top\nYou have an opinion should be based on some well see why your\nHand analysis should be here's the situation but it's not it's here's my opinion\nSo if you're going to have an opinion piece called opinion but you know what cats already out of the bad people see right through these news organizations it's not tolerated anymore and you wonder why they're not trusted and you wonder why those CNN shows are at the bottom of the cable news and NBC's at the

the Harvard cabs Harris survey this is from uh the daily water dot com or if right the Harvard\nCaps Harris survey uh found that when people are told that the tree name witnesses do not cooperate the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford opinions shift decisively in Kavanaugh's favor\nOr as a\nThey reported on Monday polls by you guys and Reuters found\nThat people largely believe what benefits they're affiliated party more than two thirds of Democrats believe the sexual allegations against Kavanaugh\nWhile roughly the same percentage of Republicans do not overall you guys have found that forty one percent belief for thirty five percent believe Kavanaugh Reuters found forty two percent belief for\nThirty one percent believe Kavanaugh Harris Poll chairman Mark Penn a former Bill Clinton pollster reported Sunday\nThat the Harris Poll found that forty percent who saw read parts of the testimonies last Thursday felt the board alone seem credible wall twenty three percent alone said Kavanaugh seem credible alone a total of twenty seven percent said that both seem believable\nOr does sixty seven percent total felt that Ford was credible fifty percent felt the cabinet was credible were the Harris Poll study it gets really interesting isn't its findings on the impact of the FBI investigation and the issue of cooperation\nThe credibility of their testimony does not appear to be a decisive factor right span\nRather the question comes down to cooperation as the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should send to the high court when we're ... we're told that the tree name witnesses do not cooperate boards claims fifty seven percent said they are in favor of his confirmation\n\nIf the FBI found no cooperation for Ford's claims sixty percent said cabinet should be confirmed pen reports well I've seen this on social media I Can't tell you how many polls I've seen you believe Ford or do you believe Kavanaugh\n\nWas cabin on credible or what ... that's

yeah that's that's that's wrong if there is no cooperation\nWell and if the FBI fines up there is no one sixty percent of Americans believe it it's almost all of independence mhm yeah and that's what you're looking for that's what you're looking for in any election\nAnd we always get this and we talked about the administration and\nSaid look you could have more success is if you have a consistent

and now I hear in Wednesday it can be of a you know wrapped up even though the president has said you know you can expand it but how far do you expand what does that mean expanding it expanded what\nWell what allegation and and it well it would be expanding it too and in the in fact the coverage that I read was expanding it to essentially anybody that might be connected with these allegations which is the any other claimed witness along the way\nAnd if you expand it to that well you may first of all you may or may not get cooperation from that person this is not a criminal

ourselves that question a you know where do they go from here remember after twenty sixteen after Trump won and again ah you know as a as a a former President Obama said there was always a twenty percent\n[laughter] after the election and do that like I Know it's a hundred per se I'm On a smartest president that we ever had modest and the room right and understand that it's a hundred percent because he won\nA ... a ... but you know they were remember all the self reflection that happened at that time Eric and I went into hysterical\nLaughter brought up some time in late November early

will tell you you don't have to do there you don't\nI don't know if you really don't I don't have to go anywhere to know what a significant portion of the middle class is thinking well\nEven remember the reporter uh who worked for the times that didn't even leave as his apartment to through the stories they said he went to was his name Brian Williams I don't think it was [laughter] but but you know you don't even have to I mean that but it it is a very basic point that\nHow can you be doing analysis real analysis not the opinion how can you be doing that\nIn an election year if you really don't know what the sentiment is I'm not expecting them to have the same internal set of campaign without or that a party would have but I Would expect that they would certainly have somebody maybe inside those campaigns are parties\nThat would see some things and say okay\nIs there a real because Obama is always a twenty percent chance he said that after the election but really you know it was a couple of idiots overnight said\nDon't don't buy the hype in Pennsylvania watch Pennsylvania watch Pennsylvania\nBecause there was something else going on and it was anecdotal but if if we could see that really with out and we did research that we're not going to say there were no tools but we don't have the tools that are available that a news organization like the New York times or Washington Post or\nAny of them have they have rooms filled with people that can whack and do we ...\nDidn't have what either party had that two weeks before they started seeing the turn in Pennsylvania right uh in Michigan and Wisconsin and we you know we might have had anecdotal evidence but we didn't have the same information that they had where they started seeing that that the turn\nAnd and you know remember that as you look at the polls now I mean we're ... we're I'm very interested in what the polls are going to do\nNow for those people that because we always get the people do call or two polls are number right actually they are ... you can find polls as we have done if you listen to the show for any length of time\nWhether it was really twenty twelve and twenty six team will really started looking and saying okay what polls were actually correct and what you find out is\nA yeah two months out three months out four months out the polls aren't that accurate once you start getting thirty days in ... you start seeing that the poll start tightening and by the time you get\nTo a couple of days beforehand or people for example say that the polls for drop are completely wrong or they weren't you know there were polls that were dead on for the numbers\nThey may not have the polls didn't figure out the electoral votes and you know you and I said well maybe they should start doing that I don't know how much money would cost them to do it right but the the by the time you got to the to the polls are done on what the people are thinking\nUh and and so to get to those specific districts and and break them down you would probably need more votes you wouldn't be need more numbers than what you what your sample size\nWonder Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai kid Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in pristine free own condition at what forward and he's written a generic ... that's right over two hundred free on cars all mates all models and incredible prices flood onto flood Otto John John now\nMight be a shift happening\nOr in in certain districts are in Pennsylvania and and uh Michigan and in Wisconsin but the fact is the polls on the where the people voted some of them were dead on yeah you're right I mean just within a half a percentage to a point of the actual numbers\nAnd they said don't show Hillary winning ... show with Hillary would get in the raw vote and that's what she did get\nVery close to it and the same thing for Trump he won the electoral college ... so you know that's something that they've since we've had to elect ... you know two very close votes ... uh you know back in two thousand and uh in in twenty sixteen\nYou know maybe they should start looking to see if they could pole and then\nFigure out the electoral college you know that way if there is a better way there's a better way to do it but\nWell you know saw back in the day with Tim Russert he would he would sometimes break it down and say and paint scenarios going look if this happens here and these districts here and those districts and this this precinct here in this state\nAnd all these come together you could see the electoral votes in this state go to they he would break those down but you couldn't really I don't know that there was a that wasn't so much of a poll as it was really a demonstration as to\nWhere it might go it wasn't based on sentiment that wasn't based on respondents that was based on basically history in any given precinct or or any given district\nIn a state you know they would break that down they don't try and do that anymore but if you if you watched election night\nOr twenty sixteen\nWhat you saw was this I mean it was a very smog attitude it was they were almost doing it it was almost a parade for her\nHillary Clinton and then into the evening the later got after the polls closed it just went down where there was a downward spiral\nBecause it was reality and they had painted the picture and the media helped of something that wasn't true\nAnd they saw it as landslide without looking at again you know how this might\nAdd up right ah but looking at the polls now as we were we were you know doing earlier a ... in our pre show meeting a I I see a ton of races out there I mean I'm looking at the Arizona race right now the Arizona Senate race ... versus send them a Christian send them at the Democratic a Democrat and Martha McSally the Republican\nAnd you know the the last repulsive send them up three seven six and three ah and but the but uh in earlier polls are earlier in the month\nA mix Sally was up by a couple well right now the latest poll was one to the from the sixteen to the twenty okay we're still not into the myths of the whole cabinet thing and cinema was up by three but margin of error four point seven so that's a dead heat\nAnd if you if you look at that overall except for the uh the one likely voter poll by CNN that was that was done where she was up by seven everything else shows that that really is a dead the that is a dead heat right there\nAnd we don't know what the polls are going into the cabinet vote I think ... and again I think that the cabinet vote has the potential to energize both\nBut I Do believe that it may energize Republicans more be it he whether he is a not confirmed or ... firmed the energy that I see right now the motivation the voter motivation\nOn the right to me is much greater than it was two weeks ago I don't know if I can necessarily say that about the left because I think the left has been on maximum overdrive for the last year looking at the last two years looking at this mid term right\nAnd so the energy is there I Do think just because I how important it is\nWhen you talk about the possibility of and again you don't we don't know one cabinet is going to do cabin on could get on and do what what what Roberts did you don't know mhm but the possibility and I were talking about were Roberts you know change the uh you know the\nThe wording mhm in Obamacare to actually you know to fit the narrative that he wanted to ... people were shocked by it but on other things when it comes to regulations he is a seems to be a

if the president decided to go in that\nIn that direction I still don't think we won't know and it's very tough to predict what's going to happen\nUh but I don't think the president would have ever

humor from Donald Trump yeah\nYou know the last time that I've given came close to that was and no one saw it because it was in the middle of the night in the U.S\nI said two things about uh you know the president and and the timing of things so when he was that the the summit in Singapore mhm after they did the the photo up with Kim Jong il and he had his own press conference\nAnd he said to reporters these were global reporters saying look in a year from now I might I might tell you that this deal did not work out didn't go the way I wanted and I'll probably make up a story you know make up an excuse\nThat was self deprecating humor and the other point that that I think uh that the other thing that America Mr course was his his wind in his victory speech that night of the election and and twenty sixteen um because what I what I heard was a humble public\nServant speaking and of course it wasn't a lot of that wasn't replayed by the media you really had to search for it but when you look at you know the president I think in in front of the people\nEspecially right now we talked about his cabinet being settled in after the first year how he started to appoint people and we said look this is going to play out differently because these are the people who are being appointed\nIf they accept that you know ah if they're that nomination then they know what they're in for right so he's getting the people that the put the cabinet and place and the staff in place that he really wants in his second\nYear I think case could be made\nBy recent activity or lack of activity that may be the president did this also settling in with the media or he's been directed to tone it down a bit until after the midterms [laughter] it could be either or but I I\nI Do believe that the president has always been\nIn the private sector comfortable in his own shoes that changed when he went from having zero bosses to having\nMore than three hundred and twenty million bosses in one night and I think it you know I think it it it had him kind of all over the place a for a number of reasons during the campaign and after the campaign\nAs he became president and I think there is a case to be made as he's settling in and learning the job and it has now knows what he can do and what he can't do I think there's probably\nA little more thought based on recent behavior going into communication and how you interact with media\nBecause here's the thing he's winning on the cabinet nomination they wanted an FBI background check he gave it to them then expanded the whole thing on Monday\nHe's winning when you look at the things that that he's put out there aside from some gas communication wise president is winning the leftist screaming because not because they think that they're

the guy makes a statement we say well this is what you're saying and it's exactly what he said and then he goes no that's not what I'm saying well of course that's what you're saying because why Harry Reid decided to change the rules of the Senate when he was\nThe head of the Senate when it came to federal nominations therefore when he did that uh you had Mitch McConnell come in and say okay you change those rules were going to change those ... these rules for the Supreme Court justice yeah the people in power we get some ... these aren't laws\nWere not changing laws were simply changing rules the sun it that we have the ability to do constitutionally you may not like it but hey when elections that's what Harry Reid said\nRight and Mitch McConnell came in and said the exact same thing that's the reality of it and what you're saying then it's it's okay to defame some buddies or what is it the fame somebody's character because\nThat's the reality of how a Democratic Republic
