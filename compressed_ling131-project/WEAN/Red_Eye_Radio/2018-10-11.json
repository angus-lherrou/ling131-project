J. H. G. ah which did streaming coverage\nUm um basically when when we went off the air they started their streaming coverage and and continued until they lost more than just power they lost power at their transmitter sites and that was pretty much game over for them but they were only twenty feet above\nA sea level they were confident that their staff was going to be safe in that situation but they continue to keep an IT guy on board to make sure that they kept feeding that and so they set another sister station and our system through and this gentleman in that garage I\nAppreciate his honesty because wedding basically did was documented where he was\nWhere he was standing yeah and and and and smartly I'm not going to go stand out there by the edge of the parking garage but what I found interesting was that that parking garage was also home for countless people in their cars\nYeah yeah I'd just be atrocity is his name and a lot of people were following him a Drudge Report actually even put up a lead a early Wednesday and uh and he had been during that time basically staging and showing\nYou know the well a calm literally calm before the storm\nAnd and ah so he was he was broadcasting essentially a through periscope ah for periods of time thirty to forty minutes or even shorter times\nBut then as you mentioned ah going live later and this is something that again it it is too I think display the power of a storm for many of us\nThat have never been through a storm and very few people relatively speaking had been through a storm like this but when you're able to\nShow people how powerful this is what it does and he's just going to be there by the way\nHe anticipated being there for up to a week or longer because he knows it's going to be next to impossible to get out of that parking garage because of the you know the damage left behind and that's what you hope to do you hope to show people\nThat this damage and how powerful\nThis storm is now hurricane Michael becomes tropical ... Michael or in the last hour or so but still when you look on the radar a Tom this thing right now Michael\nEveryone in the state of Georgia right now is feeling some effect of Michael as it's centered over a Georgia in moving toward the Carolinas what do we expect them next and the next twenty four to forty eight hours and beyond\nWell initially what we're going to expect this life you know there there still is a life threatening storm surge\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln MTC Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator one Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nRainfall from Michael and that's going to be life threatening flash flooding and it's going to go across not just Georgia but the Carolinas and they don't need any more water right there still saturated and there are places that are going to become impassable it would\nNot necessarily be out of the question\nTo to find some of the major roads Ninety five can I say Ninety five and not\nA ... we're going to need to be aware of this is ... if if if you're if if you're working and your job is to drive somewhere bottom line is you're going to need to be alert to this uh the wins a high profile vehicles\nWere twelve hours from now still going to be looking now we've got a a Seventy mile an hour wind and within the next half hour they are going to update that\nWith a with an advisory they were giving one hour advisories this was the last advisory at twelve o'clock eastern time there will be moving on to ah just regular a\nThree hour advisories\nAnd um and so it's going to accelerate and speed ah as it becomes a little more entrenched in the mid level jet stream and so that'll Pickett's speed up the I'm guessing a ...\nProbably not by the time we're off the air but twenty three miles an hour a forward speaking to the northeast and wins are still gonna be forty miles an hour\nForty to forty five miles an hour or and so uh now above the surface\nWhere we don't have the friction of the earth five thousand feet when something already clocked I'm\nUsing Doppler radar or at that level it eighty to eighty five miles an hour and so where there's a heavy cluster of thunderstorms and there is one currently ... crossing over highway six team which goes into making from savannah [noise] um there's heavy rain there and\nThat thunderstorm translates those higher wins to the surface and so in those storms\nThey could see I guess two eighty miles or maybe even eighty five mile an hour gusts even though we're looking at a a sustained speed of Seventy miles an hour so we're going to drop about in half\nAs we go over the next twenty four hours to around forty to forty five of the speed of wins above the surface\nAnd and so right now as I said we're Seventy will be down to about forty five will still be in the tropical storm range and I believe that it will exit the United states or as we get up to\nFriday morning out into the Atlantic as a as a tropical storm out\nAnd we're not it's not it's not going to become a remnant it's not going to be just a cluster of storms that are moving their way off in a in a general direction John trout and great meteorologist or admire him a lot\nIndicated Ninety five corridor and that's exactly what it's going to be following the court or although it will be on the west side of that court door and we've already learned that the west side of that court or\nHas some some some roots that are between Colombia and Ninety five and moving its way up toward Charlotte in Rockingham\nAnd so forth that are that have their own issues when it comes to a flooding and that includes going across Lumberton and Fayetteville\nAnd both of those areas um\nSouth of Raleigh which I think it'll scoot right past Raleigh those areas are are\nWe're gonna have to be watching them as we go into today tonight and tomorrow or to see if we have more catastrophic flooding and damage we can probably we can probably saved for the next time we talked about turning around and don't drown\nRight right exactly ... and you have to you have to proceed with with caution and don't think you can get through it as you mentioned yesterday you don't know if that road has been washed away under the surface of the water you it's impossible to tell that so\nIt is always best to turn around and certainly we're going to keep people posted throughout the morning as meteorologists Tom hale\nAnd later John Trump will also join his uh and and keep

I I look I I still believe Texas has different animal and probably wouldn't be the same\nAs as other states I I Believe that that uh if cruise wins if cruise wins by you know double figures yeah I think he would have always won by double figures irrespective of the cabinet race yeah I I just think Texas is a different animal than than other states are in a primary what if you might want\nTwenty sixteen he won the state um do you look at a also now look there was a period a where especially ... right around the convention time [noise]\nPlenty of people in the Republican Party didn't like Ted Cruz remember the uh there was he got voted right and and the word from Capitol Hill I mean he was being demonized by fellow Republicans are at one point\nSo this is someone attacked cruises someone who gets the benefit I think maybe a to a greater degree as than than others\nOf the Republicans coming together after the capital thing when there's a juggling within the party than someone like Ted Cruz who's been criticized by his own party\nYou know the then he's going to get he's going to get that bump a little bit more or the benefit of that a little bit more uh than than others might\nSo I think it'll be interesting I think to to really watch this next three weeks three and a half\nWell yeah ... and ... house races we can't tell because there's that you just look at it in the polling or they don't do a lot of polls for a lot of these house races and so you really don't have an indication now I'm sure inside their campaign they do\nBecause they're doing the inside the inside polling but you you know that's one of the complaints you and I were having to learn by our Mitchell meeting their little while ago saying ... really can't tell because the no polls in three weeks ... internal poll in two weeks you look at the toss\nUps the number of districts right now that are that are classified as toss ups or categorize the stuff that's thirty two according to our C. P. and they're not doing they don't do polls on the house seats as often as they do for the Senate seats\nAnd I have to wonder what has changed after the cabin on hearing and confirmation vote and I have to wonder again in those districts keep in mind a number of those districts or the race is is on\nTo fill the seat that someone has is leaving a Republican stepping out ah what does that mean is the makeup of that district changing and we look at Texas thirty two\nAh that is uh the uh Pete Sessions or the the demographics in in his district or change\nYou know um that's that's something that well changes politics\nAnd it's much of that district is uh I think in fact I think all of his Dallas County and Dallas County has gone balloon and well gosh going back to a Obama in two thousand eight so for a decade\nOr Hillary won in fact that district or buy a point and a half I Believe it was a so we'll see what you know what that means for Pete Sessions\nLooking for a car credit not

Montana for example in Jon Tester and I I guess Charlie Cook came out the other day in and uh also ... has now said it's a toss up our see peace says it's a toss up\nTester's been up uh in July was up by three in early September he was up by two by late September he was up\nBy four but that was latest poll ended nine twenty to write a at a up over Matt Rosendale the Republican challenger what happens in you know that state as we get closer ah a Jon Tester has never been over fifty percent\nIn any of the the polling ah a he is he is just over\nThe margin of error you know just slightly over in in his in his I'm\nA ... for example he was a plus for that was a margin of three point seven margin of error and he was up by three that was a margin of two so he's over but now it's a Senate race it listed\nAs a toss up and the question is in a in a place like Montana\n\nWhere conservative politics still wins in the majority of Montana and\nAfter everything that we obscene and and not just cabinet but everything that's coming out now you know the Hillary videos getting played every where they you know I had but we play down yesterday show the comments\nI'm of the former attorney general

that\n... claiming as we said during the whole Kavanaugh thing 'cause this is what to me that was the big message it came out of it the ... the criticism that Democrats put on Republicans or anybody else but didn't agree with them is if you if you believe in the mindset of due process and a presumption of innocence\nUrine enablers ... your ... you weren't able or a rape is that is what you do

warm enough that far north in the Atlantic to keep it going then\nYes okay yeah wow\nYeah I did I just assume by the time we got to October probably be cool down so I was surprised to hear that but the outer still warming up yeah\nL and and and that's why we're having these storms and the you know the the normal hurricane season ends at the beginning of November right and so at this point there's a reason to that extent this is the fourth\nA major hurricane that we've had in the month of October period and so yeah that's and that's simply a and it was unusual to have a major hurricane to begin with in October when you consider that there's been four of them total ...\nAnd and so and the last nine something that just sticks in my mind was and I can't remember which one of you said it well is it going to kind of lose some power that comes into shore and\nAnd I and my immediate reaction was you know\nNo [laughter] yeah right\nYeah because you were right because I I'd asked that

longest living storms in terms of the the life this band the time but Michael is active\nUm no I don't think so you've you've stumped me on that one because we've got some that don't even make it here but for some reason they just spin around in the mid Atlantic right we're in the western Atlantic and so I've never I've never looked into that yeah\nYeah um it it just seems that a ... and you mentioned this earlier talking about you know we always\nOften we'll talk about a storm the remnants of the remnants of and as you mentioned we this we're not going to get to that point in terms of it being overland here we're not going to talk about the remnants of Michael it will be still tropical storm Michael overland\nYes it is to Charlotte to Raleigh and Norfolk yeah and that's where I Am concerned about a lot when it goes you know for that whole area up there the Hampton Roads area you know\nThat area just floods [noise]\nYeah and and so\nI mean we didn't talk about it a lot with Florence but it was flooding in Florence it was nothing compared to the flooding that was going on in in in central North Carolina right and so it never really picked up any news but\nWhen this goes over there I think we're going to hear a lot more about the Virginia beach folk and Hampton Roads area as it probably exits somewhere right in that area and heads out into the into the ocean and you know we haven't even touched on power outages right\nA ... power outages there's a there's a huge swath that's going to be from power outage outages from Columbia pretty much all the way up to the uh uh Virginia border to at least a pass Wilmington and and just where you start to get into the outer banks island\nWhen the Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition and what board and he's written a generic ... that's right over two hundred three on cars all all models had incredible prices logged on to flood Otto John John now\nOf thunderstorms which currently are moving their way across interstate twenty are heading toward Colombia and going through Augusta well that's not likely place where you've got the heavy rain it's where\nThe feeder bands that are probably fifty to a hundred miles further out where there's individual cells and as we start to get into the morning hours where we'll have an an up tick in the uh what's called the low level jet stream and wins and we get a little sunshine we're going to see some\n... some possible super cells develop along in those ... and\nI'm a John ... touchdown and he said when you get the friction of the land and you get this massive fast rotating storm\nAnd it hits the land or it kind of drags the bottom it creates wind shear and so the the the tornadoes are typically week they're F zero to the F ones\nAnd um and they're they're shallow they're short lived and um and they're commonly in the north east quadrant of the storm so if you cut the storm in four pieces you've got your your northeast your\nSoutheast you've got your south west northwest well the the the one that is closest to the ocean\nAnd the further north than the quadrant where we see these\nIndividual cells and feed her band stringing their way and and so that's the other area where we're going to be watching now yesterday we had a three tornadoes reported two in Georgia one in Florida\nI'm a long and near highway Seventy five as as the storm was moving its way through Panama City and northward toward Tallahassee\nInland and the main peninsula Florida that's where we saw those feeder bands coming in and we picked up the the the tornado activity but as as this entire system moves forward we've got\nThese threats one or the winters are gonna toppled trees trees are going to topple power lines a power lines means widespread power outages over the central sections of the Carolinas and possibly into a southern Virginia then we have flooding\nAnd that flooding is going to be a a long and through Fayetteville to the west as we get up into the hill country I call it\nA up the Raleigh and so forth that area is is is is perfect for flash flooding because there's all kinds of hills ... ravines and so forth hollers and that all\nCreates its own issue for the flash flooding and it doesn't take a lot of rain considering all the soaking it has had [noise] and and then beyond the tree toppling the power outages and the tornados that that we have with this thing um you know it's a it's a pretty complete storm\nAnd it it has enough energy to maintain itself as a tropical storm until it gets outta here leaving Virginia Beach and heading for the uh hadn't for the other side of the pond\nWow wow just incredible energy behind the storm and of course ah just unbelievable devastation in the wake of Michael ... and a much of that will still have to be assessed as the sun starts rise or in what is now that that path that the that Michael took\nA and I were just looking at at one website uh and and the power outages here reporting in the hundreds of thousands of course of costs seven hundred yeah uh being affected here and they they send it for some of them it could be weeks\nOr a yeah I remember my ah my brother being affected they got to higher ground from their storm there on the Gulf Coast of Texas a and they went in they went inland but uh they couldn't go home for her it was a couple of weeks just for them and that storm wants them to the size and intensity that Michael was\nAnd so it could be weeks and weeks before some of these customers have a power again right coming up here and just a little while we're going to get back with you Tom we appreciate your time and we'll talk more about what to expect from tropical storm Michael at the bottom of the next hour thank you time\nLooking forward to it are meteorologist Tom hale with us this morning and he'll be with this ah each hour at the bottom of the hour just to kind of recap what

we'll start that will start down a variety of different things uh it was interesting 'cause I was thinking to myself I'm not really surprised by this\nAnd has written the wall Street Journal is said investors really weren't surprised by this and I'm thinking okay well I don't put myself in their category\nBut just looking at everything that's that has been going on things you know little signs out there that you and I talked about when you see the bond yields and you see what you know treasury bills we just happened to be talking about that last night right and and we were looking at that at how the the interest rates on treasury bills for the most part has doubled\nIn a year that's just in a year it has\nDoubled that you know that means there's more money that the government has to pay out just a for interest you've got the fed now are wanting to uh raise rates the story was out or did we do this on the air off the air about uh that uh because uh ... what we did it on the mortgage\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty

rocketed because of the rise in interest rates that was ultimately going to do those homeowners it was clear well if they can't keep up right now\nWell then what it balloons out with even a higher rate to a higher rate than uh than they had expected and plan for well all bets are off it's just not going to happen and that's that's part of that was part of the dynamics in place\nWell what you have here is you know uh the basically the fed going in and the the point Kramer was making is that\nIt was not Jim Kramer at CNBC in the street dot com was that he wants a more regimented and he wants them to do the homework on the economy he feels that the fed is not doing their homework and they should review the data because\nTo his point what do we know about the fallout from terrorists what do we know about\nA long term effect uh you know you have the PG saying you know part of the the um the demand for from China has softened greatly and so part of their problem was not just the the the cost of materials\nAnd freight well or that but that that Senate emissions from the administration that the economy isn't expanding as quickly as they as they're selling and therefore we can't raise the interest rates in a way that's politically that's an admission that it's not going as good as it should right because if you were saying\nThat you're raising interest rates um and it is regimented and and\nReally has a you know a ... ... if your point is a ... in the administration that they should wait you know Jim Kramer saying it is one thing but at the point is being made that the the feds don't need to raise rates right now well\nYou are admitting you're saying that our policy is also affecting you have to admit that any policy by any governing entity is is affecting negatively right terrorists or whatever it might be like ...\nRegulation and taxes because that's what a tear if it doesn't matter whether you call it a terror for an income tax whatever if your tax if you're raising the cost of doing business it's always going to hurt well and\nAnd I will see in the coming days where where the market rebounds if they believe this is long lived if they if it's going to be long lived if\nIf they believe that the administration is going to do an about face on terrorists and and and the tears even in the situation with China because it's it's affecting negatively way too many producers here in the U.S\nA than than the market will adjust accordingly but if we start seeing that uh that fear become the reality in the economic numbers than the market will also a general and the other way of\nOr if you see positive news coming out of leadership in Congress and we want to get this NAFTA thing done right yeah but I've heard nothing not yet nothing

that the day you never know because people might try to buy whatever but it's it's the fact that it was as you said when you look at it it was the worry\nFrom the tech companies and a lot of that has to do with regulation ... it's about trade and as you mentioned the one company as a PG E PG ... right and and a caterpillar\nA company is a deal in international trade their stocks were down right where did people put their money and utilities what does that mean you put it in utilities when you think there's going to be if there was a possibility of a downturn in the economy ... or say be

hundred thousand customers\nYeah and so we're going to get a will get over the two million mark on on people affected without any kind of power and then you have the question they were staging people for power\nIn Pensacola and just draw circle around from Pensacola around this whole area a thousands of power of of trucks utility trucks right\nAnd they're going to go into the area say can get into first so maybe the Carolinas Georgia and so forth they are going to have a better shot at getting power even though they did stage I Believe the number was up to Nineteen hundred power trucks uh\nAround the uh Pensacola area and around the panhandle and so yeah they're going to be working as hard as they possibly can but just the physical flooding an inundation and the damage and the debris is going to limit the time that it's going to take for them to get their power back so I still believe that\nThe landfall area the pan handle the took the greatest Bryant is going to have the longest period of time to restore power\nI mean [noise] face it there's a lot of places they don't have to restore power to anymore but they still have to be able to address the power lines that went there\nSure yeah the infrastructure itself has to be restored and\nAnd as you mentioned there may not be a a customer are there any longer unfortunately but\nStill is a a a a an infrastructure because down that line of course there are other customers that that has to have to be a half to get that power and have it to restore the the if you look at uh the uh the impact there as it came ashore\nA hurricane Michael again one for the record books you and I uh I was asking you the question kind of put you on the spot last last hour but you\nYou actually answered it on the spot very well and and were corrected generally speaking talking about the longest lasting\nA hurricane and and I found a little data their weather dot com about ah this would be a hurricane John back in Nineteen Ninety four which had a a thirty day run a this thing traveled in nearly eighty two hundred miles and all out in the Pacific\nAre affected why but then kept going and but ah roughly a thirty day run but I mean if you look at and you mentioned this earlier\nAnd it it it's something to remind folks that are still in the path of Michael that\nTypically and very often we see a that a storm or or hurricane starts to fall apart overland and then we we hear words like the remnants of but there are no remnants and again this is a well formed a tropical storm a that is traveling uh right now headed for the Carolinas and wreaking havoc\nOn on Georgia and uh and then we'll go back out over the ocean ah we also\nWant to go or you name it extra tropical once it goes out over the ocean\n... okay and you know and right\nIs it's it's no longer in the it's no longer a tropical storm in the tropical zones or so forth and it's going to lose power to forty miles an hour and then it'll regain power and that regained powers considered extra tropical but it's\nIt it you're right in in nailing it here the it it may not be the thirty day storm that meanders out there and\nBecause it's making good time but it's definitely covering a lot of terrain\nWhile it really is traveling in the end and speaking of traveling up for those professional drivers out there and the high profile trucks I Know that uh that uh Jon Traub mentioned this earlier it bears repeating for those truck drivers that uh and they know if there are seasoned driver they know\nThat those those are the those sustained wins a the ... whether it's hurricane force even tropical storm force\nCan turn one of those trucks over that can happen very easily and we're not even talking about the gusts or as you mentioned the the threat of the tornadoes there those sustained winds at forty forty five miles an hour\nOr can wreak havoc on those high profile vehicles there along Ninety five\nAnd as you mentioned we're going to see kind of that route over the next day or so uh with with Michael it will kind of hug I guess a Ninety five and a way a so those traveling along Ninety five need to be aware of that uh because that is a main quarter of course between Florida and New York well and um\nAnd then go ahead to some ... some degree they're going to have the stuff that they're back the wins and so that the the probably my biggest concern would be\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us that's right one
