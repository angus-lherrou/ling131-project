even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers out\nBut the community organizer a special him in the Chicago area oh the convening a number of things but politically it means getting people to the polls that's actually what it means um you know for politically or for any area not just Chicago but getting people to the polls\nThey they what they did is they grew that they nurtured that and they own that better than the Republicans and in fact the Republicans didn't know how to do it in two thousand eight\nAnd in two thousand twelve they beat Romney's team Romney was if you you and I were following the post debate polls be the polls that happened right after the debates between Mitt Romney\nAnd Barack Obama President Obama at that time and the polls showed that Mitt Romney or on the issues\nLandslide numbers even the exit polls yes and so massive massive numbers the difference was the organization guess what happened in twenty sixteen\nThey are and she had been working in the the DNC to see this because they were busy with\nYou know the whole fusion GPS and you know Christopher Steele Russians and all that ah but the orange the where they were putting their efforts was much like they in fact uh some say that as they designed it ah after that model\nOf getting people to the polls that's what it's all about you can call it what you want but at the end of the day it is getting people to get out and vote and that's what happened with those states that that Trump ended up winning that nobody saw\nAnd it was that you know boots on the ground type you know community organizing\nThe organization you know that she's trying to speak of it it really doesn't apply internally I mean\nWhipping the vote is one thing\nThe Democrats\nThough has had a playbook for a long long time and will long after a Casio Cortez is gone you and I kind of touched on the other day of kind of dismissing things being able to turn their head on a a Joe mansion you know and and not you know to the look the other way with a Joe mansion in certain cases\nAnd and not really worried about things like that\nWhen they can they know they can use Joe mansion for other things so\nThe\nThe entire equation is not going to change in fact\nI don't think the Democrats are the party would wanted to change because on many issues or they'll do what they have done in the past which includes the kind of behavior we saw with Obamacare we need to pass it so you can see what's in it which includes lying to the American people about what's what it's going to do well\nAnd she was saying that uh we need to organize for the pressure's not within\nA you know the the the body which would mean the pressure doesn't come from you know whipping up the votes at the pressure comes from the outside electorate will that happens all the title and that that ... that that's dating a are nothing new the other thing is when\nNow you have the excuses no she's not a leader of the party she's not a leader of the party you well you may not believe that she is and she isn't right now\nBut the mainstream media believes that she is that's why she gets on precedent did television time from the mainstream media\nAs a a candidate for Congress ... who has one nothing yet who was a bartender a year ago\nOne of the day they had ... said you know they basically are so leader yeah the DNC is basically said she's ... she's the future\nRight I mean she may not she's not the leader of the party right now but if she's the future that's what that's what the media is going to turn to the reason the media turns to that is because they see what's going on with a left by the way you know from the outside in\nWho who's leading the Democrats right now and has been leading the Democrats what force what movement is leading the Democrats while its its overall if you were to term it collectively it's the protester it the extreme left\nBut what's the problem with that\nIs that how many different protests are they're the reason right now that they can dismiss someone tomorrow and they uh Beto O'Rourke does not need a a former president Brock Obama campaigned for him\n... group wants your car any make any model flood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center had will vie yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nThat's what he would he go party will say he ... he reached my endorsement shouldn't be rejecting right Obama's or an endorsement but really I mean that I'm I'm Glad you brought that up because that's something else from last week\nThat we really didn't get a chance to talk about but really that's unbelievable it shows you you know you and I you and I started working together Thirteen Years ago so you know we were we were together or three years when Obama first got elected right and and we remember every single moment of it and we remember\nThe the political I dollar tree for\nPresident or an Obama remember his you know the the DNC speech from when they when they did it from the stadium with Greek columns and everything else and people were falling over him and\nIt was and I look at it today now out of it now I ... yeah\nOur our goal is to have the liberal takeover of a of a of Texas A M ... or ... nah we don't want one writer years after he's out now we don't want him white made\nBecause ... and that's it what what a Casio Cortez doesn't include here is internally externally\nThe political pressure by the way it always comes from the outside uh that's of course it and and it's always the people on it like we said yesterday about Republicans if if the Republicans were jailed last year or as the president took\nOffice in January of twenty Seventeen like are they are now after capita than we probably would see if they were ... out on the issue of health care we would see Obamacare gone completely but that wasn't the case and so that that there is one example of political pressure being\nA precedent in in in one year and then go on and the next\nWell with the left the problem is is your political pressures coming from every different splinter group right it which moves in multiple directions tell me which direction you go what are you going to be with the feminists are the trends genders\nBecause you can't on their boat right now they're fighting with each other ... as we predicted right three or four years and and so that's the problem that they created they they basically over a couple of generations they were out a ... and in doctrine aiding children and and and young people\nTo believe that it was that it's white to wake up today and find a new oppressor find a new reason to be a victim and that might include somebody with that was with you and part of your group yesterday [noise]\nPresident Obama or just not really into any more\nYeah I mean I wouldn't want to do was speaking engagement inside that but that Iran take our but think about\nIt shows you how the political wins yes Ken Ken just blow\nThe one of the probably the biggest political idol of my lifetime\nAnd make it so he's not even relevant two years after he's out of office yeah not even ... years are running right from him saying that don't need an don't need his endorsement here and that's because and and you and I've talked about we thought this might happen because we saw some of the signs\nBecause the less believes he truly wasn't the liberal right that he truly he was he wasn't in it really for the cause\nHe was and it just because of the gig\nRight but he really wasn't in to doing what needed to be done to move the political lover\nAs far left as they thought they didn't work with his own party as closely as as many thought he was going to eight six six Ninety run

I I guess I guess the point that I'm asking is\nIs in ... and ... is\nThe Republicans are the majority one can the Democrats you that's that's my point why is that there was there to be a right to go to ... to me that's what I mean it's bad for Democrats so what is their issue that they can use their point there is ... whether it be how ...\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model flood pays more than anything around because we're a certified buying center at will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nHave a mandate attached to it and the oil companies don't\nCare about the credits they don't care about the credits that's not something that helps them\nIf the government forces a mandate and that's what was being proposed the even President Trump has talked about in the past raising the mandate right to Fifteen Percent right well if you do that that becomes a that becomes a big problem politically\n... outside of Iowa good I just I've read like three different articles on it and that's what I thought it was was okay you're trying to please both sides but you're not really pleased anybody well because you're not mandating it the oil companies aren't going to do it right it's not a mandate on it so you're simply saying I'm going to allow them\nI'm going to allow I'm going to allow the industry to do what the industry doesn't wish to do\nRight and sell it year round well I think you're probably gonna see pushback ... first of all I guess we'd have to see what the participation rate is well once I like the the wife cities like Houston in LA they don't want more smog\nWhat gas station is going to be the first to put wanna put a Fifteen in when you do as well as I Do on the Internet is going to be fine you could damage your car you know a a a faster\nYou could damage your lawn mower faster if you use the fifteenth mhm right that it should just be ten percent should be the max and putting Fifteen Percent is is just ridiculous so nobody's going to do it so it's just the way the president's just trying to appease people without doing anything\nIs trying to appease the farm but you can't get there from here because there is no great motivator there really is no incentive even with changing how the credits work\nEven with changing because changing it to sell it year round how does that ... the benefits those that are blending it well okay you could blend it year round\nAnd you wouldn't have to change up at the refinery level as often that is not that's not promising to them because ultimately it automatically comes back down to the consumer\nRight so the mandate is on the blend here's my question if the mandate is on the ... right at ten percent but the mandate isn't there for Fifteen Percent\nBut those companies the the the the oil companies that are putting it out let's say they responded to the incentive of of changing the credits\n\nAnd we went to I don't know sixty Seventy percent of the ethanol or the gasoline so would would have a Fifteen Percent\nOr ethanol concept on the market what would happen with the consumer many of the\nConsumers would be driven to look for the ten percent seek out the temp right\nWhen that happens and you have a glut of the eight Fifteen on the market then what happens then there's pushback from the retail is that's why the retailers don't want her to have it on this is why it is destined to fail you're handing you believe you're handing something to the farmers\nAnd the corn states but it really doesn't fly without the mandate and he knows politically outside of Iowa you can't get an e Fifteen mandate done right now\nYou can't\nI mean you might get Chuck Grassley on board [laughter] ...

Administration was complicit ... remember that in right in the in Hurricane Florence ... uh you know we talked about you know the the president\nDoing something on that but all we're really not sure but allowing the the the increase to happen it initially up and all was supposed to be about reducing global warming until they found out from farm to tank it actually produces more global warming gases\nBecause of what you have to do to actually make up and all and we just mentioned that the president now doesn't bring up global warming it's just oh the government needs to uh get involved in this in order to help the farm right um\nAnd then we have the United nations coming out and saying we're doomed\nBecause of global warming that we are uh you have a Al Gore\nTraveling the United nations as well but we have twelve more years yes we'd twelve years now I I Know I Know you're we're already passed the first twelve years aren't we yeah yeah you never know what this twelve years they mean\nAnd so so how do we solve it ... well the United nations special climate reports suggest a tax on carbon dioxide admissions would be nice to be as high as twenty seven thousand dollars per ton at the\nEnd of the century to effectively limit global warming and that means you would have to have a two hundred and forty dollar per gallon tax\nOn gasoline in that year huh now should such a recommendation be adopted yeah in twenty thirty the report says a carbon tax would need to be as high as\nFifty five hundred dollars that's the equivalent of forty nine dollars\nPer gallon gas tax by

trees can be snapped in these kind of wins\nAnd on the air this is going back ten or eleven days as you and I were discussing why were to go to the inspector general and all the sudden it was Doug that's the role of the inspector general is to do what is to investigate corruption there it's the you don't give it to the inspector general to save review this\nAnd tell me what I can release\nAnd what I can uh you know what I can unwritten pact you use that for that you use\nYour a director of national intelligence year CIA director and uh your your uh a secretary of state it was a former CIA director those are the people you would go to for the for for that maybe your national security director now but you know the secretary of defense\nThose are the people you would go to\nTo just to decide at least in my opinion whether you should declassify it or not and I say you're a secretary of state former CIA director because they claimed that some allies or didn't want some things to be released and our initial thing was wait a minute what are their allies no they don't know what's in their right how how do they know that the\nAnd we were initially puzzled when he said he was going to give it to ah the inspector General Michael Horowitz until we realize\nThey were they ... that it went whoa look at\nThis but yeah the conclusion we came to was that if you are looking if you're looking to give this to the inspector general the department of justice\nThen you're basically asking him to do an investigation and to issue a report they said that acts but they asked for an expedited process here from Mr Horwitz\nAnd the only reason you do that is because of the role of Michael Horowitz the inspector general's office in in the overall is to do what to look at possible fraud or misdeeds done within the ... of justice\nFraud or a rousing reception\nAll of that would be and if you think about it because I I'm thinking of a a a ... and in the room with the president and also or his chief of staff or Kelly as well looking at that and saying\nIf you come out and make a conclusion or draw conclusions from this information by de classifying it and we see the on redacted information here if we jumped to the conclusion well first of all\nThe executive branch is not really that there is no prosecutorial power there you would have to go through a the the department of justice itself but where would you start at the department of justice if you believe that people that are either they're in place or were there before\nCommitted a you know a crime possibly or there was fraud or corruption or any of those items that would be on the plate of the inspector general's office you would start with Michael Horowitz it's the only way because beyond that you're looking at just a political move that's all the way it would be played\nIt would be well the president saying this and that's not what we think if you take that off the out of the political arena\nAnd that's exactly what you do hear\nThink about the fact that you're not sending it to the attorney general even that could be seen as a political move because he's an appointee by the president right while our layers supposed to be a ton of us and you know ... or which\nIs someone that's been in place since before he was appointed by Obama he was appointed by Obama but more importantly ... that's that's a key to opening that door and ending the discussion about whether it's politically motivated more importantly\nOn top of that you add the fact of what the inspector general was designed to do in the ... report you might see from the inspector general's office when we went through the inspector general's report\nOr on the FBI there were a number of things in the uh the Hillary email investigation a number of things there that we found now if you're taking this I guess otherwise mundane report and you're trying to basically build the narrative as to what was going on in this case\nOf the other report of at the FBI under the direction of a then director James Comey\nAnd what was going on and and how the Hillary email investigation or was handled into and

done the legwork done there to possibly lends support to this new investigation um and it's I think\nInteresting and I think very key that the president turned it over to Horwitz and basically washed his hands up and for now\nAnd I think it's important to remember Giuliani has been saying that he believes it perjury happen that right you had somebody in the FBI verify because that's his charge okay and and again we're this is going on speculation by what\nPeople who claim they're familiar with the matter a believer in and he is a former prosecutor what he believes his that he believes there

believed they believed because you only give it to or which because you believe possible crimes have been committed ... either something extremely wrong or crimes have been committed and you give it to the inspector general because at that point he can come out with a complete report and not just use\nYou know the the unwritten pact that evidence a you have but he can go look from anything he wants in the department of justice and get it to help build his case\nHe has access to the documents that the the the ... the oversight committee could not get from the FBI there is no process that stopped\nHorowitz from walking in and obtaining those documents that the the those oversight committees have been trying to get for a long time he has direct access to all of that information\nNow I Want to read a parts of this from John Solomon that adds to all of this he goes the department of justice and the FBI have tried to thwart President Trump on releasing evidence suggesting that will harm national security make allies less willing to cooperate or even leave him vulnerable to accusations\nThat he's trying to obstruct the end of the Russia probe before you judge the arguments from

public\nFrom the heavy redacted arguments all one could tell us at the FBI general counsel James Baker met with an unnamed person who provided some information in September of twenty sixteen about Russia email hacking impossible linked to the Trump campaign\nNot a reporter or policymaker would have added an eyelash over such a revelation than last Wednesday I broke this story John Solomon\nThe

the Supreme Court\nIs now gone ... of course that's ... right\nAh it it isn't I mean that's the ... when when you're lost or anything else to say that's that's what you say\nThe only other thing as I said I and I let it was yesterday showing and I and I do believe this is something Republicans need to work out and I said maybe I was nitpicking after Republicans were celebrating their victory but\nUh when I heard a Mitch McConnell afterwards being asked a question about conservative justices he even use the term conservative justice and I said look we need to as conservatives we need to take that out of it it's not\nConservative versus political on the Supreme Court it's originalist versus liberal that's what it is if you want to be accurate as to what is actually going on it's\nThe liberals who wish to put on judges who passed legislation versus not conservatives who wish to pass conservative legislation it's originalist construction it's also been they've been called but originally we want to stick to the original text of the constitution\nAnd say it's not our job to legislate now that may be a conservative idea\nBut same liberal versus conservative justices gives you the indication that it's all political and it's not\nFrom the point of view of a conservative the kind of judge we want is one who will protect the constitution not change it changing the constitution is up to a are changing the law or the constitution is up to the legislature or the constitutional amendment process ...\nAnd it's that simple and we need to as conservatives\nOr we need to and libertarians we need to promote that that it is we the people who are elected representatives that need to be making the law\nAnd not abandoning the constitution and having a judge's become legislators and we haven't explained that it up and so when I hear even in the media on a consistent basis in once in a while I'll even split and say a conservative\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model what pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nTomorrow that had to be like what was that ... right around Labor Day that was the friday headed by into Labor Day we ... and ... and that was because you know Mueller's going to let the investigation nobody's even talking about Russian collusion now it's gone on anybody's radar it seems like that was\nTen years ago and that's how fast the the cycle has has moved you know what is on people's minds and so when I woke up yesterday I started thinking what are Democrats thinking the issue is what's the issue that they can go after Trump out what's the issue that will even grab Democrats\nRight now to say oh yeah okay that's the issue you and I talked about the fact that the un coming out and saying OK it's time for our annual we're doomed to update because of global warming\nAnd we're thinking of the Democrat's gonna jump on that they've been jumping on that since the beginning of the Obama administration that and raised on a consistent basis\nAnd so I was looking at your earlier and saying I'm waiting for the race baiting does start some time by the end of the week because it's been their old standbys is what they've always use now even though at the same time the American people have said they don't care yeah we don't believe those are the top issues we don't believe race relations or the top issue we believe we get along with each other really well\nAre you folks in Washington may not and you people that belong to certain groups\nOr or you know or or may not but for the most part we get along and global warming well you haven't major case to the vast majority of America let me go get a burger\nI is I mean seriously that's words that but you know and we ... we actually stay to during the Obama administration I'll never forget where we said are they doing this on purpose\nBecause I actually think that if we don't talk about the issues of the day if we don't talk about the economy 'cause remember the economy never had three percent growth the entire time of the Obama administration and you and I would talk about this all the time saying there seems to be no interest in talking about making the economy better\nNo it wasn't even as a story that was being discussed\nAnd and they just went back to global warming and and race\nSo I really find it interesting as to as we are now just a little under a month from uh from election time that you know what's what's the Democrats issue what do they actually going to use besides impeachment if they think that's going to work which brings me to this article Wall Street journal Bobby Jindal\nFormer a former governor of of\nLouisiana two thousand two thousand sixty Democrats try some self restraint now I I like Bobby Jindal but this may be a little bit delusional\n[laughter] it was up there was right [laughter] yeah uh it's\nNot certain the Democrats I'm just wondering the parts of it because I actually started laughing during it or it's not certain but that's okay he's trying to be an optimist mhm I'm being a complete and total sitting here at this moment but I think justifiable I can justify it it's not certain the Democrats will retake the house but if they do they will likely ignore\nTheir leaders preferences and push to impeach President Trump or perhaps justice cabin up\nIn a swap with Clinton their opposition's Democrats now lecture the nation that unseemly personal behavior makes the president unfit for office while Republicans and says his private morality has no impact on those whose public duties this is more\nA than a interesting irony impeachment would undoubtedly energize Mr Trump's base and make these voters even more loyal to him as it did with Bill Clinton\nDemocrats have an alternative\nThey can set aside the president of the Obama years when the party sought to enact the most extreme agenda it could pass and instead to search for common ground with marginal Trump supporters\nDemocrats won't win over this most ardent Tea Party members they won't win over ... Christians or other committed supporters but a humble are more open approach could attract some\nOf his peripheral supporters and weaken the resolve of his base Democrats can support gay marriage

[laughter] everything [laughter] though to respect to the governor no um you know a number one it's not gonna happen no it's not [laughter] and not going to have a number two is also not going to happen and then [laughter] it will never happen\nI'm no I'm\nWell it it can happen and you look\nWe as we saw this after twenty six team we said this one Democrat\nBecause I find this fascinating I find the ... election that the Democrats go through ... you know of and they've gone through it\nAnd if you were election cycles where they say\nOkay we we've we've got to reevaluate we\nWe have to get outside of the Washington and here are bubble we we we need to we need to go into the\nHeartland and see how people are really thinking yeah and they really said that's twenty sixteen we have to seriously reevaluated when they went in the complete opposite direction laid off and said yeah they'd gone more in saying now they've gone more authoritarian they've gone more a dare I say using the F. word\nOr with the fascist mindset out there while claiming\nThat they are the anti fascists yeah that's the most interesting point\nYeah yeah um and and it's that's not going that's not going to change a where it was a couple of weeks ago when we basically kind of wind it up what would drive the ... the Democrats I'm Sorry\nThe the far left liberals\nThose that are really I mean then they're leading the party now I mean I think after the uh capital confirmation process we can we can say without a doubt that as part of the mainstream process now um but nonetheless what would bring them back\n\nWhat would bring them back and bring them too because you know the ... which is by the way the most in same part of um I mean we can we can giggle at at a governor Jindal's you know a appeal if you will in the same way that we can discount Robert Redford\nA script and his message because I Would ask both of them\nBefore we talk about the same behavior of the left tell me what would drive them to come back from\nAs especially when they are they stopped and they can't get out of it it it just it's a never ending loop there into creating more victims\nBecause which ones are not the cause of it like this is this is what that's a great Robert Redford once you believe that Trump is the cause of it Trump stop the cause of it he has the effect of it and and so\nTell me if you think that
