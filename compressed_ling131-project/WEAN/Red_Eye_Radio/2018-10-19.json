flood of every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nTo summarize what we've been doing the last few days there's been a progression of seems kind of on Monday morning it was a follow up to the judge Kavanaugh hearings and your reaction in my belief that we've entered a new civil war in this country between the left and right\nI used to say I'm not a violent civil war but I asked what's been happening the last year or so I'm I'm not sure that's true and uh I I think it's going to get worse especially if we talked about this last night especially for Republicans keep house\nBecause of the Democrats the less the liberal media almost all the same thing they're convinced that going to win the house and at least take back ... one part of Congress and if they don't but I I Can't imagine what the reaction is going to be\nOn Tuesday Morning I talked about the great job that President Trump is doing and of course the unbelievable anger towards him by the resistance right they even around that coined that phrase right away the resistance like yours is the Nazi Germany or something or fascism and of course that's what they believe\nAnd I also asked you who would be your favorite choice to get the Democratic nomination for president and who would you agree to have coffee with on the other side side by the way that was a sign\nThat many of us ... troubles choosing someone that's pretty bad at it wasn't always that case\nI chose personally I chose Bernie Sanders because I thought he seems to me like you might be a pleasant fellow\nActually I'm ahead of what's her name of costs you know I always say the wrong by what's her name\nOr ... something Cortez yeah of course has she doesn't even ... and the latest news says that they asked her about whether they would support whether she would support a Bernie for the presidential nomination and said oh we'll have to wait how communications director said we'll wait and see what happens on a lot of loyalty they're up\nAnd I remember I I tears roll down my eyes when he a Trump won Pennsylvania which was always a Republican fool's gold always stay we might win but when it counted like with Romney we always came up short so when he won Pennsylvania real is he was like you going to be president\nIt was unbelievable even though I predict that morning I predict on Facebook that I thought he was going to win so what did some students do and these are adults students they went to the system principle to complain that I was texting a lot\nSo she called the inter office at the end of the night and she said you know mark I defended you to the students because all of us were so upset with the results that it was not surprising that was a text and going on [noise] it didn't even cross or my for second that I could be on the other side\nAnother time there was a teacher's meeting and the ... a teacher trainer who was running the meeting said you know we have some time why don't we go around the room all your teachers and you could tell us something that would be interesting that we don't know about you\nDo you think for a second I Would tell them about my other career life how could have been the end of me and a final anecdote was when Justice Scalia died than another teacher said mark let's play knock knock joke so I played along and his answer to who was there was just a Justice Scalia just died and he said that was funny enough\nI probably didn't hide my look of dismay because he ... me because he immediately walked away having no idea that I adore Justice Scalia and he was my favorite judge so now you know why I'm Still teaching the public school system\nIt's kind of like the McCarthy Era to reverse but I have to keep quiet about my political views I Want to know

Virginia Joe you're on with mark\nMartin Morning [noise] hey I'm real good topic and I'm I'm actually calling into a tiny little story about my sister but I Want it to all of a you know on Facebook I've I've shutdown Facebook just because even if I had\nIt with my friends and family only I still found\nEndless arguments on there for I mean just for no reason you know it's almost like they were troubling me waiting for me to say something and then they were all along you know um\nIt it almost feels to a point some times when I'm Talking to people I Can't even really say what I where I stand because people just get annoyed that the name Trump sometimes you know a ... but with my sister even before the election actually happened um\n... ... maybe some day she'll come around she obviously got infected with socialism in Europe and what's going on there if you ask most of your opinions I don't think many of them be happy with what's going on I don't know what you saw a but it's it's depressing hang in there my friend okay it'll it'll come around sometimes\nJust hang in there um I was just thinking of a you know people are funny that way I worked at a at a station ... in Los Angeles as I said I don't want to say too much about it except one of the whole was had a\n... we have there's a gal on whose father was a famous I don't want to see what he did but it was pretty famous that is in this day\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island for a mere luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the all new twenty AG Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln if there were against it unparalleled luxury impeccable is\nSaid to me you know mark or her father died\nAnd she didn't even know it and I had to tell her the news and she said a whole wow I never got a chance to say goodbye so they hadn't talked to her I think it was at least Twenty years and you think that finally when he passed on but it was too late to say goodbye to him\nBecause she disowned him all those years before it ever personal reasons so one has to think that\nEventually you hope people come around before something serious happens and I always tell my students you can never tell someone you love enough that you love them because life is very short but when you hear the family story has a brother and sister daughter whenever that because of politics they disown their parent\nOr their brother who they know their whole lives assuming there's nothing terrible going on in the relationship just over politics and you see that almost always on on the left hand side\nVery discouraging but are brought up the topic because it does happen is this something that needs to be talked about like let's go to Amanda in Woodbridge, Virginia you're on with mark\nMark it's great to talk to you I'm going to get a you know Republican and conservative my whole life and went into the military right after high school and um\nIt most of the people um that I met in the military were bitter because they felt like the Republicans were the only one that would ever support\nA raise for you know the military pay as I kind of you know just that OK well they're there for me as a non for them um and then as time went on um\nWhen I'm\nThe first I'm\nA Gulf walk him about um I just remember listening to the radio and and just being like I Need to find someone that talking about this 'cause\nAt the time I was driving a lot and and the spending a lot of time in the car and I'm just want it to listen and you know he's found conservative radio and you know I haven't really talked about it with other people\nUntil people started asking me who you're going to vote for oh why are you voting for them and it was like people started coming to me and pulling it out of me I wasn't I was pushing anything on them and\nUm when it came down to trumpet with like for a lot of people around me it was the straw that broke the camel's back and they just walked away from their friends and relatives just stop paying my friend and I\nAnd they just how can you you know I think he's for somebody who's just you know\nTerrible and I'm just like you're going to stand I couldn't get mad at Republicans for Twenty years for letting the media and the and the Democrats walk all over I mean this guy won't let anyone walk all over him and he still conservative saying to make our country better and\nYou know I still see people rallied against him and I'm just like wait a minute we'll be greatest economy in that we in the country's ever seen you know we have I mean I'm T jobs for truck drivers so that keeps five thousand dollar bonuses for someone who starts a child\nYou know I mean\nFor construction jobs that are just they don't have enough people to do them and they and you know these tech jobs that pay huge amount of money ... ... you know if you get the right to greet you can get a great job if you if you don't have a degree you get Dr driving a truck working construction and\nYou know everyone seems to be still upset and close the stand back and look at what's going on but\nYou know I I had a friend telling me right to my faith that I get so mad at you when I when I read the things you oppose that I just want to shoot you and the head and she made the hand signal lightning pointing a gun at my cat\nAnd I just so hurt by that and you know I I haven't talked to her and that was you know nine months ago and\nIt just seems like a lot of my friends are just like you know we can't be friends with demand that because she like tunnel Trump and I I just don't want to be around her anymore and it\nIt is hurtful and\nUm yeah I had some time I just felt like I was the most hated person on the Internet because on top of this I'm a transgender woman so a lot of people on the right hated me for the ... hated me because I like Donald Trump and you know my family a lot of people my family disliked me because\nI've transition and and also because I'm a Republican and then I have a chance to people that looked at me and like how can you be Republican nephew chance he hates us and I'm just like nobody doesn't you know and so it's like all these angles for coming at me telling me that\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition at what for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred three on cars all make all models and incredible prices are going to flood auto job now\nFor who you are and and then\nIt's just\nWell I feel your pain that I had to use the bill Clinton line but\nI can hear the sadness and you know my heart goes out to you you can't imagine what you're going through a ... it's tough enough or the challenges that regular life holds for all of us let alone when your friends or abandon you and maybe some family members to [noise]\nIt's pretty discouraging I think you need to find new friends you know people who at least will share your Republican views\nUh to begin with and I think you're going to find a not everyone but a lot more Republicans are tolerant despite the fact that we have this view that we're not taller people uh that you know we're racists bigots and home of ... all this kind of stuff\nWhen we're not you just have to find the right people and and maybe it is that time to do that and maybe joined different organizations but that may be I ...\nI got a volunteer work for a Jeff dolls I was running for Congress in my area and Jerry ... and ... ... is\nAn army veteran and his band aid on that you know African American and tear economy this older white guy and there for ten years called him a racist I mean it's\nLike a ... a yeah\nBy the way I've got I got to thank you for your service and then well my advice to you and asked me this just hang in there and there are other like minded people but you know in this world\nIf or when I ask people many good friends do you have and some people re say non and some say one and some say to it's hard to find good people it's hard to find special people I just want you know you're not alone that way that we all have those kinds of challenges maybe not your particular challenges but we all have our own Lincoln I think said\nThere is someone I don't like I'll have to get to know them better uh it it's tough life is very challenging and and can be very stressful and it's hard hard enough now we have a different colors and said we've reached a new level where your political views are enough to lose your friends let alone anything else\nSo my advice to you you sound like a nice person just keeping their don't give up and and try to find like minded people\nOkay and you have you have a great night [noise]\nUm ... the thing I just brought

shit here at the CBC which is\nThe Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for candidate they report the news\nCoast to coast and they are all the people the last say that Trump bashing every single day every chance they get they just\nI don't know what is going on and with people my daughter just graduated a couple\nOf years ago from ask journalism school okay in Canada and she had to be so careful when she was going to the course\nOr to lean bit lean on the left right because here you can't get a job and Canada's professor if you're not ... really left\nAnyway they don't present both sides of the ... that at any of the universities here as far as I Know and their children today are being brainwashed it's a social\nUh it\nIt's terrible what's going on\nAnd I don't know ... people now my rights to assume that people in Canada are pretty far left I mean you got your do now he's pretty far left you had a good prime minister before that oh I had I Believe this\nWonderful uh and [noise] we had our um our debt was not a big deal at all we hardly had actually had a balanced budget and everything was Harper\nAnd sin is they put him in a to do because of his name uh you know what he graduated from\nWas um uh what do you call that acting um\nActually yeah but he liked to school for acting thing still doing it [laughter] filtering is\nActing you thanks for your call he's the acting prime minister he still continuing now the official prime minister ... boy it makes you ever wonder why we ever win an election on our side everybody's telling us they're surrounded by liberals you blind guy the the lady will reduce mail anymore daughters sisters\nA son is it just doesn't seem to matter how ...\nHow do we ever win elections\nWell I guess we're just finding the people that they won't talk to us and the friend us so we don't get you know the people on our side wouldn't do that you don't know who they are let's go to well I don't know if we have time for one more call it wouldn't be fair to you but I'll tell you this\n... is a new time in America and I got to admit it's discouraging when people get on the air and say I got to be careful what I say my neighbors ever knew my point of view if uh my uh friends ever really ... when they found out what my views were I was in big trouble\nI've been to a friend did I mean is this the McCarthy Era of member MacArthur was you know calling everybody communist and ... whatever you thought of him it was unfortunately ruined a lot of careers\nIs that what it's come through and let me talk about myself you've probably heard me say this\nI Am a part time teacher and they don't know that I'm a talk show host let alone on national radio if they did they could figure out that I was probably conservative talk show hosts are some liberals are most of them are\nNot among many good you know what jeopardize being what what kind of America\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center at will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nBut now you're national forecast for video road law\nDangerous flooding continues in Texas there'll be a little strange today to the forecast\nMore showers for central and north central Texas today on top of what we've already seen there look for an additional two to four inches through the day today and tomorrow it'll be clearing in Dallas by Sunday for the Gulf states look for coastal showers thunderstorms were eastern Florida Today\nHigh pressure from the east and west coast of metal mean clear skies don't look for clouds in the inner mountain west or the west coast\nGood good hey I just wanted to follow up with something you had mentioned um briefly a little while ago about a social media and the effect it has had the honor relationships friends\nFamily colleagues um I've had experiences where I I quit things what five years ago because I just couldn't take reading some of the things people were writing and you know it was opposing me but I thought I don't want to\nJump in here and and you know say something I might regret or anything but I Know people that don't even talk to me because it was revealed on Facebook how I felt you know\nBack when Obama was still president and it just I I think the damage social media has done in my eyes far outweigh the good a with a lot of relationships you know\nWhen I started to go in your direction first of all I got to say my older brother has never signed on in more than one way obviously and was always afraid about privacy issues and that kinda stuff he winds up being right\nOr if I wasn't on the radio I probably wouldn't use faced with that much although I I got to be fair it is good you can reconnect with people when I was a teacher years ago they find me or you find out about someone's life is they just use it for that\nBut I've learned to like you said\nI've learned not to say much about politics and the ... when they know all the talk shows and if they know me already good luck they'll never leave you alone it's their chance to you know trying to say all kinds of things that they can say if they can't get through on radio so people have no limitations there so I just about I kind of control myself sometimes something gets me so sad\nAnd I think I I'm going to comment on this but in general uh I Try to stay away from it I think social media right\nAnd that does some good but the I like I said I don't even use Twitter hardly ever use Twitter anymore if I wasn't on the radio there are a lot of things I wouldn't do including like I said Facebook\nSo I I think people should be cautious with the social media special we're finding out that they're you know so many things were hacked and they're finding out a lot of your information so I think it's smart you said you have ... five years and\nI admire that Tom in Port Angeles a Washington You're on with mark\nHello mark a a I Want to do a shout out to your Canadian color out you're still listening I uh I I listen to a lot of community radio up here where I'm at and she's right it was a it was pretty horrific the way that they you know both the duct tape you she CBS NBC or just\nRegurgitate it everything\nThere is a bright spot and let the Canadians weren't aware that the U.S electorate was going to do it fast can not get the candidate that the media was trying to ... and that worked out in the end show all that horrific stuff that came\nOff of a a Paul Kennedy and a a at a Charles Adler and uh and right and uh and and green or all of that probably helped a\nJet of Obama or get a Trump elected because it was trying to hurt for we're coming down from Canada like that\nAnd ah but the reason I called was so we had already been told a for\nTwenty years Thirty years that ah you know nobody was going to be able to fix the inner cities and you know the racial issues that we had to confront\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine Vermont flood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nDate anywhere\nClear off on another Chang judge and things got worse shall we were very very disappointed a you know the people that voted for the white people that voted for Obama will review review social part it damaged the Democratic party for a long long time\nWell I think if they voted for him because\nThey want to show they weren't prejudice that was a mistake you know color should never be an issue but I'm sure some people did\nBut the fact is that he was a didn't disappoint me I knew he was I knew he was when he first came out\nI or not to mention his personality in terms of dropping a bill ... who is the Reverend Wright and pretended that the you know they weren't as friends any more you can see who he was\nYou get to know someone sometimes by a their character I admit people can pick on Trump that from the things he says and does so it's not foolproof but I knew he was far left he he really has got closer and closer to hide that for for half a second I'm no disappointment to me I I never expected much from him\nAnd that's what I'm saying the other side the left doesn't understand that we dislike him\nProbably as much as people dislike Trump all of them as a high bar I've got to admit that ah people who hate Trump really hate Trump let's go to Dave in gurney Illinois you're on with mark\nHey mark I've got two observations and then eight point to make\nUm first of all you notice all the calls that you have coming in it's always the liberals\nAnd Democrats that shut off the lines of cute communication when it comes to personal relationships that's well that's the observation and then also you had a caller who was touting that she was highly educated yeah she was highly educated but she was not\nHighly indoctrinated that was the problem with liberal friends and then also when this country was founded almost two hundred and fifty years ago it was founded with the premise\nIn the power of the individual not the state and isn't it funny how the left can sit there in town for individual liberties but they don't like the founding of the country\nWhich specifically states that we have powers are as individuals and not not the state over us as individuals but they are fighting for their own demise\nWhen they fight against the founding of this country\nBoy you said that very very well and I by the way I don't I don't believe that the left believes in individual rights in this so far out there than you know they claim they're against fascism is example within ... fascist themselves\nThey even when it's convenient there on the side of individual liberty but don't mistake that these people care about and what does this group think what does that group think\nOr they want more power for the federal government whereas we thinking as you said we want limited government and the government to stay out of our lives\nSo I I don't think that's who they are although they pretend right to pretend to be a little guy and\nThey they care about my minorities and they cared about the basically for no they did they just care about getting in power and most of them many of them are really far left for the old Democrats that you could count on to be moderate the scoop Jackson's of the world\nOf course John Kennedy a lot of people say when the tax cut that he gave he'd be Republican today\nThe Democratic party that I as a kid supportive and someone said one of our caller said then they left me um they're not the same party they
