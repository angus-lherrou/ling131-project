K. C. Lincoln him get X linking him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator for Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nAnd the Carolinas have got a pretty good chance of of multiple tornadoes associated with this and and you know anyone in this entire area of the Big Bend and the panhandle\nUh are are going to basically relate to a cake which happened to be in Nineteen eighty five but this is going to blow Kate out all the water\nTom in terms of the the the danger coming ashore because I think a lot of people may be who are looking at you know the I coming ashore but I mean the where the danger and the potentially\nLife threatening situation start what is that timeline where is that window and and what should we expect during that time line\nOkay when it comes to the timeline on what you should expect 'em by tomorrow morning it's still should be offshore\nAnd it will be ... bill a category three but\nDarn close to a category for it I wouldn't be shocked if in the next ... in a in one hour from now I may be upgraded but by Wednesday evening it should be on shore\nAnd so that would be in line with Tallahassee it would be coming across Tallahassee bites Thursday evening it shouldn't be\nEntering the Carolina and cutting right across the middle of the Carolinas and so the eastern side of it will be the onshore winds and the rain and the storms so Charlotte and end up the coast and and they don't need any more\nUh destruction or anything now wins are going to be around forty five miles an hour or when it gets to the Carolinas and that's going to be Thursday morning but on Wednesday today or we're gonna have wins in Tallahassee tonight of at least eighty miles an hour\nAnd a and a probably sustained winds up to forty or fifty miles an hour going through Tallahassee um we're looking at wins that are going to be up to a hundred miles an hour or when we get to\nA coming onshore and the storm surges the other really bad situation [noise] ah from pretty much\nI don't want to include Panama City Panama City\nSix to nine foot storm surge\nAnd that's in part because their shoreline faces a little more to the southwest and so uh when it comes in if it comes in to the east the winds are going to be backing so it will reduce that effect\nBut you get past that to saint Joe which is on the peninsula they're swinging around part Appalachia cola ah we're looking at a storm surge that\nWill run all the way around through the entire big band that doesn't include cedar key um\nOf nine to Thirteen feet\nWow yeah nine to Thirteen feet um obviously once your past three feet cars float\nAnd yeah and and and so we're talking about a ... again in terms of that immediate threat really the greatest threat right now in those areas along the shoreline we're talking storm surge correct\nI the storm surges is clearly from the you know there's a storm surge warning in effect from Panama City past crystal river and and so as an example um we're looking at Panama City\nTonight they'll start seeing wins moving their way up to fifty miles an hour and all the way through an average of fifty miles an hour through Wednesday night\nThey are going to have guns ... Wednesday night or as this storm has come ashore of a hundred miles an hour and a storm surge of eight to twelve feet or excuse me rain I'm Sorry of eight to twelve inches a foot of rain and\nSo it inland and even on the coast flash flooding is going to be a common event and\nThat range got to go somewhere and uh and once you start to inundate the water starts to rise under a storm surge um\nThen from there then you start dealing with you know the rain on top of that and so we saw that in New Bern a newborn uh on friday night before the storm came in and the Carolinas the winds were coming out of the southeast and blowing up the Neuse River\nNew Bern is at the end of the Neuse River and they had a water rise of ten point two feet\nAnd and we had the um we had a a lieutenant I'm dropping his name but the lieutenant of the police department there the following day talking about\nWhen they're Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai he a Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition that flood forward and he's written a generic ends it that's right over two hundred free on cars all all models and incredible prices logged on to flood Otto John John now\nOut saying but but certainly we want to repeat it as often as possible the people that are are in the path of this storm need heat all of the directors and warnings given by local officials do not hesitate\nA that this is this is going to be a a life threatening storm it is already a life threatening storm and it is right now you have time to get out of the way of the storm\nA Tom ... in terms of uh the the rainfall you mentioned a that we're going to see in some places maybe eight to twelve inches of rain um the flooding potential though won't necessarily be like it was because of Florence because of the storm is moving faster is that correct\nYeah to some degree that's correct but still I expect many areas to pick up anywhere from eight to twelve inches as we move inland through Tallahassee and then from there when we move across the border into Georgia we're still going to be looking at five inches of rain or more in many areas so I can\nPull up some maps and break that out um next time we talk about early the fact of the matter is that it only takes you know it doesn't take a lot of water if the ground saturated for run off to start flash flooding right\nAnd we all know the usual places where flash flooding takes place ... well the difference here is that this storm liked the Carolinas along the coast are going to cause flooding in the places that are not the usual places and\nYeah All right and I ... and when when you expected to onshore\nI expect onshore between three and four o'clock okay uh this afternoon fair alright\nAlright media Ronald just Tom hale you're going to be with us throughout the morning thank you Tom tom and they don't have standing covered for us\nAs he mentioned with Hurricane Florence a and also uh last year with a Hurricane

latest report that basically the cone yeah\n... and you look look at what Tom was saying and he's expecting a that this could be they could upgrade the storm to\nA category for hurricane\nAh with this

this storm\nAs soon as possible uh get inland go somewhere where you will be safe and where you are with others especially if you have an underlying medical condition or anything else that might warrant a that kind of a of a need so\nUh we'll see here a little while we're going to talk with meteorology if a John trout or get caught up on this latest up\nWonder Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai he a Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in pristine free own condition at Ford and he's written a generic ... that's right over two hundred free on cars all all models and incredible prices flood onto flood Otto John John now\nOf the the latest uh in the Indiana Senate brown versus a Donnelly a Donnelly not vote for a Kavanaugh\nAnd the Donald he was up by a by three at the end of August the Fox news poll nine twenty nine to tend to has Donnelly up by two well within the margin of error three point to a five percent or are they now they have there are three of a different candidates are in this race including the libertarian\nYeah so uh but right now it's forty three forty one or a you know Donnelly with the lead but uh again excuse me yes Donnelly with the the lead the Democrats in there but then again that really you look at that that is another a dead heat that exist out there and then we go to Missouri\nAnd uh the uh latest Fox News poll nine twenty nine to tend to and that is a dead tied now that is before the actual vote took place\nAnd before calling speech and everything else so that's the kind of thing that we're looking for the polls coming out ah maybe here in the next couple of days or early next week and as we get closer to see the effect of that has had there there are a ton of these races that are\nA statistical tie with even in a statistical tie Democrats maybe up a point or two and a and so this is something that I'm sure as being very carefully watched and again when you go into and we're not pollsters you know we're not pollsters we can read them but I mean the methodology\nOf of each and every poll has different nuances and it it all depends on you know what the sample is do they interview more Democrats than actually are in a you know that normally vote in a particular race or not or did they over sample Republicans\nFight and and so you look at it but overall when you look at at the the generalized polls are a ton of the Senate races\nThat are extremely close and so\nA lot of eyes are watching to see okay what's the excitement level going to be the voter excitement level\nOut of the cabinet hearing which I Do believe will have an impact sure\nYeah and so there's are we are right now looking at some of the the the Senate races up\nUh you you look at the the race with Rick Scott it's interesting dynamic and and and frankly hurricane Michael a and how it's handled will be part of that discussion and campaigning\nOn both sides uh uh you know for the next few weeks um it it may seem like an unfortunate situation to many but that's that's how politics runs in the ... the United states and it may it can make or break a candidate depending on how it's handled and while you know a senator or isn't going to have\nA control if he were to become a senator or over what's going on in that state necessarily um ... like a governor ... during an emergency situation\nHow he handles it will be closely watched over the next few days because it's going to be it's going to be a very politically sensitive situation I'm sure a many from his capital tell you well we're not focused on that right now nor should they be\nBut people outside that a camp car focused on that and we'll\nBe alert the reality is that if\nFlorence wasn't handled properly by the Trump Administration Democrats would be using ... yes and and you end up being that is used in political races yes and and as you and I've talked about from the very beginning and I watched a lot more\nOf the of of Florence a coming and then I have so far of of this particular race\nBut when you watch on the weather channel you came across with a great opinion of the federal government and how they were how they were handling it yes it'll be interesting to see if the same thing happens you know here because it will be used yes no doubt eight six six Ninety ...\nTips from Jay Jay Keller and associates incorporated on customer service does your motor

miles an hour with higher just possible as Michael becomes a category for hurricane Michael\nExtremely dangerous life threatening\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explains it light up of Lincoln him Casey Lincoln him get X linking him Casey and the only twenty eight Lincoln Navigator ... have never against it unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nWas quite a devastating storm a and at that point you have to say to yourself well if you haven't been around for Kate you know what other things have come by well ah there's been very few October storms to begin with I'm\nThis storm is an October storm math he was an October storm and there was a a failure but a Celia was a major all these are major storms but Ophelia was offshore and so it didn't have that kind of a an effect on Florida and so right now\nIf you're listening or if you have family and friends along that area you need to understand that that\nOn Wednesday evening one hundred mile an hour gusts are going to be common and that's after it's come onshore um tomorrow evening because we're expecting a still a landfall sometime around three to four o'clock and that means that it'll speed up a little bit before it comes to shore yeah\nWhen they're Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition at what board and he's really Janeiro or against it that's right over two hundred three on cars homemade all models had incredible prices love onto flood Otto John John now\nIn the storm surge here the water that comes along with a storm like\nThis are being a potentially life threatening in fact that his life threatening and is often deadly um and and that is something to\nBe aware of it is not just the strength of the storm in terms of wins but also the water that it's going to deliver a both and storm surge and rainfall\nWell yeah you know remember that the ... in in the past it used to be lightning lightning was like the number one whether killer and you know why lightning isn't the number one whether killer ...\nBecause we convinced everybody [laughter] and I have to go out and the lightning and right right [laughter] okay yeah indoors it's lightning right but you know we've done a really lousy job at convincing people to use commonsense when they're on the road and they're driving\nAnd and we had over thirty people in the Carolinas\nDrowned because they decided they were going to be tougher and they knew what they were doing better than the people who are telling them to stay off the road right now and and\nAnd and so yeah a a storm surge is usually felt along the coast\nAnd let's say maybe five to ten miles inland wherever there's a waterway that that water from\nThe Gulf of Mexico can move its way and and so whether you're an Appalachian cola or you are in Panama City or you're swinging around uh uh toward the coastline just south of Perry and the big band\nThat you're looking at a storm surge that's going to be easily nine feet ...\nCould be less right can be up to nine feet or even Thirteen actually the weather service has got a plot at nine to Thirteen feet in that area\nSome for those of us who have never witnessed that first and I just described the dynamics of a storm surge especially one with the potential of a nine to twelve feet or more as you mention\nThat because you know we've seen the recent video from the Saddam me in Indonesia and we know so we can see that kind of force in terms of a storm surge I mean one of the dynamics of that what I describe that to us what takes place during the storm yeah because I'm\nLooking here I'm looking here like it at Panama City beach for example that's you know uh you're right there I mean there's no there's no barrier it's not one of the bays it's right there what is what is the fact how far I mean that goes in a pretty long way doesn't it\nOh yeah yeah when you go into the west bank or the East Bay um all the way up through um what they called dear point lake\nWhich is is it's really an extension the northern extension of the north bay a or the grand lagoon\nThis entire area from the from the lower ... which is which is basically where the beach is uh the the bridge that goes over to the over to the beach right I'm\nAn inland all of that water rises\nUniformly pretty much and it's kind of like turning the water on it's not like what you see in the ... like salami it's turning the water on and watching your bathtub Phil and except in this particular case as the storm gets closer in the last uh\nHour and a half to two hours or so\nThe bath tub still and so in the Carolinas the the I I don't know if it was the record but it started close to it ... North Carolina uh picked up a storm surge a that was at least ten feet\nI'm there may have been a higher storm surge a further around the point I'm at that sticks out there if the Carolinas um but\nThis water just keeps rising and and as it starts to rise three feet six feet and so forth you need to be able to get to a place\nThat's higher than the storm surge and that is really simple as it gets and this water is moving\nAnd and so the water has motion it can erode stuff um and when I say it's moving it it's it's\nNormal current and it's moving because it's also got winds blowing it at a good speed\nAnd so you've got a certain amount of ah it's not going to be moving as fast as the wind because the surface tension the water's going to slow that body down but it's still moving so I the the place that I recall and I I drove through this area a couple of times [noise] um because it's just a beauty\n... group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than any dealer around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers on time\nUm then you notice is you're looking off along the water all these nice homes but they're on stilts and they're they're all stilted easily at about ten feet [noise] um well Thirteen feet which still inundate those homes wow\nYeah that's that's that you know that that puts it in perspective for anyone who's gone to a beach and seen these houses in fact we stayed in one ah in in in Texas and the and the guy was scenario over the summer and we've done that many times but if you've ever been to these are areas and you've seen these houses on these stilts\nUh you're right those the typically there are about ten feet high but add another three feet to that potentially and that means even on still you're going to see destruction and flooding of those homes and that is very very powerful and and sobering frankly\nWell you've heard the terms high profile vehicles right okay well this is a house that's a high profile house and once you get past the stilts now you've got three feet of water going into a more solid structured and so that's going to be a lot easier to topple and destroy yeah\nSure and wildlife got great point of the higher center of gravity yes I Am that situation which becomes a very destructive very easily um ... and so again a the timelines you were looking for the eye to come ashore sometime in the afternoon\nYes and and and right now it depends if it if it goes the speed that it's going right now and makes a nice even turn and doesn't increase speed when it makes the turn a little bit to the north northeast uh it wouldn't get there 'til six thirty eastern time\nUm but if it picks up some speed or even a couple of miles an hour goes from twelve to fourteen and so forth or we could anticipate the same coming out a little bit earlier than that around four o'clock and that's kind of what everybody's betting on right now\nThey're getting rain right now ... has just had the light and rain and in fact all of this is very light rain tropical rain starts off this little find drops in than increases from there [noise] um\nThere's a couple of little thunder storms that are running anywhere from Appalachian coal up to Pensacola Beach so this is the eye opener hey notice it's raining idiot real it's coming your way\nRight how far inland can we can we expect those hurricane force winds anything from Seventy five miles an hour and above a two to sustain a how far inland in and how long do you expect that to be the case\nAll right let's assume that it it comes ashore and we'll just simply call it where it is right now for all right forty five miles inland ... is what you would be looking at her\nAnd forty five miles inland would make those wins go to Panama City at least and possibly a little further out and it would take those winds back over to\nProbably not to Perry but at least to St Mark's ... National Wildlife refuge area which is to the chest south or just slightly south east to Tallahassee but\nNow remember this this right now the location is a hundred and eighty miles to the south south west of\nPanama City or a hundred and Seventy miles okay southwest of Appalachia cola hurt a tropical storm force winds thirty nine miles an hour and more ... are extending out right now as we speak a hundred and Seventy five miles\nAll right so so they're starting to feel the beginning of those thirty nine mile an hour winds at the extremities Appalachian coal uh and\nAnd possibly you know and then an hour or two by morning for sure when the sun comes up they'll be feeling the thirty nine miles forty mile an hour winds aren't even then it may still be possible for you to get inland\n... group wants your car any make any model flood pays more than anything around because we're a certified buying center at will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers I tell\nYou who watch me and my co host Jessica Rose as we bring you the only weekly news show green and just joined us for all the breaking news affecting the trucking industry along with are awesome regularly profile than record dot com is the one stop you're not going to want to have\nThem busy travel down the highway so tune in every week and watch the trucker news channel by going to the record dot com [noise]\nAnd we should be from the New England trucks solutions to the top of him and I am six thirty WPRI ... stations\nHurricane danger replacing Haley I'm Elliot Francis hurricane Michael has intensified to a category ... storm forecasters say the system is expected to produce life threatening storm surge of up to Thirteen feet what makes landfall later today you know we're all just ...\nAre already seeing the outer banks of Michael push the shore right now so strong thunderstorms reported around Panama City will begin to see some of those tropical storm force winds with this as well and that of course going in from nine eventually it's a new and eventually for three PM\nThen we talk about hurricane force winds and then category for force where they're coming ashore with one hundred thirty miles per hour sustained gusts as much as a hundred and fifty five miles per\nHour Turkish newspapers published the names and photographs of Fifteen Saudi nationals well allegedly around an is stumble on board to private jets the date journalist ... went missing\nTurkish officials say the reporter and government critic was killed inside his country's consulate in Istanbul after he visited the mission to obtain a document record the memory of Turkish fiance Saudi Arabia has denied the allegations\nOne to the UN ambassador Nikki Haley unexpectedly you said it's time to move on what customs teeny ...\nGoing to be plenty of speculation about one of the news came out now even is Nikki Haley is willing to ride out the ear at her un post she would be feeling pressure for national security adviser John Bolton who is decidedly anti United Nations for Haley the international flight may have taken a toll\nI Want to make sure that has the phone from\nIt was a blessing to lengthen the land with fire\nEvery day and defend America\nIncluding the expected departure of attorney general Jeff Sessions and other cabinet members Mr Trump now has a new job opening\nWe have a number of people that were very much like to do is ... ... the white\nHouse here is is adding a restructuring expert towards board suggesting that the retailer may be preparing to take drastic actions quitting filing for bankruptcy this week\nDoes your basement or crawl space of a damp must be smell will watch out that's a sign of too much moisture and not enough ventilation\nAnd that could mean increased mold growth and build up of harmful toxins in gases don't bother with a D humidifier if just circulates the same on health a year now\nThere's a better way to remove these dangers in odors it's with the computerized wave ventilation unit that reduces moisture and expelled pollutants\nWith wave units there are new buckets of water or filters and they cost only pennies a day to run wave can transform your home into a drier healthier environment satisfaction guaranteed\nAsk about our indoor air package that includes the wave ventilation unit plus a six stage portable air purifier dealer opportunities available for more information visit dry house now dot com that's dry house now dot com or coal eight eight eight nine seven nine wave that eight eight eight nine seven nine W.

that comes with it I mean if you look at the the the wins a that will be a danger to two people and take out power lines no doubt\nBut the storm surge anywhere between nine and twelve feet or

know chugging along at a pretty good pace right now\nThan sometimes that again it it only slows down or slows down temporarily a but doesn't really a handwritten much but we'll see uh where where they are they were typically in the season where a lot of you know\nA home buying is not done because families especially I don't want to change uh schools are right here in the heart of the school year so

you've got a great job if you if you believe you got job security and good pay\nA you know for example looking at the two year treasury bills because when I see the interest rates going up on that that means the interest rates going up on the debt two year treasury bills land you're one point for nine percent now to point they doubled their right oh yeah\nYeah that's going to mean a lot of very bad things in the future because the fact that we we quit a caring I Know our our listeners and conservative friends still care about the debt and the fiscal policy of the U.S\nBut the the people in Washington don't be caused by and large\nTheir team of four meteorologist or are in their weather center and uh they're getting ready to start their wall to wall coverage and they are twenty feet

generator or work in the station is fortified sufficient enough to handle this and we won't know that until a later this afternoon right\nUm but obviously I tomorrow if we talk um maybe we'll see if we can get a phone call into them ... a month\nAfter it has passed by right um but I I think our prayers need to be with all the people who are up and down that coastline that are there because they realize that\nEven though the majority of people have evacuated out of a given area that there are still some people behind and while they're not going to be able to go out and do anything once the winds up over forty miles an hour and they become tropical storm wins um\nBut that being said even though they're not going to be able to do anything when it's over with they're going to be in there in force I Know\nAre surrounding a Panama City they've got I think six hundred staged power company people were going to swarm in there the governor of Florida\nHas called out I think it's fourteen hundred a National Guards uh guardsmen or guards folks ah [laughter]\nAnd uh the same is true 'em up and down the up and down the coast three states of of basically a declared a you know a a disaster urgency\nRight let let me let me just ask you this big because you did or you had predicted a before the last ah advisory that showed it went to a category of for you predict the would go up a couple of ...\nOf a of a more miles per hour from a hundred and twenty five hundred and thirty and you hit it right you expected to get any stronger or do seed weakening as it gets closer to shore\nAh no I don't see a weakening as gets closer to shore in this particular case um the the water hasn't been touched\nSo we're looking at eighty five degree average water temperature um the other thing that's going on is that\nUnlike a lot of these storms where we've got a cold front that might come in from the continental United States bringing in a little bit drier air there is a cold front out there but it's it's moving through the Dallas area right now it's it's nowhere near\nThis and so [noise] uh in in terms of what we know in the United states and and then the Midwest and so forth we call it the warm sector that's the area head of the cold front\n... that warm sector is a couple of hundred miles long and they're in the heart of that warm sector they have all the fuel all the moisture and in the heat and heat in the water that's necessary so it won't it won't die down\nOr whatever it gains it will carry to shore and then once it hits the friction of the shore then it will start to degenerate a little bit so Tallahassee could be seeing routine I'm\nEighty two maybe a little more than that mile an hour gusts with sustained winds of fifty miles an hour while Appalachia cola and Panama City beach will have one hundred plus mile an hour winds as it's coming ashore\nOr this afternoon and and and they'll have periods where those guys drop off to Seventy five miles an hour ...\n... as so yeah this is this is a fascinating point um\nYou you may not realize that savannah you know is way out on the on the coast here or north Brunswick in ... in Georgia coming out of Atlanta on sixteen uh savannah\nBecause of the wind field is going to have wins that are being gusting up to twenty five miles an hour with some isolated Gus tomorrow night up to fifty miles an hour\nAnd the entire coast from the Georgia toast up through the south Carolina and North Carolina coast um all of that area um potentially is far up as Morehead City um is going to feel the force of ...\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than any dealer around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers on top\nThe making and eventually comes up across Florence\nYeah ... yeah and we're looking at I'm looking at the map right here and and a tropical storm warnings for all the Georgia coast and looks like about three quarters of the south Carolina coast and the rest of it as a tropical storm watch as you get it by South Carolina all the way through North Carolina almost all the way up to Virginia\nExactly exactly and I didn't even mentioned Virginia but yeah it goes that far north and uh and so we can expect forty plus mile an hour forty five mile an hour winds all the way up that entire stretch on shore wins because this is a this would be a a nor'easter that\nThe Windsor gonna bring onshore flow and it's still relatively warm along there and whatever rain has dropped and rainfall figures for that particular area a are still pretty significant and I'm\nI'm we're looking at the Florida Panhandle 'em and mid Atlantic and all the way up to New England one to three inches of rain and as for the Carolinas southern Virginia Georgia three to six inches of rain with isolated amounts of eight inch rains\nWow wow uh and\nAnd that causes life threatening flash flooding\nYes yes and as people often do not heed the warnings or ignore\nHigh water areas and believe that they can get through those areas that's where it becomes deadly\nYeah let me give you another one of those little analogy is like the bath tub analogy I gave you earlier right um you go to the grocery store and there's a gallon of water you pick it up and go oh this is kind of heavy but it's cool well that gallon of water weighs about seven pounds ...\nOK Now let's take a thousand gallons of water per minute rolling over a road which is not an unreasonable right amount of water going across something\nEven if we brought that down and have we're we're still looking at you know thousands of pounds two three four thousand pounds it will be as if a\nA ... ton pickup truck we're at Rhodes level pounding on the road back and forth just kind of bulldozing it and so forth how do you know that there's a road under their\nYeah grade point great point what often there are\nSix the salt water six its own level so it's going to look nice and flat and smoothing all across it it's probably not going to be you know perfectly clear so you are not going to be able to see what's under it\nAnd and so just imagine all those containers of what gallons of water on a giant entire Iowa the grocery store rolling across continuously every minute across the road what are the odds is going to tear up that road and you think you're just being tired enough to make it through\nRight and and the fact that it doesn't uh it relatively speaking it doesn't take a high water or in order to move a vehicle I mean it it has that forces unit six inches right\nSo you're talking about uh you know again all these all these threats that people cannot assessed possibly assessed properly or in that situation and again he those warnings are there's absolutely no reason\nTo go through a high water or a a low area that has high water in these situations and heed the warnings of those local and state officials in the ... that are there in Florida and those other states that will be dealing with Michael over the next twenty four thirty six forty eight hours\nI hear as we continue our conversation with a time hill will do that next hour meteorologist Tom hills been on a with us before covering a Hurricane Florence most recently and also Hurricane Irma for us as well you're on red eye radio greatly
