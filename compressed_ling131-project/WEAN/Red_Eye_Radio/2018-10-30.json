yeah\n\nThinking about it but those are the ones that are trying to make that point are the ones without the most out right just accusations against their opponents the ultimate being that an incoming president colluded with the Russians to hack\nThe election mhm and they hounded that year in and year out\nYou know it's ah when when you look at it and we just to you know talked about you know the

that's good news though for Republicans facing election with voters said Trump and the economy are the big issues the latest rash for some reports\nNational television and online survey finds at fifty one percent of likely us voters give the president good or excellent marks for handling the economy thirty three percent still write his performance in this area as poor\nTrump's economic positive to continue to rise from thirty nine percent in August of last year\nNow to a a fifty one percent forty nine percent gave his economic ... gave his economic ... a performance good or excellent marks for

on the Rasmussen poll predictably eighty eight percent of Republicans think Trump is doing a good or excellent job of handling the economy but only Nineteen percent of Democrats agree well eighty percent of the GOP voters give positive remarks the president\nAnd his handling of foreign policy Seventy seven percent of the Democrats say he is doing a poor job\nAmong voters not affiliated with either major party fifty one percent said Trump is doing a good or excellent job\nOn the economy but only forty three percent feel that way on a foreign policy the older the voter the more strongly they approve\nOf the president's job performance when it comes to both the economy and foreign policy while black unemployment is at a historic low blacks are much more critical of the president's economic performance than whites and other minority voters blacks are similarly unimpressed by the handling of his foreign policy\nEconomic and consumer confidence already is at near record highs is moving up again in the latest Rasmussen consumer spending update now that's interesting to say that when it comes to economic things because I saw Rasmussen uh that uh he released just a few hours ago the president's latest job approval rating\nAnd here's what he writes Trump approvals today back at fifty percent black voter approval at record high\nWell\nSo we're talking about the economic can inform but overall they say Trump's black approval right now I'm at a record high\nYeah well and and I I think right now you're seeing again everyday people this this is the question as it is with every election what is what is what are the American people thinking right but but but really we're not talking about real things we're not talking about I mean\nIn part on the positive side as the last caller pointed out\nYou know he focuses on the winning which which I I Would assume we didn't get to ask them but I Would assume it would include the economy things that are going on the positive things that are going on with the economy but but really it's it's not about that what drives the election right now if you think about it\nBecause there were conservatives before Kavanaugh\nThere were conservatives that clearly recognized the positives and the economy but they're still never truckers there's still right now maybe going to sit on the sidelines for a while\nI ... a number of them can't quantify it but let's just I think it's safe to say there were a number of that right so there's that\nThat part of the Republican Party that after Kavanaugh looked at it and said I'm OK the game has changed\nNow it really is about building this wall around the constitution as I've been saying it is about protecting the things that are very real and we can have our in house\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln and Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator flood Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nAll of that can be discussed internally no problem we can have those very real debates on very real issues with no issues going forward because right now\nThe the the game has to be the end game must be protecting the constitution because the process is being with all it was it was all but shredded in terms of the confirmation process uh Brett Kavanaugh\nOr they were given way too much leeway but guess what ultimately it works\nI think to the benefit I don't know if it will actually show that in the house of if it will mean a win for the Republicans in the house but it showed enough to bring the Republican Party together like I've never seen it\nIn a one thing I just want to bring up here 'cause we're talking about the different uh you know challenges out there you're talking about you know never Trump or ... whatever you know maybe staying at home and I was thinking of a local story here you heard that the Dallas Morning news indoors a better or ... and they claim you know you hear the conservative\nThe conservative Dallas Morning news or conservative Dallas Morning news with the conservative Dallas Morning news yeah there's no way that you can be a conservative and support it or not or Ted Cruz no no you're not a conservative and I started thinking when I saw that story to begin with\nHow many think about this in the media there seems to be what Jennifer Rubin for example I'm a Republican conservative no you're not\nShe's not a Republican conservative she's she's a liberal or a Max Boot who is the the ... you could talk to former conservative columnist to see the picture of him with Stormy Daniels and the other day\nLike it's like wait a minute [laughter]\nYeah nice conserve your Stormy Daniels and he posted a picture of him with Stormy Daniels like proudly on on uh on on a a a Twitter ... which is like the most bizarre thing in the world and and you look at other you know you look at a a a um a Bill Kristol mhm ah who just has lost it you see John Case it\nOr who just you know completely have shown that they're not conservatives but you've got in in the media you have a a lot of different people who are claiming that there are conservatives and they're speaking for the conservative movement but they're not conservatives anymore and I don't mean because they're not supporting Trump\nOr I'm Talking about there any allergy has actually changed who they support actually changes mhm you can sit there and say maybe I don't like Donald or I don't like a a Donald Trump but I don't like the fact that Cruz now is with Donald Trump and so I'm not going to vote for it to say you're voting for ... because\nBecause the ... the Ted Cruz in conservativism has failed you is the most bizarre thing on the planet you could possibly say it makes no critical thinking sense at all you're not a conservative why\nBecause as a conservative ... what is the most important thing and let's go to the late Andrew Breitbart who before he died was on our show and we asked him you know why should people vote for Romney back in twenty twelve mhm Supreme Court\n\nYou know if Trump was done if Trump was done today I'd be happy\nI was I said that to a friend over the weekend or because they were like okay but but but the work's not even he's not able to get work done because when I said no he's he's got a lot and I said but but imagine even the tax cuts didn't get done\nI'd like to imagine that 'cause now I'm paying more in taxes let me let me met [laughter] my mom would you please [laughter] um [laughter]\nBut imagine that the you know there were a number of things and and imagine even that the economy more weren't growing as as fast\nA ... and the guys will be happy ... there are a number of things here and again we don't it's not the we never share the endgame you when I entered the race is never finished because there are so many things to do\nBut it's what we're looking at right now\nGorsuch and Cavanaugh\nI I can I can sleep go back I couldn't sleep at night\nWhile I can sleep during the day well I don't usually sleep but I'll go back to march or twenty sixteen them a

that I find fascinating is that you know the the the the call for unity in the end of of divisiveness\nWhich of course you're never going to have in politics or you know the the president has been criticized you know that uh well he uh after you know the the uh mail bomb scare and the uh the temple mass murders\nThat you know he went on to you know continue with you know what politicians do which is coming up to the terms you go after you know your your political opponents\nAnd you go after them and the call I just was laughing yesterday that the media was talking about the fact that you know the president still device if he goes after his political opponents or we need unity\nEvery president calls for unity zero presidents presidents get\nUnity do I have to go any further it's it\nNever happens every president calls for unity every person calls for unity and then they go out and they do what\nThey express what they believe and they're roughly half the people agree and half the people disagree as soon as you have an opinion you have created a divisive atmosphere how stupid are we\n\nHow stupid is the media\nRather not stupid there they believe that it gets to their advantage but every politician calls for unity and as soon as you open your mouth and say here's what I'm going to do a significant portion of the population\nDisagrees with you it is impossible for a politician to create unity in a country\nCan we move on now\nAre we gonna or we're going to continue living as fairy tale world well the president should promote pop policies on that bring everybody

Paul Ryan at the beginning of this year we talked about and twenty sixteen all of the we're going to do away with was Obamacare we're going to do away with Obamacare we will\nDo away with Obamacare and then by the time they got there the sentiment by the rank and file a changed and it was like okay well we'll do away with the some of the Obama Care\nAnd then they finally got to\nThe individual mandate which of course than a undid the funding mechanism\nAnd then forced them eventually will force them to pay for it in another way premiums going up all of the ... which is exactly what we're seeing and we we talked about that disconnect between twenty sixteen\nAnd the end of last year\nNow you have this this whole new cycle and and whole new opportunity to essentially launch the new plan based on what you know about the public sentiment and they do know what then\nWhy wouldn't you do that to say if you give us if if if if we are in charge this is what we want to do and go at a point by point as Newt Gingrich did\nAnd and it should have been it should've been Ryan and the president yeah this is what we're going to do look it isn't done yet and you promote the daylights out of it get by\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the here for only one Ninety nine process will say hello to forge twenty Eighteen Ford F. one fifty so desperate for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at flood forward and he went into the Narragansett\nThe sediment by the American people is is shifting on health care and this uh this is where the sentiment of the American people is right now this is what they're telling us this is what they want this is the plan we believe will work\nYou don't necessarily have to go back and apologize for not getting it done because the American people don't care that you didn't get it done but what you do have to do what you are charged with now is because you know you break if you pay for it\nWhat you're going to have to do now is put together a plan a very realistic plan and put it in front of the American people but that's that's not happening I mean Newt Gingrich is one thing the party didn't have well any desire to do\nThe Newt Gingrich wrote it because you saw this was a failure of the Republican I and we said this by the way and we got criticism we got criticism we got criticism when we sat there not repealing Obamacare I stop saying that we ... we got criticism and guess what we were right they weren't repealing Obamacare but they were just they were what were they were doing was ... what\nThe mandate but the actual benefit state which means somebody has to pay for it which was taxpayer money through the back and an increase in premiums but you didn't solve any of the problems right\nAnd so you should have focused on solving the problems immediately they should have been the president and and and this is why we have said\nThat we know that people loved the rhetoric but it's about the winning and it's about getting things\nIt's about getting things done more to the way that we wish to get things done so we don't end up with a Medicare for all so we don't have a monopoly running our health care system of government monopoly running our healthcare system\nAnd this is what the Republicans were supposed to be fighting for\nAnd they did not do this they did not do it and we criticized President Trump from the very beginning for not taking a stand on repealing Obamacare but just saying well just send me whatever and I'll sign right\nBecause the president has shown that when he sticks by something\nLike the corporate and individual tax cuts\nAnd he keeps promoting it any keep fighting you know a lot of people have been told us the last couple of weeks the with the like about the president that he's fight fight fight fight fight fight fight the fight has to be more than just rhetorical mhm you've got to take the hardy shoes\nAnd one of the hardest issues out there is health care\nWell and and I I've heard the point made by pundits that well you know there are things that ... that he clearly understands that are within his wheelhouse like taxes because he's a businessman but you can\nNot that you want to oversimplify healthcare but one of the main concerns\nThe number one thing that this president did his candidate was to what we do have knowledge well acknowledged the problem right I mean overall yeah but I Do but\nThat's one of the problems deregulation uh no uh Donald you what the problem is with health care regulations part of the ... well yes regulation is the is the problem you have the\nRight now the burden on employers and hospitals\nThat's the problem you have I mean how many different items but you don't even have to get that involved\nThis president easily could point at it and say there are too many the cost of health care going up as a result of I don't know an aging society or something like that is one thing that's not something the government is necessarily going to be able to Kirk\nWhat they can do is get in front of the regulation and that regulation right now is choking in hospitals it's choking employers and as a result who was it that pays\nThe American people in premiums and so\nYou ... and ... and ... and and when he got out and in payments to the insurance\nCompany ... and and and the the president pointing that out house that's not too difficult\nYou know I I've seen those pundits make that case before that well that really wasn't than his wheel house so he was leaving that up to other people know recognizing the the unnecessary skyrocketing costs of health care is well within this will happen\nUntil unless in his mind he believes in Medicare for\nAll right well and then that case she's going to have to start talking about it yeah 'cause otherwise you're not going to get anything done\nIf that's what you thought then you should have\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nIf they lose the house that's one of the reasons oh yeah no doubt it because they ... they said okay let's just ignore hell let's pretend we got rid of Obamacare when we really did mhm is that was to cry and then the president finally got to admit that will no we did\nGet rid of all the bomb and care but I mean but that's ... by the way that's part of the the ... you know you're not talking about people not wanting bait that's part of the problem that we have with the right ... we should look he didn't get rid of Obamacare yes I just you know we didn't know and people would argue with this why because they just wanted to believe what they wanted to believe in the facts didn't matter in that\nBecause the heavy costs is coming from the regulation that are still in place the hospitals and employers\nBanned by what you know those those policies and plans have to cover and who pays that we do\nWe're still paying the cost yeah H and we consider to matter what age six six Ninety right I [noise]\nEight six six months she wrote a song written [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city":
