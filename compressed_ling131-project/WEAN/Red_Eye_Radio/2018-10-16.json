a commander in chief was doing with I'm moving the embassy to Jerusalem are recognizing conservative values of a nation of laws with one of the build the wall and all that despite of his personal shortcomings\nI think a lot of times we can see with the ah the recent\nInterview that he did when he was asked a lot of those hard questions along with the first lady\nThat we can overlook a lot of these things despite his personal shortcomings of infidelity and such like that he still is fighting for these conservative values appointing these Supreme Court justice is like you were a note in about a or such a\nCabin all what is something that uh you would think would be\nSomething that would be condemnation let's say a and twenty twenty the next election if something came out\nYou know fighting against someone like Hillary Clinton in the last election with a you know her her personal server and breaking that sort of a security law in that regard being part of the deep state having

the racial relations and in our country back fifty years\nI I don't know the number of years uh Pete but I agree with you totally I mean saying if I had a son the Trayvon Martin whenever he looked like me are always assuming that you know that and what was the guy's name in the other state I can you know hands up don't shoot all of a sudden that there has to be believed\nYeah Michael Michael and he\nSent it back and a lot of people who voted for him because he was black think hey we're going to show we're not race and so on and yet he he ... you're right it's worse now ... the animosity and this country's is worse since he was president\nAnd you know the the most disgusting part of the Michael Brown has an ... what was the simple fact that if you look back and look at the history of ... as the events happened as everything went down\nIt walked into as I recall to convene a convenience store he pushed the owner around as a store or the Senate and the store knocked the attendance down walked out with a bunch of goodies and then one on down the middle of the street looking for trouble the guy was wired for sound so\nIn some minority it only as yeah yeah I Know my hardy\nWitnesses said it was the way the police officers similar look you are right on all counts and rubber Obama what was that I don't know how many days before the election said we're going to fundamentally change this country I I I've a friend on radio who said measure if you sent your wife when we got married I'm going to fundamentally change you\nKnow it's it's it's insane and this was the guy we ... and the president\nAnd at the end of the day as far as the Ferguson is so that it didn't take\nVery a lot for them to ... to ... to respond and I'm I'm Talking about a ... odd Eric Holder and Jesse Jackson and\nAl Charlotte and it didn't take a ... was it a matter of a day or two and they ran to Ferguson to to to to to stir up the eight and discontent as usual and you know the what the amazing part of it was as they grow that Michael Brown and got into the the officers patrol car to retrieve the officers gun just showed him\nYou know you have a water\nSo so exactly but but so where so where are we as a country now the racial racial division in this country is incredible and it needs to stop\nBut they kept talking and driving home all this crap as nothing more than a damn smokescreen to make us look at the next issue that pops up and whether we like it or not the mainstream lame stream media is running this country\nAnd Pete I Want to have their nice are they said it triggered a point that I think is very good on your side the less just goes from crisis to crisis to crisis right and most of it is nothing right the the collusion with the Russians and what what do we wait two years on this stuff\nOr you name it and it's a crisis right now I don't want to get on the global warming there right now although uh it became climate change always from crisis to crisis in the world is falling apart\nBut you as you said you've got a president now who's not let him get away with is in fact my loved what he said the minority community he said what do you have to

listening will agree\nWith us I maybe it maybe I Am wrong\nI've been known to be wrong we all we're all human but the thing about it was a he ... his debate ... including Hillary smoked every one of

can make as much money as they possibly can and government mostly stays Avon very\nYou know you have a like the anti trust ... make sure uh companies don't get too big and under socialism the

you think most of your listeners understand what ... versus socialism\nAnd I really don't think a lot of I don't think many Americans really know what's also that I mean what's what got a got what

you're able to\nWell I live in Toronto and I'm a little bit of socialist society and there's ... there's the older different\nOr what was the suburbs of the United states the only difference here is

Bush called for a some kind of a new immigration bill to clean up some of the mess that Ted Kennedy left back in the sixties\nWhen you say we hadn't had any ah any immigration reform to speak out from that time and uh\nUh the Congress drag their feet in ... on on this thing until I actually after Brock Obama had already been elected but it hadn't been inaugurated in two thousand and eight\n[laughter] at the last minute in December or the lame duck Congress passed and immigration reform act\nAnd uh as it went through committee and in the weeks prior they just kept piling more and more and more garbage into this thing and George Bush signed this thing it was either eight hundred twelve hundred pages I read the entire but [noise]\n... and I read all the documentation that goes with dieting Feinstein had slipped into their section too overweight somewhere maybe uh three quarters of the way into the bill of the problem is it that we have now they've created so many of the problems that we have now\nAnd what it is is they can't just automatically send these kids back they can send their parents back up prior to the passage of this legislation a bear in mind I live uh in uh the the town where we train most of the border patrol people okay\nThe federal law enforcement training centers right here where I live so I take great interest and all this stuff oh in in the past prior to that two thousand and eight bill almost everybody who came to the border and made any kind of claim of asylum or anything like that\nThe border patrol agent on the ground than his supervisor in extreme cases the supervisor above that supervisor made the determination whether or not that person got the state it was never\nPrior to two thousand and eight issue of deportation from the federal court ... court to become involved with so George Bush signed this thing or as a lame duck leaving and you may remember George W. Bush was very soft on immigration I don't think he specifically like this legislation\nBut he felt it was better than than what they had prior to that that circle certainly accomplish many of his goals\nAre in Iraq are so many up this country tomorrow ... so that means sad uh the regulatory environment that came out of that uh all of that bill created all of this stuff that we've had since two thousand and eight\nSo for ten years we've been dealing with this I mean the only way it's probably going to get solved this for the courts to\nRecognize that not everything is for education that the ... at some point they're going to have to take the spirit of the law rather than our own individual feelings into um\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...
