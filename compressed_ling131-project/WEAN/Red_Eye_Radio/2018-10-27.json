up a bottle of us who were Christmas Party\nAnd there was ... apparently some lottery going on but I didn't even know about it because right ... that's not to to use a cliche the lotteries never even

number of of a ... and and remember ... ... ... the the the people that will be at that edge\nA aren't we're not talking the super rich weren't heartland about what is viewed in many of these high income areas and as solid Republican voters who are in the middle to upper middle class right\nAnd they're getting hit and they don't like it and what's their only recourse right now there's still a supporter of Trump but what's their records to send the message my Republican congressman mhm and we've always we worried about that from the very beginning\nI don't know how it's going to affect I'm simply bringing up the issues out there that when it comes to people's individual budget when it comes to them paying more money I don't care who you are nobody wishes to do that and even though won't change everybody's vote it has the potential of changing\nFive percent of the vote yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election so that's that's a you know that's one thing we've talked about the Democrats and we've talked about what what they face the whole cabinet thing\nI'm just the insanity that has come a out of the uh the the Democrats the ... the the the fact that they plan and this was the one thing that may bought person that is they're coming out bluntly and saying we're going to raise taxes\nSo many of them are coming out now I'm going to raise taxes not working\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in East Village and there were against that have the best financed reason they devices in cars with zero

the care of it rather than ... in the Republican Party that's one I'm yesterday auto auto dealers seat slower sales sparking fears that along expected decline is here now the economy overall\nMay not be an end and the tariffs overall may not change a significant portion of people voting in this election\nBut it will change those small business people that are being affected and\nA caterpillar a worse at the the the caterpillar story and then they're they're being blunt the terrorists are killing us write the steel and an autumn of the the steel and aluminum tariffs by the way that this isn't a China thing right\nIt's the United states and Europe and and and Mexico that they're still in effect mhm and it's killing them it's raising the price as we said\nWhen the president came out and said dare I delivered for you I gave you the I gave you the the new NAFTA or whatever you wish to call it nobody's using the new name by the way [laughter] All right\nAnd and uh the his you know and the only success that that he claimed the the biggest thing that he promoted was what he did to the automobile business and we said that's unbelievable that he's promoting the fact that he has raised the cost\nOf buying an automobile in the United states Mexico and Canada and that's viewed as a good thing\nWas a story last week about Ford grumbling going to be losing a billion dollars and they believe the tariffs are guns that are hurting them remember every supplier and every small business that deals with Ford in the United states knows that that's coming\nOr or or a feeling it already and every dealership and it reveals that remember the steel tariffs really been affected ... we're from China which has increased the cost from the beginning of the year and that's actually that's actually nine months ten months old now because the steel prices were up ... percent by the time we got\nTo June of this year so you look at that you look at the fact that automobiles are going to go up in price because of steel costs and now because of terror cost and because of the new NAFTA or and then the farmers as we mentioned in the last break\nThe farmers that are being hit and you're talking about your your talk if you're talking about\nA manufacturing people with manufacturing jobs at a technical skills\nTon of those people are Trump supporters if you talk about the farmers you're talking Trump\nCountry and you're talking about farmers that are stream Lee upset because it's not only their current profits\nBut it's the fact that they may be shut out of the supply chain that took them decades to get into and now it's disappeared you made the comment you said a in our preceding you said I Wonder if that's why he went to you know even though was wishy washy ethanol plan\nI Wonder if that's why he went to Iowa because from the internal polls were saying you're getting killed with the farmers right now yeah there was\nA couple of weeks ago because I Will would be basically the center of the corn belt but the farm belt ... it's not that everything is about the the votes in Iowa or any election in Iowa\nIt's that you're trying to reach that region when you go to Iowa you're speaking to the industry the farming industry not just a ethanol and corn but it's the farming industry uh you you want to reach out with that saying we're going to help the farmers\nAre and and you know in this region in this area in the state and I don't know what you do in terms of of ah reconnecting the supply chain this is what they're worried about or they need to have those farmers those companies\nNeed to have trade partners all around the globe and when those trade partners for instance when Mexico a set up a portrayed with with Canada\nOr any nation that they're selling to those farmers if they're going a different direction as a result of a threat of a tariff war terrified that went into place a or any of that if they have to make arrangements a lot of time a lot of time you don't get that back right away\nYou're not you're not going to get that business back right away and that's the concern that this was one of the farmers came out a couple of weeks ago and said look ah thanks but no thanks on this you know a four point seven billion dollar a handout we need the business the business is worth a lot more\nRight it's still not making up for what our last is All right and we're ... we're we're ... we're out of the loop and the supply chain now we don't know when we're going to get back in right took us deck I think one of the ... was it took us\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nDo right uncertainty as a killer this is what we saw after the recession\nThe problem with bailing out all the banks were are putting money into all the banks the coffers of all the banks by the federal government or during the recession or in two thousand and two and a two thousand a ... and into a two thousand nine day there were three apparently large banks that were on the brink that we're a\nPossible high risk but they didn't want to run on those banks so they put money into all of the coffers well limit made all the banks look\nRisky and that's the problem you create you muddy the waters well when you talk about trade trade deals between nations that are set up um you don't you don't reconnect that bridge\nIt's like blowing up a bridge and believing you could rebuild it repair it tomorrow\nYou can't\nThat's going to take a lot of planning that is going to take a lot of reassuring but if there's political uncertainty\nAnywhere in that\nThen your former customers are going to stick with someone else a another nation in this case and they're going to get their supply chain repair\nAnd our discussion right now is not really so much on the the the substance of the economics of it it's more the politics of\nWhat is going to be affecting this this ... election we talked a lot yesterday about how the Republicans in so many ways\nWere set up in a way that you don't see a political party in a midterm election with a ton of positives and de opposition political party that the Democrats are in a complete match\nAnd that there are many things because the the economy right now but the majority of Americans looks really good mhm well we're talking about is the old you know in the the impacts that starting to be felt now and making investors very where wary and a core\nConstituency of the of of Trump supporters which are the farmers that aren't happy at all now so even though there's a lot of good for Republicans right now there is still bad lurking out there\nUh when it comes to economics that there are Trump supporters that are extremely wary about where he is you know where he may be taking\nA you know the their particular economy and what's going to happen to their livelihoods so we think it's very important to bring up all the issues that may be affecting this election both positive and negative for the Democrats and positive and negative for the Republicans just to give you a more realistic\nUh I think a analysis\nTo listen on your smartphone or Bluetooth

I wouldn't mind taking it out to Eddie gossip just plays the Texas anyway and putting it on the track a couple of times but I mean what are you going to do with the money\nI'm at the point is is that I Would be so paranoid all the time with six hundred I mean instantly having six hundred million in the bank\nIt would it would a high end there would be a bit disturbed there's yeah there's nothing I'm\nI'm not saying I wouldn't want you know I [laughter] and I have a clear it would it would be a huge hassle mhm I like my life and\nI don't want to change mhm and I and I don't care what anybody says that kinda money changes your life I have a a set of changes the reaction that everybody has towards you as your life I have a a friend\nWho a friend or family member who a bat boy at one time was working for a a multibillion um and\nIt is you know how we talk about the president sleeps four hours a day mhm and my family member told me that this person was the exact same way only because there's\nNot enough time of the day we're talking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day and how my schedule is very busy [laughter] not a multi billionaire although ... at least one listener thinks we are um but but\nThe point was is there so much going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money um but but still you've got so much going on man\nBlood Lincoln is southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln M. K. C. and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator flood Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury him ... service\nUh you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else though to know\nI couldn't trust anyone that do that that would be the thing because you know people about what would you do and I said ... I don't know I probably would I'd want to distance myself from the money in ... set up some kind of foundation ... you know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kind of money you're not going to be able to keep your name private so this\n... it would be it would be hard to manage you can you can do that legally in in terms of you know claiming the prize\nBut\nIf you've got that kind of it's six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars\nSomeone's going to notice eventually yeah exactly the the word your life your life is going to change managing the money mhm 'cause I said you know I'd probably want to come up with some type of ... what I Would do I don't even know what the foundation but that means you've got to run the foundation so this jobs gone well I don't want to run my door laws there are laws about\nReceiving the money away their laws about giving money to your it let's just say you wanted to take it you claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members well there are tax laws if you just write them a check and you got to pay the gift tax the giver has to pay the gift\nRight well my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job figuring out what to do even if they're going to give it away that's what I mean they're going to be a full time job is going to be a huge hassle yeah and it's like oh this life I have is gone well I liked his life fight that right I don't know if like I said if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going yeah\nAll right let's let's have a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older you're like well like when I'm doing yeah I don't want to change my life I like my life\nWell yeah but you're you're not as secure as you could be well that's part of why I like my life I I I Do I get to do challenging I get to do challenging things and I you know I I like everything that I get to do and so I'm\nI'm not saying that there wouldn't be a part of me that wouldn't be\nGreatly excited about that mhm oh yeah 'cause I don't know I Would love to you know I think about it here's one of the worst one thing I think about that if I miss this is one dumped off it goes through a mind but it's still a thought\nOh we're talking about is is that if I Want one point six billion\nBecause every day I mean I ... the average person out there and I still consider myself sort of average I don't you and I think alike it's not like we don't even think we're on the radio we do a radio job but it's like no it's just like any other title oh we've we've ever done really I mean it's not I'd never think that\nOutside of being and doing this I never really think I'm On the radio some when somebody comes up and do those are they\nA little shocked we work in an over warehouse for those that don't yes where you're I mean we really ... it's almost like we've come to work and aware that we're just everyone is the end of the show we grab our lunch pills and going to do it that's what the feeling is is like that in the last time I work third shift this is the only time I work third shift\nOutside of being a machinist and so the mentality sort of the same for it so I but the the the thought is and so there are still you know challenges that I think of every day and what to do here and there and you know a a just and financial decisions and everything else that become a part of your life everything that you're doing in your business\nAnd personal life were you one point six billion\nAll that goes away and and I always think to myself I don't know if I Want to get to the point where the only thing\nThat now is it in my way because I have on one point six billion the only thing I'm thinking about his death [laughter] right then I got all these other things but I can think about it basically keep that the thinking of debt at a distance well all those challenges and problems are taken away and all of sudden I'm going\nTo get all this money death [laughter] I was a you\nKnow I talked to one time about this uh there was a a guy and I I'm I'm blanking out on his name but he he developed a game and he sold it ah I I I don't know I'll I'll have to look it up but anyway the guys told his game or the company that you know that surrounded the game for two billion dollars\nAnd his take of that was a you know roughly like one point eight so he became a billionaire you know overnight I obviously he was earning before that but then he talked about one night he went on it wasn't a ranch just a series of tweets that he was talking about it was that this party\nAnd it was the first time I was in a room with other billionaires\nAnd I was talking to people that I had nothing in common with\nBut I did but then I talked to this girl who was there and she wasn't a billionaire so we talked one girl who was a billionaire he's a single guy and he had nothing\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit light up of Lincoln I'm Casey Lincoln him can you actually linking him Casey and the only twenty eight Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nReliving had a job was not a billionaire far from it he had nothing in common with her and it was what I'm not trying to cry I'm just I'm just saying it's a weird are pleased to be in\nBecause I'm you know I'm not from money I'm new money but I don't fit in with these people and I don't fit in now with the people because you don't know what the motive is here's a here's the problem\nWith being famously well uh like the the the person in my family member works for\nYou've got to put up I mean your security surrounding you all the time yeah that's your famously well so you have security detail we talked about this with the president the president has that security detail that is is parallel to\nYou know the types of security detail or you know maybe not necessarily the president in terms of the training but you know up in that level you know what I mean and so you're going to have to be very careful because they are ... girl
