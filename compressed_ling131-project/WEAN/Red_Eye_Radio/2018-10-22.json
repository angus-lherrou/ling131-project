I mean but I guess you'd say last week our our first couple of days on vacation\nBefore not it was in the forties for the high I cranked up my fire plays started I you know and I was like you know I don't really feel bad about it on Wednesday I was like OK I'm ready for the rain to be done now\nI was done resting I was I was becoming restless or to go outside so I was like\nYeah I'm ready for the rain to be done but we kept getting rain and\nYou know the temperatures moderated you know how bad the weather was ... I never picked up a golf club once you know am I going to me now is not one oh my goodness had not even swung a golf and I got a big argument coming up yeah the independent Bob\nAll by the way I was

Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nThis is just well the they they believe that's a good thing\nTo do\nBut they believe that this is a good tactic would you and I just kind of just in general if you just look at the tactics right now the left as using I mean politically we're not talking about the moms in restaurants we're not talking about you know the the the rank and file with the protesters talking about the people holding office yeah\nTheir political tactics I mean there may this is their mainstream political tactic and they believe stuff like this\nIs going to work and and that's and you and I made sure that before he went on vacation when we were talking about cabinet or not understand this is the mainstream now yeah of the Democrat leadership in this country because we'll always get calls from people saying well this isn't the average Democrat\nIt's the average Democrat now representing you sure in Congress and in the Senate\nRight\nThis is the standard and we'll get to Elizabeth Warren too and uh the the three big problems that she by the way they weren't there are down just to to three well one of the things I I Love was uh I I never believed in white privilege until Elizabeth Warren\nA white person makes the claim yes she's Native American you all white privilege that white privilege ... rice or cultural appropriation\nYeah right I and and again they believe they're on the right track I Know it just it's just\nUnbelievable so we'll get to that to the polls everything else you've got a great show up for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nTexas set to receive more rain today there's a couple of systems that will be providing moisture to the region in the Gulf of Mexico there's a low pressure systems and in the Pacific there's a low pressure area both of those systems funneling moisture right into southern Texas and the four corners region\nAnd if you get up into the higher reaches of the southern Sierra is an southern Rockies you could pick up some snow fall as a result of that ... at the end of last week the winter weather forecast from the climate Prediction Center was issued a couple of regional highlights it will be warmer in the west know changing the chances for snow\nThey did a during the committee vote on on on Capitol you know that you had come out here it's going outside and doing the press thing and all that but it wasn't that wasn't so much the ... that was like the protests after the fact they still voted yet and they still voted\nSo that wasn't affected really anything you know it it will show about it\nBut they had the meeting that first weekend they had that meaning we'll just get up and walk out\nThis is this this ... this is the mainstream Democrat today this is not the protesters\nAnd we talked about how the protesters lead the party they leave the party they lead the call for the party but how many groups how many different causes and different protest groups are there this is why they have no direction because they're in every direction and it's it's it's crazy and then\nThen I guess the the other point was so Elizabeth Warren then does DNA matter\nQuite right does this does is destroyed transgender isn't mhm if DNA matters because remember the the the next thing is as as we all know uh we we've gone through the whole trans racial thing the leftist starting to embrace right remember you're talking about Elizabeth Warren who was [laughter]\nBefore this one of the leading liberal icons\nYou know socialist icons social justice warrior ... who broke a ton of social justice warrior winds and regulations ... number one you were saying the DNA matters does it does so DNA matters across the board then and then it matters for uh your your sexuality it matters for your gender huh\nYou know writers for your race huh right is is that the is that the whole point or or does it not in\nOkay what's the determining factor of what you are then what is the what is the [laughter] where does that decimal point go what is the what is the fraction that indicates that you are a particular ethnicity just great stop\nWell and if I were doing a debate with her on stage I Would say a former President Obama said race is just a social construct yes do you agree\n[laughter] and people don't forget about that\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed reason they do prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nThe was the letter or a New Yorker I forgot what I think it was ... he did a a an interview with\nAnd they asked him you know why do you say that you're black when you know your ... right next mixed race ... and he said because I've come to know I've I've come to realize that race is a social construct mhm it's what you think you are ... or so is that it now is that done now\nHas the left moved on because I when when you look at it there were so many rules of the social justice warrior that Elizabeth Warren broke and they were completely quiet mhm totally silent mhm\nEverything from cultural appropriation that the fact that race apparently is no longer a social construct it has something to do with DNA that's\nWhy are you using science [laughter] for him [laughter] remember when Ben Shapiro brought up the science on a on the doctor drew show he was threatened with violence\nSo you can't bring up science that's wrong but see this is this is the madness of the left because there are so many different directions how do you know which one is the\n... here's here's the thing when Trump says something the majority of what Trump says that they criticize in fact check this off the cuff Mm right it's it's an opinion or just a thought that he just boom records out right and and and the insanity of the left\nWhich is I'm going to call them the whole my beer party from now on cars whatever Trump does like ... hold my beer I think that I Will watch what I'm going to say it's actually premeditated and thought out yes no planets\nThat they were trying they're trying to prove them wrong on something that he didn't give a half a second to he didn't give one one hundred and twenty fourth of a second [laughter]\nMy my favorite was the [laughter] water over one hundred and twenty four yeah Navy SEAL and it was a huge I fight with a gun [laughter]\n... in a swimming pool or if you know that that's it it really is the that's the madness because they believe that something that's going to win\nFor them look in her state in terms of you know her Senate seat yeah she's pretty sick like Dick Durban he can get away with saying and are doing a lot of crazy things he's safe as long as he wants to that seat but at least for the time being you want to enter the arena and twenty twenty\nFor the big house well but by the way not present the White House I mean yeah but [laughter]\nAlthough although Hillary was a contender for both\nUm [laughter] we ... do you have to get up on that stage and you have to bring down out look again you know those um those blue states where they're safe they can they can do the crazier things they can do the protestors type attitude but do that up on stage you know we talked about this\nIs a few months ago when we were talking about what the the the pool of contenders in the primary season and twenty twenty will look like right\nThere each going to have the top each other on how much they hate Trump that will be gold number one you've got to show your anger and you've got to show how much you so the person who hates Trump more\nIn terms of the perception by the voter or the rank and file Democrat might get the nomination because that's the goal number one for them so but in order to do that they have to get up on that debate stage during that primary season\nAnd that's what they have to do they have to do the crazier and crazier and crazier because\nNo longer can you have a debate\nNo longer can you have a real discussion ... what are they going to say well the economy is suffering ... as long as it holds between now and twenty twenty no\nA jobs we need more jobs ... we haven't found finding enough people right now I'm so the what are you going to do well do you have it has to be about the hatred for Trump's so you're going to have to display you know the one who hates them most is gonna win\nOr where it's going that we thought the only way that they could go if they were going to go more or less which is we're offering you everything for free yeah yeah and I mean that's the ... and that we are the other day we yeah we do we we do have a fascist mindset and we do is to control\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model flood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nInstitution of the United states by the way it's become clear and we brought this up a few years ago and we were amazed\nAt the very little response that we got from Democrats on this right where we said look they don't really believe in the constitution we don't know that they don't they don't believe in the Senate they don't believe in the cars that by the way that gain ground over their vacation and you know the Senate has to go to the electoral college the electoral college just to go to\nThe Senate has to go and what they what they may not realize it but that's when you get into not carrying that belief get you to the point of\nNot caring about individual rights because that's why the Senate exist that's why the electoral college at you know it exists because we're not a direct democracy were republic\nWhere constitutional Republican republic why to protect individual rights that the Democrats and the ACLU use to care about right but now as we know they don't write and so you know that's where you've got to we really don't believe in America\nAnd so in order to get you to vote for us we'll give you as much free stuff as possible to me that's actually what the Democrats round\nI Know I I you're you're spot on and but the problem there is what\nCNN Jake Tapper and Chris Cuomo asking tough questions from Ocasio Cortez and ... you know separate interviews okay well how do you pay for it how do you pay for it but but but beyond that forget about the media ... wasn't so tough but they did ask the question\nIf your Hillary and you get back in in twenty twenty\nThe it used to be the boiling the frog slowly right okay we'll give you a little more free stuff and then we'll a little more free stuff you've got to go for one because you have Gillum and Florida promising the world will Casio\nCortez promising to world Bernie's been promising the world can\nAll Harris now over the last couple of days yeah you know saying okay let's give everybody right now let's let's give people six thousand dollars a year that's the starting right right let's just give cash to people right and and so uh so we're to the the the the free cash free health care and free college and\nYeah and and they know they can't pay for it and the American voter knows they can't pay for it but how how do you do it if you're Hillary and you try and put up a plan of a little more free stuff no you've got to go full on like the rest of them did\nSomebody will get to the point where we talked about before the twenty sixteen election just offer every American a hundred tops of dollars that exactly or one ticket to

twenty sixteen why do you think he was just you know random participants on the street interviews\nAnd the the one common thread in those and those respond as from those respondents was he was talking about problems we have here at home she kept talking about problems over seas somewhere outside of this country\nAlways be some reason the Trump one was not because he had all the solutions but because he simply identified what the problem was\nWhat the problems ... and the fact is you haven't had presidential candidates that have looked at the topics that people have cared about\nAnd even point out these are the problems that we have to solve them that's how bad it had gotten by twenty sixteen ... as we said the Democrats were talking about instill our climate change and race are two major problem ... well they're not\nRight Americans didn't you with that way right Trump is president because\nHe identified what the problems were and now we can debate all day long whether all of the solutions\nThat he has come up with or that he has promoted or the correct way to go or not ... but the fact is he came up with the problems and identified the problems and politics are so bad in America today\nWhere if you just identified the problem in twenty six team that got you elected president of the United states right\n\nThen what you have now is two years later you've got a ton of

out with something very simple here's how my plan is going to work\nHere's what I Want to do while you're up against potentially a president in twenty twenty who has delivered some pretty stellar results on the economy\nSo you're going to do what promised a lot of free stuff do people still buy the hype in the free stuff if they believe that will never be delivered ultimately and because here's what changed after the great recession and we saw this\nIt was well the banks got the bail out so I should get mine even people that otherwise might be conservative you know we're like okay we want we do want more free stuff we got a ton of those calls and and so there is that affect their\nBut the concern is too is that\nAmong the you know just the generic voter population out their rank

necessarily in the Senate run in Texas I I still believe that it wouldn't have back then because in Texas remembered twenty sixteen in the primary\nHe won the state he won Texas or he also won Iowa a but but\nMay be maybe could have been something where a Ted Cruz was the last two or ... or ... or back there and and again we don't make predictions would just look at the polls right now and and Ted

that's what the Democrats will try or just a bunch of basalt there oh Trump Globes America we love America or\nWhat I mean I Love America to actually if you don't believe in the constitution you don't love America you may love the concept of what you as a group all think America should be\nBut you don't love America the way\nThat it exists under the current constitution and the rules and regulations that we have you and I talked about it when you talk about\nThe fact now there's they're talking about well the president needs to remember the president's see is no longer effective or that needs to go yeah the the the electoral college needs to go in the Senate needs to go from what they don't understand what those are key words that you don't believe in individual liberty\nBecause we are not a direct democracy we are a constitutional republic and the reason we are is to protect the rights of the minority best\nTo protect the individual rights and the rights of the minority exactly what they claim that they believe the Democrats claim that they they think about\nSo we look at all that and that's all part of loving America so when you hear when I say that I've always got response though that's above the thing that he loves American we don't know based on\nThe actual specifics of what the Democratic Party is promoting mhm what we're calling for which is anti constitutional mindset and an anti constitution well yeah and we can make that point and you and I said for the longest time but it's the left that doesn't believe in the first amendment\nFor them yeah mhm\nBut for others they don't and we have broken that down before they don't believe in the second amendment and now they don't believe in due process under the law when it's inconvenient for them there was not a presumption of innocence that mindset is wrong\nAnd we've talked about that you know the support of the judges when the judge has become activists judges and how that is an American and unconstitutional and how they promote that mhm\nAnd so the average person I think she's at and Trump is anything they look at Trump and I look at Trump and you look at Trump is anything but an authoritarian and a fascist even at times though his words we like I don't say that\nYeah I when you look at what he actually doesn't what he promotes in the long run it's all\nConstitutional yes it's all part of the process that was put in place\nHundreds of years ago I mean it it's but this is this is what we have to this is what it has to come down to if we're not going to win the Senate we need to get rid of it that we're not going to win the electoral college vote\nThen to get rid of him to get rid of it we need to get rid of the constitution when it doesn't but it doesn't hurt me when we don't win the White House we need to get rid of the president's that's anti American yes no it's not\nWell what America you for ... it's not America where they don't like it but on the

bring that up because that's more of the the emotion of what drives an election and I and I don't think I don't think we should discount how important that is in this election that reason the Trump is drawing the crowds\nThat he is is drawing a especially from a Republican Party that you'd think two years afterwards that he was going in and doing these rallies and he is drawing these people\nAnd we had mentioned the the uh the story that came out over the weekend that Beto O'Rourke a small little theater\nHe couldn't fill that and you're in the state of Texas just a couple of weeks out as was reported over the weekend that the real rock star even though we hate that Trump or politicians to begin with but the real rockstar still is Trump and why because there is an emotional\nAttachment to him that is based on the substance of what he's doing\nIt and that's what that's what it comes down to it also how the left is behaving in reaction to how the left as having them and that type of threat that that poses if you think of the what happened during the cabin a confirmation process\nYou know so that's that's what it comes down to what's the greater motivator on each side and will

Rockies you could pick up some snow fall as a result of that ... at the end of last week the winter weather forecast from the climate Prediction Center was issued a couple of regional highlights it will be warmer in the west no change in the chances for snow\nThat wasn't the point\nYou know but I'll Wait wait a minute and again you can't make the case he was trying to make the case that it was the same and I'm like no it was unprecedented what happened right mhm and you even look at Justice Thomas you know that goes back you know twenty five\nOr ... that goes back twenty five years ago and and uh you know he those hearings were held and then but then but then he was he was you know confirmed that I Believe some Democrats even cross the line and voted for him yes they did I Believe that yes they did well I Believe it was a Democrat said it at the time mhm\nYeah ah so yeah so you know they they ... but this was unprecedented\nNothing nothing we've ever seen a ... it in our lifetime or in modern times has has been like this so to even question that\nTo me uh shows ignorance and that doesn't mean stupidity it means a lack of knowledge ah on on history and that's why we brought up he said that didn't happen with sort of minor and that didn't happen with Kagan there were people that disagree with that because we we believe\nThat sort of my or and Kagan many times not all the time\nOn the\nCell tower right to cell tower case of the cell tower that they agreed with ... they you know that ah they use the in their writings they used\nUm the prior judgment or by opinion written by ... majority opinion written by Scalia\nIs ... exactly that was the press and the right they use but in many of their many of their answers and many of their their decisions we believe they legislate which is not their role which is why we were against their nomination but it was based on traditionally what they would do\nNot by what we want each in everyday mhm mhm well ... what the job of the judges and that's the difference and that's something that we brought up with the whole Kavanaugh hearings that we said look ... you know conservatism Republican stop have to stop arguing\nThe same premise that Democrats are arguing right Republican keep arguing most conservative versus liberal justice no it's not ...\nI'm not voting for a conservative judge I'm voting for a construction is an originalist I'm voting for a judge irrespective of what they wish the government to be each and every day understand that their role is not to make law either left or right\nThere their job under the constitution is to interpret what the law says\nYou know it's interesting to see that as we got to the uh the the closer to the the\nUltimate vote on on a Kavanaugh you know I made the point that even the liberal justices\nRespect the process in my opinion based on experience and I think one thing you can look at\nOne judgment you can look at from SCOTUS was recess appointments which was good anonymous yeah against all by him against Obama yeah because if you look at that that really was something that was very clear\nOn what the process yes and so respecting not only the process of how you know the confirmation process of of of how that's done but also again the process at the highest court I Do believe and\nYou know you can say what you will about the opinions written by a Ginsburg or or whether they're dissenting or majority opinion you can we can turtles apart and say well they're wrong about this or the wrong about that or we disagree with this or that\nBut in terms of the process I think ah by and large I have seen\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit light up of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln ... Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty eight Lincoln Navigator flood Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nApple but there are others a recess appointments was that unanimous decision where ... you can't do that and and and that is that is the difference when the left no longer respects the process when you don't respect to process what is left\nBecause what is left is shouting people out of restaurants do away with the Senate do away with this do away with the presidency do away with the electoral college do away with parts of the constitution\nThat's what's left to the point there is no process and we'll shout you down just to get our way which means we'll get control of your life\nYou better button it up north Dakota where California and will tell you what the law is will tell you who's going to be president will tell you how it's going to will tell you what individual rights are in fact there aren't any left\nIf you want to get in we would love to hear from you we do have a line open eight six six Ninety read I [noise]\nYou know these are ... radio toll free at age ... maybe ...

up a as early Sunday to get him at this rally I don't know I don't know if that that's been um\nHere but it's so much tougher to tell on those house seats I just I I Wonder that if we're going to gain\nIn the in the in the Senate mhm and so that's you know that's looking at a populations across the state and right here or that\nYou know I just wonder how they extrapolate it out to so many of these races where if they're using the public polls out there there are so few of them\nSo few and far between how they use those no if you're going to the internal polling polling which I'm sure as being done by the campaigns run you would have the better you know a better guess at that right\nYeah it it gets here it is a a a Dems midterm advantage narrows among registered voters yeah my new national poll a few weeks before the midterm election shows the chances of a blue wave are far from a slam dunk for the Democrats the NBC Wall Street Journal poll released a Sunday shows forty eight

Democrats had in September I don't know if that tells you anything though\nWell and and again I mean registered voters ... we've got to talk about likely voters and then again what the motivation is on election day this we've been talking about this it has changed since the Kavanaugh's confirmation\nLeading up to and since I don't know to what extent I Can't tell you it's motivated the left or the right more we do know there's no doubt the right is motivated Republicans are motivated right now are they more motivated than Democrats I Can't tell you that\nNow I I watch it on the Mike called before we started talking about you know the the whole Russian collusion at the top of the hour and I say that because\nMike was not driven to call based on what we had said and therefore he you know became passionate about giving his point of view across my called with that passion about the Russian\nCollusion investigation and his anger and his feeling that this could possibly changed the election you know and and move it to the Republicans before we ever started talking about I think that's important because I don't find many people like Mike mhm\nI don't think honestly\nNow we've covered everything when it comes to the whole Russian collusion from day one and we've asked every question known to mankind and we do think that we have looked at more\nOr as investigators in partisans and we believe that\nHey that with everything going on and with the Pfizer warranted and and everything there that we are going to find out that probably the Democrats were up to a lot more hijackings than the Republicans ever dreamed of actually doing it as we know already\nThe only evidence of colluding with the Russians in any way directly or indirectly would be the DNC and the Hillary campaign to give me the money to uh Perkins gave it to fusion GPS it gave it to the former spy Christopher Steele who said he got his information his\nSalacious on verified information or I or against Donald Trump from people close to the Kremlin right so the only people that colluded it any way with the Russians were the Democrats from the information that we have\nAt this particular point but I don't think right now that's driving anybody to go to the polls\nNo it really isn't um\nIt it could it is it an underlying factor as a part of the larger I guess scenario with Republicans or conservatives are based on following you know the work of of many really great reporters who who really brought to light so many things in this thing if\nWonder Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai kid Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in pristine free own condition that flood for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred free on cars all makes all models and incredible prices flood onto flood Otto John John [noise] now\nThat's I don't think that's the big push right now I don't think that's the big emotion nothing right now um I Do think there's something to the the the fact that they've been alleging all of this since you know a after the election and since certainly who's become president\nUh and they never showed anything for it and and it's really been this media circus and it's really based on nothing I think that's a motivator but it's not what I don't think it's the here and now I don't I don't see it\nI look I I think that there are some people that have looked over the last couple of years and what the Democrats have done and they have included a ... in its in its contacts the whole Russian collusion thing in Holland for they believe it is and maybe that's partly what's driving them to the polls but the difference that we've seen over the last month\nIn the energy level or what do they call the excitement level and upper Republican voters to come out which\nWould make the difference in keeping the house and increasing the number and the Senate none of that has to do with Russian collusion right or the mall or investigation at all or\nNot and see I don't know what a of a more report does the if the if the report from last week is true that says the that Mueller would would uh issue the core of his report after the midterm right after the mid term\nI I don't know what that does politically because first of all how can it be an actor report without including the fact that of how all this information was obtained and what you just spelled out not us that direct line that we know\nThat no one has disputed between the DNC and the Hillary campaign and ultimately Christopher Steele\nYou can't you can't debate you and you can't you can't let out a report I don't do it it's incomplete um what I Know the report right now it's not going to even talk about that in and that's that's the whole point it's like a ... but it's not even going to talk about the possibility of ... with the Russians\nI I just because where where would be the evidence if there's not going to be in a movement on ... if it is just to report a chrysalis over at CNN\nA former Washington Post I ride that you know where he said you know I think it's a it's ultimately going to be just a just a report he's been saying that for a while it's it's ultimately just got to be a report it's really not going to be any more indictments unless maybe there's a you know lying to investigators charge somewhere else along the lines\nAnd and we've got what are the Michael Flynn hearing\nAnd everything else of us probably will never see this ... right because it and that will be a complete does that it'll just happening right it's it's something I noticed the landing on the last two years yet accusations gone just as good as the donor\nExcept for the fact that you have the I. G. working on some information of what was going on at the department of justice during that time based on what the president and the White House sent to Mr Horwitz\nAnd we've been asking this where I still haven't seen anybody else asked what ... what we asked why would the White House sent it to the inspector general but we're talking about the\nAs the that is the most interesting mystery that exist right now in Washington DC and nobody is talking is asking the question is what he has talked about away on vacation I owed everywhere nobody is talking about talking about and we said it when it happened we said wise you sign it into the ... the only reason you some of the ideas because\nYou suspect corruption why are they are no links on this why is nothing coming out on a story at All right\nWhen and and people have just a refresher when rubber when President Trump said he's going to declassify\nOr the ... the application and other emails that were sent between the FBI and the department of justice for over Twenty one different pages right ah and then it came out well he\nUh uh we have some allies that don't want us to ah you know release it there it might be some sensitive information so we're going to send it to the inspector general to look at it and expedite\nWhatever that are ... port yeah expedite a report out of it and we said well why would you give it to the I. G. I. G. S. nothing to do with whether you should release it oh corruption and how how to our allies know what would be and how our allies know what's in it and what's not in it how could they object either way because they don't\nSo why you sent into the ige e because one reason your son in the ...\nHow would you like motor dredge twenty or gene truck to be here for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty four to one fifty best drug for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a port board and he went into a ...\nThat as\nThe the role of the I. G. and because of the power that they have ... you can go in and get the documents that even oversight committees haven't been able to get within the department of justice and the White House\nWouldn't be able to get it I mean that would be a political move right and it's also takes it out of the political realm you give it to the idea you go to war with and see what or which can bind and for which has access to every corner milk and cranny and the deal Jay and and since that happened what almost three weeks ago mobile maybe yeah you and I said what are we missing here\nIs that what what are we missing or nobody else was talking about are we missing something completely in it right at eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\n... widow [noise]\nRight now AT T A N Petro stuffing centers so wonderfully strong and soft wonder Jill purple extreme seat cushions is on sale burly sixty four Ninety seven", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "22"}
