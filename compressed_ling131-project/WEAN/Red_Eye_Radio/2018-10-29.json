I haven't seen in there were probably about the nature of those bombs yep and and what was dangerous about them if they were immediately dangerous or or anything else except for the fact that they you know they know who the guy is we got some background on the guy that's responsible according to the authorities\nBut aside from that the the a lot about the devices themselves remains a mystery\n[noise] how do we define civility because I've heard that conversation are going on over the weekend we'll get to that looks like NBC got caught withholding info on ... claim if you saw that over the weekend now the reporter was\nKate Snow ... who was her name she came out and tried to defend it but as everybody you know\nIt should really from what I saw I should ever respond timeline doesn't match up are still a couple of days and there were she knew ... and ... ... at least one day and maybe as many as two or three days because she started talking\nOr to the uh the the ... the the woman or who was a source weapon that he claimed and you know that uh she had seen ... uh these drinks being spiked and everything else and she said I did not I I didn't see that\nWe're moving in the Republican Party is moving in a more socialist right a a a a a position remembers we brought you friday the Commerce Department numbers and a half of the increase we're talking about the increase\nIn the GDP half of that increase is due to government spending mhm not\nNot the private market booming now half of it is the private market and preventing and we agree with that but we look at what's coming down the pike here with what Republicans have done and we're extremely concerned about where the economy\nIs going to go but to me when we talked about you know for example tariffs again\nAnd you've got is as I said on friday have conservative lost their economic mind ... because you have people that are conservatives that would absolutely be against the increased a government causing the increase in prices in goods\nAnd services because the goods are going up and they're claiming that's a that's a good thing that will actually make an economy do better actually two responses on that on friday no no no no no tears makes the economy better know doesn't\nKnow we live in this and so people that were conservative I rent is delusional state of increasing of prices helps the economy it doesn't\nIt helps the ... the companies or the industry that has designed to protect beyond that no\nBut when we get to a minute we're talking about the blame game in the whole civility thing because on many issues out there we talked about civility when we talk about look you need to get along with everybody well let's talk about the issues you and I've taught gone down this road before and we've looked at what the left as promoting in this country right now and what they're promoting something that we can't compromise\nOn there is no compromise and if there is no compromise what do you do as a nation on sanctuary cities sorry not going to permit sanctuary cities I'd open borders there is no compromise on open borders there is no compromise on sanctuary

I I was back in New York and went to church with my parents so yeah just blow me away this whole thing that\nYou know what I watched a while we were on a break recently I've watched the movie a spotlight\nA that was the movie on the Boston Globe you know they had their their spotlight division for many years and they did the\nBasically the expos they there are in in Boston and the the process of kind of following that you know through the years and at the time that the movie came out there was a lot that wasn't no\nAnd then you saw the uh the authorities come out about a Pennsylvania Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania\nAnd then the latest about you know from buffalo and everything else um but that movie was kind of startling it was when I re watched it it was even more startling you know it was it but they set in the movie basically what we said one of the characters in the movie\nI'm just said you know can you believe it can I go back to church essentially could I ever go back to church again\nFor cover electronics here's your forecast\nIf you missed a chance this weekend to be in a part of the country to get out and take a drive and see some of the beautiful fall foliage you're actually passed the peak season for many locations around the country the upper Great Lakes including northern Wisconsin in northern Minnesota\nMost or Pennsylvania New York in the New England states are past week this week we're seeing the ... conditions throughout the Appalachians right through central Ohio and Indiana and to northern Illinois\nWe could just say OK authorities can now just walk into homes at will\nAnd to just to see if any crime is being broken or committed but you are in one of the neighbors are of the shooter\nThe synagogue shooter was was talking on you know Fox News saying\nI didn't even have any there was no clue that this guy was a white supremacist I I didn't know and I wish there was a way to you know to tell I Wish there was a way how do you know what even in a person's part I mean maybe ... people close to them do um but\nThen beyond that how do you know\nHow do you change their heart ah and how do you predict whether or not because there are plenty of people filled with actual hate when we don't mean people on social media just talking you know negatively about someone we mean people filled with actual hate\nThat are potentially deadly well there are a number of laws we could pass to keep because\nUh you uh you know this guy was on a apparently or a social media site I'd never heard of a that was ... was a social media site for white supremacist\nAnd\nOkay so your we could say that participation in such a site\nOr is against the law we could say that I'm speaking out with hatred in your heart real hatred for groups of people are based on their ethnicity or or or culture that's against the law we could pass a number of laws son did I mean how do you change for freedom\nOf speech ... part of the reasons that freedom of speech speech exist is so people do proclaim what they think so you know who they are do know exactly how they all you do by taking away their free speech rights as what you send them underground that's what you\nWell and and when there's pressure from you know society because the reason maybe I'm guessing the reason and I think it's a solid theory here that the neighbor wasn't aware of of this\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit ladder of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator floods Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nSociety we don't tolerate it morally speaking forget about the legality of it all forget about what can be done legally morally we don't tolerate that because the overwhelming majority of people don't have this kind of hatred evil than there are no\nAnd you cannot ... and and that's what it comes down to there's there's no way of knowing for what ever reason whatever motivation a person might have\nI mean think of all of the reasons that might be stated a in terms of the motivation of of any mass killer in our history well the list is very long\n[noise] you know I I was just I was going through the headlines are just yesterday just in real clear politics and and it was a it was just really interesting a Donald Trump is a shameless liar\nThat's the headline of an article written by former president in Iraq Obama got his by what has a no in Philly Detroit News be honest we hate each other\nBut the one I liked the most was just in Fox Bloomberg's headline if you ignore the news\nAmerica actually seems pretty nice if you ignore the new view ignore the news seems pretty nuts ... well I I just I thought it was you know I didn't even read the article I just I saw it but I but it's it's something that you and I talked about before where we've we've said\nAh for and and I mentioned for example everything going on in the news and you walk into the voting booth everybody greet you how you doing with no one on who you're voting location what's going on good to see a\nOh the weather's bad Oh thanks for voting pick up your thing thanks you take care oh have you don't have a I mean everybody goes and it's very orderly very nice I don't think I've ever had a non pleasant time ever voting in my life right well that's actually the reality of it you know of of what goes on\nFor the vast majority tens of millions of people out there one thing we talk about you know the the news media\nAnd you and I have talked about this a lot that they're always\nYou know and and it just because it's it's it's the news the news is what's unusual that's one of the first things I learned in journalism class is news is the unusual right that's why that's why murders\nAre new system because for the most part they don't happen to the vast majority of people not to discount that murder isn't bad but the fact is the majority of people the majority of the time\nNever encounter a a a murder right many ... some families do but the majority of families in this country do not when you look at the three hundred and roughly thirty million people in this country still mass shootings mass murders\nAre quite low but when you look at the uh\nPsychopaths that exist out there\nUh when I was just watching and how many uh documentaries every watched\nOn it but it was another one on on Ted Bundy yesterday ... and talk you know the going through the transcripts of his girlfriend at the time I'm telling you just haunting yeah she was trying to figure out\nIs he\nIs he not and going through that progression of her there's no campy\nAnd then sent you know since he's brother ... the Ted 'cause the exact same thing shuts\nThe door on the FBI you know how dare you this isn't this isn't my brother and then finally you know started thinking about it and said well okay I guess I have to deal with reality\nAnd it's not that it gives any you know um there was no on us or or or responsibility on the part of his\nBrother necessarily because it was as if you know he was learning at ... he really was learning about you know what his brother might be capable of doing or was capable\nIt turned out of doing a A N and that's the case with any of them you know the neighbor here of the shooter at the at the synagogue\nYou know you think of that and\nI'm sure in in his mind is wondering wow is there something maybe that I should have paid attention to you know closer is there something that I could have done we all do this and by the way this is how we get to this point I was saying there must be a solution because in our hearts\nThere should be one this in our hearts it doesn't make sense but we're trying to make sense of

and more taking away those the people's rights the individual rights of Americans that becomes a real threat but it is not something\nThat is in most people's minds something you respond to with anything else but a vote or debate\nIt's that simple and that's who we are everyone greens most good people grieve when when there's a loss of life that's who we are as humans that's who we are as a

of time and I I Wish there were way but as as it stands right now it's just impossible as you mentioned Gary sometimes in a society it is going to happen\nWe can learn from it but it doesn't mean that will be able to predict the next one or stop or prevent the next one we look to learn from it because we all want to stop the loss of life in a situation like this\nWe'll talk more coming up if you'd

Want to get too because you this is very important because one of the things that that really\nGets to conservatives because conservatives have compassion and I believe and I believe that and I believe that that the the yanks when we are we've got some interference or I I Believe the Trump is compassionate I Believe Trump's rhetoric at times goes over the top\n... example [laughter]\nYou know the example I'm going to give [laughter] keeping the conspiracy going the cruise Ted Cruz's father was part of the Kennedy assassination so to me that was the high level anything since then has actually taken down a little bit because that's one heck of an allegation so we understand that when it comes to hyperbole he can go over the top\nBut don't you care about the substance is it only hyperbole then is that what you're claiming Democrat or Democrats only care\nAbout how you say it's not what you say and you also have to understand when it comes to the fury that exist in America by a lot of people including Trump when you see\nThe Democrats wish to protect illegal immigrant criminals this is not\nUltra partisan to get people angry it is the reality of what exists today stayed in reality is not hate talk\nBut when you have the Democrats who prefer their preference is the safety and security of illegal immigrant criminals over American citizens yeah you're going to get people angry including the president ... yup it's going to happen\nUm look and by the way the whole thing with the remember the\nPresident said the rapist thing and you know it's you know you and I for

third political party everything here proves it that would stand for what\n\nYeah what are you going to both of us are going to let him out for about a third political party stand for well where's the center\nWhere's the center yeah who's really a moderate right now\nI don't know what a moderate is right now you know we've been you know over the past few years especially over the past twenty four months we've been trying to define what a conservative is a I think we all know what the liberalism there are varying degrees of liberalism but it starts\nPretty much on the foreign left and then goes to the extreme far left\nWell tell me what a moderate is forget about conservative or liberal tell me what a moderate is one of the stand for what are they promote and how they vote\nAnd I've talked about how a a\nTalk to a a relative by marriage who was a college professor and he was a liberal I mean I really never got into the conversation and did this year at our family reunion\nAnd even though he's a liberal he rejects what's coming from the Democrats completely and he said about Trump said\nIt was like my dad loved Trump as Trump look his rhetoric is over the top but not a racist you thought you said come on the New York city deals with everybody and this guy's a liberal professor who says I Can't stand being on the liberal campus was he said because we're not liberal anymore

back to your calls and\nComments on the political divide in America\nI just chuckled over this one on um MSNBC on on Saturday joy read and the panel were in a discussion on voter suppression you know they've got the very tight race Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp for governor of uh of Georgia and then\nThey're trying to make a big deal he's from voter suppression voter suppression are talking about the fact that ah there's you know there's a law in Georgia\nThat you have to purge the rules and they got it wrong it said after every two elections not after seven years and by the way a lot of people left have got that wrong it's after seven years you have to purchase it and they're like and voter suppression voter suppression voter suppression voter suppression\nThe law was passed by Democrats in Nineteen Ninety seven that you had to purge the rose after seven years if you didn't vote ... if you didn't vote\nFor Democrats passed the law it's like\nYeah but he wants to do it\n[laughter]\n\nWe've passed that we didn't really mean it he means that they make [laughter] we're Democrats we passed the law to purge the voter rolls if you don't vote every seven yeah but he's actually doing it and he's a Republican so that's bad he's surprising the vote I mean this is held\nBy the way if you want the most bizarre issue out there it's the claim of voter suppression by the Democrats\n\nThat is when you think about it how but ...\nYeah um it's it's just like the money in politics we hate it if the other side's raising more money than we love it if that is raising a ton of money so\nAnd then oh Casio Cortez\nShe did it was very little money\nSo they're not there one more example of them just basically reaching out every time they get defeated they'll reach out and

vote for Ted Cruz ... there are people out there that are voting for Greg Abbott who vote for better over why would be my question mhm\nRight because there's such a disparity if if there is and and right now ah ah with real clear politics or he's roughly up a a Ted Cruz roughly seven points\nThey they moved it I think in our cp though as to now lean it's not a close to ... Republican ... uh but Greg Abbott absolutely dominating in the polls I mean there was one you can go back a couple of months you can't find one that's not double digits\nSo you've got a ton of people because if he only get six or seven wins by six seven eight points Ted Cruz\nAnd have it wins by twenty huge number of people we voted for Greg Abbott voted for better or voted for Greg Abbott and would not vote for Cruz why would be my question\nWell you know we'd have to point out and I don't know if this is a part of it or if this would be in in the you know part of the answer that uh that you would get if you were to learn that\nUh but we we talk about it was two years ago Ted Cruz being the demon oh I agree with you know and and you know I mean back when banner was was speaker of the house and and you know uh there were people in the Republican Party we know that in the Senate and in the house\nThat hated cruise but I mean if you had any question you look at what happened at the bar and see if the convention in the summer at twenty sixteen yeah but without the age but now he's beautiful Ted yes right while because now he's useful\nBut if you decided to challenge the president managing and twenty twenty but isn't that politics though yeah of course a stranger and I was ... was that it makes you a little to me yeah that's and and it's nothing new but\nIt it is\nThe same thing is is that okay well but in that setting it was about his lack of endorsement and now it's I think you could probably point to a number of people that say that still stuck with me\nEven though the president is with him and Houston I'm not I mean I I think you would probably again which some I Can't even measure that but I Know there are people that support the president right now support governor Abbott\nAnd are not going to support Ted Cruz for one reason or the other and it's\nIt's likely because I'm I'm guessing a handful of them at least are saying it's because he did not get on board and twenty sixteen\nI Would love to see those votes how many votes for avid but don't vote for Cruz at ... or ... just don't vote for Senate\nMhm yeah no there or you know if you if you look at that there there could be a number of them that aren't voting and the Senate or how many of them\nYou know are looking at the governor's race and and you know going well yeah that's it that's all great wonderful but Lupe Valdez is not our ... there were a number of things that came up and her history as a share if that's left is considered that in fact have been more vocal about\nUh of course in the in the past few months that they're concerned with\nOr her actions as an and policy of the basically the Dallas County sheriff's department under her leadership so you look at that and that and and those that probably has some to do with it again you know you could put some of those answers in that category but\nWe'll see what where it comes together I guess on election day in and how many people actually did vote for Abbott but wouldn't vote for Ted Cruz that's an interesting question and point\nEight six six Ninety red eye\nIn addition to being required by law pre and post trip inspections are vital to the safety of professional drivers conducting thorough pre trip inspections allows you to kitchen aid problems before heading out on the road\nPost trip inspections give the shop time to react to any problems that were identified during your next pre or post trip inspection check to make sure your fifth wheel securely attached and free of any excessive were\nThe train or a king pin must be lashed properly and the jaws of the fifth wheel also check to make sure your safety chains are attached properly th trucks service understands\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln I'm Casey Lincoln him ...

Bush and John McCain while they weren't Hitler Hitler but but definitely this guy is really Hitler but that's the that's the um oh the lab they really want to come out and and make you believe that this guy or whoever it is the most recent was there at the current threat\nIs the one that is is is the biggest threat to you right now the only way they can get away with that or they think they can get away with that is by creating a monster and the person\nYou know a James I saw the a young black Leadership Conference that the President Trump spoke to the other day and I saw one of the young people that was interviewed that said\nI'm finally off the plantation and when he said that I went wow that's going to drive liberals just crazy but to me and I'm not black\nBut to me when he said that\nWhat it was was I I'm I'm Out of the I'm Out of the mindset of groupthink that if I'm if I'm involved in group think find being told that I must think this way because of the color of my skin and then my mind is still in the plantation\nAnd that and that's what I Try to some of the other for your your your corner the finger at a a Republican plantation what I'm saying what what kind of fish or you are on right now that wanna allow you to fake as you really think\nBecause well when you're talking about folks about the homosexual affair and the marriage thing or whatever if you talk to the mission by issue is that lives up with\nMore of a conservative mindset but because of their best hope right brainwashed to fishing of racism racism racism racism you know it clouds their their their their judgment\nYou know I I Wonder 'cause you know we've talked about the identity politics with a with the ... with the Democrats in and the identity politics that are really I think come to the forefront because they're so radical is you know number one the transgender movement where if you're\nA a man you can be a woman and the the country in law's must ah recognize you that way and then what we've got into now is trans racial that if you're black you can be white and if you're white you can be black\nLegally and I started thinking about that and wonder how many 'cause we said that we said with the trans gender it seemed that there was more acceptance and when they jumped to the trans racial\nI said I think you're going to get a lot of blowback from a lot of black leaders out there stating wait a minute so you can be whatever race you want whenever you want to BS and I thought that was really interesting I Wonder if people thought that that was ... just a ... a lot of minorities might have seen that and said okay\nMaybe this is time for me to get on a different mindset as to where the Democrats are going\nBecause it's an exciting challenge is so what does the fight for a way yeah was it all in vain yeah right\nNo that's I I think that's the question that that many of us have been asking for a long time I mean when you think of the mindset from the the the the left right now that you can be whatever you wish to be now that includes gender or race\nSo there because there's transgender ism there's also a trans racial Islam and they want you to believe well if that's how you identify will hold on a second\nBecause if you look at a you know the the the civil rights at the protected groups created under the civil rights act\nIf there if you\nCan belong if anyone can belong to any protected\nGroup then they're\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than any dealer around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our high car buyers on top of\nCivil rights era and has done is it's over I I mean the the the civil rights act but everything that the civil rights era\nThat happened there all that entire battle is we're not\nAnd not only that you know the of the civil war was for nothing and wouldn't you fight against other oppressive a governmental systems\nYou know why did we fight this to say oh it's not that we should have done that uh we're we're on a different path now so I'm like no we are America this is America\nWe're not saying that we're as individuals better they ended by or any of the country where say our ideas are better than everybody else in order to other countries\nYes and ... and and and the goal would be to everybody to adapt the actual ideas in in in the constitution where they\nThey don't always do so and the other thing is too I mean there's also this thing that the less throws at the conservatives in at the right that you don't you won't acknowledge racism come on and we all know what are how horrendous racism in slavery and Jim Crow was\nAnd I don't know any conservative that which is to go back to that\nAnd my belief is the Democrats and I think about my grandfather my grandfather was the ... the Democratic chairman of the town\nThat we grew up in and he was because he emigrated from Canada and he came to town and they were all Republican and he just said well you got to have two parties you can have a system with but he was he was much much more conservative but he left the Democrats that well I I Believe\nMy father never had the official conversation with somebody and he died before I got to ask him but I said would ... be a Democrat today and he said no abortion abortion changed him a lot of the liberal politics or changed him but\nWhen you think of what they what the Republican but the Democrats\nUsed to claim in the seventies and eighties I cared about and then the identity politics where everything is about race everything is about gender and the whole cabinet thing where you saw that you must believe the woman well that's ridiculous if you must believes a woman will it used to be it must leave the white man over the black\nYou know over over the black person in a criminal justice in the black person you don't believe in the white person you believe you know you'd go by evidence\nAnd what I find in credit is what I find a credible is the bigotry and intolerance and the actual racism and sexism seems not to be coming\nFrom the Democrats\n'cause it will go when I talk to black men about a ... that situation um they fully understand\nThat the uh 'cause I don't you remember it was all white lady that was several years ago she ran away and uh she blamed it on to black males as so every\nBlackmail that within the city is okay but by the scrutiny that came out that she just wanted to run away or you know so\nSo I'm like well you have to understand that that\nIf you go to that system would be fully aware of that what you're trying to fight against cultural for which\nJames uh thank you so much ... some reshaping writes thoughts and uh\nYeah I mean you're not the first\nPerson who is called the show and said look I'm black try being meat and the conservative and live my life\nWhile you know what's interesting too is that you go through the day to day experiences and we hear that from callers uh every so often\nAnd and I think of and then you mentioned the signs in the yard I have a a a a neighbor I spend my neighbor for almost Fifteen Years at the end of my street he's so he's at the corner he's got a corner lot right\nAnd one of the street of that corner not not our street but the the the cross street there\nIs a is six lanes so there's a lot of traffic has the crew sign and another conservative that's running on the state level for for ah for Congress here um that is our our our congressmen on the state level\nAnd I just I just wonder I haven't asked him yet 'cause I haven't had a chance to talk to him he's a black conservative and I haven't had a chance to ask him has anybody ever tried to steal your science I mean not that they would know he's black and and that that would even matter to anybody on the left but you see the things on social media\nHas anyone ever tried to steal your signs you know from your guard because he has them right there on the on the side where the big street is and so I don't know\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred
