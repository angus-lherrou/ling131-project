Narragansett\nIt because people were essentially chomping at the bet to to vote to to get there say and who was at which group is that that is more motivated to get their first that can tell you something\nAbout the the point I was trying to bring is not not the Democrat or Republican but if you have if you know if ten percent or in the one case was at a in Florida eight Eighteen percent not affiliated were independence going right now where the polls on were independence live right now\nOur independence being affected by what is going on now independence for the most part did not like what was going on in the cabinet hearings\nWhich may be a huge uh you know a driver to the poll of independence but we're independence going in this election I haven't seen a lot of you know election polling analytics on independence\nWe've heard a lot about the enthusiasm Republicans and Democrats but of course that's key because independence and most elections decide you know where the country is going and and I just haven't seen much I'll I'll do some research on it now yeah I'm going to do more research to see what's out there\nOn on independence but it just popped into my head right now we spent so much time talking about were Democrats are Republicans are\nAre not realizing that a significant portion\nThe the determining factor of vote in most states is still you know those were the independents line mhm\n[noise] yeah you you get to the break down to the polls that we do have available to us and that number of I guess I'm not independence but\nUndecided voters starts to become much much smaller and that's where that's why we're you know for me\nI'm anxious to look at some some of the latest polls\nBecause [laughter] you go back to uh the Montana race or any of the other Senate races and if you've got numbers that are that are pre Kavanaugh that that's something very different I mean it's it's something that because people will make\nThis this inevitably happens the closer you get the more the the fewer undecided you have\nAn any given race and it's crucial just I think that it's the job of the pollsters\nTo to show those numbers as close to election days you can but you know again ah they haven't been as active as they were in years past and you and I've been following it you know for a while maybe that's going to change in in you know later this week\nWell we know for example that the internal polling that was being done roughly two to three weeks out of back in in twenty sixteen\nThe Hillary people knew they were in trouble in the internal polling you didn't hear a lot of talk about that at all in in the general public but after the election post election that's just started hearing that they saw the you know that that's when they started seen in some of those districts in those states\nYou know when we're talking about Pennsylvania and and and Michigan in Wisconsin that's where they saw some of the change at that point mhm\nAnd they said oh and you know they saw that swing at that point and in most elections as we see what you see in July is not necessarily what you see the last three weeks right now internally\nBecause they're doing the polling consistently\nYou have the political parties that have an idea they see where the momentum is going at this particular point\nBecause we are just two weeks out now so for the last week\nEspecially if you went inside most political parties and say ... what is your polling showing you're going to have one or another say okay the momentum is moving our way or is it moving our way mhm we just don't have access to those particular polls at the moment\nYou know well we know afterwards yeah because he the adult the analyze you know what happened in a you know particular\nYou know political election you know we'll we'll be analyzed after the election but it's what's happening right now in the internal polls are probably showing that but when we look at so many of the polls out there so that that haven't been taken in two three four weeks some even more than four weeks out\nWhat was going on in September\nIs not the mindset of the voter of a significant portion of the voter right now\nYeah I mean it's it's I think um it it will be interesting to see what the rest of the early voting in a turnout is like and and where those numbers comeback but but ultimately you have to get down to those polls in each of those individual races and I'd just\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nLeading up to that are leading up to election day at the two weeks from today by the way so um but the early voting\nOn Texas and Florida are you know will be interesting I think to watch but then you go to those tighter races I'm In Texas it's it's a war\nAnd and cruise the crews and latest poll has been ahead by at least in the latest two balls or by seven points or so and they are seeing the average he's up by seven and he said over fifty percent and and each of those last two polls so\nYou know that's not one that I Would call at this moment two weeks out assuming those numbers are still in that goes back a little over a week ago assuming those numbers still hold that's not one that I Would call a\nYou know neck and neck or or up in the air and undecided right now I'm you know too close to call if you will I think it's right now that momentum is with Ted Cruz\nAnd if you look at it for the last poll for the uh was uh I don't have it here in front of me the last poll for ... or a rock and Cruz was a week ago uh yeah it was a little over a week ago I guess my point would be that doesn't even include the last debate\nDoes yeah yeah that's and and that's my point is that is what I was I was asking you at the top of the hour or the or the crucial meeting\nI said you know because I Would I Would think that you would have won and maybe maybe we'll see one or later today or or Wednesday that covers the debate maybe they were waiting and and going through Monday to to have people digest that debate and\nUm you know I don't know I really don't know but I I expect we'll see some more polls\nBut they probably won't be as numerous\nAs what we've seen and and um the last month or two\nWe have a line open if you'd like to get in eight six six Ninety right I\nWas very much Ira and

headline that we'll get to in a moment\nBut uh as as you know the uh uh how Hollywood celebrities left going crazy the New York times story the other day that the Trump Administration may eliminate\nGender ... officially returned illegally identifying individuals as biological males or females ... and of course have gone nuts and the Babylon be which is like the onion a parity website\nParody news website ... of the greatest\nHad this could actually be a real headline in the left me a really good anti science Trump Administration to revert to a definition of gender to an objective scientific standard\nThe anti science anti facts Trump Administration is considering reverting the definition of gender to a biological objective and scientific standard drawing the anger of the pro science left\n[laughter] the party of science [noise] [laughter] they even have their own best science guy yeah I\nJust I just I we I was going to be muster up yesterday just didn't have time and I was just thinking what we were talking about\nYou know how the the expanding victim and oppressor base of All right the Democratic party right now we're talk we're using the example of the transgender movement against feminist mhm where feminists now and we've set feminism is dead if any man can be a woman whenever they wish to be a woman for sure I mean\nIf you look at the ... in fact the uh the civil rights act is is gone if anyone anyone simply by claiming simply by claiming can belong to any protected group there are no protected groups right\nAnd we saw this with the whole bit war in a while [laughter] messier equally mathematics lesson for last week well [laughter] it's also strategy less on what not to do but it\nMoney and doesn't matter what their goal is are are they stealing or ah right they still waiting for money right a buddy\nThrown in jail colonial because it was it was it was coupled [laughter]\nAnd I don't know I mean it was real bad [laughter] but the but the thing is is that um the the\nIt was it was part of the whole well there's too much money in politics or oh who's the guy that was on um\n[noise] he used to be on CNBC then he went over to MSNBC or Dylan Ratigan you know that was his ... and he had had the fake anger\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and there were against that have the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if you are for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nOh Casio Cortez she spent next to nothing compared to her opponent Hillary want Hillary didn't win right\nBut I Know but nobody in a life really has complained about money in politics right so right Hillary so it was funny because some I saw that on social media somebody said hello Trump won because of the money and that's that ... know\nHillary raised more money and then they just shut up they were quiet life right ah but look at look at a a look Democrats don't complain about money in politics them if they're raising the money ... you see that in the exact nope nobody's complaining about not I've\nNot heard one Democrat come out and say it's just wrong in that Robert Francis O'Rourke is raising on President had money for ...\nRight now in fact it's quite the opposite they're they're promoting the idea you have sons is a good thing\nSo when that started coming out and that was McCain ... you know that was McCain fined gold and and and that's when the rules and regulations came out as two groups of people that\nCouldn't that couldn't run advertising or you know within ... sixty days of of an election I Believe ... sixty this within an election because it might influence an election right well that's the only reason you're running ads is to influence an election and the reason you run ads close to an election is to influence an election\nAnd at that point we just said do these people understand\nHow the country was formed do they understand about the partition of government for redress of grievances irrespective of who that group is do they actually understand that and clearly they didn't want to understand it so we said this back going back ten Fifteen when you when I started working together\nSo going back Thirteen an ... maybe almost Thirteen and a half years ago right when you and I got together and I know we were saying that beforehand ... it's like we said we don't believe in the first amendment you don't believe in the second amendment and so that's grown and grown and grown and grown and grown and since that time we have said look if you don't believe\nIn these major tenants of the constitution of the United states you actually don't believe in the United states right and now we're to the point here where they don't believe in the Senate they don't believe in the the well the ... was it came out said that the presidency was adequate\nYeah that was a few weeks ago was that that was Michael Moore wasn't Michael Moore so it was somebody in that same it was the same time well no it was at the same time when he said it's over that the ... century essentially the the office of the president of the United states you know it's over this is you know it's it's now gone it's\nAnd then someone in that same period said we we need to do away with the presidency\nAltogether right and so but we've heard the electoral college just to go now it's the Senate that has to go right that's being picked up by more on the left every single day if you go to social media well it's just not fair of a sudden it needs to go\nSenate needs to go to and as we've said that is extremely important because if you do understand the constitution which unfortunately\nThe majority of America does not\nYou seen the polls majority of Americans can't tell you what the three branches of government are they can't tell you what the rights are in the first amendment to the constitution they don't know they a lot of them don't care\nBut the majority of Americans don't know according to the polls and when it comes to the ... you know the separation of powers the three branches of government that's the vast\nMajority of Americans can't tell you that well then you don't even know how our country works\nWhich I then we have stated we understand why people say the country isn't exceptional you don't even know what makes us exceptional right or if you believe that the Senate shouldn't be gone if you believe that the electoral college should be gone you don't understand the basis of what this how this country was formed that it wasn't that that it wasn't on a pure democracy\nIt was on a representative government we're the minority would be protected were individual rights would be protected something that the left used to understand and promote\nAnd now they don't care as long as it's\nAs long as it's they they don't care to protect the minority as long as it's the minority that they don't care about them or they don't care about individual rights as long as it's individual rights of people they don't care about right and but when you get down to it it's a clear under a not understanding of how the country was form so\nWe have said that that's a huge issue for many conservatives because they do understand the constitution and they understand everything that we just talked about right now\nAnd that has energized them to go out and vote so beyond just because the Democrats were against a nominee that Trump picked because Kavanaugh went way beyond Trump that's why you had the conservatives or never Trump hers come ...\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nA Republican or Republican Party so you can look at that you can look at some of that may be driven by the fact that look we're concerned about the house because the whole Russia investigation goes away if we lose the house and uh also when it comes to judges the fact that if they win the Senate\nOr ... and Trump has another chance to get another judge in maybe in the next couple of years and that would be unprecedented because conservatives understand that if you can have the construction of sport and you can have\nOf not only five to four but it's six to three ... that that could move the country in the right direction for the next generation and that's extremely important and the other thing is and this is new and it's the caravan\nSure and it's it's interesting too is that if you you mentioned it earlier but it bears repeating here they even if the care of and and it likely won't reach the border before election day two weeks from today that the news cycle is what's keeping that story there and and\nWe've talked often about how the news cycle you know changes so not drastically but so often\nUm and the because the protest by the left is one thing even even during the Kavanaugh a confirmation process itself what was the first protest\nAll those documents remember we need to be able to agree we need time Dr you that that was their first protest was that it became about Dr Ford\nBut we said after he's confirmed whatever happens in you know we didn't make it a a production but if he's confirmed on a Saturday through the vote this was before the confirmation vote then on Monday and they'll move on to something else as they did\nBecause it it but there is there's a the pumping there's a new protest and new hot button or almost daily but certainly a couple of new ones every week so we got two weeks left so you got the care of and that's that right now is new but that goes back\n... if you I guess this adds onto a consistent issue that's been around for a long time but the Republicans thanks to this current president when he was campaigning for president\nOh and\nIf you think about it you know everybody talking about the conspiracy theory and who's paying for it and who's not paying for it\nIt is working for the right it is a motivator for people on the right to get out and protect because if he needs money for the wall he needs the house the president if he's going to get money for the wall he's going to need the house\nRight and and so to me this has been a huge motivating factor and\nI saw the other day that after uh the the illegal immigrant caravan them which is to get into the United states from Honduras that they walked about nine hours right well at that and and blisters and they were going to rest\nHer a wild well at this pace they won't get to the United states for a month right so ah you know if that was the pace that they are are are going at as to you know who was supporting them you've got you know a right wing website stating far right wing website stating that it's you know ... groups you of the wall Street Journal\nStayed in you know basically they're not sure they talk about the leftist politician in Honduras that organized system started it\nAnd then they were surprised how quickly or the number of people got aboard they talk about the people without frontiers the U.S Mexico a group that has got involved in it who directly is giving the money nobody is really short here at this\nParticular moment yeah a lot of these groups are have funding in the past from folks on the left including cirrhosis but whether they have directly given the money or not who knows right but the fact is if they are right now it's working against them will have some audio coming up here just a little bit actually from

problems at all mhm and and I feel blessed because of it but I Know last as I was telling me ... or ... yesterday that last week\nI still can't get on a regular schedule where you sleep you know really one time of day who did day shifted so tough now I'm back on this ship sleeping twice a day 'cause that's what I did when I came on this shit and I you remember I just said I'm going to you know I couldn't\nI was trying to figure out okay what time can I sleep well I Can't do that with my body my body tells you when it's time to sleep yeah and and I'm Glad that I can pick up on what my body tells me that because it's twice a day I go home and I go to sleep and and and then I sleep again at about five to six o'clock when my body gets tired\nAnd you know I mean you know what a disciplinarian I Am at that people that know me and to me my whole life said you really became disciplined I mean you have to sleep during those times and I said if I don't it throws up my tier mine my mind is gone if I don't\nIf I don't do it but because I'm a because I'm On that schedule\nRarely do I ever\nHave to you know take even anything over the counter mhm anymore I\nI was for a little while they're taking the melatonin maybe once in a while and sometimes on weekends I may have to take a little bit of it because my\nI changed my my sleep pattern but that's even rare now I'd decided no just sleep and if you wake up in the middle of night get up you know do some stuff for an hour and I go back to sleep and it was my ... my my dentist my uh who\nAre is asleep therapist who who uh\nSaid when I told him I scheduled 'cause he was always concerned as my dentist 'cause he was also wanted to sleep therapy\nAnd I told them I scheduling what oh she's asleep twice a day goes when that's how the basically the caveman used to do it came I used to go to sleep like seven o'clock there was no TV they went to sleep seven eight o'clock\nThey woke up and midnight one o'clock and set up for a couple of hours him back to sleep again that's how human beings used to do it and he said so you're basically into it and he said do you\nFind many problems and I haven't had any problems no type of medical problems but to me the only thing that really insurers\nAre that I've I mean it it's almost that I Do have to I Do have to work out almost every day working out does make a difference for me ... tiring out my body does make a difference doing physical activity\nI'm having trouble uh getting to sleep I have trouble finding the time I mean my my life is so busy it ... it literally is

home and I had some Monday morning you know when I when when it was time and I knew that wouldn't be that wouldn't cause me any any problems but you you have to do that and it also has to include like for me to the difference with people I Know people that can like drink coffee\nYou know full strength coffee and have no issues um it's you know comedians and cars getting coffee\nIt's amazing to see Jerry Seinfeld loves coffee\nAnd he talks about it and he's they drink you know it looks like he's drinking at least two or three cups if I had two or three cups of coffee and today well then that would be no but I just couldn't I couldn't do that I can drink a total of maybe one and I'm good but\nThe I have to know the the point being is I have to know that I've got to keep exercising I've the

there um and and maybe it's because I'm aging I it's not about insomnia for me it's about schedule a typically lately it has not been this this past weekend was a total anomaly but\nTypically it has been here lately you know getting to bed a and getting a good seven hours of sleep on the average um and I I Do notice the difference is that it does it is you are a especially physically you're

... they all have their their hours of service\nYou know based on operating you know the the aircraft are operating the big rig\nAnd I for me I don't know how someone could sleep in a you know in the cab of a truck for me I ... and I I think I guess eventually I'd get used to it but\nBecause you've got to ... you got to create that sleep environment right or or uh people tell me though the same thing I don't know how you sleep during the day I don't know how you sleep all night um or or stay up all night and sleep during the day but for twenty two years now I've been I've been doing that and

I don't know I don't know how we did that you can't get a routine down ... got to have your routine and that's the whole thing you've got to have your routine\nOr whatever that is uh that worked for you whatever works to get that sleep you've got to stick to that and that has to be disciplined and you know it's a habit\nThat I I don't know if they still do that is in law enforcement and yeah but to me that ... that are well that would be an an alert is concerned yeah are you alert when you're out there well I guess you've got to change sleep shifts like yeah I that would be a ... total concerned\nYeah I have a friend who's been a prison guard for a long long time and that's that's kind of what they do they it's called that's called shift work right where you're changing you know that that your routine\nAll the time my dad did that he was talking to me about recent he said I I still don't know how you do this and I said well that it's easier than what you describe a back into your military days he would do that when he was a military police officer in the air force they would do shift work especially in the early days\nOr when he Rosen rank that you know changed he didn't have to do that but uh you know for the longest time they did the same thing and uh as an MP and he said that was just for me he said that was just difficult it was impossible because you don't have a routine\nYou know I think I Can't do is on Sundays when I go back to my regular sleep shift yeah I get up at like five in the morning yeah I have to change it a little bit I have to get up so I'm
