Gordon the Chinese side of the story\nHas lots of millions of people at risk here for a weakening economy in China because of the tariffs maybe tens of millions of people do they have a voice Gordon and the way our manufacturing base has a voice\nIs a very loud voice these days of the Trump Administration do the Chinese manufacturers have a voice in Beijing\nWas a great question John and you know in the Chinese system um it is a complex series of bargaining among coalitions groups factions and political leaders so they do have a voice but it's very different from the voice that we have in our political system\nWhich has direct because as you pointed out we've got mid term elections we've got of course presidential elections\nThey don't really have that but it does mean teaching paying faces almost an election every day and that's a very different dynamic of course\nThe report from China and these last hours and in these last days is that the purchasing managers index which Gordon is taught me to pay much attention to\nIs that fifty point too which is lower than the expected fifty point six and a Reuters poll down from fifty point eight in September whatever means it's weaker than it was so we welcome our colleague Andrew Collyer\nHe is in Hong Kong and he watches the Chinese economy extremely carefully\nA Andrew a very good morning to you and Hong Kong these purchasing managers index is a confused me and there's another headline saying the site chin ...

Lincoln Navigator one Lincoln of never against it on parallel Marjorie impeccable says\nAnd the prime minister of India and ...\nThey are two parts of what is called the Indo Pacific Claude India\nJapan Australia and the United states all day and and Modi both share democracies are they both have aggressive modern warships what are they what are they what are they looking to do with each other and how does how do they regard China collectively good evening to\nGood evening John and Gordon and to your listeners around the world John and very happy Halloween to all of you\nUm you know it's a good good point John the or the Japanese and the Indians share both a common values and also a common threat perception there is a view that is very widely held in both Tokyo and in India\nOr that China's aggressive build up its military capabilities and its use of both military\nAnd economic tools as well as its diplomacy are coming at these countries expense including the region in a bit of a danger where uh it's possible Beijing may use coercion and unto on toward influence to try to put these countries\nNational security at risk so you saw the prime minister of Japan visit Beijing where he and Xi Jinping met late last week the very next day he was back in Tokyo and met with prime minister Modi at the foot of mount Fuji\nWhere he invited him to his private residence and signed a host of deals and announced a number of other initiatives all designed to signal a very strong bilateral relationship between Tokyo and New Delhi Gordon\nScott you mentioned that a prime minister Abe's hosted a the Indian prime minister at his private home in\nAt the base of mount Fuji um what struck me about all this is the uh when I went to Beijing did it just seemed a little bit stiff of the meetings that he had in the Chinese capital\nBut to his relations with Modi were very warm and and this strikes me is is not just a personal relationship but as you point out\nI'm In Japan and India seeing a common interest um if you could talk a little bit about the the warmth of the relationships that has had with ... and the significance of going forward\nSure yeah I think there's no doubt you know the\nThe Japanese generally and the prime minister in particular do feel a a a very strong sense of shared identity as a democratic country and Asian democracy that has legitimately embraced and built its own version of democracy\nOr and and that shows through in the personal relations between\nUh the prime minister and his Indian counterpart but also between other Japanese officials and their Indian counterparts what's not oversell this\nWorking with India is still recognized in Japan to work in progress very promising but it has been very promising for a long time so it is not always easy as you've seen they had been negotiating arms sales and other types of a defense cooperation\nFor quite a number of years it's not necessarily the case that this confluence of interest in threat perceptions immediate ... results that one might hope\nBut there is a great sense of optimism that at least the direction is the right one and that they can build a closer relationship by contrast the Japanese recognize that China's in a very difficult place right now I Believe your previous guest just outlined some of the economic difficulties China's facing they're also of course facing a difficult relationship with\nThe American administration and the recent election in Brazil is likely to put even further pressure on Beijing such Japan recognizes that China's outreach now is almost entirely tactical it's an attempt to alleviate pressure on Beijing\nNot genuinely motivated by any change in thinking of by Beijing about the grand strategic relationship it wants to have with Japan\nAnd similarly the Japanese recognize that and say okay we'd be happy to work more closely with you on terms that we can accept but we're not going to wreck we're not going to believe that this represents any kind of a sea change or permanent solution to the problems that led us to the difficult place where they were the two sides were in over the last several years\nScott were told there is a claw the Indo Pacific region Claude India Australia Japan and the United states is that aspirational or is that actual\nI think it's a great question John you know I I Do think that this was an aspirational\nAbout a dozen years ago at that time a there is a force side there was not entirely a confluence of uh of ...\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne has over one hundred brand new borders gates were just one twenty nine per month that's why one twenty nine Vermont blood as every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nI Will say though that uh there continues to be a need to build a practical meat around the bones of the quarter lateral dialogue and grouping\nOf course do do some military exchanges of exercises and in fact the recent visit by the Indian prime minister to Japan has led to an upgrading in India Japan defense ties with\nMore regular eyes high level contact including a two plus two dialogue bits firmly been announced where the Japanese and Indian foreign and defense ministers will meet and the two sides will work more closely to invest in\nCapabilities that are dual use including a code developing a artificial intelligence of robotics and working more closely\nOr in male male exchanges but to be sure there is much much work left to do and it would be premature just in the quad has reached its full potential\nGordon Scott you know I listen to you describe the relationship between Japan and India one could say many of the same things between India and the United states it's a great relationship but it's got a long long way to go I mean do you see any parallels there\nOh absolutely I mean I think that the reality with India is it is a country with enormous potential\nUh and unfortunately also enormous obstacles to realizing the full measure of that potential\nUh India continues to have a large uh amount of attachment to its previous or and continues to have a non allied policy or a policy that cherishes autonomy and devoid of any kind of a formal alliance relationship with any other country\nThat is in some ways quite limiting of course India also has a large number of captured or vested interests in its\nDefense industrial base as well as the broader economy that kind of complicated\nBlock or at least make difficult any sort of a deepening of are really meaningful deepening economic ties including defense industrial ties so I Do think there are a lot of parallels I think that the good thing here is that the U.S and Japan is very close allies are working very closely to try to encourage the Indians\nTo find ways to uh work within their system to try to put pressure\nOr from the outside welcome pressure pressure that new tally can use to say what we want to do this with the Americans and the Japanese and in order to cooperate more deeply we need to make some changes domestically\nIn the Japanese contacts does you know Gordon this used to be referred to under still referred to as ... or use for foreign pressure that kind of pressure can help India\nTo make forward progress I'm kind of breaking up some of the cartel like structures that domestic economy and opening it up so that they can capture some of the real dynamism that exist in India is highly educated extremely skilled workforce that is unfortunately still in some cases\nAre trapped in the ... industry structure that persistent that economy in some places\nGot Harold is full political scientist he's also deputy

investments in there and for infrastructure but I think their preference would be to have the United states there are with a little bit more of a of a presence there and I don't think we need to\nMeet them on that scale I think there are ways that we can be helpful to them in terms of technology and other a smaller initiatives that to give them a sort of force multiplier is and I'll give you an

can they joined in this partnership to provide security and freedom\n[noise] um well I Would say that uh and and my visits and almost every place I went I did meet someone from Australia uh either from Australia navy or Australian Government consulates a Japanese as well so there there is a presence there for certain um I don't think\nThe Indians have arrived as much on the scene yet but not not to say that they're not I just did not encountered when I was there\nAnd is that something the U.S navy a can work with in other words we've been we've been uh the dictator and sit in the in the

there\nCan those warships or at least the personnel from those warships reassure Oceana that they're not to be left alone\n[noise] oh I think I think we definitely can I mean that is one thing that came up everywhere we went was they would like to have more ship is it's I'm not just for the sense of security\nBut also just to demonstrate our our ah our interest and those nations the the the cultural exchange that happens when\nOur sailors come ashore [noise] uh the opportunity to get to know is better to sort of have I'd I interaction with the people I think of something that they really really value and frankly we've we've not done as much of that because for a variety of variety of reasons we have high end warships that have\nHigh end missions and operational requirements for those missions has not subsided so we have to think about different ways there where we can establish that presidents were looking at ways that we can possibly get our\nHospital ships out there again a to

commuting distance from New York threatens very easy\nAnd close by the train station new hope is also there so there's a lot of trend in this at the edges of a box county it's well to do I underline Laura a very good evening to you the race here is for is for the professional and veteran Brian Fitzpatrick who's the incumbent Republican\nHe's challenged by Scott Wallace however you've sent me a link\nPolitical apple is like the takes us inside this not just about them but about how the district is polling on issues right now is ready to lean D for two polls icy and toss up for one poll how to read this is a political scientist what does this tell us about the rest of the nation as well good evening to\nGood evening John thanks for having me on tonight this is such an interesting district because the cook Political Report rates it as a toss up seat on the University of Virginia is crystal ball rates as a toss up seat by every measure that we know Brian Fitzpatrick is\nAn incredibly I'm\nSort of well received and well liked incumbent Republican and in any other year I think most people would assume\nThis district was going to fall his way because he has been somebody who has tried to really represent his district not necessarily his national party um\nBut what is true in the numbers in this amazing political atlas a website that the ... Center for politics and it says has created\nIs it you can see in snapshot fashion how he is being dragged down by other factors kind of within his party\nOn the first one being that we're in his suburban um district that Trump approval rating is twenty nine percent I'm so that is a good you know\nSort of twelve to Thirteen percent below the national average for President Trump\nAnd there's no doubt that sort of the the disapproval of Trump is dragging on Brian Fitzpatrick on reelect possibilities\nI'm looking at the main issues on social media this is statewide not just the first district President Trump dominates thirty three percent second of course in health care and Supreme Court\nHealthcare favors the Democrats if I understand that this election talking about Obamacare has suddenly turned into a positive because the Republicans fumbled it in the first year of the president's term\nSupreme Court that looks like a mixed bag because of the Kavanaugh a scandal and how it ended\nI can see that there's polling pushed but to remind the rest of the nation and did not grow up in Pennsylvania this is a county Bucks County that entirely reads the New York times every day okay fine if it's in Pennsylvania but I might as well be in Manhattan there very well informed quite sophisticated heavy media all the time\nRhode Island's number one board do or is setting the standard again and again for borders over one of them are brand new border states we're just one forty nine Vermont that's like one twenty nine promote flood of every dollar every option and everything you're looking for like four dollars a job\nThat they're sensitive to Trump no the Democratic candidate here Scott Wallace he then has very little to do other than to emphasize the trumps in every headline is that the campaign lower\n[noise] well I think so certainly I Would imagine that he is trying to create distance from ... Brian I'm fitzpatrick on the issues around health care or say around 'em guns but again\nI mean one of the things that is true is that fits Patrick has been incredibly moderate very reasonable he's actually I'm sort of one of the members of Congress who's engaged in um essentially what's called the problem solvers caucus so\nHe is somebody who is kind of modeled this notion of we should be civil work across the aisle find\nPlaces where we can connect and I think what's so interesting about\nThis contest is how this contest goes on election I Will tell us a great deal about how a lot of the other suburban districts in the country will go and so this is certainly one to watch and it's one\nIn the east you know a poll closing time in Pennsylvania I Believe is eight o'clock I'm Virginia will close at seven\nUm but we will have a sense of really where this is going when we look at a seat like this on election night and we look at a seat like I'm Barbara Comstock in Virginia\nThis is Pennsylvania where the Supreme Court re district between the last election in this election of this district ... in a slightly different configuration was plus nine for ... over a plug to for ... twelve and plus two for Hillary Clinton\nIn sixteen so it with a Republican as representative so it's a perfect target for the Democrats if they're to move the needle back to their side of the majority Laura let's go to the larger map\nThe conventional wisdom last week when we talk\nWas that the Democrats take the house somewhere between twenty three and forty feet a pickup which would give them majority and the Republicans hold the Senate possibly to pick up has anything moves in the last week\nUm I don't think so I mean there is this question about whether or not\nThe Texas race between Beto O'Rourke and an incumbent Senator Ted Cruz is essentially narrowing and becoming more competitive there was a poll out today that suggested that the distance between them was more\nLike three percentage points\nAnd not a six percentage points\nI think that's going to be um very much a function of turnout and then there's also this question of how much immigration versus health care really plays in sort of the important states the states like North Dakota where\nThe incumbent Democrat Heidi Heitkamp is trying to um\nSecure reelection where Joe mansion in West Virginia is trying to secure his reelection um those are the states where really this question of will the president's um desire to focus on the caravan and illegal immigration\nAnd asylum seekers or will um the Democrats desire to focus on the need to protect pre existing conditions and support the um Affordable Care act that's what will matter\nLara Brown is a political scientist she's also professor George, Washington university and we're looking at a website political hyphen atlas dot com with a great deal of detail I mean it's just granular to the nth degree so if you're a geek like me you can stare at this on election night\nThe district we've been talking about his first Pennsylvania Scott Wallace was raised and norm is amount of money compared to his income but he's raised Thirteen million dollars he has two million on hand as opposed to Brian Fitzpatrick who's raised only three million dollars in comparison to that used to be a lot of money in the first district\nAnd he only has less than half a million dollars on the hand on hand so that this is an example of how the Democrats have overwhelmed the Republicans will fund raising in this cycle I'm John ... this is the John ...

Lincoln him Casey and the whole new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled Marjorie impeccable surface\nForward as most well two dollars or five dollars a month for\nOr twenty five dollars donated\nThis is Bob zoom in on I Want to thank your listeners for their remarkable long term generosity behind the black really appreciate most welcome I'm John ... [noise]\n[noise]\n\nI'm Tony DeJesus from big blue bug solutions I've been in the pest control business a long time and one thing I've learned is that you never stop wearing\nAnd the greatest aside from the ... tradition\nIs that prices give you information about good so worth without having to do detailed inquiries as to whether the people think do or want it makes it an exchange system rather than an administrative system it's more subtle it's more responsive and in the end it works better for everybody\nThe president's council of economic advisors Richard has a link to the report has issued the opportunity costs of socialism Richard is giving the overview very quickly we're going to plunge into this\nBecause democratic socialism does not make common sense period however it's important to pull it apart on the basis of what it believes is in his historical precedent\nThat would be the nineteenth century and the language of Carl Marx as inherited by the man who you know we call Lenin or the definitions Richard applies in his defining ideas beside never looked at them as closely as I did and Richard definition because they don't make any sense on the one hand we have\nA definition of socialism that includes these words regulated by the committee as a whole what the heck is that I asked myself the other definition we have is collective ownership of the means of production what the heck is that I asked myself\nThen the updated version this is for the twenty first century by those who call themselves democratic socialism Megan Megan days Richard citation pooling societies resources to meet people basic needs what the heck does that mean I think Richard the language here is so inexact\nIt's dumb sounding because it doesn't have history and when we offer examples you just did with Venezuela we can talk about you but we can certainly talk about what happened to Russia\nWhen we offer historical examples in which they shuffle aside and say now now\nThat was failure we're going to do it right Richard I do not believe that we can we can debate with people who don't do history\nI certainly won't be able to do it right but let's just go back to the analytics of the\nPoints any serious activity requires joint cooperation either through exchange or through corporate businesses are corporations but when you start talking about the collective ownership of a from these are self identified people who pick their friends put together\nAnd then when they do is they put together goods to sell to the world or shares that they could sell the other people and everybody knows the business that they're buying from or the business that they're buying into so the collective ownership is a way of combining labor and improving productivity\nWhen you say the collective means of production are owned by the government that winnowing and sorting process no longer takes place and so which of the three hundred and twenty five million people in the United states are going to be at the\nHelm of which benches and want is going to be determined solely by a political process all political process these of these terms turn\nOut to be completely unstable because what happens if somebody gets in gets elected and appointed friends in cronies to take these jobs over\nThere is nobody who can discipline them by saying I'm not going to invest in your particular business because I don't think you have a decent business plan so they do is they expressed pay tax money and then they put it to ventures and they have no idea what to make her how to make it or why to make it so the system essentially\nUm this fused responsibility leads to nobody controlling anything which is not going to last very long or to these arbitrary groups coming in and taking over segments of the economy without\nThe consent of the people who invest and so if you ask a simple question Ken this collective pulled asset\nPlan and work with government control the answer is no now does government have a role in regulating the economy yes one of the things that you never hear talked about among socialist is how is that regulation actually\nThe Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve for your own condition at what point and he's written a generic ... that's right over two hundred\nThree on cars all makes all models and incredible prices logged on to flood Otto John job now\nTo do which is to control the use of monopoly power as it would otherwise exist by putting in a set of rates that leave enough money to the firms so it doesn't go broke but prevents those excesses this is a very hard road to follow but at least you know what the messages\nWhen they're talking about government regulation then I Try to talk about reaching some kind of competitive ideal they have no respect for Marcus no respect for competition no respect to the fundamental theory of economics which is that competitive solutions could not be\nTopped by any arbitrary solutions you put into place so the only question is when you can't have competitive markets a good capitalism is willing to think about limited regulations to create it but when you can have competitive markets the last thing you want to do is to have the socialist come along\nAnd wrecked them by taking over all the means of production\nI'm speaking with Richard Epstein at the Hoover Institution and he's a senior fellow he also teaches law at NYU and the University of Chicago we're dealing with the Democratic socialism idea of the campaign trail twenty eight dean\nTheir people to put a plug into this when we come back we're going to Elizabeth Warren in her concept of collective ownership of a corporation and how that works with the older concept of
