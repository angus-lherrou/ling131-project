of\nTerritory a look when you have the\nFederal Reserve chair or Jeremy Powell talking about the U.S economy being almost too good to be true and talking about how there's not going to be any recession until twenty twenty uh you know that's a that's a pretty good\nIndicator and I don't think he is someone who is political I don't think he's saying it ah except that's what he sees a and that's in spite of\nThe fact that the fed is going to be a increasing interest rates pretty steadily throughout the next year so right now um I don't see in the\nMarketplace any excesses that are particularly worrisome there is a lot of dead around but gosh guess white folks when you have one percent interest rates forever people borrow instead of issuing equity or whatever uh and that has had some impact\nProbably on stock prices but and it also has meant that interest or that the debt levels have gone up but it's not at all that kind of situation we had in two thousand seven two thousand eight when we all knew\nSomething was profoundly wrong there is no sense of that today whatsoever\nAnd the market is high and Main street is being a strong dollar so we're looking at a good Christmas

Amazon today announced today that they were going to be going wrong Fifteen dollars an hour\nFor all their employees others have raised wages to make sure that they have enough seasonal workers and the numbers that the increase year over year\nTarget I think was twenty percent they're not alone in that that that suggest that they're looking at incredibly good indicators are for the cause of upcoming holiday season and don't forget for many companies that's like two thirds of the year so it's hugely important I think we're going to have a gang busters fourth quarter\nAnd you know the question is then does all of that translate right well for the Republicans in the mid term elections it's hard to imagine that it won't it's hard to imagine that Americans are going to be\nI'm completely indifferent to the idea that Democrats could raise their taxes or at least roll back the tax cuts that came through early in this administration\nOr the people are saying there are other big concern is health care and I would say they're\nA Donald Trump talked about that today in his meeting with the electric or his speech to the electrical workers group a and talking about how the

and it's true by the way the other not American companies but many companies want to open in China they are not permitted ownership\nChina insists on these so called joint ventures which are in most cases provides them with fifty one hundred and fifty three or fifty five percent ownership us as a minority stake color white there is a huge problem\nBut the simple reason that the Chinese owners can command the American business people to literally lay down their loop prints on the desk\nAnd from there the technology opens up and that's how they do the stealing and that's how the force\nA turnover of technology that is in and said the essence now\nThey've had some very tiny false starts with it give some small financial companies ownership but guess what they will not grant a license

best for them is the author of the brave holy war called the ...\nThe reason we called the first World War right\nNow had to do with decisions made in Nineteen forty five to link some decisions made by Franklin Delano Roosevelt to call that the second World War so there was the first about for the generation that was dark and buy it was the great war the greater holy war I World war one became a religious crusade\nI'd always heard that there was I I used to propaganda language in order to convince people to continue the fight to pour their son's into the front lines in France and Belgium in order to convince the Americans that they were writing to the rescue\nBut in Phillips' book it's clear that the politicians and the Philo ... and the poets and the writers\nAnd the movie makers the filmmakers and the publishers all agree that this was a crusade it just happens to be a Christian versus Christian versus Christian priest crusade\nAnd the the ... the one country part of the triple on time that was most deep in religion where the star and the head of the uh the Russian Orthodox church were almost\nColleagues of friends in ruling the great Russia the most populous of all these nations is the one that has destroyed the most\nFill up your the language of the Russian Orthodox church in those days blessed all the soldiers that they went off and I believe the priest went with them is that correct\n[noise] oh sure yes uh I ... they are absolutely soaked in these ideas of of Russia as a whole nation of a ... nation\nI'm On the ... from ah the Bible and off it oaks tradition they're also using many a prophetic ideas for the circulating some from the middle ages which a profit saying how I'm a great and bra ugly draw a is destined to liberate the middle east to destroy\nA cookie I I Am so the Russia they support is a it is a mess panic a nation\nI mean if I could have been not just found a going you know if you want a president that's what\nA mainstream intellectuals I think in Russia which at this time is going through what one of the great religious revival of between ... century seemed on too much in that in a ... like what we know is going to happen with Bush revolution but the Russians it goes to war in Nineteen fourteen years aren't religious Christian\nNation it's concept of the you know any nation that if it if it's a middle aged\nWhat striking about Philips a presentation is that we've named these Christian nations\nBritain France Germany and Russia but they pull in the colonies who are question or are Christian icing the the colonies of Africa also they pull in that ... that the Ottoman Empire eventually coming in and the German side\nAnd that is the end of the caliphate that's the end of the leaf or as the Ottoman Empire is fractured in divvied up afterwards\nSo the language of crusade\nHas paradoxes that's the way I can express it fill up\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than any dealer around because we're surrounded by buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers on\nOn the side of the central power because the Germans were using crusader language I\nKnow partly because the uh the ticks themselves are also\nDesperate at this point to avoid being a petition to avoid having the nation are destroyed they'd like to have the as the Germans are there to protect into system\nThe British must be very very careful not to say that a lot of food because at this point the British Empire is the world's largest Muslim empire a it controls the world's largest Muslim population the British don't want those people going into revolt\nSo they have to work very hard to stop this natural urge people to say you know we we have taken Jerusalem this is a this is the final crusade a says that crusade to language is very dangerous the the Germans managed to keep it under wraps ah the the British really dumped\nOn they they fight on a ... in that campaign until the end and the crusade ends in Nineteen Eighteen with what I regard it's one of the great ironies with the war but British when the great victory in the middle east against the Turks ... where else Armageddon\nYeah oh for ... do the fake Islamic F ...\nAh yes will touch on Alan ... will get Alan ... entry into Jerusalem just one more detail Austria ... we call it also Hungary but it was in fact a blending of tribes in groups all jammed together it didn't much work it had been\nThat falling apart under friends do suffer about several decades now but in your book I learned that the Russians managed to come up with the way up denouncing\nThe ... there is a ... there's a drawing of a Russian poster showing what looks to be the devil was seven had power the Russians denouncing after all the parts were Catholics Dr Roman Catholics\nRight um so right away if you're from unorthodox point of view than uh the uh the the third heretic the yeah the Catholic or a a a deadly western enemy\nAnd when I came across that picture the person who are trying to get to know what it was it just seemed to be a picture of attracting with multiple heads but when you read ... if you look at it you see that it's um amongst with seven pets and the way they've created Germany and Austria\nIs um they've taken the individual member states like a king ... facts me and made each your head I'm the one to get to the magic number seven and the ... of the reason for that it's very simple because they've read that book of revelation\nThey know that one of the sons of the apocalypse one of the signs all the end times will be the rise of this great setting headed cracking on the Russians are saying well here it is it's in the central part of it in Germany and Austria\nAnd no matter what of vitamins we have to do to geography we're going to turn Germany and Austria into a seven headed a beast Soviet images all the uh uh the devil the beast or on a pervasive through the wall\nAnd there's a conflict that is a is every chapter of Phillips' book this is ... is this is a fight between Christian nation yes the caliphate is at the edge but it's chiefly\nProtestant versus Catholics versus Catholic versus orthodox and they struggle Philip what I learned from you everyone was confused by how it is they can define the other guy as the anti Christ right\nRight I said the only way Christians confide Christians in that way\nIs if they can present the enemy as being left and Christian or anti Christian so one country have to look at another one I think well they may appear to be Christian\nBut in fact they are so evil they're so bad that proved how hypocritical they are and that that even contributes to a making them even more\nA more diverse public so if you can save you another Christian denomination that's good if you can say that they're doing something very ... non Christians and that's the that's very powerful but the school is the enemy may seem to be Christian but in fact that not just anti Christian with us well they they are anti Christ\nLet's turn onto a left turn to how they proved the Germans were wrong right away from Catholic France's point of view of the great in holy war Philip Jenkins is the author I'm John bachelor [noise]\nNow that you were in eighth grade let's not talk about alcohol I Want to ask you to try to alcohol or what you doing

Ohio ... they're all in ... was born in religion or again but that's the way to work ... hours only goal models that incredible Russia's move on to John John no\nAnd what do they use that money for they buy weapons they recruit soldiers and they corrupt and bribe a law enforcement and institutions inside the country Colombia's courts are very much corrupted by drug money\nAnd this is just an example I mean the the special piece court was supposed to be you know uh the one where I Would interview them and find out what their crimes were and write them all down and this is going to be a way to sort of have a cleansing a spiritual cleansing of the country because everything would be out in the open and the criminals would have confessed\nBut it turns out that there's already corruption inside the peace court there are officials inside the peace court that had been cooking up a false ... says Martinez described it and and fraudulent testimony in order to help\nFor you know the FARC members basically escape and and and go off and do whatever they want to do so the court is corrupted and you know he says that he is going to prosecute this particular um series of people that he caught\nIf the court can be corrupted like that it will be corrupted again and again and again it will be very hard to keep up with it\nAnd you know one of my big problems with this court in general is that why should you have a parallel court system why\nShouldn't you say to somebody if you killed somebody over there you have to go to jail for Fifteen Years but if you're a card carrying member of the FARC and you killed somebody or killed five people all you have to do is come and tell us and you get to go free creating a parallel justice system is fraught with problems\nAnd aunt now you have another layer of problems on top of that which is the parent corruption of the court\nThe report you have from the southern district of New York seems important here Mary because we care about the US's participation over the years in solving Colombia's prices you report that two members of the FARC who were due to take seats in Congress\nAre now part of an accusation by in New York in the southern district of New York\nFor conspiring to import tons and tons of cocaine use some Greek\nAnd Marlin marine oh who is the nephew of an important negotiator for the event of group\nSeems marry this seems incredibly persuasive has got the attention of the new State Department that we then we signed on to an agreement\nThat is in complete violation of our laws not of not only just Colombia's laws and the the security of the of the new worlds but our laws our own were burdening are prosecutors\nWell you know I laugh when you say that because there were so many red flags before this thing was signed but the Obama administration John Kerry Bernie ... ads and we're all you know just then to on\nBurn errands and was the representative does that doesn't speak\nWho doesn't speak Spanish I mean who knows what he was doing sit around Nevada I don't know [laughter] but um you know ... this was all very apparent but they were bent on having this because they thought that it would be a legacy item just like opening\nTons of cocaine as a legacy item I well\nNow you're touching on what the ... you said you know our our is the U.S now aware of this what the us away is aware of is that the area of of ah Columbia that is used for cocoa crawling and the increase in a cocaine production has shot up\nAnd um you know now or as I said in my column I mean in many ways we're starting over again a president or ... or\nHad basically pacify many of the rural reaches of the country because he he returned the presence of the state to those areas\nPresident Santos pulled back from that he he basically gave an olive branch to you know all these different criminal groups while he was having this negotiation in Havana and he basically told them you know what we're not going to hold anybody accountable so what do you think the consequences of that are going to be people are going to say well crime pace\nAnd why why should I be sitting here earning minimum wage when I could be could be in this business and the other thing is that you know if you get these old guys who were the um you know you you mentioned the two that are out we were looking\nFor a recon marine but the nephew of market right exactly and\nHe's disappeared these older guys you know they have all the money they want that's backed away and you know offshore bank accounts and so forth so they're off\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they're all in for Steve we own condition it wasn't for the new religion or against it as white over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices are going to flood auto John job now\nIn the next ... and that's why so many of these guys are returning the has the money is in the cocaine\nAnd anything illegal businesses and to think that you're going to sit down in Nevada also those that really\nWas carve out an amnesty for these old guys who have enough money and are kind of tired of the foot rod and the jungle and want to come in he didn't do anything about actually change the dynamics of what makes the FARC of violent\nOr you know a drug trafficking organization\nJohn Kerry a President Santos Bernard errands and rock Obama have any of them commented on this district ... southern district of New York issue or the fact that the violence is increasing in Colombia\nOr the fact is that the Havana negotiation in twenty sixteen is now demonstrated to be in tatters have commented marry\nWell not to my knowledge I mean I Know that Santos said publicly that if these guys had violated that they um their pledge not to being cocaine trafficking\nAfter November two thousand sixteen that yes they should be arrested and I think he was even in favor of the extradition\nUm but other than that basically apologist for the FARC agreement are saying well the problem is the government because the government has a you know built the nice housing for these people and they haven't uh you know reintegrated them into\nThe ... it really goes well beyond that the\nGovernment hasn't delivered on its side of\nYou don't give us a gym so we go back to coke smuggling\nAnd well maybe it's not quite gymnasiums although they did ask for that but they claim that you know they they they don't have they they envision one thing about what they would get to sort of be welcomed back into society and the
