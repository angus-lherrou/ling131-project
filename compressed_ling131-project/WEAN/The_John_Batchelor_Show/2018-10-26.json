November fourth November fourth what does it mean why is everybody extradited why the concert All right we welcome Catherine ... power\nThe limits on cash family fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East policy former treasury official Kate a very good evening to welcome and I have been arguing\nYou know because we are getting in your presence between break in the break about what we're going to start with I Want to start with the swift Malcolm it All right but for his water use swift and why is just part of\nA sanctions on November fourth that everybody's pointing to good evening to you\nA pleasure to be with you um so so swift is a financial messaging service um it is I like to kind of explain it is it's like an email um it just carries a message from one thing to another state the predominant way in which banks send financial messages\nAnd financial messaging services are one of the activities that provision of financial messaging services to Iran it's one of the activities that will become sanction of all at the end of this wind down period that we're in right now that\nEnds on November fourth so as of November fifth that would be things shovel activity\nSo ... are there alternatives ... outside of the switch swift which you can use to force the zero important policy didn't\nSo so I should take a step back and look at the last round of sanctions I'm under the last round of sanctions swift um did cut off a number of Iranian banks and so that's what the U.S is seeking to see again um at least in part\nA what we saw then which that there are other ways to send messages\nAnd in fact a without the underlying relationships between banks that messaging services don't mean very much so if you think of the email analogy\nI could send you an email um but if you don't know me or don't want to have a relationship with me or not necessarily going to respond to it so it's not the way in which funds are moved its just the way in which messages their pets\nUm if you look at when the sanctions relief was put in place is another good way to consider it\nSo a lot of of of people thought that when Iran was given access again to the swift platform that it would be like turning on a switch and all of a sudden Iranian banks that he reconnected to the international financial system but of course that we didn't see that\nA lot of things were were wary to reconnect with Iran or for a variety of reasons that were uh in some way it's related to sanctions overhang but it related to all kinds of other compared to the only dealing with Iran and so does underlying relationships didn't necessarily materialize\nWhat we've seen since the U.S withdrawal from the uh the Iran deal and da da da da and gauge most of them have had since withdrawn those relationships are so it doesn't it doesn't necessarily matter as much it's not a silver bullet\nUm if the banks won't uh aren't willing to do that the business anyway and I think that that actually the announcement that this special purpose vehicle that the Europeans have had said they're going to put in place\nUm to try to maintain a financial linkage with Iran when the sanctions that reimpose is kind of an endeavor indication and acknowledgement um that those banks with or without swift aren't going to do it and they're trying to find an alternative even though it's essentially a barter system that they're proposing\nIs not likely to be very effective given the pianist record but I'm going to the issue with two things one we know that he run will look for ways to abate any kind of restrictions so we see now owned\nWhat's your Chevy GMC Honda Toyota and should we all have in common they are all in for Steve we own tradition of what they really should know against the white over two hundred dollars all make almost incredible prices will go to John John now\nAlso means for us to track the money flowing in Iran so those who raised concern that we're going to lose that information you know valuable information for tracking the Iranians ... is an alternative means to do so\nSo up first I think that that some of the the the conversation around living access to to to tracking Iranian activity it's it's a little bit of it as a Garbo and there's there's two things that are apples and oranges there is a program called the terror finance tracking um\nI'm Sorry T. after the terrifying attracting program that uh that the Treasury Department administers and has since uh shortly after nine eleven um through which they receive a information from swept under subpoena can be searched to look for terrorist financing activity\nUm and that's that's a separate kind of program ah\nThis this with and that continued when a Iran was taken off of swept previously under the previous round of sanctions\nUm so I think that those are two issues that are getting max but but on the issue of rainy and ... of course first of all there's other ways that they can send these messages and that they did last time whether it's by facts or email you know we're anyway just to to signal that they want to move funds from here to their\nBanks that are willing to take this nation's risk of dealing with Iran um you know after November fifth are probably going to do so regardless of whether or not Iran is on the switch program to city oh go ahead\nDon't know I I I don't want us to run out of time and we did not ask you about the efficacy of the sanctions so far no\nShe was she did address that in the in your opening about the first round I mean we we try to keep track of the companies should have pulled out we tried to report because people don't know would you judge the after to see the first round of sanctions just successful and really impacting the target you saw\nI think that's a really important question and ... as we approach November effect because I've I think one of the things to remember is that there were these two Ninety Days and a hundred and eighty Dave wind down periods\nOr what that meant is that businesses had that period to to pick up any business that had been allowed that they were doing\nAnd that a lot of of firms acted very quickly after the announcement and and ... and so I'm In terms of of assessing the ethic of yet but I think you've already seen a lot of pressure um that that's going to be brought to bear through both the first\nYeah the sanctions that went back in place um August ... well before then just as you're going you know we've probably seen a lot of the impact\nUm that we're going to see a ads have November fifth ah because this activity should have a already stopped and in fact\nBecause this idea of sanctions snap back within which was written into the J sepia way perhaps not for a scene in this away a but most firms that that that would have ... gauge would have had plans on the shelf to put in place to to quickly wind down to business\nCatherine Bauer Cape hours the bloom and Stein

strong bond between the U.S and Israel and I and I will say that\nYou know a President Obama had differences with ah with Iran as you point out\nBut where it came to a to helping Israel with with with funding um he was right there and we've always had a uh for the past twenty or Thirty years we've always had to both presidents from both sides of the aisle\nAnd bipartisan when\nThe relationship and

people like Tea Party people from the ... from the right all the way to uh extreme of a progressive or on the on the left\nAnd everybody voted for it and then we did it because we handed out and we we we we moved to head\nAnd we talked a lot about Israel and the United states and I'm going to keep doing it I I Know that it's going to be some some difficulty but I'm I'm ready for the challenge and I have a lot to say I've been working this issue for a long time and I look forward to sitting down with all of my colleagues and trying to help convince them that Israel is the best friend we have in the\nMiddle a it is true that you are very very and very likely to be the chairman of the house foreign affairs committee if your party is accessible in the mid term but I'm not certain that that's

of people a Syrian ... citizens who were just murders and killed by Assad and his henchmen with the backing of Iran with the backing of Russia um it it it's just something that just just has got to break your heart from a from a human a point of view and\nI'm ... we're not done obviously there's still there's so many many difficulties with a with Syria and many many difficulties that is why it's important I think for the United states to continue to ah to talk to all sides and to to have a working relationships with ah with country\nOne more detail ... one more detailed Eliot the American embassy is now in Jerusalem does that make it easier to deal with the Palestinians your measure\n[noise] well to tell you the truth is John I don't think it ... makes it easier or or harder\nUm we we passed a law uh I Wish I voted for twenty three years ago a which ask that the embassy be moved to Jerusalem and there was a waiver in it\nAnd every president since then use the waiver\nUm and a President Trump and I have many disagreements with him but President Trump to his credit\nI'm signed it to a signed the move in and didn't use the waiver and I think when Congress shows a and intent or to go in a certain direction I just don't think it should be disregarded and these were bipartisan or was it was several years\nAnd um I I think that it's where it belongs now if the Palestinians and the leadership really wants peace\nIt it shouldn't have any effect on it you need to just sit down you can't have have an agreement if people won't even come to a to the negotiating table and whatever one thinks of\nA two state solution and I still favor a two state solution um the fact of the matter is that during all these negotiations since Oslo uh Israel was ready on two occasions\nTo

Latin America or we have a lot in common and uh there's there's a lot that we can do\nAnd we should do it when we were last in the majority I was chairman of the western hemisphere subcommittee and we

story that looks positive the vice president of China visiting Israel to whatever\nIs a I think a very interesting story because it's kind of thing to get very little attention but I think long term has great significance\nBecause for for a number of years there's been a an organization to Israel China joint committee on commission on innovation\nAnd cooperation and uh this is a body to meet annually and was under the guidance of a very high ranking Chinese official but the government of trying to clearly has upgraded this and designated a vice president who's I think number eight in the hierarchy\nTo come a ... a a cool and I think is his name and as I said a very significant player very close to the present Jean and he came and visited and publicly\nAppeared with the prime minister and that they opened a conference at the Paris center in Maine for the late president of Israel Shimon Peres\nWho appeared in a hologram engaged a spiritual will because it's you know he was always the one talking about nano technology and\nAll sorts of a missionary uh have used for Israel and seeing Israel as technological has been in it strengthened even Jack Ma was there many others came a but the relationship with China to Israel despite the fact that on the run and other things are tensions\nAnd the investment in the nineties it was fifty million dollars Chinese investment in Israel in sixteen\nIt in in twenty sixteen it was a sixteen and a half billion dollars\nAnd so the trade is growing or all the time the trade with the Arab world is like a hundred and Seventy one billion but the differences that that's mostly sale of consumer goods lower and good with Israel it's high tech it's IT ah and you know there are restrictions cause it's real ... doesn't sell military technology\nBut health care and and the other things that that can be beneficial sustainable development and thinks that the that China really needs and they find the news where they bought a dairy from Israel because they found out that the cows give more milk and they they are now working cooperatively in many areas\nAnd at the same time they still have a relationship with the Palestinians they vote in the un with them um but no longer have the pressure you know that the Arab states with that\nLooking for a car credit not very well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east

auto dot com\nThink reflective of a bigger change that doesn't get noted but I think long term you know a hundred and fifty thousand Chinese visited Israel this year you know when you were there we saw the delegations every other\nOr if I read in the economist okay Hi that's emerged last time I read the students to read the economists look at America from mother Britten write\nA reading the economists that there is fresh concern in Israel\nAbout Chinese has been a ... about Chinese or interference in intellectual property because there's rail is start up nation there's even a building that the Chinese workers are working on and Tel Aviv that is part of the national security apparatus and there's concern there as well\nMalcolm it's not an idle concern the economists said that the prime minister is freshly moving on this so while there's investment dollars\nAnd jak laws present\nA it is impossible to ignore the fact that if you were going to choose a country that gave you access to American technology he would choose Israel because of the relationship between the two countries\nI think you're right on all counts and and the concern is there it's actually universal it's true in most other countries because the Chinese have a record in that regard I I Do think that there are those who are trying to counter it in established a different platform I met with\nChinese business people who who are very interested in coming ... are working with Israel ... building tourism to Israel and from Israel but there is a universal concern that that technology has often been stolen from the American companies as well and because that's what Israel has its main export yeah it is is it's\n... it's a knowledge economy and knowledge based economy ugly and ... and the Chinese agents of the Communist Party are bad actors when it comes to knowledge economy\nRight so so those restrictions and that is why they don't deal in the technology in the military technology areas and have restrictions on it except things that can be used for\nAll right I'm not I'm not the prosecutor I'm repeating what I read in the economy perhaps I misunderstood I don't know if it's true let's go to China let's go to China because there was at a bank and China that is closed its doors I think they even caught the fingers of an Iranian agent trying to get into the door at ... at the end\nThey slammed the door and it's had it what is this may laugh well I think it's part of\nOur ongoing effort to get people to understand how the sanctions are working and and even in the countries that we are least likely to to adhere to it we see that the Chinese ships now are are at least a turning off their trance ponders as well but some of them will not carry uranium oil\nAnd the and other countries as well but now we see a key Chinese bank and ... it's the bank of ... but it's it's very important because it's controlled\nBy the state ... energy groups in PC and they they uh had stopped euro denominated transactions with Iran and while ago but now they stopped US Currency\nAh this is a a really important indication\nThat the uh sanctions and what's coming up in different before that we discussed earlier this evening\nI'm at with cats are empowering others\nIs really a even in advance of of the application I'm already affecting so many companies and so many banks insurance

and the French commander foe she wanted to cut up the Americans and feed them into the weak divisions that were holding the line against the Germans that summer and Pershing had refused\nThis is part of that that's part of the macro but under very tactical level the chief of staff of the second division a colonel brown insisted that we dig in behind the French and we form a a defensive line and this was a very important move\nThe um the the\nMarines dig in and I mean this is where through accurate rifle fire they stop in many cases advancing Germans through the weak field and I mean this is

George Hamilton who is the captain of the forty night the the unknowns covers\nThis band of brothers the forty ninth through the entire book it's the through line in many cases\nRight this is a moment

bit too far\nAnd they brace for counter attack that's typical German tactics within a half\nAn hour the Germans immediately will counterattack position that they just lost in the hope of of regaining it and that's what came that there are two they're literally potato mash or grenades and artillery that reigned in and the Germans counter attacked in great strength\nUm with ... and they started to
