Lincoln Navigator one Lincoln of never again since ...\nThese are not counterterrorism strikes these are\nThese are police operations I think that was the polite way to talk about in the twentieth century Tom the Taliban is looking to an Afghan election I just say that the Taliban is going to disrupt it is an understatement a you also mentioned that the Islamic state is involved how so\nWell you know both the Taliban Islamic state of course uh you know denied the legitimacy of Afghanistan's elections and what's the key thing here is that the U.S government has been quite delusional about what they think the Taliban is willing to do with the Taliban leaders are willing to do\nYou know early this year the state department actually called the tall bond to turn to turn over their bullets for about ... and to get out and vote and to become part of the political process Afghanistan\nThis is completely inconsistent with every piece of public rhetoric you'll see come out of the tall blond there's no evidence that the Taliban is willing to lay down its bullets for ballots I mean this is just mindless rhetoric really\nIn any event this new um Taliban theme of the came out just today emphasize the fact that they reject the Afghan Afghan elections which are coming up on October twenty if I Believe the parliamentary elections they rejected by numerous grounds they claim that the elections are basically just they sort of a publicity stunt for the foreign forces meaning of the U.S\nThey reject the legitimacy of the Afghan government and they claim that basically it's their religious duty to disrupt or prevent the elections from going off\nNow that the Taliban unlike the Islamic state is very careful in the statement anyway rhetorically to say that they're going to try and be careful not to kill Afghan civilians indiscriminately and they're going to try and target security forces that are in charge of preserving the elections are safeguarding the elections\nWhat's different about that now of course they will if they do strike out they will end up killing civilians but what's different about that at least in terms of their rhetoric of the Islamic state doesn't care Islamic state says we're going to go after if you're participating in the elections as your your civilian or otherwise\nThen you we have the right to kill you and so the Islamic state has absolutely no compunction about going out and killing whoever is taking a party elections where's the top on because there are a little more sensitive toured\nSort of how they're they're perceived publicly in terms of popular appeal the least want to put a little bit of a shrine on their sort of the violence\nBut the Taliban is against the elections just not correct um they're not they're not in no way in door seeing this after\nThey couldn't be any clear that they are against the elections and here's the point John ... the whole us strategy Afghanistan is about right now we we call the strategy is about trying to get the Taliban lay down its arms and ... and recognize the legitimacy of the Afghan government and participate in the political process\nYet they couldn't tell us anymore or any more often than they already are that they reject the Afghan government and the political process and it's against the ... votes against religious obligations and that they basically need to undermine the Afghan political process because all it is for them is basically just a sort of a a puppet of of the foreign invaders\nA bill I checked with you on your sources right now this Afghan national election it's a lining up to be a failure or at least considerably diminished considering how much\nIn the old days you remember when we used to make a big deal about an election Afghanistan now it looks like they're going to hold it in in in a small club in capital and call it an election\nYeah that's absolutely right I Wonder if there's a lot of places are not going to be open right\nThat these elections are largely going to be held in the in the major cities and the more constantly off that most of the Afghans are not going to be a represented in this election and now that is a major failures years\nAt the U.S invasion that you know it's the ... and it is is worse than a than at any weight and that polling centers in Afghanistan to represent the will of the Afghan people that the Taliban are very clear that that\nGovernment is a legitimate that aid you view elections is illegitimate and the election looks illegitimate when they can't open polling centers\nBill

of Interpol since two thousand sixteen um went back to China in September he was disappeared now Interpol has received a message that he's resigned there's been a notice from China that he is being investigated for a serious preaches\nHis wife is complaining she's not in China and she's complaining that she's not heard from him so clearly this was an ambush of wasn't plan\nAbsolutely it wasn't planned and it shows that number of things John one of them is that um the disagreements at the top of the Communist Party have become so severe that they basically broken out into open warfare\nOf the reason why I get to that is that China really wanted to have the head of Interpol to be a Chinese national Communist Party official and they were successful in that and for them to do this to take a among\nAnd the disappearing indicates that they don't care about China's international standing anymore that what's really important for them is solving internal political disputes\nWe've seen this in the Maoist era you know see Jim paying is one of ... Arab powers\nHe's also ended up with Mao era instability you can't have um what a siege and paying wants this really I think is an indication that we are going to go back to the intense political struggles\nIn the Nineteen fifties and Nineteen sixties this is really bad news because China right now looks to be unstable\n... said in this meeting that he regret that there will not be an annual meeting between Chinese and us diplomats and military officials do in\nMid October so not only of\nThe ... stop Gordon and Secretary Mattis canceled his visit to China but there will be no conversation between diplomat sci fi follow this reporting\nYes well you know the Chinese are blaming us for the cancellation of the security dialogue but we canceled only because the Chinese said that their top the admiral would not be available um and so you know this is and also they pulled the admiral from meetings he had in the U.S [noise]\nSo really what the US was reacting to was China centrally cutting off the milk Tamil discussions\nAs we pointed out before these melt Tamil dialogues benefit China much more than the u._s. so for Beijing to cut them off shows temper tantrum shows

puzzle here Gordon is with this deterioration between the U.S and China where does that lead moons utopian is is is is Korea now collateral damage to ... a temper tantrum\nWell you know it could be John you know a lot of people have said we've had simply this ideology for for decades that you got to be nice to the Chinese and they will reciprocate well you know President Trump explicitly tried that last year he said look I'm going to go easy on the Chinese on trade if they help on North Korea\nWell they didn't help on North Korea they took that as a big green light to violate sanctions we've got to do something different and you know I'm not saying that pressure is going to absolutely work\nBut it can't do any worse than the cooperation path\nI think what President Trump needs to do is to start sanctioning Chinese banks really imposing costs on Beijing for transferring ballistic missile and nuclear weapons technology to the north Koreans for violating sanctions for doing all the rest of it\nYou know we have all these disagreements with China we've got to have it out with the Chinese because as disagreeable if that is\nYou know we've tried the other approach and its miserably failed this made the Chinese even worse than they were before and so you know we are the author of almost of Chinese aggression and it's not like we're the aggressors but nonetheless we made it easy for the Chinese to be a embolden and to try to take down the international system\nJae in is the president of South Korea he has made it very clear he wants to reunite the peninsula a\nQuote today in

[noise] well I agree with David the Democratic officials and consultants don't want to talk about impeachment but their Base Camp help itself as a message that is\nGoing getting through a lot of the grassroots is we have to impeach Trump and not just trumpet Kavanaugh and that's what this election is about\nSo the the the overall thirty thousand foot message is responsible and prudent as David says but it was the message a lot of activists who syndicate individual districts are uh we're going to get them and we're going to impeach them and that's one of our signal issue\nDavid I saw a news item and saying that some group and the Democratic party was not going to spend money or ... pulling money back from that that the Democratic race in in Tennessee did you see that was that substantive or just a quick reaction\nWell look I mean it's it's a major democratic group I'm part of me I got the one Democrat who speculated they might have done that it just throw bread is a solid or because you know you could give them something to crow about I mean he ... he doesn't need any money so if they're going to pick Brett ascended to disown\nThem you know that's fine as far as Democrats are concerned but but it's true that the base is John John mentioned\nThe base on the left was all ginned up about this I don't know how much Senate Democrats wanted is is that just like the Obamacare shut down in twenty hurricane that the Republican base demanded or at least a portion of it\nThat are sort of had to take this all the way and this is what happens when you don't have a leader of the party and the ... thinks the minority should be able to do a lot more than I can actually do\nSo you do not believe that precedent Bredesen was hurt by that remark because he's not already modeled on the TV and they need the help I mean I\nRun an ad and say the liberals or disown him\nRight now to David David rocker I recommend is reporting from in the Washington Examiner forests trip to Tennessee Johnson to the national Review Online Thaddeus McCotter W.

John ... he's the author most recently in the end of work however before that he's the author of who needs the fed well apparently the fed nieces that it's the largest employer of economists and the United states John we'd go immediately to the federal\nReserve and what makes it sleepless why people wander around worrying and mumbling themselves then this large collection of economists I picture of vast room kind of Nineteen eighty four vision\nOf everybody at their desk worrying about what's going wrong when the economy's doing very well thank you very much and apparently they worry about inflation why John\n[noise] they worry about inflation because what inside the fed the belief is that a growing economy\nIs the cause of inflation they say that it leads to higher prices of everything which is one hundred percent backwards\nRecently a growing economy is driven by investment orders investment it's just it's it's just more capital flowing to perjure up production such that we're able to produce more and more with less less and so in in the real world inflation is is going to be most prevalent\nUh when the economy is growing the leaf simply because there is the least amount of investment on the economy is booming that's a sign of mass investment which is a sign that the prices of everything are dropping\nVenezuela you use that example in your article what has been a while to show the fat that it could learn a Venezuela's economy I mention quickly Venezuela's economy is in the hands of a dictator and\nA regime that imports brutal brutality from Cuba and from Russia and at the same time that people are are they are fleeing or working in the black market because the currency is completely collapsed so much so that they are ... that they're projecting something called the\n... some fantastic crypto currency because they no longer can handle their deaths in the world please continue\nVenezuela is to our eyes that's the other thing precisely because their parents no longer works it's increasingly dollar eyes to major paradox because Venezuela is evidence of what true inflation is the boulevard there has collapsed and value\nAnd ... and it's collapsed so much that that that restaurant owners are constantly having to change prices reflect\nThe truth but think about that\nIf you're constantly changing the price because you don't know what you're going to get that means a lack of investment who would invest in a country where you don't know what kind of returns you're going to get into Venezuela's evidence or what\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't

models interest free log on to what\nActually experiencing rising prices but the big the the the true source of inflation is one you destroy the currency that's the traditional definition of inflation the fed has somehow changed it in the last ten Fifteen Twenty years and it's something that it plainly isn't it never was\nAnd the puzzle about inflation is that they are going to worry about they're going to continue to worry about it\nAnd they also worry when there is an inflation they were both directions these economists wandering around brooding and worrying to themselves this is built in to the Federal Reserve right John there's no way to get it out of there they\nThey warship the idea that inflation is bad and therefore we have to stop it but when they try to stop it what tools to they have aren't they aren't they aren't they without without success\n[noise] yeah how would the fed for one doesn't have any control over the valley of the dollar there's this myth the fed targets the dollar in fact it doesn't and it never has the dollar is a treasury function and the fed can only view inflation through this new way\nOf focusing on economic growth and trying to control it through the interest rate and so we're seeing it right now with the ...\nSet economists in there and say obsession with the ... storage this notion of reaching an interest rate that such that that that money is neither too tight or too slow that the creditors neither too too easy ... north too difficult\nTo ... our our star then translates as Goldilocks right it's the Goldilocks\nGoing locks which absurd and economies just collection of individuals we take it back to inequality ... unequal people grow much faster than three and four percent but the fed thanks to the economy needs to be managed like this\nBut there's no way the fed could achieve this\nThe interest rate is a price sat around the world based on infinite decisions taking place every millisecond of every day so the notion that a bunch of economists at the fed working with limited information could come up with the our star with the proper interest rate\nThat that basically balances the needs of savers\nAnd those who want to borrow from savers is too ridiculous\nTo even to even contemplate or discuss but that's what's being discussed inside the Federal Reserve today and it's a reminder\nThe feds power is vastly overstated if a group of economists so diluted\nTo actually control credit the U.S economy would Be Sober assessed as to not even be worth talking about it would be yesterday's news yet it booms and booms precisely because the fed is just not that important\nTo you that are star are hyphen star this is um the the remark of fed vice chairman Kevin wars\nTalking about the our star quote idea most in vogue and central banks circles does that mean our star is in Europe as well ... and the central bank of Europe are doing this and the central bank of Japan that there are all central bankers who are searching for Goldilocks\nOh absolutely and and what if they always done it the fed the central banks are just another bureaucracy in search of a purpose and so they've got one we're going to try to create equilibrium\nOn on interest rates but back to reality interest rates are set in the marketplace the fed nor any central bank can alter reality and so while the central bankers are talking about how they're going to achieve Goldilocks\nSimple truth is there's going to be a lot of credit during economic booms because there is going to be a lot of resources during slower periods there'll be less credit as those who have access to it limits the ability of businesses to misuse it\nEconomies are self regulating mechanisms the idea that central banks actually regulate regulate them defies basic common sense\nCentral planning died in the twenty century with good reason this notion that central banks or the last vestige and actually control the the economies of the world is just not serious and I contend that the next few years it's going to be accepted wisdom that central banks are just not that important that we forever overstated the relevance\nJohn Tammany his books include
