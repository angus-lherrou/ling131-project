kind of home project whether it's a small repair or a major remodel\nBlaming around on the line with a question about Fifteen I'm the first time\nI guess we have architectural role of the house a couple of years ago it looks like I got the ... the dock streets coming down on the ... and I'm not that far away from the airport here a long road island and I got plans or some kind of oil that fail or maybe dumping their a\nPot of fuel or whatever they do [laughter] I thought I landed I don't\nThink they're flushing the bathrooms on your roof they're what they're going to shoot a let me ask you a question for you but this roof on did you take the old ... okay now I'm the old rule did have any stringer same problems not rarely now is your home shady\nUh yeah some shade or in front of the house yeah you get more strict on the front of that\nI just noticed that in front of a little bit right right like above the entrance of the door you know ... but I got a a by shape a typo so\nOne thing here is that typically the area where the roof rafter touches the roof sheeting\nRight where the would basically isn't solid contact\nThat's a cooler spot than the areas that are right and left of it so sometimes when we get these stripes on the roof of conditions called ghost running and it's because you get more conversation\nOr in those areas that are cold in the areas that are warms the left and right in it now also on the shady side of the house or wherever you have shade you're also much more likely to pick up a little algae or liking or moss\nAnd that can also cause standing on the roof\nSo before we jump to conclusions what I Would suggest you do is use a very simple approach is a roof clear out there that's called spray and forget\nIt's available and ready to use bottled you basically just snap a hose and a garden hose onto\nAnd then you can spray the roof down\nAnd just kind of walk away and see what happens I actually haven't had an extremely dirty shed roof that has so much moss on it and it was crazy 'cause it just hadn't done anything for a long time so so last summer when I was\nPainting the fence and doing the repairs outside of decided that we take care of that and I got the springs forget and put it on once and then I walked away for about a month knows that almost all that was going to put it on one more time and it's perfectly clean and put it down doesn't happen instantly because basically what it doesn't stop the growth performing\nThink of it in a sort of a weed killer for the moss\nAnd it brightens the roof and then there's a residual in stays on it and kind of protection over the long haul so I Would try or products like that it's very simple fairly inexpensive\nAnd see if that doesn't pay and then if it does and you kind of know what you're dealing with um one natural thing that you can do to ... though that group down to teach me try to get a little more sunlight on that area sometimes I've told folks a traumatic trees and and that's should just enough light on it because the sunlight is a natural middle decided as well so it makes sense\nAll right I'll give it a shot\nAnd have you got a flooring project in mind we got

plus they're specifically trained on\nWhere to put the insecticide how much deployed and also the insecticides that they are very specific and they remove only insects that they're supposed to remove and they don't remove the beneficial insects that you want to leave behind so if you're having that much of an infestation\nI Would stop shopping round pesticide and call a pro and have them treat the house and once you get the populations down to where they are manageable kind of more normal than you could try to use some of those other products to sign a maintenance base is is that makes
