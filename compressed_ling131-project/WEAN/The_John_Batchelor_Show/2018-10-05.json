was the favorite target for Brady denied he looked as weight fourteen dine me ten catches or Seventy seven yards but Julian Edelman in his return seven catches tonight and I have to say we looked like the Julian that'll minimal he really did outside of his drop\nWhich might be him banging off the Ross but outside of that drop he looked like the same guy yeah and\nThat was surprising miss early I figured there would be some level of Ross um you know because he gets ...\nAnd you sometimes see these guys drop a little bit any of them played you know in a real game and over a year you know so

B. R. prominent humility station [noise]\nSports\nSingle brand new set of friends [laughter]\nPatriot office picked up right where it left off last week that was the first of three Tom Brady touchdown passes and Tom Brady step to the podium as let's say to him right now\nWhat does that mean well I think all these you know things like that milestone and so forth it's there's so many people that contribute so I just think of all the people that you don't have really worked hard and\nUm you know a quarter back then brought him down south you need people to go out and defense and make plays and coaches a coach and\nThese are all you know great team or so\nPretty cool [noise] [noise]\n... what was it like watching Julian a sprints out of the tunnel and then connecting him for that first passing the game\nThat was great I mean we we want to get them involved in and uh you know make some great plays and I'm just good to have not there you know I'm sure I'm you know we all want it to be perfect Everytime we go out and uh\nBut I was really happy to be out there with him he's a great player and obviously the more great players you have out there [noise]\nYou know the better we're going with the ball score points and uh you know I play um just for a long time and really happy to have now they're healthy and having fun\nA Tom nine for nine on the first Dr ... that would seem to indicate you guys had a rhythm you had a rhythm how important was that in terms of getting off to a good start and getting Julian involved early\nYeah that was good that was good I you know I think all of us just would love to keep going you know the whole night and I'm good first have we had to go play during the second half that we'd like to have back but I'm just a good you know good went on a short weekend to be three and two were at one and two so we've got a huge game coming up in a week from Sunday\n\nI can I Do feel like I'm obviously all the pieces and now in place to take your only kind of scratching the surface I mean you had the touchdown pass it to John she got you know finally get everyone involved but he feel like there's definitely even more to come\nThat was a great play Josh made you know jumping over the top of two defenders and uh you know tell you you're kind of confidence I haven't really short period of time so\nI'm you know he's earned it and habits they make that play Cordell made a great play on the on the one touchdown James made a great play on the one that he caught so we're working there I mean this week we actually even how he practices we've had a bunch of walk through so\nStill a lot of football last throughout you have a lot of room to to make improvements I'm In a lot of areas and asked for Romney folks our play a great team in Kansas City coming up so [noise] um you know hopefully we can learn from the first five weeks and move forward and play a lot better football [noise]\nThat Tom are in the in the second half he seemed to be getting a little fired up when you had the consecutive drives that were turnovers as a result of self inflicted Arizona police to Chris in Rob what's the mindset when you have the sort of errors that it's really just the guy just bounce a ball bounces off guy's hands like that\nWell I mean part of it is that those things come up and they happen um you know to me that we I think everyone's first\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com [noise]\nFortunately we we came out on the head but I Know like you know we've had too many turnovers and we've got a lemonade does because you know we have Ninety three percent chance of winning when we don't turn the ball over and that's pretty good so when you do need to do a better a better job taking care of it last one\nAtomic set about a third of the way through the season I have a a little mini by here natural time for reflection how you feel the officers doing overall uh especially the the turnovers the lack of down fuel passing or are you concerned about where the fences right now\nWell were you know we'd like to just ... it's really not about those things to me it's about points and the turnover is obviously they keep from scoring points\nUm they're gonna guard deep you got to do it where there were there not so ultimately we just we were more points and we have more opportunities out there for thirty eight which is great we have more in us\nThis week last week we scored I think thirty eight I think we have more in is and I think that's what we're looking at so we got a lot of room to grow and uh we need to make\nBottom from some short period of time so that your guest\nPatriots quarterback Tom Brady after the wind over the Indianapolis Colts Tom Brady is brought to you by your New England Buick dealers experience the seven expectations shattering models\nBusier local New England viewer dealers are we we'll check back in at the podium when we get here

up and the situation um I think at this and\nThe uh\nThe Russian get out of the pocket you know just go out and go to St Lott football scramble drew you know go the opposite direction on what you're going you know knock on one of the head towards ... and he made are contacting threw up their new perfect ball so I had to try to make\nA play on it and uh I was pretty much that's pretty much it\nHey Josh you know back in twenty Thirteen you at such a great year statistically and and you were you know a large large part of the fence what's your impression looking around this a lot of sense when you have Brady and groggy can Edelman and James White and Sony Michel is a comfortable for you to be\nKind of a part of the machine instead of the the whole engine\nOh yeah most definitely it's a relief anything I mean you gotta do to sit by sit back a little bit and in and watch everybody do their own thing but they should not forget that you also part of this you know you know so I'm Margaret Sunni prison cell phone number is called I'm going to go out there and give a hundred percent you know just like everybody else\nThe on the receiving end of ... touchdown Seventy first player

he was tied with any test diverting now he's all by himself\nAnd at that time it was an important touched down 'cause all of a sudden the game and go closed because of sloppy ... due to Chris Hogan and the rub Broncos me\nBut not only that it gives a good point to the crowd in the building and at home great moment for Josh Gordon kind of like the welcome to the team moment even though I had a couple of catches last week in some prior tonight but that was the true welcome to the women you were in New England Patriots now ... and you got your first such down here\nAnd a hell of a play by him not much effort as you mentioned by the secondary of the Indianapolis Colts but it was great there and it also shows that there is some kind of like trust building near the last couple of weeks between Brady and Gordon\nOh I think there definitely is and we heard Brady talked about how much you trust Gordon already built el checked said that Thomas put an extra time with all the receivers recently you picked up on that is man made by bill bell jak but if that is true it's obviously paying off\nAnd I'll tell you what though this play though is taking on like mythical status already ... oh you left off over no\nNo he didn't job and go back and watch my film like ... it was on the Monday Night when they enter a play with what it was not Randy my wasn't only didn't ... anything like that I went and fought\nFor a ball or made an adjustment I should say on a deep all of which were just seen too many guys here that don't have a great ability to do that but tonight Josh Gordon did because Josh Gordon is a Supreme leader talented player\nThat's why so he made a nice grab to catch is for him on the night and one of them obviously being that big touched down on my question to him would be\nThat there's going to be some free time on days Josh what are you going to do with it [laughter] you know who you are you staying with were how's everything going here and the greater Fox borough area you know stay close to check in every day those types of things nightlife you still\nFeel the need to to dabble in his huh he's still into that or do you stay at home all the time seeking

phones Dan has been a hanging out Dan ... wait and go at\nIt then I ended up I said what's up yeah I got I'm asking [laughter] [laughter]\nOkay I'm going to go based on what your comment line sandwiches or the patriots gonna rely on Josh court\nRely on no I just think he's going to be another weapon look I mean radioactive full control the often than not I think that was most encouraging things a lot of that had to do with the return of Julian Edelman that's the guy that's his ...\nHe knows he could trust him more I think even the raw bronco ski look if they're all healthy is eat the rely on Josh Gordon what what you've thrown up bombs like you did the mosques in those seven I don't think it's going to be like that but it's just another weapon form\nLet's go to Joe Hughes ah in the tree is that which would that be brain tree [laughter]\nYou know at\nA Joe's up next on the job market patriots post game show when he got\nLet me ask you this okay double coverage over the top correct what it was all that\nAnd they look a couple of guys also a couple of goes through deep directly or to Randy Moss says you're just going down to a tourist she is so how is that not ready last type of like\nOkay it's a type of play you would see Randy Moss may but not the best of Randy Moss that's why I'm saying that that does not come up to one of those planes were Randy Moss it to guys actually making physical contact\nRight physical contact where he's out muscling two guys and he's just so much bigger than everybody and taller than everybody in a ridiculous reached that goes up over everybody that made him Randy Moss yeah\nNo that's it's a it's a it's a little bit insulting I think the same was mosque like tonight who is now a hall of fame and one of the greatest wonders why does he was of all time look just Gordon is infinitely talented and it was a really good play but go back and look at it again you're right and like we've never had a replay a bunch of those two popes defenders of falling over each other like the Keystone Cops\nHow many how many decent deep guys and mislead can make that point\nReese main hello that's a no go [laughter] and we'll never know [laughter] or no cost back rice a critic California Hi Chris [noise]\nSo you guys just want to get back to ah the jaw scored and catch I mean you guys are kind of playing that off like it was no big deal but if you I I watched that probably ten times as slow first of all you know the guy was the guy was there was pastor's church courtyard down the field\nAnd then that falls route to to the facts like it wasn't even throw to Josh and Josh\nPretty much angles Bobby to bounce off one of the D backs ain't going to get that far probably could have been intercepted only\nIf that was hawking if that was you know a course at all not caught on your thoughts are\nYeah no kidding stop being done on typing on the other players are sad when you say that's an earth shattering revelation right there cannot I hear they're not\nJust touched them as ... reach middle of an hour I told you you're going to be a problem and it was a great play\nFun flight got the crowd out here's the credit I really liked it I really like seeing those two guys Gordon type of page to adjust and the middle of a plane he stayed focus the guy tried knocking them kind of off of where he was Murray Gordon stay focused made the candidate Taylor tomorrow gifted measurements taken for the red jacket here at vox borrow\nAnd the gold wanting cans because after that play he's gone to bigger and better\nThings man oh my God [laughter] it's a problem\nWe said it was a great player that's not good for you know it's not enough you have to call Randy Moss [laughter] or it's not enough credit to Josh Gordon unless you're calling them Randy Moss people don't want to hear about it tonight oh that is so annoying or by the way that wouldn't have been passed interference I Would have been illegal\nContact is what that would have been long before the pro but I agree that defender mugged grabbed him slowed him down all of that and he bought through coverage which\nIs all the things that I Love the most the multiplier talent is off the charts right I questioned the signing because the the unpredictability and unreliability of his availability\nBut the thing is I really appreciate about him as a player not just the fact that he can run a million miles an hour down the field and catch the ball and and just be so great in that regard the fact that he goes over the middle he's tough he tries to break tackles\nThat type of stuff is impressive to me I I was more relevant diva no fighting your coverage like those are things that you look at it and say you wish every receiver and all we\nDid those things the first case last week was good the second one I thought it was better because he showed that tough just breaking out of two tackles the guys in ... on your show talked about um oh he looks like he's built bottle you know granted you see that and he backs up some guys can look like that and not out the toughness Gordon has that and he showed that on the touchdown too man I was\nStanding very close to him on the field before the game tonight and if you pass by him like this guy's muscles on top of my yeah he is and he's huge he's ... he's way bigger than you figure if you see him next to someone like doors that he'd dwarfs fill up towards that like he's noticeably much bigger\nThan than the doors but again if you and others on the field of either of us had a question to ask a drop of a gym or you know the sports I'm back here uh once your bedtime [laughter]\nOr ... or ... speaking about the one who were stuck in your [laughter] all those things six one seven seven seven nine zero Ninety eight five or Brian is in New York tonight Brian when he got force\nYeah say uh I Would say that I'd like to know when you go into bad um\nI I don't know what happened to those first two place where he dropped the ball or Brady was of a yard off at a concert need\nTo know other because I was a sprayed sorry for the uh three cleaning has afraid that radio they're not going to come back to it and so was Brady can't backfill for the touchdown after the in the middle of the universe catch all of a lifetime\nBut that touched that was the most exciting thing I've seen in my life\nI have to say that I mean like if I see Thirteen on the field it makes me very angry I Can't\nI Can't stand seeing filled George that number on the field very angry and I wanted to see\nJosh Orton all my life\nOr your life All right well\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than anything around because we're a certified buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nMinded damn thing like the way [laughter] damn it sounds\nLike it's about the land on them I don't think it's going to the ready to call them ... then you you don't want to know you didn't want to know his name all the Cornell again because I didn't call them the same thing again Joe is in Denver is always up next on the shots and stock market patriots post game show\n[noise] man how you\nDoing what's going on generally\nKnow much I actually I was at a game Josh is routes were great there's still a little bit of a disconnect between him and all but I mean the fact that everybody is so excited we'd be mediocre the at all but we still get shredded\nAndrew Luck still troops oh almost a hundred yards three touchdowns I mean I eat fences mediocre at best\nSo if they plan on going anywhere at all I don't know Josh on the it I don't know that hey we're going to swell forty swell forty will eat us\nThat's just too much pressure I taught him that I mean\nWell there were things to be concerned about what the defense and I'd be like you said that there wasn't much push up front I agree with you there and then there pressure on him at all and then the secondary as I mentioned I thought that ... and stuff on Gilmore stood out for all the wrong reasons and what it was a nice interception that them according but otherwise those two guys were chasing all night and that has to be fixed\nNext week before next week\nWhen you get to take on the Kansas City the good thing is is you know it was mentioned during one of the press conferences like they have a mini by your ten days to get prepared for that team they have a tough game this week against the good defense in Jacksonville maybe they get\nLumped up a little bit there so it's perfect timing to get that theme\nBut all ... they're going to be a hell of a lot bigger threat\nThan Indianapolis was tonight credit to what to what took a quarterback you still probably worked some through some things the arm strength isn't what it was prior to his ah you know him being out for a year with the injury he had nothing to work with weapon was the night outside of uber on a tight and who's okay\nSo ... had a career night ... eclipse one thousand excuse me one thousand one hundred yards receiving a game or the first time in his career he's been in the NFL says twenty fourteen tonight was the first oh well\nThese are worse than I thought he was sort of okay in Detroit when he was there well I mean do you find it encourages you I think there's not there's not a ton of tight end to rack up enough catches to get over a hundred yard yeah right I mean the tight end is just\nThis team the tight end is used a lot because he's a monster garage you know you can't anti they use them a lot because the guys great grand you know there's not\nThere's not twenty titans it'll lead that get the ball you know federal them the way\nYou know Rob Gronkowski and others do\nRight now he brought him I wouldn't be getting fed the ball this way if you've got a healthy ah jak oil yeah right so\nYeah but that's career night for him out there you should not be given up those types of the nine catches one oh five but over a broad and they got killed by him than I but overall I don't think it was a bad night for the defense like that guy seemingly did\nLet's get to a ... well we're going to get to more here on these shows in star market patriots post game show well actually from Julian Edelman coming up right All right sound good Edelman on the way Greg regard will join us just after the top of
