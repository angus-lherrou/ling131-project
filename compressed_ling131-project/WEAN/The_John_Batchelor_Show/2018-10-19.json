anecdotes and we had late this afternoon from Bloomberg News and others repeated that there were strong words exchanged in the White House in at least earshot of journalists around the oval office between the national security adviser John Bolton\nAnd longtime friend of the show and John Kelly the chief of staff a and a former marine general strong words and the subject was\nThe question of the onslaught that's the president's words of migrants headed to the border you've seen the photographs or you've seen the video we have this report from the wall Street Journal late in the day after all of this anecdote about both ... and Kelly exchanging strong words\nPresident Trump is elevating the issue of immigration rights Alex leery of the journal which drove is twenty sixteen campaign with the aim of animating Republican voters in a midterm election that threatens to derail his agenda if Democrats we take the house\nMr Trump's latest comments came Thursday as he warned about an onslaught in quotes of migrants reaching the southern us border with Mexico\nAnd threatened to deploy the military did Mr Trump if the caravan isn't stopped except this is certainly national security and John Bolton is the national security adviser John Kelly was homeland security secretary before the president asked him to be chief of staff\nI can I can imagine the real story here is much more fun than just strong words but we'll leave it at that\nThe demonstration on the border right now looks like a provocation\nThese people marching from well a hundred and sixty of them started out in Central America and they picked up a they've picked up fellow travelers along the way it looks like a provocation and if I were to guess who this benefits it's some version of the Democratic party's idea of open borders\nThe question I have for you because you're on the campaign in sixteen is this\nA motivator for Republican votes in twenty eight teams because it certainly wasn't sixteen\nNot only is it that motivated John this was the platform on which the the man who won the election for the presidency build his whole campaign let let's you know wind the video tape back a little bit the first senator\nTo endorse candidates from was none other than the current attorney general Jeff Sessions and that that event when he put on the red hat\nWhat was the what was the subject of rally\nThe wall illegal immigration that's where it all began people always gravitate to the the moment when he came down the escalator at Trump Tower but substantively when it comes to policy it is immigration reform and securing our borders which\nBegan the whole Trump effects of course this\nThis comes at a very good time for the Republican policy you know the videos that are not going viral on social media or a so called refugees all members of the kind of out of being paid off in cash\nYes I saw that that was puzzling ... I wasn't sure what they were being handed but it certainly was a clear that they were eager to get whatever they were handing out\nRight so this this you know that this will be used by some Packwood superPAC as we get that they've town down from what ... minds you know a few and we have left so again this is you are absolutely correct a national security issue and it should be couch this sucks on let's not\nForget also the speech that the other presidential candidate gave\nTo a group of bankers that was leaked to the press and anybody to listen to your show junkie can download the transcript which Hillary Clinton\nTold the audience my dream my objective is to have a water in this hemisphere meaning from Canada to South America no national borders at that point you know as well as anybody else\nAmerica as a concept cease to exist and this is a party platform issue that will be used by the ... and to the president's benefits\nIs a nice detail from the wall to Wall Street journal some vulnerable Democrats are using the issue as well Senator Joe Donnelly who's running for re election in Indiana has run advertisements promoting his support for Mr Trump on immigration\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve for your own condition at what for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices logged on to flood Otto John job now\nSo if a vulnerable Democrat in Indiana is worried about this I can imagine the vulnerable Democrats in other red states are worried about this ... this is the Senate but that would also\nMean that vulnerable at a Republican in suburban districts the Democrats have targeted would cut can use this issue to bolster themselves\nI think it's incredibly effective irrespective of geography or who's running I I used when I was in the White House is very simple analogy when a when you go to bed at like do you love your fun though\nIf you do is it because you hate everybody outside\nNo because you wish to protect everything that you love inside your uh America is a whole and its border is Trump's door and the idea that we will not control who enters our hope\nIs of course at these ethical counterintuitive to most Americans at all so very simple\n... matter of old a matter of fact that the individual who has the leak rights to decide\nWho comes into this country and by which yardstick measure that is the incumbent president that this is not a hot argument to make for any politics should in any district of the United states\nSebastian Gorka the national security strategist for Fox News he's the author of the new book just issue why we fight I'm John bachelor this is the John ...\nOoh\nOoh\n[noise]\nWilliams Institute real estate presents the real estate insider show Sunday mornings at ten WPRI\nBut I don't think they want to jeopardize that and I feel for the first time that Trump's that type of unpredictable president that might in fact jeopardize that relationship so I think they're going to be a little bit I mean they want them to come across the causes discomfort but I'm the Wayne what's in their self interest\nThe report here from the Associated Press Mexico's federal police commissioner said the officers\nDispatched will support immigration agents Mexico said migrants will have to show a passport and visa or apply for refugee status otherwise they will face deportation that as an update of what we saw during the Obama administration and the first year of the Trump Administration now the larger story Victor with days to go to the to the mid term\nImmigration is one of the stories that that can be told on the well known cables I keep repeating the political science mantra that we vote on pocket book is that still the case or people's passions persuading them that there there are these other issues to key on\nNow I think it's it's complex but I think it's still you know four percent economic growth and record near record on them um lower employment but the only danger and that is that when people are doing very well they have the leisure the complacency\nThat to to look at hot button social cultural issue and that's what the Democrats\nAre counting on that this can be a referendum on the cruelty of Donald Trump but I think you're seeing with Mexico that for all of Obama's I'm a liberal of a ... an international is and people didn't have any respect for him and people are starting to sense that\nObama would have never gotten Mexico to even do anything on his own border but whatever they think of Trump people abroad tend to listen to him more than Obama met starting to get clear in these last two years and I think that helps trumpet he's considered\nA strong leader and people when when there is no alternative John when you see these people coming forward and they're saying I'm going to be in the United states and six or seven days and you can't stop me and if we can stop them and we don't have a country anymore so most people are saying to themselves\nWhat is your Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai key a Toyota and Subaru all have in common there are all in for Steve free own condition and blood for Denise religion they're against it that's right over two hundred free on cars all makes all models and incredible prices logged on to flood Otto John John now\nThe spiritual confidence to stop them more than ... and if they are right that we don't have a country anymore\nAnd so that makes it pretty stark choice this mid term has basically between the rule of law and the main head scratching on the doors at the Supreme Court or people crossing the border it's law versus ...\nAnd I'm here to for and that's always favored the party in power the question here is are the polls are telling us that the house\nIs not it's not an overwhelming success for the Democrats but it is a success and the Democrats and it all the polls are also telling us that the Republicans will enjoy the majority in the Senate and will increase the majority in the Senate is that enough to hold the Senate for the presidential election and twenty Twenty one Trump can go and ...\nIt's hard to know but I I'm not convinced shut the if they're going to lose the house I Know that historically the in party loses seats\nBut that that the loss of the seat is often the Jew Decatur and whether that's going to lose the entire house when you actually asked the question rephrase it does the in party lose control of the house rather than just lose a lot of seats\n'em and change the the the the political nature of the house then that's not as common it's only three or four times\nSo I think they can lose twenty seats and that would be historically in line with what usually happens but not necessarily lose the house because\nThings are changing and usually when you see an abrupt change it doesn't eroded gets more intensive and I think that Kavanaugh and the aftermath of the Kavanaugh and ... was with the war on and the caravan they all have a force multiplying effect of saying\nThis is not the Democratic party your representative whether you like him or not is now a you know ... in service to the\nThis new Neal socialist progressive movement and he won't have a choice and you better understand if you vote for a Democrat evil and keeps the president they could control the house that will investigate Republican House members they'll call these investigations and that just the way it is but I think a lot of people either not vote\nThat are democratic hurt just just\nThat they're not necessarily going to vote for that\nThe ... the polls do show that in the sixty six I Believe it's sixty six battleground districts\nWhere the Republican representative ... is in a district of one by Mrs Clinton and the twenty sixteen and those sixty six districts the generic is nowhere near as a separated as it is generally in the country yeah\nI agree with that and and I think that again these trends are starting to attempt I live on a conjunction of three districts\nAnd they're all to Republican one Democrat and the two Republicans won ... going to get reelected even though he's being outspent by two to one Jan suspending twelve million dollars and he's still going to get reelected easily and then David

executive\nDirector most importantly he's our man watching\nThe new world Latin America because of the bad actors the sinister nature of the bad actors is that they hide in front of large nation states in this case we're looking at Hezbollah\nAnd Brazil Malcolm us to question it's yours\n[noise] yes first food good to talk to chose to begin a what do you think about the arrest of a settlement Barakat who is a key ... a blowout financier and what do you think the likelihood that we can actually affect the way to extradition to the United states\nWell that that's actually the second question is actually really really important one let me get to that but it's out of my barricade that's a key get at the key get for um any any government really in the region and I'll see if we can actually the United states to be very important as well I think honestly the most important for Argentina\nBecause the Barakat clan in in South America is an old Lebanese clan that's tied to Hezbollah that's in financing and that's just a lifted narcotics and things like that but the bulk and finding the terrorist operation including the army attack\nIn Nineteen Ninety four which is why the Argentine government should talk to them first um so yeah what are the chances that they're going to extradite him to the United states\nA lot of us person that we'd have to charge him with somebody here in the United states them with money laundering or something but I'm pretty sure there's there's something that we can charge him with but I think that you're not going to see anything like that happened after the election in Brazil\nOr because I think we're going to see how the political makeup his in Brazil and then the if there's\nA time the opportunity to do to do so uh so I'm not sure that's going to happen but I think\nThis is a great kind of a symptom of the successes that we've been having a more recently because I think you know the Trump admitted she drove administration taking a complete it\nTo be much stronger on that even though it's not very vocal about it they'd been very strong about looking at the tear finance networks all throughout the world and particularly in South America would they've they they've looked at Hezbollah very strongly in and try to work but the regional governments to go after him\nLet's say in Brazil I'm reading the economist about Brazil there's an exciting election there in\nWhich a man who was described is a far right populist\nWho managed to I was trapped in the ... the stomach during a rally is now leading all contenders are he seems to be from the column of none of the above I don't know how to say his name correctly in Portuguese so I'll say both so narrow you know he is he is he going to be a help\nA disrupting the protection of bad actors or a hindrance because he's a ... you\nKnow I think he's going to be a tremendous help he comes from that an advertisement wing that's been a wave throughout the world that you know obviously you kind of a similar ah seem to have in the United states would be elected President Trump he would that non establishment candidate he has a bit of a military background but not much of a political background\nYeah he was at X factor no nobody really expected him to do much in the presidential race at the beginning of ... of the election season but now he became the front runner\nAny any looking like he may may win on October twenty fifth when they when they go to the polls it it'll be a close election and the first round which was more candidates now it's just him and a guy named Daniel adopted and so I I Do expect him to win I think he went and if he does\nAh he's very close to two religious communities including the image eloquent Jewish community he's close to the military and he goes to other element that I think they have direction only correct\nOn who's the bad actors in South America particularly Brazil and I I I think he will be a tremendous ally if you get elected\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lineup of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln

little notice is that the department of justice created a subcommittee\nOn Lebanese Hezbollah and now has Ninety Days to get specific recommendations how to disrupt and dismantle ... transnational organized network so what do you believe are the most pressing items that they can do how do they prioritized is and how will the administration back this\nSo I'm Glad you mentioned this novel is is a a you know with all the things are happening in the world and and here in the U.S as well this is very and use that and that really didn't get a lot of attention but very quietly just that she's announce something that's a major move for those that are in the ... community\nHe put one of the biggest terrorist groups in the world had below Lebanese Hezbollah he put it in the category of a transnational criminal organizations\nAnd he put it among the most important national organization that this country's facing because they're tied right next to the three biggest cartels in Mexico is that the lower and the uh looking at actually under cartel\nSo he basically just effectively designated has lived ... they can now what does that do and Latin America that gives Latin America much more authority much more priority to put has blend a different category 'cause they still struggling Latin America understand terrorism particularly Islamic terrorism\nBut they understand transnational criminal organized crime because they deal with that every day because it's allowed 'cause let's get a more of a priority among a regional government what do I think they should do I think this sub committee the un has blood in foreign within the department of justice led by a veteran ... ...\nI think that they should focus a lot of cases that currently exists\nThere are already on the docket of Hezbollah members whether involved in trafficking money laundering counterfeiting or even some ... like the one I'm involved with in Peru ... Mohammed ... and put all the way to department adjusted to prosecute these cases and get successful conviction because they can get a quick when there's a lot of things are already on the docket\nIn in different courts Latin American power lie in Peru and ah in Panama and Colombia and and so I think this is where the priority be All right now\nI Know John Venezuela 'cause we just have a minute justice Venezuela increasingly under the boot of the Cuban security services does that enhance Iran's presidents that Cuba is the is the strength of the of the dictatorship does I Do have an in Tehran work together\nYeah Cuba as part of the alliance and just like the United states has defied by England in New Zealand in Australia and Canada they uh they have their own by by which is you know Iran Russia Syria China North Korea and they communicate a quite a bit including with Cuba human intelligence is very much involved in that and that intelligence alliance\nBut yet they're very much so like you're talking about Venezuela to one of the there's an important case headed back to his bill as well in Colombia\nThere's a gentleman named Alex Bob who is a front man for a president Nicolas Maduro who the Lebanese Colombian who works with Hezbollah to launder all the kinds of cocaine to move multi shipment of cocaine and longer all this money and he went missing recently the big in Colombia that in a in the press down there and that that's connected\nTo the Venezuelan human intelligence that they know what that we've been talking about in your show John for\nSeveral years Justin ... is

positive and yet his rhetoric\n... some of his speeches have become a more of a throwback to the anti Israel language of the same time that they are fully cooperating in in military and security cooperation\nYeah it's interesting I mean it it comes around the same time as the annual Egyptian celebration of their quote unquote victory in the October Nineteen Seventy three war um but I think that you know they're\nBlood Lincoln is southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln MTC Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the all new twenty eighty Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury him ... is\nThat the military to military and security cooperation is extremely important to to both parties but um she she is vulnerable politically he hasn't consolidated his power\nAnd one of the things that Egyptian leaders are you know they go to the well on is a is Israel and painting Israel as an enemy and and and having to\nYou know have kind of national unity uh in in a confrontation with a with the Israelis I think this is a lot of rhetoric for\nPublic consumption but behind the scenes\nOr it strikes me that uh the security cooperation will continue if if only because Egypt since really need it they've proven themselves to be benefits incompetent and trying to pacify their own territory in the Sinai Peninsula and it needed a significant amount of Israeli help\nAh the thing is he still I'm taking phone calls from Moscow [noise] well I think we're out in doubt that the Egyptians are interested in developing their relations\nWith ... and that intention to use the port for the Russian fleet is that going solar\n... ... it's very controversial in Egypt to have foreign forces have an actual permanent basing our basing\nA arrangements in in Egypt but there is after you know thirty five almost forty years of relations with the United states there is a kind of wistful romanticize Asian of the Soviet period in Egypt\nAnd there is a natural place for the Egyptians to want to play the great powers off of each other to extract as much as possible from these great powers so [laughter] um I there is a there's a genuine interest in developing a relationship with the with the with the Russian Federation at the expense of the relationship with the United states we've seen that the\nProblem that many of our allies or so called allies in the middle east to the face our economic problems you cited it before seem in Saudi Arabia\nAnd in prison people taking their uh their goods their their assets um in Egypt where the economic problems are chronic but also in Turkey and we saw hundreds of thousands of Turkish citizens\nHave sought residency in the United states just in twenty Seventeen to twenty Eighteen and many more in UK and elsewhere\nHow does or to one see ... what is the basis for the new turkey for the economic basis when he's losing and dismissing the academics in universities and many of the others are are leaving\nUndoubtedly there was a brain drain out of turkey this ongoing purge that has\nAffected the lives of almost a million people when you think about um you know family members ed included with those who have been courage dirt detained or a jail pending trial we're talking about large numbers of people\nWhat it says done has set a chilling effect through the business community which has now um moved assets outside the country but also kept their heads down\nSo uh I think that everyone has has cowed and intimidated the business community\nTo the extent that um they will told his line but protect their assets all at the same time it's extremely difficult to imagine the kind of dynamism that you had in the Turkish economy in the mid to thousands for example under a ... a under circumstances where\nEveryone is essentially leads a a an elected autocracy and the and the kind of repression a that continues but the business community says that do will continue to Seoul drawn but it's it's not it's not the same as it was when things were more open in in Turkey\nIn the province it has not been in the news because of the Saudi Arabia matter there is a report that the Russians and the Turks are patrolling the border and does Assad go along with the idea that it will be a just a permanent stain on his country or is he pushing for more action\n[noise] ah it's complicated but it seems that for now that agreement is going to hold but it really is going to delay\nA in operation in ... in it live rather than permanently put it off um the Russian military in particular\nA feels very strongly about cleaning up or the lid pocket they called it a a festering sore a terrorist and extremists\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed

control over\nA over the country so I I think um it live is not in the headlines but I think it's going to come back into the headlines sooner rather than later\nNow come a quickly could you ... what is the impact of what happened with Saudi Arabia and the other countries in the region that particularly running and turkey are in the war in Yemen will this habit direct impact will will or ... or ... it'd be reluctant to continue the bombing and the expense of aid\n[noise] uh I don't think so I I think as long as king Solomon wants to have a crown prince Mohammed bin Salman as the crown prince\nUh this is going to be the policy of the government of Saudi Arabia I think certainly um ... Mohammed bin Salman ... opponents within Saudi Arabia are emboldened by this but you know\nWho were who how are they going to seek redress or he controls all of the\n... important levers of power in Saudi Arabia so they can be angry about what's happened they can be angry about him and they can be angry about what happened in Istanbul\nTo Jamal ... but it it in the end they have no power to affect a a real change that will ultimately alter policies in places like Yemen and other places\nA final question it hadn't occurred to me that till now but a steep cuts here does the the have a say in any fashion at risk in any fashion about the subject matter is that is that a problem for Cairo are they on the outside\nI think for the most part I'm there on the outside the Egyptians have expressed their support for the Saudi Arabian government um and of course\nUh the ... and the Turks or a ... tremendous odds are over ... support for the Muslim Brotherhood so ah it doesn't really affect the Egyptians directly but they can be counted upon to support the Saudis in this instance\nSteve ... the any Enrico ... senior fellow for Middle East and African studies at the council on

an advantage to Netanyahu good morning to you\nOr what morning good to be with you again I'm that's right I the mood here is a very much on a hunting direction of early elections are rushing rescheduled anyway for next November November twenty Nineteen uh but the consensus is that uh that can Yahoo like the uh\nPull the trigger I'm On early elections a for a variety of reasons but at this point it's looking like possibly or early spring or possibly march or April [noise] um and you know protecting Yahoo it's politically or beneficial or you've got to pass\nA to kind of create the narrative he wants going into watching as opposed to being dragged into an election uh but I think more importantly I'm is legal issues I think we'll dictates a both ... comics or he wants to preempt

Ninety nine dollars for only a board and he joined the Oregon\nView of the election in God's\n[noise] so that's a great question I think the one complicating factor for anything yeah right now I'm you're right is a possible Gaza escalation if not a war ah so I don't know if he'll necessarily want to let's say pull the trigger on early election dissolves the or the government is\nIf the countries in the middle of a campaign um you know you don't quite know or you can get into a war but you don't quite know how how you're going to get out of a war um and that is true to that over the past week Gaza has really come to the forefront and and could erupt I Would argue a today friday a hearing Israel\nUm but but at the same time a show and a lot of strength\nOf both he and and as a security cabinet have showed a lot of restraint or as you mentioned the the rocket on ... and also one fell off the coast of Tel Aviv\nTwo days ago or the response there wasn't the IDF response but it was a relatively measured a there waiting and seeing how a mosque response today to uh\nTo planned or you know friday Gaza border marches and that'll dictate really how how Israel moves forward or the government is set the rules of the game and have have changed that they're going to respond a lot more forcefully to any any violence coming out of Gaza where the rockets or or border violence\nUm so we have to wait and see whether Hamas actually a push is both a he and and Israel and escalation\nThe north Syria is that ain't no longer a priority risk because of the negotiations between Netanyahu and ...\n[noise] no I wouldn't go that far uh it's always there uh Israel is monitoring what Iran and its proxies are are still doing in Syria\nBut but you're right in the sense that it's kind of falling off since the big altercation in the air between a between Israel and and the Russians a number of weeks ago a and as mentioned earlier the uh the as three hundred\nAre being deployed to Syria that also complicating factor or no Israel has has said and I believe it to be true that they'll they'll act when they need to act a in Rio to stop Iran from\nFrom I'm basing itself there militarily but but it's been fairly quiet over the past few weeks um and that's one on the ground though it's interesting that the border crossing between Israel and Syria or in the Golan Heights is actually a

uh early Israel Israeli election here in the spring\nSo I don't think that's imminent uh but but in the sense of uh you know Palestinian reconciliation a Hamas and Fatah a over Gaza that's also been

think they like that\nAre all that much they want to be involved as partners um and there are certain the reforms that the United states has done that that did they can do in the u._k. they can do in Europe uh one thing that that the report\nBoth sides just funding them more which obviously you know it's not a a an advocacy group and asking for more money and not doing their job but one thing that the United states that\nThey pay a company to develop something in the research and development things all the way to orbit they'll fly hardware and in the in the u._k. and in Europe it's usually a fifty fifty split so that the programs are a lot less ambitious and that the end of the day they don't have something they can sell to somebody else if they start doing things like that\nAnd making the reforms that are a little bit or commercial sadly or commercial friendly\nThen you you could actually kick start your own industry there and they can find that interesting and really find a role in the new space economy that's developing\nWithout spending at the same amount of money that the U.S or or China would would be spending so there are things that Europe can do proactively building on the things that they're doing already which is an impressive flight record out of out of French yawning\nUm and the new hardware the coming on line but they could do more on the regulatory sense to
