assertive prime minister of India\nThere's also a mentioned in a paragraph this has CNBC riding a s four hundred last time I checked that's a very powerful weapon Cleo India\nRussia together again not since the Soviet days you understand how this goes what is the what is the intention of Mr Modi showing friendliness towards the aggressor in in Ukraine and Syria good evening to you\nGood evening Hi well the question is who is that can be used against and really there's only one country that has them is likely to be at the gate and that China\nWhich is why I think it's perhaps not as concerning for Washington and last month um the sector ... pale and Secretary Mattis we're in Delhi signing a much more important agreement\nWhich is a ... which is that communication agreement with Delhi which will dramatically increased and drop or ability between the Indian and the American\nAnd I'm sure that the sale with Scott during the meaning and if the U.S had had very serious concern they would have been addressed at that time so there there's the legal practically or for the sanctions but given the politics I I Would hope that there wouldn't be any\nYou have to put a little context and is the United states sanction China for by the same as four hundred a\nDuty or aircraft system from the I'm from the Russians and and clearly I don't I Can't see the U.S sanctioned in India and that must be as you point out a sign of enduring partnership between deli in Washington\nAs these two countries start to work much more closely um but you know ... seems to be playing a very interesting game of outreach not only to boot and not only to the United states but also to China what's going on there Cleo\nSays they they kind of focus is always\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the

you're looking for jobs\nWithout the political or security compromise that sometimes goes with dealing with China\nAnd clearly has Modi gotten the investment he expected from the United states\nIt has been as a as easy as it could have been um but I think there have been um problems on both sides there are a lot of\nUm vested interest in Delhi or that have been slowing things down as well um a lot of people made a lot of money from a lot of different sorts of relationships so\nUm when weapons sales are involved um you're looking at relationships that may be going back decades including back to the Cold War times and um people in systems who um have vested interests and other alliances or other purchases\nSo clearing away all of that brush in order to get things that are good for the strategic core of a nation can sometimes take a bit more time than expected the\nPuzzle about ... does he have a neutral image in Delhi is she regarded as somebody we can work with is there a general opinion\nThere's been a very light and during the kind of so called non aligned period India's not aligned period um they did get a lot of weaponry from the Soviet Union and then from the Russians at a time when the U.S really wouldn't touch India at all so um there is you know it it's not considered a problem and\nUm I think there was during during the time when um\nThe west was backing some pretty nasty elements in Afghanistan um the Indian knew that this ... hottest problem would flow back to India and were I'm not averse to working with the Soviets during that time either to try to contain it\nSo a lot of their relationship with Russia is very much a reflection of their immediate border you know the problems with our hottest on one side and the problem with China on the other and that's the lens through which they view their relationship with Moscow\nIncluding ... what is the state of play between Islam about a dollar today\nThat terrible uh and in fact what China did I'm immediately after a India bought the ... the um missile defense system was it announced it was going to sell some very high tech drones to Pakistan\nSo essentially opening up a second front for that missile system to try to defend ... from\nThe puzzle also about India playing the Russia card if that's what their play this can be a dangerous game the Russians are not easy to work with you that forgotten the Soviet days says that regarded as that was all that was then there's just now is that the fresh thinking\nNot really because they're because if you look at the age of the people in both administrations they there are people who would have been engaging with each other perhaps his juniors\nOr during the Soviet period so they know each other um you know there there was there was all sorts of stories about Soviet infiltration into the Indian system during the during that period as well\nA lot of compromise material all that sort of stuff\nThat's the way of putting it yes [laughter]\nSo um you know I think it takes a long time to to to read that up but also you know they the the Soviets were there for India at a time when sometimes others weren't but there is that the more serious problem is that a lot of the stuff that Russia sold to India has not been great\nThe quality has been particularly good and the price tends to keep going up and up and up with a very slow delivery\nSo the actual quality of what's been sold in the past has been a real problem\nYes I Wonder if they're going to send all those all broken soup ... and ... back to Moscow for their money back

other words we're seeing the ... fundamentals of what earth is made up of art how earth came to be\nNow the puzzle is what can New Horizons achieve forests Allen I go to the instruments are on board they were spectacular with Pluto and we saw that first part of Pluto and then you gave us details of the planet and then we the binary emerged\nAnd uh we're still getting information from those photographs all downloaded doping analyze what can work comparably ultimate truly considering that it might be a contact ... binary considering it might be dark substance and considering we're so far away from\nUh the earth that this signal takes so long so what are you expecting out\nWell we have a a very sophisticated little spacecraft is going to be visiting ... truly a New Year's eve and New

and how it was formed we're going to map it in stereo so that we can determine the photography we're going to map it in color so that we can see if there are variations across the surface that indicate past activity\nCurrent activity or even that it was made of several different things that came together\nWe're going to map its surface composition with our composition spectrometers we're going to search for satellites we're going to search for rings we're going to search for weather has an atmosphere\nAnd given has satellites or rings or an atmosphere\nWe're going to determine their composition we hope I can learn about their geology we hope so this is a wide ranging investigation this bringing it may easing scientific firepower to bear and it sounds like science fiction you know where we have a robot or billion miles away\nI'm doing a thirty two thousand miles per hour flyby of four billion year old relic of planetary formation but that's what NASA can do and that's what New Horizons is about\nDavid ... are you expecting a rocky surface or do you do you have any expectation or it's just a blank slate waiting to see what you find\nWell it's a little bit of both David\nUm we've never been to anything like this we'd never been anything so far away we never been to anything that's so well preserved we know very little about it you know with Pluto we knew a fair amount going yet we knew there had an atmosphere we knew its basic surfaced opposition we knew had five satellites that we knew what their orbits were for example\nA witch ultima about all we know is something about the size and shape and the Hubble Space telescope measured it's color and tells us that it's reddish\nAnd that's about it so we're going in with eyes wide open we'll see now you know the answer your question a little more specifically we don't expect to find liquid on the surface for example yes we expect to find a solid surface but we don't know what kind of land forms will be there we don't know what kind of details\nUm surface will present is for example crevice loose or false or craters on the surface it'll provide windows into the interior didn't ever have activity did ever develop its own geology or is it simply a relative of a ancient planetary formation didn't ever have an atmosphere\nHow many moons does it currently have it might be knowing that it might be a whole swore\nA so this is pure exploration and as I said no one's been anything like this\nWe won't know much about it until we get to New Year's eve\nBut starting New Year's eve and then for weeks and in fact for months as we download the data will be learning more and more about ultimate and this whole new class of objects out in the corporate belt or for the first time and over a period of many months\nAllen I Can't help myself I have to ask about Pluto because there's so much no unknown about ultimate tool like there was the suggestion that Pluto has underground ocean sisters two years old now\nIs there an update you can give us to have you got certainty or uncertainty about the possibility of conditions that would be conducive to life as we know on Pluto\nWell that's holding up it turns out that is one of the most exciting discoveries that I'm\nA that the New Horizons a data can bear on ah the possibility that Pluto has a deep underground liquid water ocean\nAh we have circumstantial evidence for it in that case is not only held up but its strengths and\nOvertime and members are scientific team you know have some new results that I uh I Can't the most because they haven't been accepted for publication that really strengthen this story an ad details to what the opposition to that ocean may be\nSo uh in in I think we're going to need an orbiter around Pluto in

I'm I'm really impressed by the security that there was not a leak\nWell David Gray or who was considered the father of the tunnel really made it a his job to keep the the intelligence on on the tunnel very limited\nIn the meantime they're preparing for their scape which is going to be when the right field returns because they need that cover what else did they need to prepare\nWell here's the thing I mean all of them had been out before all had been recaptured they realize now it holds men that I wasn't enough to get beyond that while you had to get to the home run you needed to get all the way in about\nA hundred and fifty mile hundred and fifty miles which is no easy they're ... they're much farther from the ...\nThey need it for rivers um they need food they need complex as
