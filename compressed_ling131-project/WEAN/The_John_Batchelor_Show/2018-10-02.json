Mogadishu October three four Nineteen Ninety three twenty five years right about now the U.S said pushed forces rangers others into a rescue effort in the area Mogadishu was collapsed to our understanding this is the George W. Bush administration\nLate in the administration uh and then the Clinton Administration inherited it so that's why in late Ninety three the U.S is still involved with special forces\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east British you never give them the best financed reason unbelievable prices in cars with zero percent need your for Seventy two months you can be driving on the boards also models interest free log on to what Tom\nWas abused stretch back to the early days of the U. S. landing in Somalia bill the Italians who struck some in Mogadishu what is the expectation\nYes or so and Italian a unit of part is part of the European Somalia was it in a in a district in Mogadishu with ... suicide bombers of is al ... as you know twenty five plus or to just about twenty five years later\nBut you know al ... continues to haunt us on the west\nIn Somalia and ... and ... title was involved in the black Hawk Down incident Mohammed ... who he was killed in two thousand and one involved at nine or ... and they all kind of military leader he was in Mogadishu\nUh with some other al ... and they instructed the tribesmen who are fighting us or in the black Hawk Down incident on how to hit the U.S helicopters that hit them in the ... the the Blackhawks and the the rotor the tail rotor and that's what brought them down and cause you know the the the may lay and that led\nAnd the city so you know we continue to fight\nAl ... to this day ... its branch there as we noted earlier\nThey uh they they Shabaab likes to use suicide attacks against everyone and anyone that he can uh it it had a a ... in Somalia is one of the we were the first I think two or three American suicide bombers\nUm that have conducted attacks Somali that's for the first American suicide bomber enough that it's attacking and I believe you hit a un compound a couple of years ago and killed and dozens of people\nAnd so the Italian operation was struck by the Shabaab a operation do we operate just quickly bill do we operate forces on the ground in Mogadishu absolutely\nThe U.S special forces a partner up with African Union and Somali forces and when we launch airstrikes often it's because we engage with Shabaab in there's heavy combat and airstrikes or to bail out um our forces and it's\nAbout this of the partner forces there\nYes the long war we think it's Afghanistan no Somalia twenty five years and counting Tom you note that Mogadishu this the Shabaab still mentioned a county when they when they remember their origins\nYeah you know it's still not really understood a John but one thing is we have to document all the time is the fact that Shabaab and other groups like them around the world\nHave adopted the kind of program all the way through and this includes all sorts of different operational I'm sort of a strategies and tactics right down to the ideology and sort of the playbook there for who they are going to reference as sort of key ideological figures and in their thinking and how they look at the world in ... and the county is certainly one of them\nUm you know Shabaab has referenced the economy's in their propaganda and the tall bond as well a number of times and this this is just not something we find to be uncommon with a lot of these groups and it's one of the one of the indicators that we look at the show how these groups are in fact I'll ... or part of all kinda\nWe go to advise the attack on a military parade many wounded many dead and last week when we discussed is there were videos provided by the attackers of the martyrs in the operation but it's much dispute these last days by Tehran\nThat the attackers were ISIS a mock news agency put an announcement out part time you tell me their airstrikes launched by the Iranians in Syria they seem to be a coincidental\nWell the Iranians struck Islamic state targets in eastern Syria as a response for what happened in Nevada that's attached to the mission by the Iranians that despite all the bluster they know that it was in fact the Islamic state that carried out the attack\nThe Iranians for their own reasons and their own interests are very keen to blame anything on the Saudis the Americans Israelis there's a whole laundry list of sort of actors that they try and point the finger at but the bottom line is that there's there was early on after this attack was already evidence that it was the Islamic state not dispositive\nNot foolproof but there were strong evidence that it was his comic state\nAnd that evidence I Would say in my judgment is gotten only stronger over time including with these airstrikes by the Iranians which as I said it's\nSort of a tacit admission that they think the Islamic state did but John in the last ... seconds go ahead and tell him he\nSaid even released a very special message from spokesmen touting the attack and advise and that's not the type of thing they do unless they really mean that they did it Tom jobs\nBill rose you they are senior fellow and the foundation for the defense of democracy they keep the long war journal not just Afghanistan but back to Somalia twenty five years now\nWilliams and then the\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda daycare Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition at what forward and he's written a generic ... that's right over two hundred\nThe political will to match them right now they know a lot of our capabilities but they don't no political will and I think that there are still testing I'm the president\nBecause although President Trump has given them a hard time on trade in some other things they still think that there's room for them to force him to back down which is the reason why they're trying to influence our elections specifically this mid term\nSaturdays and I just want to focus on what you said Gordon they aren't as well trained as arm as our navy that increases the risk of miscalculation ... doesn't it\nWell it certainly does um because you've got a lot of very arrogant flag officers in China right now and they're really itching for a fight they've got all this new equipment they think their bowl they think that we're in terminal decline and hear all the rest of it\nPlus if you add in what John was referring to in the beginning you got to see June paying who basically maybe thinks he's got a closing window of opportunity to deal with us\nBecause he's concerned about his economy has got to be concerned about other things this is a very good time to take the United states on so that's why you know people talk about it quote unquote decade of concern I think that it's maybe a couple of years of concern and those couple of years Thaddeus there right now\nThe Chinese ministry of defense complained that dictator violated Chinese saw China's sovereignty\nNo Vietnam in ... Taiwan also claim the spot in the islands Gordon does a destroyer captain make a decision on his own to come this close to ... I mean all they can totally dominate the area\nOr they're dealing with a super wash up and it's wired into our network so it's not alone out there that destroy a captain the P L A navy started captain make the decision on the spot or we see under orders is he talking to Beijing when he does it\nYeah I I'd be really really really surprised if the Chinese captain was making decisions on his own because that's not the way the Chinese military works\nIn addition to all the chain of command issues because for instance are kept in was not making decisions on his own but you know in China is much more tightly controlled you've got political officers at all levels of military so these decisions were being made back in ... during a at extremely high level\nFatty mean you mentioned in our campaigns acting under orders to can you explain that\nThis is the freedom of navigation operation these are not planned by the commander of a ship these are plan not even at the level of seven fleet or I think that we're talking about\n... of the commander of the Indo Pacific region which would be Honolulu and probably even up further up the change to the chief of naval operations top admiral\nAnd indeed I I wouldn't be surprised if the president himself were generally a prize\nOf what the navy was going to do maybe not on a specific um pass by like this one but in general what the plan was so clearly this politically sensitive on both sides and you're not going to have decisions being made at the lowest levels\nA detailed chart and we're told within these last hours that Secretary Mattis you will not make a trip to China a it's a little unclear whether there was a trip planned and they called it off or whether they were planning and they just decided not to go forward\nDo you find any significance Gordon given Mr Madison's last visit where there were a sharp words that the Chinese are no longer talking ... yeah\nWell this is significant you know there were going to be a meeting um they had maybe specifically a ... a set the time but they were definitely going to have it because this was part of an established dialogue\nAnd what happened is the Chinese said that um Secretary Mattis is counterpart was not going to be available so of course the Pentagon I'm\nNo called off that trip\nYou know this is one of those cases where you've you've got the Chinese throwing a temper tantrum it's in their interest to have this milk Tamil exchanges and they're calling them off because they are upset about one thing or another and we're seeing this temper tantrum play out it's like you've got sucks in Beijing who are now acting like three year olds\nThat that is you know and so what does Madison now when the when the he his counterpart is available or does he accepted\nMeeting does he know or does he say well you know I might not be available now myself\nI ... that's a great question Thaddeus and that decision is not going to be made by Mattis that's going to be made um maybe by the president in consultation with his senior White house staff\nWhat's your Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve we own condition and blood for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices log on to flood Otto John John now\nPeople in Washington think that you've got to have engagement you got to have these contacts\nAnd so therefore they pure desperate to the Chinese to have\nThese um discussions these discussions do produce anything you know except we produce a lot of carbon as we fly over to Beijing are they fly here for really no purpose at all the Chinese are not willing to talk they're not willing to act responsibly I just don't see the point of talking to the\nCourt and this is a question because you do a great deal of Congress have a great deal conversations with major media figures and you travel have we passed a point guard and where the relationship is broken how we how are we past that now are we\nAre I Know we're very well informed this audience is very well informed in China\nBut I Can't tell whether they're still feeling whether there's still some sense that we can repair this I Can't tell\nIf we can repair John but we shouldn't try to repair it because we appear to desperate in the past\nBut I you know what the you know the past were ongoing\nYeah I think the Chinese right now are not willing to talk so I don't see this being repaired um because we're not going to make the effort they're not going to make the effort we have got to raise all sorts of issues of their objectionable conduct they're going to react badly to this\nSo I don't see that we're going to have good relations as people to find good for a very long time I think the relations are going to be good because good is getting what you want good is standing up for your principles we haven't done that for a very long time John\nAnd you know people can complain a lot about this president but he's doing the right thing with regard to China and we need to support him\nLater on this evening I Will have a conversation with captain Jerry Hendricks US Navy aviator retired we will talk about the shape of the navy for the immediate future\nWe're building a navy China's building a navy\nFor trouble trouble that's what we're

show temperament that's right\nThat is now become a debate because judge Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary committee within these last days defended himself from allegations that are completely over the top craze and yet because he was in Tempe rich in defending his honor his family's life\nThat means he can't sit on the court goes the argument Andy I don't back it up with any facts because there are no but the idea of judicial temperament is late to the game what is it that the Democrats hope to achieve by throwing this down good evening to\nGood evening John well what they want to achieve with every single aspect of their strategy with respect to Kavanaugh is delay so it the more issues they can raise\nThe more things that need inquiry into the more witnesses that needs to be a deposed or interviewed\nThe more they can argue that\nThis needs to be pushed back in time and the ultimate objective your courses to push it back beyond the midterm elections in the Democrats hope that they will take over the Senate take control of it and then be able to defeat Kevin ... on the numbers\nSo the judicial temperament argument is just noise that it it doesn't come does it actually exist or did they just make this a\nWhile they didn't make it up I mean they're they're reacting to Kavanaugh's\nA very uh ... indignant at times passionate spirited defense of himself and his honor which is not only been smeared and dragged through the mud but I I I Believe if you um\nIf you look at what some of the things that have been set about cabinet I mean they actually called him a serial rapist on absolutely\nZero evidence the ... even if the if the case against him is collapsing for want\nOf any corroboration or verification these outlandish\nUh and and really smearing a awful things that they've said about him continue to ring in the air so he reacted to that as any normal person would react to it or they regard that as a temper it I thought it was actually quite temperate under the\nCircumstances I mean I guess uh you know Aristotle would would remind us that we have temper for a reason right so the question is what is it for and if it's not for occasions like that I don't know what it's for\nHis creditors also plays a part in now ... seems to bring into the arguments about but he drinks too much despite any corroborating\nEvidence ... actually the case because this is part of it over all these are ... they're looking for things now in addition to just slip temperament anything like an anger head on to extend their sort of try to swear Republican wrote\nI think that's exactly right of course they'd like to to sway Republican votes and they've seen in the case of a Jeff Flake who collapsed after say he was going to vote for Kavanaugh\nOr it turned into a vote with their caviar to delay when he was accosted in an elevator by what turned out to be to a hard left progressive activists\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne as over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us that's right and one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nTemperament or is this completely separate uh allocation\nWell I I don't they haven't John to my knowledge tied the the drinking allegation to judicial temperament and I guess we should tell our listeners that ... in terms of judge Kavanaugh the allegation of a lack of judicial temperament is particularly absurd\nBecause unlike some nominees to the bench he's actually been on the bench for twelve years and is widely acclaimed by colleagues by people who appear before him by people who've worked for him or as one of the most a civil and thoughtful people\nTo appear before a model of judicial temperament in fact a Kavanaugh's very diverse\nStable of law clerks is coveted by a not only are members of the bar but also by the Supreme Court he has sent more\nUh clerks to the Supreme Court ah than virtually anybody at his uh it it's very it's level so you know the idea of all the things to attack a\nTo attack Kavanaugh for judicial temperament would you would think would be the least likely a I think that's an outgrowth of a ... the fire which which he reacted to the ... marching of his honor at the hearing the drinking allegation I think is because they won't dare\nTo his face at least while he's sitting there suggests that he actually\nCommitted sexual assaults in was a serial rapist or one of the arguments they want to make is that they think that his denials of this are very a credible and passionate but perhaps he had a drinking problem and committed rapes that he forgot I suppose\nA the idea being that his ah you know his his mind may not have been in it but it is but his body was it's it's absurd but you know anything that might get traction will be tried it out here that is\nOr anything they can put the press this was going to protect our low point for the media and covering or any confirmation hearings for such a crazy on their part to this question than Andy is\nWhat's going to happen now and we're just going to continue to see this the allegations accusations anything they can put in a cramped going to court and and but at the end of the day there should be a vote shouldn't there one way or another\nYeah there has to be a vote that he is and what that means is that it eventually the Republicans are going to have to have the gumption\nThe number is to simply say enough is enough you\nKnow we have to keep reminding ourselves that a judicial confirmation proceeding is not a trial it's not a counterintelligence investigation it's not designed to to do a full blown criminal investigation and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that somebody's engaged in misconduct it's actually not even an executive branch function\nIt's a Senate function\nOf exercising the advice and consent power the FBI's role is just to support that it's not a normal FBI functioned in fact uh if you think about it there was no FBI until\nNineteen away so the Senate was confirming\nA judicial nominees for over a century without any assistance from the FBI the thought that the the the Congress needs the executive branch perform it's a constitutional function is absurd and I think that you know Senator McConnell who runs the Senate\nOr as long as

F. A. Eighteen super hornets the lightning to the new at thirty five ... all that good stuff off the carrier plus one more thing\nUnmanned strike platforms an unmanned tankers those are the new elements so let's present the plot at less present the problem first what is the challenge for the carrier groups now with their air wing manned airwaves what is the challenge for the good evening to you Jeremy\nGood evening John and there's one additional element of mess and that's one of the purposes of this paper are filling the scenes in us long range penetrating strike is also the land base element which is the air force be Twenty one bomber and the beach twos and and their legacy force and this is all about\nHow do we integrate a one at a a relevant carrier air wing in the future with these new platforms are going to be coming in the air force to actually come up with sort of a joint combined campaign to take on the anti access or denial\nTechnologies that both China and Russia are trying to bring to the poor or to try and keep us from being able to reach an hit them in their critical centers of gravity they political economic uh or or or military and so this paper wanted to look I developed some themes a few years ago\nIn a paper called retreat from range that looked at the carrier air wing and then we did another paper about higher farther and faster which looked at the development\nOf the new be Twenty one bomber and what I saw was that I take it needs to separately are distinct platforms I wanted to see how they would work or develop a concept of operations about bringing them altogether and you're right one of the key essential elements of this is the idea of\nTankers an unmanned platforms and how they can come in\nTo knit this very diverse joint environment together into a coherent whole\nThe a challenge is the shortfall of the range now from the carriers and the expectation that the PR see I'm going to name the folks here the PR see has developed\nDemonstrates their commitments\nHow would you like motor trench twenty a jeep truck of the year for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty eighty four to one fifty so desperate

bachelor show [noise]\nI'm John ... the John ... show kind of Jerry entering the United States Navy aviator time is at the telling us grew\nIt vi seeing for example Northrop Grumman building aircraft carriers we're also looking at a paper the Jerry Rohde at his last days of the center for new American security just published about the challenges for the navy in the air force for the U.S military in the Pacific especially off the shores of East Asia\nAgainst an aggressive predatory state to Chinese with their Russian allies after the year twenty thirty when Xi Jinping the president for life\nTells us that he expects his military to match and ... match the United States Navy their chief\nA threat to their tyranny in the far Pacific Jerry we've spoken on the air wings and the shortfall we've spoken of the carriers even the forest for class carrier not having an answer until in the navy and the air force worked together for deep strike\nBut you write if something called the fine fixed finished kill chain dealing with hyper sonic weapons that can travel very quickly\nAnd this other element that doesn't exist now although I understand it's being built and they're the Navy's debating it didn't unmanned platform both as a strike platform and as a tanker platform what does that mean Jerry and what what are they building\nWell what what is important here is is minimizing what we call late and see which is the time separation between when you can find a platform\nOr find a target you want to fix its location you want to track it and then you want to be able to then targeted for elimination so if we have a a a space based asset or an overhead a intelligence surveillance reconnaissance drone\nThat is watching and it has to watch uh almost persistently to see any subtle changes in the movement of platforms are geography\nOnce it detects something that looks like a target then you want to minimize the amount of time between a classifying it as a target and then putting a weapon on that target the problem is is all too often now or were either using overhead space based I uh I asked our assets or overhead I'm a unmanned platforms\nThat are not equipped with weapons and so the idea of having a platform that can penetrate into a very advanced a surface to air missile environment or that means that that platform would have to have a low aspect stealth are all aspects self or all the way around it\nAnd then would have to have a deep magazine 'cause eventually once you have that platform get in there you want it to persist in that environment for a period of time uh so they could hit perhaps multiple targets so uh the the problem there becomes you know how long can men sit in a bomber or an aircraft and still be combat effective\nOr if you're in a very large bomber like the new be Twenty one than perhaps you can do that and you get up and move around a little bit of stretching legs but sport naval aircraft it's very difficult to do that and you're almost limited to ten hour profiles\nSo the idea of launching an unmanned platform from a carrier and then having a platform refuel on its way to the target so that it can extend its endurance and then look for targets identified them hit them and then move on to a new set of targets that's really sort of the holy grail of this uh\nHow would you like motor trench twenty a jeep truck of the year for only one Ninety nine will say hello to forge twenty eight teams for that one of the best for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a flood forward and he joined Narragansett\nYou want to go with the heavier load and you want to be able to persist there and so the navy has fallen short of that over the last generation and a half\nIs the navy fighting in the last ... that is the curse of the twentieth century\nSo we we actually talked about this week we think that the navy ... gets up every morning prepares to fight the battle of midway um and so it's not just the last war it's perhaps three wars that\nGo why does that great victory at but at seven minutes to change the course of the war\nAbsolutely absolutely and everyone you know wants to be able to go to a point lock and know the game plan to execute and the army for that sense I mean I I think we're the U.S military sort of fixed a strategically in sort of the larger wars of of the second World War without moving on to the environment we actually exist in\nAnd so looking to the future if the navy was looking to that than it would be wanting to move its carrier air wings or to a new um a mix of aircraft in order to keep them relevant into these future environments that we can see coming\nWere missiles and directed energy and longer range weapons systems are going to dominate but that's far we have not seen that in fact we seem to be can Washington in the Nineteen nineties when we could park a carrier in the ... seat and then take a Fifteen minute hop over into the former Yugoslavia\nUm and and no one's going to shoot back at you so the idea of being locked strategically into permissive environment seems to be the mistake that we've made over the last Thirty years\nIs the carrier secure now as it as a deploys into the Pacific to act Kennedy defeat China now carry\nA show that that's a great question I Would say that we still maintain that advantage over the Chinese now both geostrategic police strategically at the operational level and perhaps even tactically but the Chinese are are building capabilities and resources very quickly\nAnd at some point in time you can you can envision in your mind that sometime within the next ten years I Believe and the twenty twenty five to twenty thirty timeframe\nThat there will be at the marsh and um and they will call our bat\nAnd we'll have to make a decision whether we're going to lean in and come to the age of an ally or partner or whether we're going to cede that portion of the ocean and that portion of the world to a Chinese sphere of influence and I fear that we will not be ready for that challenge\nAnd the U.S navy right now in the debates are looking forward they're talking about a three hundred and fifty five ship navy perhaps by twenty thirty would that provide the ... of the security that the carrier needs in order to penetrate the Pacific\nSo it will head in that direction because we certainly do need more platforms in order to surround our aircraft carriers and give them adequately defenses but this other part that I raised in the paper which is we need to invest in a new generation of missiles new generation of radars and sensors\nThat will allow those ships or be they cruisers destroyers or ...\nOr to better protect that carrier and its air wing as its executing mission we also need a new generation of a ... century to do to the day to day presents operations to preserve the peace in the interim between now in that war and then they'll serve an escort\nA mission once a war begins and and I think the navy is beginning to think about that we've set the number right three hundred and fifty five ships\nWhat we haven't set is what type of ships with in that number so that has not been decided on\nAnd I noted that the air force in this last week\nMade the mentioned that they needed to grow from three hundred and twelve squadrons to three hundred and eighty six so they have a number but again they're debate is how many squadrons of what type how many squadrons of bombers versus how many squadrons of fighters I Would argue they need many more bombers than fighters in their future for scotch\nCaptain Jerry ... directs the United States Navy retired writing for the center for new American security in his last days he's now to tell them a

was if it had been reviewed by the time that this was a British Intelligence propaganda operation it could have played out very differently so so all the schools to save a whole Lawrence of a telegram the first place he is so concerned that this doesn't get out that he doesn't even tell the foreign office which you know by by law he should have\nUm a because of his concern he he he was he was concerned that the Americans would learn 'em that he was\nIntercepting American messages and to his dying day I'm In in the late Nineteen thirties early forties he never admitted um how he had originally intercept the telegraph\nIn fact he created several legends one of which was that it was because someone at Pearl ... documents\nRelating to the Swedish embassy on board the ship which carried bounced off the German ambassador back to Europe having been thrown out by the Wilson Administration hall was a creative genius however I mean we have to stay on top of Wilson because\nA page takes the document back and has a trend crypt up hasn't translated into code and they send it to the state department and Lansing the American secretary of state is the way on a vacation that weekend so his counselor State Department Foggy Bottom Frank poke\nCarry a has ... has the telegram\nDeep coded on coded cribs analysis on his part with the code book\nAnd he sees the document he sees the revelations\nHe doesn't get to take it to the president of the United states until the next day Sunday\nAt and at this point he introduces to Woodrow Wilson a a plot that it's so fantastic the question is will Wilson believe it and Thomas Wilson is convinced that America must stay out of the war when he sees this telegram\nYou write that Mr pokes memoirs\nSuggested Wilson took immediate action then he very much present this case is the state department and the White House moving together the president moving together was Wilson reluctance Wilson has thoughts in his mind that this might be a fraud\n[noise] um well I mean certainly he asked the question you know is this real can we trust this I'm I'm a you know he knew this was coming from the British\nI think I think he he he he never really believed this was a British forgery I don't think he he he thought the the the Brits would be so primitive to try something like that on him um\nBut the interesting thing to me was when I read about Wilson's reactions and it's it's difficult to gauge because he did leave any more so you have to read it through you know the memoirs or the notes of other people um\n... ... of course he he he's not very happy when you hear that um I don't think he's seriously believe that you believe the United states is is in danger of Mexican invasion and but as I said earlier and interview he was\nEven at that point still hoping that um you know he could bring about a peace between the warring parties that would be immediate body noted states\nNow when he sees the telegram of course he understands the Germans are really not interested in um in peace they are preparing for war against the United states he at that point see this all efforts to bring about a negotiated peace\nAnd so the telegram doesn't doesn't push him into the war that will be too simplistic but I think it's fair to say that he stopped believing in bringing about media to peace and then eventually it takes a series of steps that brings the United states into the war so it\nIt it didn't precipitate America's intervention but it's certainly accelerated it um but it's also interesting to see it Wilson's reaction when he is told by by Lansing who returns see one or two days later\nAnd he asks Lansing well how did the um\nOut of the Germans transmit this telegram I'm\nIn Lansing tells him well it was probably done throughout by our you know thrown cables\nAnd it seems to me Wilson was almost more offended by the fact that the Germans were abusing this this you know American hospitality ... riding them used the cables then by the content of the telegram itself and if you know something about it we'll see you know he he was very high minded he was something very moral somebody moralistic\nUm but it costs you all she could also be very petty and take things very personally nothing was done on until I was a good\nExample of that he is personally offended that the Germans would do with something like that I'm a abuse abuse the good services of the United states\nThomas folk artist the author ... telegram intelligence diplomacy in America's entry into World War one
