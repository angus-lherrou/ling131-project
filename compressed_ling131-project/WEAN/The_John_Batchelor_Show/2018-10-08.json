years ago it looks like I got to block the dock streets coming down on the ... and I'm not that far away from the airport here a lot island and I got plans at some time to do all that and stay away\nMaybe dumping they're a part of fuel or whatever they do [laughter] a lot of land and I'll\nThink they're flushing the bathrooms on your roof there about what they do and listen uh let me ask you a question for you but this roof on did you take the old way of all yes of course okay now I'm the old rule did have an e streak in your same problems not rarely now is your home shady\nUh yeah that some shade or in front of the house yeah you get more straight from the front of that\nI just noticed that in the front of a little bit late right like above the entrance of the door you know ... but I got a a by shape how a ... type of show\nOne in thinking here is that typically the area where the roof rafter touches the roost she right where the would basically isn't solid contact\nThat's a cooler spot than the areas that are right and left of it so sometimes when we get these stripes on the roof it's a condition called ghost thing and it's because you get more condensation\nA in those areas that are cold nearest enter warms the left and right in it now also on the shady side of the house or wherever you have shade you're also much more likely to pick up a little algae or like in ...\nAnd that can also cause standing on the roof\nSo before we jump to conclusions or they would suggest you do is use to take a very simple approach is a roof clear out there that's called spray and forget it's available and ready to use bottled you basically just snap a hose and garden hose onto\nAnd then you can spray the roof down\nAnd just kind of walk away and see what happens I actually haven't had an extremely dirty shed roof that has so much moss on it and it was crazy 'cause it just hadn't done anything for a long time so so last summer when I was\nPainting the fence and doing the repairs outside of decided that we take care of that and I got the springs forget and I put it on once and then I walked away for about a month knows that homes all it was going to put it on one more time and it's perfectly clean and put it down doesn't happen instantly because basically what it does that stops the gross from forming\nThink of it in a sort of a weed killers or the moss\nAnd it brightens the roof and then there's a residual in stays on it and kind of protection law also I Would try or products like that it's very simple fairly inexpensive and see if that doesn't pay and then if it does then you've got to know what you're dealing with\nUm one natural thing that you can do to ... though that group down to teach me try to get a little more sunlight on that area sometimes I've told folks a traumatic trees and us should just enough light on it because the sunlight is a natural Mildred side as well so it makes sense\nAll right I'll give it a shot\nAnd have you got a
