Muhammad this begins to feel like the Cold War Tom the ethics and the CIA recruiting men who have been executed by Shabaab\nYeah well actually Shabaab executed these guys who were ... they were allegedly recruited by the U.S\nBritish Intelligence and small intelligence to spy on Shabaab or to cause problems for Shabaab\nAnd Shabaab like other all kinds of branches does this fairly regularly they have a campaign take out certain alleged spies to try and show that they are you know have infiltrated the ranks of that there's going to be accountability for that now what they're trying to do is tied this back to both the air campaign that we just were talking about with the U.S has been watching these drone strikes against targets\nBut also to the Islamic State's president so\nThis isn't Shabaab Shabaab of course opposed the Islamic state just dissolve all kind of does and in Somalia the Islamic state has an upstart presidents that trying to basically carve out a niche from within Shabaab to try and challenged about or is it thirty\nThus far Shabaab is is the far stronger ... player and I don't think that's going to change anytime soon Islamic state presence is much smaller but Shabaab is part of its information campaign to try and undermine the Islamic state is accusing some of these spies including one in particular were allegedly worked for and my six\nOf taking money from the Brits and giving it to the Islamic state in Somalia to try and basically a build up the Islamic State's presidents and sort of strengthening at your Bob's expense I think that that's probably more propaganda information warfare and their part they're trying to undermine the Islamic State's legitimacy but you know the details all get very murky very quickly\nUm we just have a minute and to your knowledge is the U.S seeking to negotiate with Shabaab wastes negotiating with the Afghanistan Taliban\nYou know John that's a great point you know the tall blond what's happened with his negotiate with the U.S us the same as the tall blondes Islamic emirate is somewhat legitimate in Afghanistan and of course it's all butter Maine's cool see out while I with all kinds of the day on the other hand Shabaab which is part of al ... is trying to build its Islamic emirate and of course the U.S is not negotiating with\nThem and so we have two countries going in the same direction under al ... is a mantle and the U.S is negotiating with one part of al ... has linked but not negotiating with the other part yes yes we can't rule it out in the future ...\nYeah I mean nothing can be ruled out at this point I I doubt Shabaab would ever agree to any sort of overt negotiations with the American side um because America doesn't have the the substantial foreign right there in ... that it doesn't have guessed\nI'm Justin who keeps the long war journal he's a senior fellow at the foundation for the defense of democracy\nThis segment national security report ... by scholars scholars

up our are no longer the by words today we're closing the economy down there they're going back to state dominated markets and state determination of prices\nSo you know at this particular time um this looks really bad because it shows that um this is the way that season ... thinks it's going to emit they might be able to do a little bit of short term getting through it by determining markets but they can't really have a long term solution here\nAnd you know you're absolutely right this is I think the inevitable result of communism see jumping is not an aberration he's the inevitable result of China's Communist system\nI'm going to use the chess metaphor I Am not a good player but I certainly know how to use the metaphor Gordon uh whenever the night moves on a board I've learned pay attention\nThe night is the hard to predict very dangerous piece when on the attack I read a report from Washington a pie by making a rare second trip this year to Vietnam defense secretary Jim Mattis is signaling how intense simply\nThe Trump Administration is trying to counter China's military assertiveness by cozying up to smaller nations in the region and share American wariness about Chinese intention Madison is the night\nQueen ... court what's going on what is Vietnam how does this fit into the Chinese matrix\nYeah I mean it's as you say John I'm the United states is working with countries along China's periphery this really surprised me that you had as you say the second trip of mad as this year to Vietnam\nBut you know one trip a year or one trip every three or four years on the part of the secretary of defense\nThat would be normal two trips a in a year that's not normal and that's a real indication that the Trump Administration is moving very actively to counter China and the Chinese have got to be really concerned because it's not only that we want to go to Vietnam is that the Vietnamese are accepting mad as\nThey know that that's going to anger Beijing and they're doing it anyway\nAnd the Vietnam means do I remember correctly garden that they bloody and the Chinese knows one time once upon a time not too far and go\nWell it's not only one time not to Fargo which you're referring to Nineteen Seventy nine but you know throughout history the Vietnamese have been able to deal with the Chinese you know Joe and why the mountains premier when he was talking to Henry Kissinger in Nineteen Seventy one or Nineteen Seventy two\nYou're brought up just sort of out of the blue house the Vietnamese had really mold the Chinese two thousand years ago this is really on the minds of the Chinese that they just can't deal with Vietnam\nThat is called one other countries where do you think the defense secretary might be visiting in\nThe near term\nWell you know I'm assuming that all the reporting that he is I'm about to be fired or wrong and they probably are wrong you know you'd expect to see the secretary of defense go to the Philippines because that's the treaty ally\nAnd you'd expect him at some point to go to South Korea which is an unreliable treaty allies we've got some real military issues with the south Koreans who are taking down defenses without consulting us so you know that should be on his ... though I don't know how whether he'll actually in fact go\nBut you know you'll see a lot of senior administration officials around and I do hope that is that somebody of Madison stature goes to Taiwan that'll really tell the Chinese that the game for them is up they could not take Taiwan by force\nYeah there's

J. out of the great voice the great lakes are recovering politician and John Fund who's in Eastern Europe ... Hungary\nA wonderful capital rescued once upon a time by the success of the Reagan Administration in the end of the Cold War and it's a pleasure to talk to Eastern Europe because ah Eastern Europe is\nProsperous an ambitious and growing and they have great food very good so\nUh the uh Soviet Union exploited that food and now it's available for sale everywhere gentleman I turn to the midterms because I'll lose before and seems to have lost the argument she wants to talk about\nHer\nCreative heritage and Hillary Clinton seems to have lost the argument she wants to talk about her memory of Nineteen Ninety eight however in front of the Democrats is a challenge the economy is very good and pocketbook issues as my friend\nLarry Kudlow the director of the national economic council reminds everyone every time they listen\nPocketbook issues are white Americans vote on their terms presidential years off year ... we bought on the pocket book if it's good\nWe are grateful and we don't rock the boat if it's bad you bet we rock right now it's very very good so John\nI go to you again on this ABC poll about sixty nine battleground districts these are the ones where the Democrats are ambitions to pick up seats against the Republicans because Mrs Clinton did very well in these districts in sixteen though they have a Republican\nCongressional member right now and what is the generic spread John and what does this tell you about this paradox to have a good economy and democratic momentum\nWell I Would make an amendment to your statement the economy is good but Donald Trump is still a drag on Republicans or he has a lot of suburban women having said that the ABC Washington Post poll I ... I mean it's only one poll but it's a solid one\nUm the Democrats have a generic lead of almost ten in that poll but I'm sixty six swing districts twenty four which went for Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen the Republicans are ahead by one point the Republican\nNow other polls don't quite show that but they show that the swing districts are much closer because Democrats are going to waste a lot of their enthusiastic votes in district they were going to win anyway\nSo I think in CBS back the CBS background poll also believes that if the election were held with normal turnout today they will be a two hundred making two hundred and Seventeen split not clear which party would have a majority I think we're heading to a much closer house\nUm result than people anticipate because the battleground districts are not the country\nThat is you have institutional memory because you wrote through the tidal wave for the blue in two thousand and six and you also saw what a block Obama as a candidate didn't two thousand and eight how do you read how do you interpret this is one poll I understand that it's a moving story but how do you interpret this\nThis unusual fact that the battleground districts the Republicans do well it\nIs much better now than it was back in those six and a weight as Mr funds and tell you that made it exceedingly difficult for the Republican majority in two thousand\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood born in East Village and they were against that have the best financed reason unbelievable prices in cars with zero percent eighty are for Seventy two months you can be driving on affords also models interest free log on to what Tom\nInducted by a democratic for that shows the Minnesota special election for the Senate to be competitive in clear single digits New Jersey there's a very hard hitting ad out attacking senator but then there's the Democratic incumbent for sex\nWith teenage prostitutes a quarter FBI reports from the Obama Justice department um I think that the Democrats are now defending more seats than they expected and if I had if the election were held today I think Republicans would gain Senate seats\nAnd gain that clear advantage it could be more judges including a possible mothers Supreme Court report lived next year\nMr fund the Democrats are doing very well talking about health care health care health care I saw that on ads for the last two weeks and yet these other issues have come up\nA it's a puzzle to me is is a lack of discipline or is this because in two thousand and six the Democrats in the house had the leadership of Nancy Pelosi and as far as I can tell she's completely disappeared I Can't find her\nWell remember about forty democratic challengers have said they're not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi should they get elected\nSo the last thing that she wants to do is remind voters that um she's there it is trying to become the next democratic speaker even though many members of her party clearly recognized she uses liability on the campaign trail\nStatus they may ... says you will know job but when they get there and they started getting shall we say acclimated to their caucus those votes can change can say\nWell yes but what if you have only two hundred and twenty Democrats or two hundred and Nineteen or two hundred and Twenty one you know Saturday as it has been since Nineteen fifty two that we had the congressional majority that was less than five seats\nAre from two hundred and Eighteen we've never before in our living memory had an extremely close house where every member counts because the speaker has to be elected with two hundred and Eighteen and majority of the entire house\nI watch Tony clips from CBS the sixty minutes interview between the president and the corresponding but I was struck by one thing John and I'm puzzled whether this is too late or too little\nThe president is acting very presidential these days he's quite he's quite clear about his accomplishments he's expansive about the policies that they've initiated there's nothing hesitant about 'em at all is that is that showing in the polls job\nWell actually Leslie stall who conducted the interview said I I've interviewed the president three times as candidate as president elect and that was president the the change in his level of self confidence that assertiveness is dramatic\nOr she says he's he seems to have grown up to the job in the country may not be comfortable with him and the job but he's comfortable and it\nI didn't see a president shooting from the hip I saw a man who who was prepared for the issues you know how he makes a little pyramid out of his fingers you and he's confident that the man I saw in that in that interview\nHe's on this message discipline I think through the election if it stays that will only help his party\nThat is meant just got a counselor Mr fund the greatest thing I heard the night the country may not be comfortable with him he just comfortable in the job [laughter]\nWhat what do you do you think that this will translate in the next couple of weeks the the messaging the tight messaging of the president and more parents whose because he's not going to stop campaigning for the rest of the Republicans\n[noise] no but I think that the Democrats submitted enough mistakes he's just going to remind voters over and over again that\nEven though they may have difficulty with him look at the other guys and by the way given you know Elizabeth Warren and given Hillary Clinton and given ... Kavanaugh given Michael ... you know the other team doesn't like it looked like professional paragon of governing virtue\nI Know John if if I was struggling with comparable actors on the Republican side I think I'd change the subject my goodness\nWhat a mullah ... especially mentioning Ava ... who's now a who's now a curse if he raise money for you everywhere he goes good heavens Johnson he's in Budapest, Hungary the Democrat political science says gain the house that's going to happen or is it\nThat is McCotter W. J. all the great voice of the great lakes I'm John ... [noise]\n\nWonder Chevy GMC ... Toyota and Subaru all have in common they're all in for Steve free own tradition and bought bought any religion or against it that's right over two hundred\nThree on cars all make all models and incredible prices are going to flood auto John job now\nMean he he admitted what he did which was to preach religion and and but never did anything\nCollie persecuted Braun they persecuted Brunson and they Saudi let's put this way they were in Ankara and Riyadh do not see the same book the same way let's put it that way\nLet All right I'll let me let me throw another one down near Iraq last time I checked a I Ankara and Tehran and Moscow we're having a meeting about defeating oil sanctions and that seems to be relevant here how they're doing now\nWhile it is relevant all of these things are open and what's most important John is that everything is interrelated you cannot separate anymore any one of these\nIssues will we see Iran and Russia now reaching a deal to circumvent us sanctions according to a number of reports that Dell supply crude oil Iran to to Russia's who the Caspian and then it would be exported worldwide\nWe've seen reports that I'm Indian vessels were taking on Iranian oil and then going to to ... to um Kuwait filling up and then selling it as if it is a it is Kuwaiti oil\nAnd the agreement with the Russians were supposedly reach last month when put president a potent and Iranian President Rowhani met in Tehran\nAnd the the the other sanctions the other um at this exposure about the efforts by Iran to ah to impose sanctions to to avoid the sanctions in the administration warn the world's banks\nThat they may try to use these duplicitous means to minimize the sanctions in panic they continue to fund terrorism and there's\nSigns that the the flow of oil seems to be according to new data from September that the oil industry is still quite robust and and it means that they are using a subterfuge and and other means like the example of India um\nTo uh to bypass or to cover their uh their exports so sanctions banning transactions with the Iran central bank the shipping comes to oil companies are all scheduled to take effect on November fifth\nSo it could be that they're trying to rush to these things these as much as they can export are now but it is certainly indicative of the weakness of the Iranian economy we know the teachers went on strike today we know that the price of milk has has gone up sharply and other goods that cannot tomato paste\nSold for sixty thousand ... in March is now a hundred and eighty thousand ...\nAnd the ... south that currency as a has fallen so dramatically I think it's a hundred and forty six thousand to the dollar now and the projection is that the Iranian economy will shrink by one point five percent or this year and maybe almost four percent and twenty Nineteen\nSo Iran is under a lot of pressure that the sanctions will work the new sanctions could be very significant in the U.S has to find ways to close these loopholes\nThat in America you know guys who have been recent reports show the Gazans believe in the ... the bigger problem than from us\nIt's exactly right and I think Palestinians over oil a blamed the PA by a bigger percentage than than the blame the um ah the Hamas for for\nWhat is happening and it and and it's reflected his lack of confidence\nAnd it shows that in the election or change is not going to bring about any uh any dramatic I'm a difference so we were seeing the um uh the the numbers that ... that came out that are more than almost fifty percent almost half\nA do not trust the PA they don't trust Hamas necessarily but they certainly don't trust the Palestinian authority\nAnd this is a you know a very significant figure when you're looking at what are the prospects for a changing things in in the um [noise] um and the guy in gossip for instance because if\nForty three percent of Palestinian state ... responsible for the bad situation and only a quarter blamed a Hamas\nAnd that and that's why they don't want demonstrate against Hamas 'cause they don't like the alternative and they don't want to ... to take over and and especially don't like it measures against its own citizens the fact that was another study that's coming out that shows a tremendous number of arrests by the\nPalestinian Authority figures against those who oppose it in the west bank so they they seem to accept Hamas control of Gaza\nYour mouth and I have learned because you've taught me the Europeans have a profoundly different understanding of anti Semitism then we\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model flood pays more than anything around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers on\nWe struggled with it by you indicate there is there a change is there an enlightenment in Europe are they pulling back from their exploitation of uh the the tragedy of the twentieth century\n[noise] uh it's it's a that's a good question but I I think it goes too far to think that the that they pulled back what we're seeing according to this latest survey that the Israeli foreign minister did in in major European countries\nShow a clear rise in support and this is the first time in memory for me that um there's been a turnaround in\nIn Germany in Spain and Portugal in Romania where we're maybe the support for Israel crew to fifty six percent in Portugal uh it went to forty eight percent and and versus thirty percent were not supportive\nIn Spain it was forty percent in Britain it went up the eight points to forty percent\nAnd this you know in the court urban area or a red and everything else and with all of the negative media and and measures that were adopted into campaigns in Europe against Israel to see this a turnaround I think it's it's really remarkable I Will tell you some it is not something I Would have been dissipated\nAnd the fact that in all these major ... countries in Europe a sympathy for Israel is increasing maybe it's a greater understanding\nOf the um of Israel's unique position maybe it's because today the middle east include said that they see what's going on in Syria they see what's going on in these other countries that have come\nTo realize that you have one source of stability and um you will have to see whether this is borne out over time but it's certainly a a surprising developed we\nHave a minute ... go ahead yes but let's remember that the people of Europe are different than the elite that would gain to govern I'm correct and\nThat is true in the countries like Britain and France which starts top down France tendency is to be bottom up but I think you're quite right that that that is a distinction and and still the numbers are not as positive as they should be\nAnd we see the campaigns continuing but this split the left right split that is exacerbating things they are also tend to benefit the understanding of Israel\nJeremy Corbyn not withstanding correct about that would be a tragedy\nVery much a tragedy and and the very fact that that he continues in the in the current path in Britain is very disturbing may be part of this is a reaction to that\nYes our cousins in London you're aware of the fact that Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister would\nBe a disruption between the

means to us today\nTo understand our liberal is\nThe genius of our forebears to give us freedoms that we take\nMuch for granted we don't understand what where they come from or we don't worry about the fact that they couldn't be taken from us now there is a word right that is very attractive\nThe French Revolution used the rights of man Tom tom Paine used it in his in his what you'd have to say very long pamphlet about the rights So Peter what did Edmund Burke the\nUh the parliamentary in addressing parliament don't do this to the American revolution and don't mistake the American revolution for the French Revolution what did he make up these claims of rights in the French Revolution and elsewhere Peter ah he what\nWhat is your Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve we own condition and what board and he's really Janeiro or against the wind over two hundred dollars all makes all models had incredible prices are going to flood auto John John now\nClaim on tethered to any historical experience with supposedly gay individual authority to protest to overturn any institution that this please them\nTo this Burke objective profoundly but he said the ... of the real rights of man I'm friendly the real rights of men are the ones that become that get re frack that he'd write the dense medium of politics\nThat are rooted in experience that are interpret that had been in this case interpreted by the British common law courts for centuries and provide guidance for living within political side in a way that protects\nAll the more or less all the um [noise] uh all the good and the private sphere that John Locke would like to see protected the Burke is a Paul again appalled by the notion of rights that turns them into revolutionary cut deals\nFor um destroying all of them heritage political society\nLet's connected to the twenty first century now Peter\nBecause you also have a recommendation of what needs to be done our college campuses are political parties and the television presentation of a most recent very unhappy advise and consent in the U.S Senate Judiciary panel have descended into these abstract\nFalse claims of rights that are pending as soon as we have people telling us what we cannot say we have people chastising as for who we are for well how were born\nWe have people right now so fearful that they whisper as if they were being overheard in our politicians\nAre I'd have to say at this point acting or they're pursued or under under assault there it's a simple Washington's under siege what can be done how do we how do we re start liberalism and at least in the conversation for the young people Peter\nWell the answer is no way a simple bought it off from Haines they for medical tell him all the conduct that you've been describing John ah it flows almost directly from the\nKinds of at the kind of education that uh we have been delivering to our students for more than two generations now it's it's an education that\nTrip from the curriculum including the curriculum of higher education\nAny serious study of the American political tradition any serious study of the principles of free speech and limited government any serious study of due process and and religious liberty it's an education to treat the American tradition as an almost I'm\nOn the scene saga of discrimination against people on the basis of race\nOr sex or class\nAt it in other words it's an almost and he's in\nIt that it's a false suffocation in that it takes ugly aspects that indeed are part of our tradition and presented as the whole truth and it excludes the glory of the achievements\nOf the modern tradition of freedom so that's a long winded answer the shortage at uh the short answer is that we must undertake a dramatic reform of our educational system so that once again\nWill produce students who leave our schools informed about the American political tradition its strengths and weaknesses its costs\nAnd benefits are and who understand the blessings they can they will receive by maintaining a the institutions of a free society\nAnd embrace liberal is not serious version called liberals but liberalism the idea that you don't you don't\nRetain you don't you don't protect your freedoms by by chastising others about their about their speech or their conduct now does not freedom that the

new book I Will hold\nAnd our protagonist cliff gates commands the Ninety six company that's part of the deployment of the overall sticks regimen but they are told\nThat they are going to hold the line and advance in a particular place where there's off hunting for us to his own aristocratic hunting for is called the Bello would cage is given the role of advancing on a village Bora Shay\nAt this point Jim cases understanding moving into the wheat fields because that's what surrounding him\nYou make a special case that the Marines were completely out of date they were believing in mass mosque a tree and advancing in a line not taking into account that they were going up against machine guns and artillery\nYeah they had a an overpowering belief in overpowering rifle power I shouldn't use power so many times but they believed in the rifle and they believed in marine marksman ship 'em\nSo they they a lot of different forces learn this and the first World War doesn't work you know good dancing in rows and being mowed down by machine guns is not a good way to to a fight about\nUm I Want you to add to the Bella would um course gates was still he was a second lieutenant um the company commander was Donald Duncan um\nBut they decided they made a decision to attack fellow would which indeed was a it was like a royal hunting area you have to keep the er and stuff in there the Germans were coming south and then they were heading east there are thirty five miles from Paris so they're getting very close\nAnd they sent the second division in a to a fend them off and the first to arrive was I\nBelieve the U.S twenty third regiment so they put them at the far eastern end of the line to block the road from many Germans come from that way and just by happenstance the Fort ... regiment was first and then the fifth regiment was came in after\nTook line in front of Belo would otherwise you might not have heard the Marines um the regulars got kind of a of shut out of the picture\nThat because it didn't really assault della with themselves anyway John harbor James harbored who was the afford a brigade commander was certain that there were hardly any Germans and the word he was just sort of it but it's that they\nHad infiltrated chase the French outrun adult strong a machine gun positions until late into the positions all through it very rocky craggy place and an juice sixty Americans decided to attack it so they sent the fifth regiment basically on the left in the morning to try to do that\nThan a general ... movement assault was order for the afternoon\nAnd it was at a salt on the far right or he used to live at the Ninety six company carried out on the ... village of Russia's was about five o'clock in the afternoon and basically like you said they're going to spread out on the line across the five hundred wide yard are wide open field and attacked us\nVery powerful a German position at Russia's many machine guns artillery a rifle man and a Kate's with leading his platoon sport but soon and that the men were literally bent over as if they're walking to a rating score\nAnd as he has bent over a bullet cleaning up his helmet knocked and cold and let this huge tempted to get the helmet throughout the rest of the war um\nBut he woke didn't even know how long he was out and uh he said his first impulse was to run away [laughter] so it's kind of unusual ... wrote character but just first battle really it looked to his right they saw some of his men over there being and he made his way through a severe a rifle power and machine gun fire to them\nAnd one of his men started pouring a wind from the canteen underwater on his head and Kate said hey you end up in my head give me a drinks we took a long drink of\nFortified he picked up in a band in French rifle like twenty men into brushed\nRight twenty ... um the fifty six men that ... of the platoon that started a gyms reporting thirty two casualties so twenty four reached the village

British as they weren't English how much he added that the German soldiers no longer hope to reach Paris all of them are sick of the war and he was glad he had been made prisoner so\nThe Marines get no noticed here Jim and that's part of your story is that the Marines' fight spectacularly in these massacres and yet or the army and pushing overall get all the headlines\nWell in a way um\nI Would tweak that to say that actually I think they did start getting a notice to the chagrin and anger of the army regulars regularly to the first division not not in a second to be so much but ah what happened was there was a correspondent for the Chicago Tribune went in with uh the\nPositions Floyd given the one who shies media yes\nWent in through the we feel took a bullet and the I knocked out and before hitting the advance you've been tipped off about the advance or get written a story that mentioned the Marines are pushing it laid out order to know you were to be identified\nThis is the Chicago Tribune is that what it was yeah\nYeah so it went out on the wires that story about marine storming Bello would and this kind of stuff and uh everybody thought given was dead so it gets to the censors off as a person's headquarters in Paris and he says well I'm a I'm going to let this through because it's the last thing I can do for zero Floyd you know see what it through the Marines\nI wanted to rape victim that's why the ... story here doesn't make any mention of it because this is via Chicago I see yeah is that don't really I mean they had right\nIt it it it may you know it everybody but actually it was like the Marines were the only ones fight the war after that to a lot of people there was like you know they never really hurt but they capture the America's imagination\nLet's take them into the village themselves because what one of the aspects of gyms book that is always worrying that once they capture a mission was a complete their mission and capture a point it's going to get worse\nYou know because the German counterattack and in this instance while they park themselves in this village the Germans then start using\nMustard gas over these next days and\nThey are the mustard gas is especially bad in the villages June eighth through eleventh gym as my no here that's when they just get rained upon by mustard gas and they don't retreat they they try to survive and their masks and many don't make\nNo what happened was they were in the village and they were getting pretty well pounded by artillery and they were really worried about a turban counterattack um there's a very vital point eastern and below what they could have blood which from there any Americans attacking it so it was a real strong point they needed the gas was not actually used in till later Kate spent several\nDays with his men by the by the night of just six\nHe said you know he had like an entire regiment of people that are basically held any town with a number of people who came in the reinforcement um it was on the night of a change their teeth he's actually pulled to the back lines and sat around in this cops trees basically there's a company\nAnd Seventy eighth company and they were spotted by German a balloon is all day and write as they were getting the last feed it about midnight or all hell broke through a mustard gas a high explosive shells just rained down on them for about an hour\nAnd basically what it was all over age would write home that his company with defunct a base it was just as of a bloodbath\nI Will hold is the book

know a a quite a ... yes exactly from quite a thing so you're you're looking at the you know these are the best and the brightest thrown at each other and then here's this kid\nFrom Columbus ohio a car racer who has this incredible ability he is not the best shot\nHe is not the best pilot\nBut if you combine shooting and piloting and being in the air he is the best at air and credible\nThere are ... that we begin combat combat is seriously in Nineteen Eighteen because the American army comes over its now coming over a hundred thousand a month and John ... deal of time may be very careful about the battlefield conditions in the ... the construction of the American led army\nThat a person wants to throw in against the Germans last hundred days and much of a ferocious action of John's book of your book John comes in the last in July August and September Nineteen Eighteen\nAnd I have to tell you as a reader it is heartbreaking because what you're watching these young men who go into the skies knowing they're going to die and they're coming up against a superior German air ... air force yeah very superior what is the flying circus\nFlying circus and it's an incredible thing started by Baron bon ... who are painted his entire by play tried playing\nRat Scarlett rat and everybody said no don't do that you're just going to stand out and he said I Want to stand out to bring the year so everyone in the flying circus on his side painted their planes bright colors\nYou imagine these guys going out and you talk about the bravery of it parachutes one example parachutes were invented right\nBut the everybody until the Germans on the last six weeks of the war did not issue the Americans did not issue they're young flyers parachutes because they felt it would be the fetus\nAnd that the first ten of trouble a pilot would drop out of the airplane they couldn't have that it wasn't 'til after the war that they realized oh my gosh\nThat's such a terrible tragedy to lose people and you know who could have been safe with a parachute an eddy last saw a lot of his friends die that way was just apoplectic about the bureaucracy and what they would do because these men were anything but to feed it every day our phone\nNumber and always is going down in flames are in May of Nineteen Eighteen they separate from the signal corps they formed the first army air corps what exists\nOr by July or a flying this bad which is a new aircraft it's very heavy color flying crank it has its own eccentricities\nAnd Eddie now rising through the ranks his kills are mounting but those ahead of him and kills don't always mean that the other flyer dies of times they land and there's a lot of night Aaron tree going on between the two forces but there is mass murder being done\nThere is no disguising it this is not a happy ending any it's climbing through the ranks because those ahead of them are dying dying they're crashing the airplanes are being shut down they're burning\nWas sad I mean this was a little bit of luck for him right when he was Ninety four percent of the worst sector the red where the you know the flying circus was he gets", "show_name": "The
