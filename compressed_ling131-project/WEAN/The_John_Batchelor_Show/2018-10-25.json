T. A. D. the divides all economies into their consumption their investment instead of China has inflated the largest investment bubble ever created in history\nAnd then on top of which there was a lot of leverage nobody really knows how much that there is on the Chinese economy when you cut through it and the demand inside the country hasn't gotten to the ... worth of support all this stuff so I think there's only one painful way through this and that is that destruction\nGarden Charles or you know the number of countries have tried to manage their way out of crises tried to outgrow um problems and then China certainly falls into that category and it seems as the article that John referred to in the beginning of the segment\nEssentially um you don't have very much upside potential for China really what it is is at best a straight line flat line gross ... ... it just seems to me that it would have been much better for them to accept some medicine and have a crisis and then get over why aren't they doing that\nWell I I don't think that China really has the long a period of experimentation in history that we have in the west just having lived through the many booms and busts and we could trace our modern economy\nBack to the mid Eighteen hundreds we've had many painful depressions we've learned from some of them there's just too much productive capacity in China assuming that they can sell their products and services\nAnd dumped them around the world and places like the U.S where that's not going to happen anymore so there's a simple way through this you have to have your fascinates you have to encourage people consume more of your country and you gotta you gotta be forthcoming with how much did it truly have and if it's too much just go to the guy off the mark downs and\nAnd I have to be a redo of a Chinese financial structure\nI've gotten a reading these charts I find I knew highlighted this to me China's retail sales don't look as bad as everything else does that make sense or they are they selling domestically\nI I don't think they are John Doe their numbers tell you that they are so for instance they're saying the official national ... retail sales increased nine point two percent in September\nThe same month a sales of automobiles so Levin point six percent\nUm vehicle sales were down the three months of all three months of the quarter and yet they're saying that a consumption is increase\nThat just doesn't make sense John especially when you start looking at the sales of other items which were also slapped or down so I think that China has a real data problem in terms of what they're reporting to people but I think it got to do that in a sense because if people really knew the truth\nThere would be panic if there'll be panic it would be the end of the economy so what they're doing is they're just trying to lie and basically get their way through a very difficult patch\nWhat is your Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition and blood for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices logged on to flood Otto John John now\nUh what what is what's in it for us does this indication of failure I mean it's a it's a big two thousand eight here we're looking at just this come our way how we got defenses for their equity collapse\nWell I think fortunately yes we do I mean one very good thing if the chairman Jay Powell to the Federal Reserve has managed to get interest rates up above three percent of the ten year\nWhich means that in awe of China collapse or China\nDowndraft we have room to lower interest rates and cushion the blow compared to other economies I think we're all in\nMuch better position than any other large economy it'll hurt is trying to go through this painful\nProcess economically I fear that a distraction might be suggested by the leadership there that some military adventure or whatever to distract the population that messed it poses an order is certainly a very dangerous set of months here um but in the end I think the United states\nEven if the Republicans do not maintain control the house and Senate will survive the coming retrenchment far better than any other major country\nAnd and Gordon I'm checking with you because of this question before is the Chinese Communist party capable of taking a recession because that cures they're there they they they've they've missed price Sarah ... can they take a hit\nI think that they believe that they can't and that's the reason why they have been playing the economy were too much cash you know as you talked about just a few seconds ago\nChina did not go through it's two thousand that everybody else did\nAnd eventually they got to go through that and right now we're in a pretty good position because as Charles points out our interest rates have gone up we have moved to move them down again and we're very I think robust period so um you know whether China goes up or down you know we'll be able to get through this and we'll do very well\nEarlier today Charles Gordon and I were corresponding and there was a report in the Financial Times that businesses have borrowed up to one hundred percent against their stock\nOr that they they borrowed it they give it to the bank and they borrow against it but the stock market it's collapsed their assets have collapsed and the central government is looking to subsidize that collapse as long as it can ... I Believe that that is not a sustainable model that's like Fannie Mae times a million correct that ... that does not work\nIt certainly does not work and we really do unfortunately throughout China and the Asian in parts of Asia\nPeople do like the gambling leverage and do it with ... money is very dangerous um I Hope that our European banks which were also highly leveraged are not overly exposed to the China tried to best we're America effects I think we're pretty good shape\nBut in a China collapse I think that inflict torture bank and other European back to the blunt heavily emerging markets in China wow are they in trouble\nAnd garden if you heard talk about had banks putting in defense is here says it's we don't go through a weight as ... as the wave washes are way\nIrish they did um but I don't think that they really are thinking in that direction John but you know clearly there is going to be some sort of adjustment in China\nProbably will be severe I think it will be fairly soon though I could be wrong on that but it will come because China has just done too much to balance its economy since two thousand that\nCharles hotel a Sunday with Charles Gordon Chang the Daily Beast I'm John ...

John ... this is the John ... the eleventh congressional district of New Jersey bill in the garden\nHe writes for the wall Street Journal who's a member of the editorial board and he's taking us into the eleventh district and showing us how the Democratic party is making a case that the tax cuts\nAnd jobs active twenty Seventeen which was a predicates along with the regulation for the boom in the economy these last month in court or is it was actually a tax hike I think that's right it's not quite logical but I built kind of helped me bill\nHow does the Democratic candidates Mikey Cheryl how does she maintain a straight face when she says that the tax cut was\nA tax hike how does it work good evening to you about\nWell it works this way John ah as you know that one of the more controversial aspects of the tax cuts was to a cap\nDeductions for state and local taxes and mortgages right and uh I Am a long suffering taxpayer of New Jersey stand uh but I was willing to give up these things for an overall cleaner system which they've done\nSo by focusing on this I mean it's true that some taxpayers um\nBecause they're deductions on this will be kept\nA we'll have to pay more but there's also you know the AMC has been pared back and so forth and others standard induction has been raised so most people are getting a tax cut and even the people who fear that they're not I mean we'll have to see in April but I think more it's going to a more is going to be a wash\nBut it's it's a crazy argument I mean she's essentially arguing the tax bill um\nWas it a was a tax hike [laughter]\nYou know the ways and means you can argue the figures all the time but they have figure saying that for the average Morris county or or congressional district member eleven in New Jersey the average family of four is going to get a six thousand dollar tax break\nThis is a problem the Democrats look to solve these last month since the tax cut in jobs that are to explain away the booming economy even to take credit for it I guess and uh build the general conventional wisdom is that they have been successful is that accurate in New Jersey\n[noise] well I think I think someone in New Jersey look on the Republican running Jay Webber is is the real thing he's a principled a Republican and one of the few with the guts to embrace the tax cut you know he says let's be he would like to roll back some of the salt caps as well\nBut the overall it's been a big benefit the reason that Democrats get away with it in New Jersey in particularly in the eleventh is that a bike you Cheryl is a very attractive candidate\nAnd by that I mean also has a um an attractive backstory she's a Naval Academy graduate I Believe a former helicopter pilot in the navy and worked for a federal prosecutor she also doesn't have a voting record\nRight and it's just absurd to complain about the capping the salt tax as for tax relief when you say nothing about the high New Jersey taxes\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one Ninety nine per month we'll say hello to what boards twenty eight teams Ford F. one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a plot forward and he went into and there were ...\nOver tax safe they raise taxes on corporate income on personal income and on gas taxes just since June and it's going to get worse so um you know it's not a coincidence that I'm Michelle says nothing\nAbout the tax hikes that her fellow Democrats loved to impose on um the poor residents of New Jersey stand like me\nFor those who do not live in the east coast New Jersey as part of the trifecta of blue states with an enormously high tax demand\nAnd that is why the salt that is the state and local tax non deduction in the tax cutting JOBS Act is such an argument here because one one hand you have all Democrats and then the other hand the well to do Democrats now have can no longer the duck their ... their\nProperty taxes as they could before and that limits the ability of the Democratic governors to raise taxes that's what that's that's a Frank Murphy in New Jersey Andrew Cuomo in New York certainly no bill that that solves deduction going away means that they have a harder time just routinely raising taxes\nYeah and uh it's actually it's going to force them to pay a price for its just all so we don't have a press that asked a lot of questions so again or make you Charles running on a very attractive resume suburban mom good good\nBackground in the military it's harder for her image or she runs very good abs I think her image is just hard to associate with polo the style Democrats and she says she wouldn't vote for ... the as speaker but really do you believe that if she's elected that she's going to be a voice\nFor a tax reform and lower taxes\nIn Washington I mean she's got to be voting with the rest of her party is she is the party of and I miss it flows he says that our first priority and she's going to be the speaker if the Democrat I get that right or her first\nPriority is rolling back the tax bill I mean um it's just crazy we we are without doubt New Jersey the dumbest voters I mean we've all these professionals who who um are supposedly so smart and so educated and um and yet we allow ourselves to be so\nBadly run so monstrous Lee over taxed and this is one reason why rolling\nBack the tax bill before rolling back Brett Kavanaugh and Donald Trump yes there is a priority\nNow I don't think that Brett Kavanaugh is in her belly where but I think should like to do is try the\n... race affect the Weber shall race in any fashion 'cause I see an end as is struggling to make a case here\n[noise] [noise] yeah I'm not sure in the debate um uh Jay Webber\nYou know I asked her whether she would vote for ... and she said she would and called them a fighter for New Jersey I'm not sure that helps her but I I think the truth is in New Jersey eleventh just no one wants to ask tough questions like what it really means for the state um what it really means for our economy and uh whether I'm\nWhether we're going to get lower taxes as as a\nSort of implied if we vote for him Mikey Cheryl I it's it's just preposterous\nThe conventional wisdom says that the Democrats have between twenty and thirty feet to win here at Bryan forty feet to win in order to take the majority and the Charlie Cook report says that ... a good number\nIs is the ... district critical to that Thirty years this was always going to be a democratic\nUh I'm not sure it's always going to be a democratic win but it it fits the profile to swing suburban district it's been represented by my Rodney ... house and a moderate Republican who has been a free\nRide who retired so it fits the profile that way um there's been a freelancer housing in Congress almost since there's been a Congress um\nSo it fits the profile of retiring Republican members also the state's been growing bluer\nYou know I mean even before Donald Trump um New Jersey is becoming a much bluer so ah I I'm not sure this just happened to be the year I mean Jay Webber to me is a very attractive candidate he understands economic he's been a strong voice\nIn the state assembly a but again he has votes to defend than his opponent doesn't she just running on
