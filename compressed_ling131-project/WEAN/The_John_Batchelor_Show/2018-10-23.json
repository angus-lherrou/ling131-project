world leading the wave of retail transformation visit scholar dot com today to modernize your digital experience Tom\nYou have a report about two members about tied in the Arabian Peninsula now with a wanted poster ten million dollars rewards for ... and up to five million dollars reward for college I'll buy tower see when they come from a\nWell John this is a good example of what we talk about talk about these uh kind of veterans who ... who can just sort of keep operating for many many years and stay in the game despite being relentlessly hunted by the U.S our allies because ... and ... are both kind of veterans from\nTraining camps pre nine eleven and Afghanistan so these are both these guys attended all through which was all kinds of his primary training facility in pre nine eleven Afghanistan and so their journeys through jihad starts all the way back then and ... actually it was again a fight very early on by all ...\nAs a guy who should be groomed for a leadership position he somebody who they they very early on thought you know sort of had that potential and lo and behold today these are two of the most senior guys\nIn Yemen they've now leading okay and rabid so now\nYou know a lot of times you hear people talk about ... pie that's okay but it's as if it's an affiliate of al ... well we've said all along is now it's not really in a ... it's just all ... because guys like this are groomed a kind of veterans who\nHave been putting these positions Toledo kinda globally so they probably are ... they probably play a role in actually al ... global management team making decisions around the globe now\nA KP of course came to fame because of the um attacks that they tried to plant against the United states\nGoing Christmas Day two thousand nine or when you had the this underwear bomber on Detroit bound plane and you've had a series of other mostly failed plots some\nInspired like dollar sign at Fort Hood ah which was sort of had some sort of inspirational connection at a minimum take a pay for the most break your piece plots against the u._s. has failed however they have taken advantage of the war in Yemen this multi sided conflict and they've expanded their base\nInside Yemen and according to a un report that came out this last summer they now have somewhere between six and seven thousand fighters\nIn Yemen Andre ... command so these two guys who um the u._s. ... released these wars for increased the reward for one of them and actually released a new or work for the other one um these are guys who likely have thousands of fighters on under their command\nThe consistent nature of your reporting over the years suggest that title looks upon its personnel as interchangeable with other personnel do they move them around in theaters to learn networking Tom do they have a a a chart a personnel chart that says\nLet's training here let's training there or is it hit or miss\nWell you know we don't know exactly what their personnel policies are we can only track these guys and show when they pop up somewhere and say that there's probably some thought behind doing that and what we've seen is not only traffic from Afghanistan Yemen and back through the years of course going only back to Nineteen nineties\nBut then you see guys go from Yemen to other places so we've track them to the Sinai we've tracked him to Syria and Italy province trapped in the north Africa and Libya and you see these guys go out of the pie and they serve leadership roles in other parts of the kind of work elsewhere\nSo looks to us like this a creepy serves not only is part of the senior management structure within al ... terms of the top leaders but they have guys who they groomed go elsewhere to sort of continue on with that role elsewhere\nAnd the fact that they move them around is that a promotion can we tell do they have levels of trust and command authority of the ... the would he be a a comparable to a colonel or general can we think of them that way\nJohn it's amazing you're asking this question because\nThere's not been any work that we can detect to actually map out what their human sort of organization looks like in years and there's ... at least publicly US government is not tried to explain what the management structure of all kind of looks like and yet when you go through their primary source\nStatements literature you go through other pieces here and there you can point out and show that they do have a management structure in place despite the relentless post nine eleven war has been wasted on them\nThey still have a management structure in place to this day and its opaque they don't they don't put on or turn on line to explain it to everybody but you can pick up details here and there for example you know I mean I was out here of course the emir of okay well you know he has at least two deputy in years by the way who according to the UN or in Iran and helping and lead the charge\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lineup of Lincoln MTC Lincoln Lincoln MTC and the all new twenty eighty Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impassable surface\nPart of the okay the senior management team you start putting this all together you can see that there is a a sort of a human organization they're from top to bottom and yet there's been very little done publicly by the U.S government to explain to since nine eleven remember the name of the ... report\nGave a summary of sort of a basic summary of the commission structure that how these different entities within all kind of worked or to guide the organization internationally we haven't seen updated version of that I can that I can point to any way since two thousand four so that tells you so how how out of date or assessments artists\nYour measure of al ... is it showing cohesion ... is there some change in a confidence level can you tell them\nWell you know it's interesting last week General Dunford had a very interesting comment this this type of thing that should get ... ears perk up when they hear this he says that they've got new indications are new evidence intelligence that al ... is\nAble to communicate more readily and manage more readily across the globe it's sort of infrastructure in place\nThis is like this is sort of a key tell because there's been a lot of what we call it disconnect the dots announces through the years to try and explain away all ... to try and say that has there is no cohesion there is no global network and play and here's yet another comment however from U.S officials saying no there actually is\nStill some cohesion here and there is there is some coordination across international boundaries we think that that degree of coordination equation is actually a lot more than even what some people have said but it's interesting to hear General Dunford very senior level express that publicly chosen something got thrown some assessment got to him that said oh look out\nGeneral Dunford as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff of four star a marine general and he leads the effort to defeat the gal ... so when he comments as Tom says look out Tom just one of the foundation for the defense of democracy this\nNational security report brought to you by scholar scala leading marketing technology company powers millions of digital signs around the world leading the wave of retail transformation visit scholars dot com today to modernize your digital experience I'm John batch\nDid you have your house for sale this last year and it didn't sell than you need Nathan Clark\nWe have been far too ambiguous about our commitments Taiwan I'd like to see the Trump Administration make it very clear I'd like to see the president actually go to Taiwan and send that symbolic message to Beijing that we are friends and allies with Taiwan and we will never let it go\nThe Russian and Chinese and us defense ministers have all been wandering around um negotiating with each other talking with each other inviting each other back and forth is that going to continue regardless of this these incidents and the Taiwan Strait or the south China Sea I'm I'm puzzling about\nHow these defense ministers and our secretary of defense\nThing called the demonstrations by the navy card\nI think that there'll be some huffing and puffing on the part of ... at first because they won't let this go\nBut uh you know within a month or two maybe several months and things will be back to normal\nThe reason is when the United states shows strain the Chinese back off um and so there's going to be a little bit less huffing and puffing than you'd think you know so far China's been quiet about this transit I'm waiting in the next several hours to see what ... says\nAnd we'll get a really good ... of where they're going because if we get a relatively mild statement that means things will settle down if they actually are belligerent um you know I trust that the Trump Administration will meet word for word and that's something that we need to do right now to show Beijing that we do have the resolve\nSaturday Gordon is ending on the wording we communicate as you mentioned but we're all skim the Chinese regime attack the United states has interests you know ... you know he and the streets or anywhere else\nThey can do that anywhere on planet earth any place in space you know the universe is not off limits um and so you know we're going to see a broad base challenge um and they will do that um see jumping has nowhere to back down he owns this controversy with the United states\nIf he is seen to cave in um he very well made\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than ... around because we're a certified buying center and we'll buy yours and even if you don't buy ours log onto our high hardliners on Tom\n... paying is whether he's an aberration or whether he is the inevitable result of Chinese communism we've got him for a little while and we've got to make sure that he understands that he cannot get what he wants\nThe two cities trap Gordon six point five percent that's the official number GDP said to be the slowest in the decades since the great recession two thousand two thousand nine whatever the real number is there is a contraction of the growth yeah China depends upon\nThat means unemployment does Xi Jinping does the standing committee do they have a response to that\nWell there are only a response John is to do what they've been doing in the last several months which is to stop their de leveraging campaign pile on the debt\nAnd hope that they can grow their way out of this which of course they can't because even if you believe their official GDP number of six point five percent growth and and you shouldn't but even if you were to believe that they're encouraging one and a half times as much as they're creating nominal gross domestic product\nThat's completely I'm a losing proposition for teaching paying it just a question of how long he can hold on\nHe can hold on a long time but he's making the inevitable crisis bigger so they don't have any real solution the real solution of course would be to reform but see jumping doesn't want to do that so he's just going to take the country off the cliff with him\nThat he's Gordon how about the capital of slows you talked about before\nYeah um well there hasn't been very much in the way of capital outflow since September or so of two thousand six team because the capital controls right now or ... even the ones that are announced and the ones that they are effectively enforcing which are unannounced\nBut I think we're going to start to see more money come out because there's a real change in the Senate and China it's gotten quite dark um and you can see that of course with the falls in the stock market and in the currency the only reason why there was a rebound um today was in China which was actually quite a strong\nRebound in Shanghai composite wasn't because the Chinese authorities were making these statements about how great the stock market was\nAnd they probably were also buying as well\nSo you know and under those circumstances it's no longer a market\nUm but you started to see I think a real pessimism because people are understanding the consequences not only of slow growth but also the challenge ... seats in paying as opposed to the United states and the American response the thing that's different Thaddeus is the American response\nDoes the renminbi go to seventh or did they touched that that that live wire\nYou know I think so John you know if you'd asked me two or three weeks ago I would've said no and I probably would be wrong um because I think that they're starting to believe that they cannot indefinitely defend the currency\nI thought that they were defending six nine um but you know they went through six nine so I think I was wrong on that\nAnd you know of course only time will tell but I think that they eventually have to ... what they should do John is a big one time devaluation shock the markets punish all the speculators but they're not smart enough to do that\nA one time devaluation ... what's that look like\nOh you know going to eight or eight and a half to the U.S dollar um from six point nine three which is where they are now and then that really shocks everybody and it stops the slow erosion when you have slow erosion you have the central bank\nI'm starting to spend foreign exchange reserves to no good and and that's what we saw last month twenty two point seven billion dollars that decline in their foreign exchange reserves\nUm and it didn't really do any good John So I think they need a one time big ... I think most analysts would recommend that but seeking paying is not willing to do it because that's what a mission that his policies haven't worked he can't make an admission of that sort\nGordon Chang the Daily Beast Thaddeus McCotter W.

J. automated voice of the great lakes the cow that the numbers\nContinue to move from free thousand to two thousand to five thousand to seven thousand\nIs said to be the lead elements are in Mexico or CNN is reporting that migrants are at the Central Park and the gal he doll go in the center of a Mexican town ...\nOrganizers says CNN plan for them to begin moving north reaching the northern city of walks law which is about twenty miles north and resting there the president has been responding with tweets\nThese last days certainly the president of the United states has made it very clear that he wants to make this he is making this a partisan issue saying the Democrats want this the Democrats are behind this and other remarks pointing to the Democrats\nHe's also the president and his aides at the White House are saying that they're unknown middle Easterners and the care of that\nJohn to begin with you this care of that looks like a problem for the Democrats and I want to look at the Senate races\nArizona which is said to be close Texas not close but certainly Beto O'Rourke is a premier candidates for the Democrats Montana clubs Nevada close Missouri I Can't tell Tennessee I Can't tell but certainly leaning Republican\nDoes the caravan change any of those states for the Senate and does it change the house seats that are at risk in those states job\nWell it's an awful visual because I'm Democrats are almost paralyzed from commenting on this because you know there's a sea of brown faces of even black faces and the care of him and to go criticize it and say that we have to protect our sovereignty is too risky politically correctness\nA Trump and the Republicans I can guarantee you're going to have commercials for the last few days with the campaign which will future quotes from all the leading Democrat started with Kamala Harris and California and Elizabeth Warren\nSaying we have to abolish ice the immigration service and then they will be the pictures of the hordes climbing a I sat next to someone who dinner who's from Hungary very knowledgeable on Hungarian politics during the migrant crisis of twenty Fifteen\nHungary was able to stop Ninety nine percent of its immigration problems for the fence\nA and he said I Believe that this could do to the Democrats this fall with the migrant issue did Angela Merkel which is painter as powerless and unwilling to defend the sovereignty of her country\nDavid Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales said earlier this month we have arrested almost one hundred people highly linked to terrorist groups specifically ISIS I don't know the facts in Guatemala but the suggestion is that the White House is linking this to ISIS\nA does this change the face of the election in the Senate as you measure it David\nI don't think so but that's only because I think the Senate is already in a really good spot for Republicans now I I Do think it's possible this message could have an impact in Arizona and Nevada um most of all possibly Montana\nTexas a secure I think Tennessee isn't a good spot um and I think just Republicans in the Senate in general are are good shape\nAnd they're only competitive house each really that can be swayed either way it's among the states into that but I Do think it's smart messaging by the president will look at your base another reason to turn out gives them another reason\nTo get ... about the opposition party\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in East Village and there were against that have the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you could be driving on the boards also models interest free log on to what Tom\nO'Brian can venture voters little they don't show up bad things are going to happen and that's really easy to do when you have no power as bad things from your point of view are already happening so your show up to vote to put a stop to them and that's what the president doing with this message of the you know the one counter here\nIs republic is Democrats are not playing ball they're not engaging hears a Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer issued a joint statement after that Trump tweet where he said Chuck and Nancy call me so we can talk border security and they just turned it around to health care which is where they want they used to be\nA but but the other thing that I give Democrats have going for them in this regard as President Trump\nIs in control of national security and he has at his disposal the power\nTo stop migrants at the border and so it's not a situation I think this would be more potent\nLike national security wasn't twenty fourteen when Senate Republicans and in fact House Republicans were able to run against President Obama's handling of ISIS when he referred to never the JV swan and diminished the danger that they posed the middle east into American national security in general this is a case where\nA President Trump who is warning of this while I think it's a good election year message down the stretch ultimately he's in charge which means he can implement policy to stop this and that's if Democrats really getting the ... and they can say look\nYeah President Trump has the power to deal with it we're not standing in his way\nSaturdays but don't they have some type of obligation at least in terms of messaging on this I mean\nI don't know who's behind this march or just to see a bunch of people coming to the United states for a long time for the midterm don't the Democrats at least have to say something on this won't be the 'cause Jon talked about a David what can they say about that David\nI I don't really think they have to say anything about this and in fact I think\nThe same way I think it's more for the president's push this from a political standpoint I think the best thing Democrats could do is say nothing you don't anger your base by by by trying to outflank trap on the right\nAnd you don't play Trump's game by looking weak in looking as though you hope that everybody shows up and and it gets into the country\nSay nothing the most I Would say if I were a democratic candidate is it I was a I clearly in for border security and this is President Trump's job to deal with this because he's the president and and that's what I think we should there John\nI think that's a good strategy except that there's so many than the Democrats who earlier earlier said that it's time to abolish ice so if they remain silent\n'em and they don't repudiate their previous position or they tried to model that I think that just gives turns the debate away from health care which is what the Democrats wanted it to be turned to immigration\nWhich is a mixed issue for Trump but not in the districts are Republicans after hold on that is a base turnout model\nCan we agree John that this is a this is about as hot as it gets as we watch these videos that we don't know what's going to happen the next two weeks but they're marching marching marching\nAnd they're not going to stop until they reach the border and that's where it gets interesting\nJohn ...

H prices documents that is that you know that we can chasing for quite a while now and a ton of tucked in a hundred and fifty plus page report is revelation\nNot entirely surprising but hopes filling a few of the gaps of style or this whole investigation that the FBI use multiple confidential human sources bottles compiling information on Carter Page and the Trump campaign and all these things so\nBut the new revelation there's we already knew about foster steal the British spy who\nWrote the dossier that it could be a key tromp on the campaign of all these things I'm so this new document\nOr refers to multiple uh you know plural\nOr informants that were used and so you and I talk quite a bit about stuff on our the University of Cambridge professor who\nHas been revealed to also be an informant\nWho met with page and George Papadopoulos and everyone and uh so now we have those two known informants\nPlus others and so the question that you and I and everyone else would like to find out uh who are these informants when did they crucially when did they start ah their work on the FBI and how much were they paid and all of those those types of questions\nHere's the quote from Mr hardy the FBI is protected information that would identify the identities of other confidential sources who provided information or intelligence to the FBI as well as quote information provided by those sources so we have a long list to investigate we know steal\nWe know helping her out the FBI has never acknowledge how are correct Chuck that's that's we've surprised and other reporters have\nConfirmed the surmise that help has one of them but we don't know does this include down or do we know Alexander down or he's certainly in the position to have cooperated with the FBI certainly had a large motive\nBecause after all he was identified with the Clinton campaign and we know now that the Clinton campaign one of its lawyers ... for ... coy was connecting with the FBI so do we believe down his name is in this filing\nYeah very well could be a ... that's an interesting possibility a\nHimself has given ... you know one or two interviews since his name's surfaced last December\nBut it's connected to Papadopoulos um and he's not saying a whole lot not a ... he ... he was obviously and the Australian government we're following information back to the FBI and the question would be to the FBI consider him a confidence ca chest and their parlance\nHow would you like ... twenty gene truck of the year for only one Ninety nine will say hello to forge twenty eight Ford F. one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a blood forward and he joined Narragansett\nCosts with a downer is considered one of their confidence that human sources um there are others that you know or who have been involved in the ... who make contact with Carter Page and George Papadopoulos and these guys are throughout the campaign who\nWho very well could have sharing information with the FBI um and and as I mentioned you know someone a according to these documents someone was paid for their work and so that raises\nYou know we we can assume that perhaps down her since she was an Australian Government official perhaps was not paid for that work so they're all in addition to doubt or others out there um and so it'd be very interesting to find out what information they provide it but also with the whole Carter Page ... and and this new finally did not get into it\nBut you and I've also discuss how um Republicans on on the hill of referred to\nPotentially exculpatory evidence contained in the fourth and final five so\nUh that that somehow or paints a different picture of the information regarding Carter Page and so I'm going to go back to Rod Rosenstein who's going to be speaking to Capitol\nHill I'm On Wednesday I Believe um he he sign this particular spices\nSo this is the question that you know hopefully it will be asked to we we can expect tend to try to dodge that question um as far as what type of exculpatory information there might be but it's a the next to piece that that would help put all together and it's also one of the aspects that President Trump has\nBeen interested in declassify from these documents\nRight and it's ms Rosen seeing who stopped that de classification President Trump wanted the foresight to war and\nHe wanted the FBI question and answer the three of choose with Bruce or\nWho was in ... who remains in the OJ principal and who was involved in communicating with Mr Steele to the FBI another he was a go between his wife Nelly our work for Glenn Simpson of fusion GPS who has now taken the ... I think we should note that Carter that\nI Am Carter Page needs to the other quarter page investigation doesn't happen without blend Simpson and Glenn Simpsons no longer cooperating with anybody so a chalk we've moved the story a little bit also in the White House request for release\nWas the word the text messages of many of these players including Rod Rosenstein himself\nSo there's an enormous amount of information that we have not seen yet and the FBI is being coy about what it will or will not release protecting confidential sources Papadopoulos is testifying this week to Congress is that accurate Chuck\nBut yet he's testifying on Thursday to the to the task force or\nThe same task force that his interview James Baker the FBI lawyer Nelly or and ah Bruce or\nUm House Judiciary and House Oversight and Government Reform committee interviewing Papadopoulos and um if you follow Papadopoulos on Twitter um he's made quite a few comments recently about a lot of these what he says they're suspicious contacts that he had while on the campaign and we've documented I've documented you and I talked about Albert\nWho is definitely a suspicious or contact you as an FBI informant or George Papadopoulos has said\nThat he had at least three or four more strange contacts people coming up to him and wanting to meet with him while he was on the campaign um and he now believes since he's been through you know uh he he's a he's interaction with helper now believe that\nPerhaps other informants other people working on behalf of western intelligence so were sent to approach him to perhaps queen information from it does\nHe think metal in your does he think Masood was one of those ... one of those FBI informants\n... yeah yeah he does um he he believes that he's not laid out I'll be honest these not laid out a clear and articulate kind of\nA ... there's no evidence yet tying Mitt sued to down or to help her um no not one clear narratives here um but they these are three or four I'm\nVery interesting um approaches that he that he you know he had um and so his theory seems to be that there's some sort of connection here um because you know as as he claimed he and he he he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI but he's not found\nYou know he was not charged with anything beyond the lowest one thousand one charge for lying um he's not been accused of conspiracy so I'm ... and what we've heard from several lawmakers as well is that soon after the investigation was open based upon information about Papadopoulos the down or information um there's some\nHow would you like motor treads twenty gene truck of the year for only one night I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty anti Ford F. one fifty the best drug for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a plug for it and he joined there were against it\nThe government ah to to open an investigation based on ... so um he he wants to talk to Congress about all of that we don't know yet exactly what it makes you provide 'em but you know some below or it could potentially change a store here give us some new leads to\nFollow up on Jack Ross for the Daily Caller waiting for Rosenstein and Papadopoulos I'm John bachelor this is the John ... Mm\nWe all know the familiar symptoms of bad water like rush stains bad taste ... or hard water but did you know that your water could be causing dry itchy skin do or just colored hair laundry problems or even worse making you sick\nYou told rich Lowry that Mueller is not Bob Woodward thank heaven however when I take from that remark is that we're not going to get a narrative that satisfies a TV what we're going to get is either no indictment or indictments we've had some indictments of Russians chiefly\nAnd also Manafort for actions that took place before the campaign\nYou believe it's significant however that the sentencing for Michael Flynn has to come on December Eighteenth explain why that tells us that Mueller is going to be disappointing\nYeah let's let's I guess we should sort out two separate things John I think with respect to General Flynn when he pled guilty it was with the understanding that he was going to cooperate with\nThe investigation and so far as we know he has made himself available for interviews questioning and all like um [noise] generally speaking\nProsecutors when they have an ability to influence when a sentencing is scheduled do not allow cooperate or to be sentenced by the court until after their cooperation has concluded which usually means any testimony that they're going to give are expected to given the investigation\nOf because you want the full breath of the person's cooperation to be before the sentencing court so I think the fact that General Flynn is now scheduled to be sentenced and apparently the sentencing is going to go forward on December right team indicates that Mahler doesn't think he's going to require him for any in court\nTestimony that's not a sure sign of that but it's a pretty good sign\nA so that is another thing that leads me to think that the investigation is probably\nWinding down to a conclusion as far as the Woodward comparison is concerned might might point to in in my discussion with rich and I appreciate your mention of the the McCarthy report podcast um [noise] the point of that discussion was\nThat Mahler works for the Justice Department as a prosecutor he is not the lawyer for a congressional impeachment committee and a prosecutor is only real job to report is whether to recommend bringing charges or not or declining charges\nOn a particular investigation and a particular set of facts that he's been authorized to investigate so to my mind it's not ... job to do a disc lose ... on\nThe fitness of the president to be president the question is whether there's enough evidence to to bring charges based on the things that he's been authorized to investigate\nThat is [noise] and you mentioned in the past how this would not be a surprise for Mr Rosen's paying ... continue to stress that\nThis was all necessary but she also made the point and breathing last article was well there are a lot of the stuff for the special counsel's during has been handed off to other departments existing departments of justice and really are yet to show why this was necessary which is still stream I totally agree with that\nI Do agree with that I think that you know we question that he is whether this investigation was necessary because it was not\nAssigned in compliance with the regulations of the Justice Department which require both showing that there's a conflict of interest that makes it impossible for the Justice Department to investigate the matter and the normal course and that there's a factual basis for believing that some\nA criminal charge may be appropriate\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right and one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nTrust and there was never any articulation of the factual basis for a criminal investigation and the fact I think that\nThe portions of the investigation like the to Russia indictments that smaller returns have been transition took components of the Justice Department is strongly indicative of the fact that there was never any conflict of interest in the first place I don't think those cases should have been brought\nBecause I think that the the charging instruments there are more in the nature of a publicity\nAnnouncements then real charges nobody ever thought that the including Mahler I'm sure\nThat a lot of ... was going to allow his awkward has to be brought to America for a trial so bringing an indictment like that was was pointless in that sense but the fact that it's been transition to ... to ... they've been transitions\nTwo components of the Justice Department indicates that
