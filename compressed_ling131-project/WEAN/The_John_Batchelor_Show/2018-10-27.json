California and trying to have in common or jobs and that's where it stops because what it really is is China is fucking jobs from California so uh yes we do oh one thing in common jobs but we're not we're not hey I'm here in California in China's forward faster than you can imagine\nThis report from the Los Angeles times so this is not a blog just worry\nSays half a million jobs lost to China and I'm going to guess that that's not the end of it or we're looking at Johns just Silicon Valley but the apparel industry and all the other small manufacturers that have prospered in California have left they've almost maybe\nMaybe Jeff they went because the trends it's better in ... in Shanghai you think is that it\nThat's quite possibly one of the reasons but you know California has been suffering for a number of years\nBecause of the high cost of doing business here taxation is crazy the cost of regulations is crazy or the threat of litigation that's hanging over your head whether it's for a chore reasons or dealing with regulations is again crazy\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine Vermont blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nStates like Texas and such but really uh China has gone whole hog and trying to recruit people and companies out of California and they're doing a pretty darn good job\nThe story that is hard to imagine in the twenty first century but it's the fact is that the most expensive house of representatives race in the country it's not even close this is Devin Nunes this district twenty second ... congressional district in the San Joaquin Valley\nHe's being challenged by a a ... assistant us attorney ... an assistant district attorney named Jan's\nAnd the numbers are stunning as to what Jan has been able to raise and spend against Devin Nunes chairman of the house intelligence committee and a long time resident in Fresno worried about water issues which is what the farmers concern themselves that water water water\nKnown as has been very successful through all of his terms\nWith the farmers and yet Jan says Ben ... I don't know Jeff ... it can be six million eight million twelve million enormous amount of money against newness and it's not close is this the nature of California races these days it doesn't matter who wins you just spend money\nIs truly a the nature you know there's been a lot of effort in California to flip the remaining a Republican districts uh to Democrat and they've been pulling out all the stops but in some of these districts that are safe like Evans\nA you wonder what are they thinking how could they be doing this I mean you know you do have to say Devin has spent a he's raised ten point five million but it's really like you said it's the opponent who's who's putting in over seven million dollars\nThat's just it's unfathomable at least it was nowadays in California you're just seeing huge amounts of money coming in a Mayor Bloomberg decided today or yesterday that he was going to dump millions in California and some key races this is the way California's going these\nDays and two other congressmen who are not threatened even slightly\nThis is Adam Schiff and Brad Sherman ... just taught me you call everybody by their first name in California it's the way it's the hip thing to do okay Adam and Brad are safe but they're from or the southern part of California I think Adam is West Hollywood and Brad\nIs the Los Angeles area and they showed up at an event they were stage like a town hall and they were yelled at who yelled at some\nWe had a number of people who are are very pro Trump\nA number of people who are anti illegal immigration and other folks who have been lining up against the uh the more liberal agenda and they they surprised Adam and Brad as we call them\nA with a big shout down the other night and it was crazy because as you point out there and safe districts they're much below by their liberal constituency\nBut they were surprised they were rocked by this this very loud this very rock is a crowd that showed up a matter of fact drove in\nFrom the room ... we call everybody the first name you on everybody knows immediately if he has a very distinctive first name yuan has not satisfied with his test tunnel in Hawthorne he wants to build an underground transportation network Jeff is he aware that he's going to have a homeless problem if he actually built it\nI don't think that's something that he's thought much about I think he's been concern with a you know where to put it how to get it there and to get his scientist says researchers working on living things as fast as possible as cheaply as possible I don't think he's got into this socio economic the socio political aspects of it yet\nBut I can guarantee knowing how things are with transportation throughout Southern California particularly in LA\nThat that will come to come to the fore and that would be a problem in the near future\nIs this a problem is this a story in LA do people worry about these ... you know somebody drinking ... digging tunnels underneath me is that ... is the culture in different to the\nFolks are the most part are indifferent are actually excited [laughter] more excited by the prospect of getting across town faster they do now which would be anything faster than two miles an hour some days\nAre they're much more so by that than they are worried about\nA cave ins are seismic activity and really you know people in LA they get kind of laws they about earthquakes and such but uh this they're they're really much more excited about the prospect of getting across town faster especially that means that can get to a baseball

of the three point five or they're going to stand pat on they're blooming as\nWell [laughter] well I think they're going to probably continue to look at it at a downturn ... I don't mean a recession but a downturn in terms of the growth rate ah I doubt that these numbers will change that I think the real issue confronting the fed is that inflation the price of later ah inflation numbers generally\nAre incredibly modest and so you know the conversation that's kind of developing now is what is sort of the neutral rate\nAnd is it two percent is it more than two percent or because you know you look at where our rates are now and compare them to for example a German bonds three point three percent and ours are now a well over two percent so\nWhat what's the difference there I mean is that really makes sense are in other words are we really kind of a hampering our growth by jacking up rates a little bit too aggressively kind of like President Trump has talked about or is there really a good solid reason for that\nIt seems to me the inflation pressures are usually coming from two sources one is a\nA plant and equipment and other words the capacity utilization\nThere is no problem with that we're still way below ... a historical averages are plants and factories can accommodate further growth the the one issue is a labor and yet you look at the labor participation rate there are more people who could come into the workforce\nIt hasn't really happened to any big degree\nBut again if you look at historical averages\nIt you know there's more than a million workers who could come back to work if wages are tempting and you would kind of hope that that's what begins to happen at this point in the cycle\nAll the ...

story or the Russians you know how to fail so use launch with two astronauts on board about two weeks ago and uh they therefore they've had to do a lot of investigations about why that happened bought\nA this week they successfully launched a Soyuz rocket launching a military satellite or out of that plus a launch site space sport in the middle of a country on what that means is that they now are confident they can down the issues with the Saudis rocket\nNow there's a variety of stories rockets but all of them generally use the same first and second stage configurations which is what was the problem on that first launch that bad launched two weeks ago the changes or the third stage uh they do use various different stages and so\nThis launch was a success and it does indicate that they're getting closer to solving the problem it's more important that they wanted to do a variety of unmanned test launches with the soy use to make sure they've got things right\nAnd this is one of them they got at least two more before the man's flying December that means I assessed as almost certainly not going to end up having to be evacuated then unmanned John they'll be able to get\nThe manned launch in December off on time the report also had an interesting detail about the investigation into the failure we thought that there was a collision between the strap on second stages and the core first stage of this so I use a there was some speculation that one of the vows vented valves that's supposed to help push that strap\nOn away did not work but new reporting suggests that the

think of the luggage on your car I'm the king me as I say a similar nominally occurred\nUh an unmanned launch in eighty six and to my mind that's a little puzzling if you find you got a problem and how you assemble this shouldn't be redesigned the engineering so it won't happen again\nI Can't answer that that's just a question John Bob what is our line\nStyle line is one of the two commercial
