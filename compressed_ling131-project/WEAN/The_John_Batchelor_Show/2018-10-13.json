century in the nineteenth century\nAnd there are plenty of civil wars in Europe as well\nTo look at this situation we now inherit\nWith days left in the mid term with Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder making in temperate remarks with actions in the streets and this report of an attack on the New York metropolitan\nI'm a ... Republican club on eighty third street by men wearing hoods who were acting according to Ed Koch center professional manner in other words ...\nAre we seeing them everywhere and they're not Republican they're not Democrat they're anarchist but is that the forest that's on least by the language of the leadership and you make the case for that Michael so I went to press you on this what in this escalation cycle is next to watch for we've had our painting of Sumner that was Kavanaugh\nWe now have individual actions of renegades\nOr outlaws or red flags that's what they called them in Missouri or the riders into Kansas the men who rated Lawrence where is that what next to watch Michael\nWe have permission granted by the leadership at least a blue not quite yet but we have the leadership of you to sanction\nA more aggressive actions direct action and that is translating already end of the kind of a situation since as you described and that would correlate to same kinds of things that emerge\nIn Kansas and the\nIcing fifty ... you know the right on Lawrence right right but also you have a more generalized um\nExcept of the need for\nA resistance is the only possible\nWhat is your Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common there are all in for Steve real condition and what board and he's written a generic Kansas that's right over two hundred three on cars all my home models had incredible love onto flood Otto John John now\n... that would be to suddenly shift focus to blue legislative options but if those took a turn that inflamed read then you would have ...\nWe're only talking impeachment Michael that's all I hear from from the man who was appealed his head of the Judiciary Committee who's a representative here in Manhattan he's talking impeachment not only of President Trump but also a Brett Kavanaugh\nSo what you have is that there is no longer a belief that governance however you define governance whether it's a Supreme Court decision or or laws statutes that are passed by Congress no\nAct of governance can alleviate theirs and in fact any decision\nIn any uh government sphere only inflate\nThe situation so this is where I come up with this idea of of a curve that that at some point gets beyond control that there's no way to call it back and you know other countries like China seeing this understand\nThat this is their moment\nTo potentially intervene once the U.S is fully a mobilized to achieve all of their objective\nLook what they just did Michael they disappeared the president of the Interpol in front of everybody and I have no explanation for it he says he resigned his post he's a member of the Communist Party in fact he's a senior figure in the ministry of state security\nAnd they're that China is arrogant to the point of believing that the international community cannot in any way make them pay for that\nThe moment the president\nIs um through some sort of event shown to be\nNot in charge or to be a made\n'em impotent in some form an impeachment would be one of those processes at that moment something will happen abroad and that will be an earth shattering historical moment for the United states in the world as a whole and the\nThe the people who decry\nOr the president will have been in effect for those who have brought this on\nIt is Michael ... there is a reason to make the case now that it's already too late for this that we can stop it that the escalation cycle there there's pleasure in the escalation cycle for too many parties China\nRussia to name too but also those allies who are not all that friendly say Germany or Great Britain already going through their own disorder\nRight and that uh with the American superpower weakened by internal drive\nA our allies and our phone believe they gain another word that maybe there a moment to take a chance and we're not we're not prepared to defend ourselves Michael were not an estate I\nI Do not know if the Democratic party presuming it takes control the house I don't know if they'll follow the constitution I mean going after the president with\nCharges of impeachment based upon you understand that that kind of disruption makes that makes America I'm disorganized to the point of not being able to defend itself\nWill people living in the moment who are wrapped up in the beliefs that they are in charge\nOr we have a less than a minute Michael go hey represent\nThe leadership those sorts of people are not I'm sensitive to nor are they attuned to shift in which the entire situation ships and there\nIs today I think a larger atmosphere shift in which expectation is now the driving element in other words the Chinese\nAnd the Russians and of course even the Europeans expect that this is going to be\nA kind of end game for America and as a result they are going to act accordingly and in America people who are in power whether they are red or blue\nAre simply obsessively and understandably focus on the domestic\nWe'll leave it there Michael play house of Johns Hopkins I'm John bachelor Mm\n\nWhat auto group was your car any make any model flood pays more than anything around because we're a certified buying center

point of view Georgia would get transit fees they they are able to get a certain amount of gas and oil from either by John because of the transit\nFees and the the transit rights but they know that the the the more oil and gas transits Georgia to get to Europe and and to get to the international markets means that there's more international concern and focus on Georgia and as you pointed out Georgia's already\nPartially occupied by Russia in fact twenty percent of the country is occupied by Russia and they know that if Russia tries to take any more land or there'll be a bigger international attention on the situation because of the oil and gas traveling through the country\nThe Silk Road though it's a theory it's a dream it's an imagination but they have a port at Baku they're waiting for the development of the Silk Road how close are we look to getting that trends that are the pipelines the highways to railroads\nFrom China to Europe or we was in Twenty years ten years what's your opinion\nBut actually say to some extent they exist right now um and it's exist it's been around for a couple of millennia\nA bed to different degrees and there is a huge aspiration to do a lot more with new uh pipelines new shipping routes Newport's new rail links and I think we are we're seeing good progress of with all of this but I think for for to really see its full potential we're talking another\nFifteen Twenty years there right now we're already seeing huge improvements in a way east and west hum travel a transit of goods on the Eurasian land mass uh takes place and and I was about to such an important part\nIn all of this so there's one point there's one longitude and the whole year Asian land mass where there are only three countries from the Arctic Ocean to the Arabian Sea and that's Russia or is it by John and Iran\nSo if the U.S or European partners went to conduct trade with East Asia over land and they went to avoid Russia and Iran all the trade has to go through as a by John ... that's what makes us so geopolitically important\nAnd with this new port that they're constructing in Baku the new the just south of buck who actually uh the potential is really unlimited uh there's a lot of space they have broken out in different phases they're making good progress\nOn opening of opening up different aspects of this port some of the some of the sport has already operational other bits are under construction\nAnd the U.S uses this port actually to ship stuff to Afghanistan and in fact when I was at the port in February there was a ship heading out across the Caspian towards a Turkmenistan and I asked where you know what what's on the ship and they said chickens for us troops to eat in Afghanistan\nOr so it's important for us to hear in the United states even though we're several thousand miles away it's important to see this development take place\nAnd what's unique about what's happening in as a giant as there's very little Chinese money I mean this particular report that we're talking about has no Chinese money involved with it so the eyes about Johnny's doing it themselves knowing that it'd be more appealing to Europe

um the keel might have had been cracked which we couldn't tell the kill gets cracked a crack opens on the ship breaks into two parts\nAnd here comes the type of do you remember the typhoon Peter I do\nRemember and the hard part of the Alice tease it very flat bottom there's no no point in the um the part that goes into the water so when you head into heavy seas the ship goes up and then comes

add a brick and mortar stores in the form of bookstores and he's doing it as he buys whole foods\nUm he ... the best way to reach customers has to have on the ground stores and so this is not about taking out as competitors again no one wants low wage workers think about any business you are you want to get the most talented workers who logically costs more\nThat's the path to growth businesses

brand for heaven's sakes do another self made man or is he he is now the president of the United states Donald J Trump the New York times has reported\nThat they can document and I don't doubt them than Mr Trump inherited more than four hundred million dollars from his father who was a very successful real estate developer and New York and in the boroughs\nI joined the puzzle here is does receiving four hundred million dollars from your father make you a self made man when you're worth billions\n[noise] uh yes it most certainly does make you a self made man or let's look at the force four hundred there airs in it and there are self made man it it's very rare that there's both in it in Trump's case\nNo one's going tonight it surprised exactly no one that he inherited more than the one million he claimed but his father was a very successful outer borough real estate developer obviously a brilliant guy there's no question about that but Donald Trump has his name on buildings and Manhattan\nThe most difficult and competitive real estate market in the world he has his name on buildings around the world by the New York times\nVery own reasoning he is one of the great marketers of all time or will ... smart girl atlas dealmaker if that's not self made what he did turning what his father gave him into a global brand I don't know what it is\nBecause Mr Trump is often in the news and because we're watching him as a president quite apart from as a businessman\nWhat I read in the New York times is that Fred ... and then the family took advantage of the ... uh the IRS in in in the in\nThe rules that the IRS keeps changing over these last decades about inherited wealth I didn't see any law breaking John So I'm quite puzzled this resentment for people who have inherited money or the resentment for people who are self made\nThere's this suspicion is that they're doing something sinister\nJohn they're creating jobs it's it's entirely lost apparently the New York times

dominated the ground combat but also I learned from the new book indoor encourage a pilot a wreck and block from the dawn of the age of speed by John Ross\nA reckon bacher define how automobiles came just to win the hearts of America racing automobiles first and then the family automobile\nJohn a very good evening to you and congratulations for your extremely careful work over a ... a period of time in which everything was inventing itself the automobiles inventing itself the airplane was inventing itself air combat within vetting itself and America fell in love with going fast\nLet's begin in Nineteen fourteen in Des Moines at the Iowa State fair August September Nineteen fourteen\nMen by Eddie ... at this point is twenty four years old\nA matches up against a man named beach and they're going to have an unusual race what is it well\nJohn thanks for having me on it's such an exciting period and you kept it with that example Lincoln beach it was a daredevil flyer who was up by plane and this was a pushover airplanes so he was out like he was playing up beyond the piano right out in front and the propeller was behind him\nAnd Eddie reckon backer who was a famous race car driver just at the moment there\nWas asked to compete in a race around a circuit in front of a huge crowd artists and so that the crowd could see what an airplane could do and bought a car could do and it was like\nA bear against the law when I was like a circus these things where it this technology these technologies were so new and so explosive was taking people's breath so way\nIt is August September Nineteen fourteen exactly the time the world ... catastrophe we're still living with which was the comes August\nThat is where we're headed with ... but we need we need to recover his racing car period because that's the first time he invented himself in Nineteen fifty\nA beat she dies in another stumped with his aircraft he drowns I Believe after racing in San Francisco but in Nineteen Fifteen Eddie ... one of the most famous racing car drivers in America is racing for a firm run by the Maxwell and he's battling his old firm run by the pool shows\nAnd they're the do some birds as well but he's not working for the ... and he's racing men who are extremely famous in America all the boys in America knew their names Dario ... and uh another\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than any dealer around because we're sort of by buying center and we'll buy yours and even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers on time\nRights than the you know he was they were nobody knew that the car everybody had an idea that the car was the future but they didn't know it was going to be electric if it was going to be gasoline um if it was going to be a electric you know a steam\nSo what they did is they had to cork things and listen to it listen how the engine plane they had they were inventing as they went along that reminds\nMe Eddie is an engine whisper yes that takes skill into the sky is what ... what was his hearing he could tell he learned\nThat FA as an engine running to rich there was too much fuel you could tell that if it was running to lean he could tell that he could tell the sounds when something was wrong and by that he\nHe had a relationship with machines where he would know how to push it harder\nBack off what was wrong with it and to tweak it you can't just remembered that the the engine the internal combustion engine was built but then the next generation of people came along\nTo tweak it and to play with it and to send mess these things to learn what it was all about him he was a prominent you know not in any manner as much as a weaker\nAnd you can drive the machine is these days they were committed to racing because it was a novelty he meets amending leaf fryer and he's going to be tapped by Lee fire to become what is known as a mechanism ... what does that mean\nWell it's a crazy thing uh in back in the early car racing days in the early early Indianapolis five hundred Z there was not just a race car driver by next to him ... condition and the ... conditions job\nWas a couple of things one was to pump\nThe oil pumped because they didn't have a mechanized oil pumped to keep the oil pressure up its speed but the big thing was to look behind and because they hadn't figured out that are rearview mirror\nThat the ... that the driver could look back so the mechanism would look back and see if a car was coming up and then tap the needs of the driver to tell him to get out of the way or to speed up or whatever was was needed now this was in a day of course with no\nSeatbelts no windshields no hard helmets\nSo the Mac condition who actually often got the worst of it was only just holding onto a little strap on the side of his uh\nHis chair so when they hit if they hit a fence or they hit a pocket of something often the both of them would go airborne were more likely the ... airborne because he didn't have the wheel in front of him\nLeave fryer got up to sixty miles per hour and that was considered fast he runs in the first twenty four hour race it's important to mention that they were inventing the whole idea of racing going around the track and it about this time the Indy five hundred gets put together by a man named Carl Fisher who will become important to us we'll get to him at the moment\nBut money is the motive here any needs money he's\nVery close to his mother\nHis mother depends on him winning money and there is a thing called the Vanderbilt come for ten thousand dollars which even sounds like a lot of money today I have the Nineteen oh six Vanderbilt ... and that becomes a magic\n... a golden ring that they want to capture what what did it mean to them I understand the cash but what\nWhat you got to remember too that Eddie grow up in a place so poor and his experience was watching\nMen going to factories day in and day out and anonymity that he just didn't want and racing which is extremely dangerous and the Vanderbilt Cup on a road was a road race so wasn't within the confines of everything of a of a\nYou know the Indy five hundred for instance would give him an opportunity if he won if he made some money if he got a ranking no one could ever take that away from him when\nThere's a man named Barney Oldfield it's gone now but it means everything do ... what is what it who is Barney\nOld feel is one of the original bass I Love terror alert solve that you had a best picture of him is he has a big cigar and in the middle of the race he would be true in he would chew that and it would often go out but actually what he used it for\nWhat so did his teeth wouldn't because the rocking they the shocks were terrible the road surfaces were terrible you would shake you up so badly it would not people's teeth out so he kept a cigar clamped but he had this big burly go at it a hundred miles an hour speed he was the first to go\n... group once your car any make any model flood pays more than any dealer around because we're sort of by buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers on\nShoot for it to be admired by by like yes absolutely you know there are other ... young men who are coming into this business\nAnd their ... their names are everywhere they're legion and in John's book we're not going to cause for them but it's a rich part of the book and if that alone had been ... would have been exhausting because they were inventing the whole idea and the crowds are inventing the idea of watching races\nWe've seen NASCAR today which is on the shoulders of what they were doing a hundred years ago October first Nineteen ten of written that date down because of Vanderbilt Cup took place in New York\nBut it was banned by the governor of New York because it killed what twenty two ... at at the ... of watchers they would they would only part as the car came through them it was some kind of ... it was some kind of what daredevils tree or the police and nobody was shaking charges that\nThey had police lined up they had ... so this was out in Long Island on roads right so it's kind of like the Tour de France everybody kind of kept out and they have picnics and everything the crazy thing John is that nobody had seen anything terrestrial go so fast\nAnd they and the noise of it and the smell of oil and gas excitement of it\nThis these crowds would just come right into the road right in front\nOf you know if these cores that just part at the Paris last second they had no understanding of what speed was like\nAnd a lot of these guys as you mentioned got hit and thrown in the ... on what you're saying yes to finally the governor said you know we just can't go on I mean this is just awful and these were law by bonding citizens he gives you a sense of how exciting it was how knew this was\nA the woman and Eddie's life we've got to get to her in the season Nineteen Fifteen it was going to be a great one for Karl Fischer and this is going to be the fifth Indianapolis five hundred the brick yard\nFree point two million bricks and Thirteen cents each in what ... what a bumpy ride that must be a way around the tires they had to practice it in one time that he tried to cheat and got caught but we don't have time to get on your Carl Fisher who will become a force in ... future um\nAnd Eddie and ... because by now he's putting together as a teen\nHowever there is a woman and we've got to get to hurt her name is Adelaide her maiden name is Adelaide fraud so I have here she's of vaudeville singer and he only took up with romantic Larry ... why is that important\nWell cliff with the side of the founder of a a General Motors and it was a playboy um and he gravitated as many Playboy's did early aughts a racing and that's how eddy met him at how eddy Matt Adelaide but the secret on the\nUh the unspoken secret on the track was that a cliff was beating Adelaide and he was not a nice guy and there was an Eddie wasn't nobody and he walked into cliffs big\nPlayboy kind of a state and where and cliff was cheating on Adelaide autistic they struck up something there that they would not pick up until later\nNineteen fifty 'cause there's a war ahead of it is and as a means to men in Glen Mark who use an old Methodist Church to build an airplane factory in California where you know him as Martin Marietta what\nIs it he learned from Glen ... what does he ... feet what'd you seem to learn about himself\nWell this is the first time he goes up in a plane and er\nEddie I don't take really at until then had seen airplanes but I never had bought this poor kid from Columbus who could drive cars pretty well but he never thought he was one for the air and he got up\nUh with Martin and went over the and thought he was going to be sea sick and uh up you know nausea said he was dead and gone Martin said yeah because it's a different thing when you get up and you look over there and you know Eddie was bitten by a bug and they would never looked back the\nBook is endure encourage we're about to go to war ace pilot Eddie ... soccer John Ross is the author I'm John ... the John bachelor show\n\n\nI shouldn't have been in mom leaves we\nAnd the last two years for what I'm Sorry for failures\nWhat is your Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve we own condition and what board and he's written a generic emphasize right over two hundred three on cars all make models had incredible prices are going to flood Otto John job now\nIs that there is there could be great dissatisfaction within the engineering or crews that build these\nThings because they don't get paid much effect that paid a pittance compared to engineers the rest of the world and the management is not great and detectives generally been poor and so Russia's around happy country right now so I wouldn't be surprised if the criminal\nLet's go to the U.S side how can we get a spacecraft ready to do routine back and forth to the I asked us to operate as if it was so you\nGo out right now our schedule is that a space X is going to do is unmanned test sometime in January and then five months later it's first manned mission that that's not that's not an operational mission that's still a test mission\nAnd Boeing is going to go in April with unmanned and then in August manned so that sometime next year and those are still the test flights\nI'm One of the reasons the January the January unmanned test\nFlight of safe sex was delayed was because there was scheduling conflicts at I assess I say they should take advantage of this situation and push the space X launch up but then it might not make sense better to get the Russians in shape first um\nThere is problems at the bureaucracy at NASA and that's his safety panel which would would get upset if if I had a paper about\n'em is talking about how well they haven't really handle all the factors that need to be handled and we don't see these launches happening as scheduled well I think the safety panel is going to be told to shut up and not interfere with the need for getting\nThese ... another twist here Bob I don't trust Ross ... I don't think I I Am I an investigation and a report is going to satisfy the doubt that are now a cemented about Ross cosmos is quality control and their ability to be successful\nI think that's what I'll give it a slightly different perspective John which is that like NASA I actually trust that they will investigate this thoroughly pinned down what the problem was\nAnd fix and make sure that problem doesn't exist on late emissions but like NASA with less program which has had numerous Ga oh an inspector general reports over the last eight years telling us how badly it's managed I Would expect them to fix the more systemic underlying\nProblems that are causing this\nThat their problems just like in ... is not really fixing its management problems they fix each individual ... specific thing and don't fix\nThe overall issue you can't do it when you got a government run system you don't have competition to\nForce you to fix the problems and so I think all that means is I think they will get this particular problem fixed they will be able to launch again soon but I think it just it's just more ammunition we've got to stop depending on them because they do not have a a good system\nAnd and what we're switching to is private enterprise and competition increases the chance that we won't have similar problems on our upper commercial launches\nBob detail here not that has not failed with protons and to start uses NASA has not been the target criminal investigations of fraud and and I and improper construction and\nOversee John I have to interrupt Sony Ross cosmos Orion\nThat this ... this this is like a general court this week outlined almost identical kind of incompetence shouting is and quality control as\nBob we're dealing with malfeasance when we're dealing with Ross cause most fast fraud misrepresentation quality control and a central government the non transparent they're not and knowledge is Bob\nWhere are you know what I don't I don't entirely agree with you for example with us here last\nThe G the inspector general report pointed out how NASA contracting officials were keeping a ... authorizing the contract the Boeing to spend more money and do things\nAbove that contracting authority they didn't have the authority to make those authorizations and they went ahead and did it anyway that standard like criminal actually I have to tell you\nKnow mental mother adolescents not criminal lessons brought before the bar of justice I cannot accept a trusting Ross cosmos\nThat there's there's no transparency about there's no reason to go back to them for anything else unless you're looking for more trouble because there's no expectation that they can they can solve what has been creating these failures\nThat in that context John we are in a hundred percent agreement this is why I think we should be accelerating our own man programs as fast as possible we should we should really try to get out from er line amendment total agreement us I pointed out they might\nThe Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and super all have in common they are all in for Steve ... edition at one point and religion are against it that's right over two hundred dollars all make all models at incredible prices are going to flood auto jobs now\nThat I'm looking for a success here Bob rocket science is a good one a rocket what is it well rocket lab is\nThat uh Americans slash New Zealand company they launched a New Zealand that built an electron rocket it's a small rockets designed to small or large or small sets\nAnd they did was successful launch back in January they were going to do another to another operational lost their first operation wash in June and I had to cancel it because of a problem with a motor control they say\nAnd the delay kicked in and extended until finally about a month and a half they announced that they're going to do a a that next launching November and follow up with a launch in December [noise] um\nToday they announced they unveiled\nI'm a their new rocket production facility in New Zealand and what's really interesting about this facility is it's designed to mass produce the rockets they want to be able to turn out a rocket electron rocket once a week at this facility\nThat's a significant thing because that's a complete change in how rockets built I mean SpaceX has tried to make it this\nWay but nobody has ever built rockets without I but I Do or not mass\nProducing them and getting done soon as ... what this implies is that um\nThey've announced this ... this factory because I think what they're thinking they incorporated into corrections that they had to do to that motor controller and they purposely ... the late for the last you know they got that exactly right\nSo they could also put it into the facility that's going to mess just these rockets and so when they get these next two launches off in November and December this tells the I think what that means is they're going to then if the ground running in twenty Nineteen\nAnd we'll be aiming for fall frequent more frequent launches maybe as many as one a wink for weeks the entire year\nIt'll be just a matter of how many customers they got to have contracted by the way they can just keep putting them on the planet I'm going to be quite exciting\nThe observation and it keeps the website beyond the black when we come
