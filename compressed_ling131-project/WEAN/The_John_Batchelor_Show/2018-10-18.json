our breath and see if it works good evening to you Brandon\nWell good evening John and thank you again for having me on and hello Gordon and to answer your question I'm back home in Florida we have a saying even a blind pay confided slot bowl once in a while um the Chinese yes it's true they're having some technical difficulties\nOpposite to be fair we here in the United states in the sixties and seventies had our share of technical difficulties with our space program if you give them enough time though they will adapt and the Chinese are heavily invested\nAnd they're heavily committed to achieving a what we know in the national security policy arena as space dominance\nAnd uh they are they are offering that so whether or not be next launch\nAnd the next few months we'll work uh I think it probably will but even if it doesn't they're going to keep trying until they get one right and we hear in the United states unfortunately are not competing the way we should be the way we did against the Soviets in space and so they basically in China have a lot of time to perfect\nA the technology they're trying to ah create and and you\nWant to translate quickly there's moon race on and there's only one contestant is that is\nThat that is one hundred percent correct yes Gordon\nRuined another to just choose the topic a little bit because I heard you speak yesterday and I was absolutely flabbergasted it's something that you said\nWhich I think is critically important which I think every American needs to hear and that is um we all know that Google has declined to participate in a Pentagon contract to develop the cloud some ten billion dollars\nA lot of people and Google are upset that um this does not fit in with the Google philosophy of don't be evil but I heard you say and and I just was completely astounded\nThat Google is about to participate in a technology contract in China were affected were the partner on the other side is the People's Liberation army if you could just run through back because there are a lot more details on that but I think everyone needs to hear this\nYeah so basically a quantum computing is it's the next revolution I'm that's that is the thing it is an ex industrial revolution whoever can figure out quantum computing first\nIt's basically like having the cotton gin you know other laughing duster revolution it it will completely change the way the world works\nUh the Chinese presently have what's known as quantum Internet basically it plays upon string theory and basically without getting into the mechanics of it\nIt's a physics has shown that to a particle could exist in the same place can exist in two different places at the same time and the Chinese have figured out a way to manipulate that particle to transfer encrypted data between the two particles I Am it's worked they've been tested this twenty sixteen from\nThat technology that initial investment they spun off technologies like quantum radar which can be a it's believed can see through the F thirty five that multi trillion dollar\nA program of ours to build the great stealth fighter they can see through it and they're married that to the S. four hundred Russian built defense system\nAs well they are now investing heavily in an actual quantum computing center\nHow would you like motor trench twenty eight gene trunk of the year for only one Ninety nine per month we'll say hello to forge twenty four to one fifty this front for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a flood forward and he went into a newer games it\nAnd not only sending over talent to this massive new center there building which would be probably operational around twenty twenty twenty Twenty one\nBut Google also wants to infuse cash this is under the umbrella of a state owned enterprises in China which happens to be basically reporting to the People's Liberation army the Chinese have actually not been very secretive about the fact that the quantum computing center that they're building that Google could potentially be helping with\nA is actually not only for civilian purposes but also for military ads in the same way that Google and apple investment into a I research artificial intelligence research in China is also going to be used for Chinese military purposes\nLet me set the formula here if I understand this correctly Google as evidenced interest in participating in the pie LA's advanced\nAdvanced work on a lie and quantum Kim ... corner and quantum computing at the same time Google's employees have raised a raw when Google was looking to compete with Amazon and now with Microsoft\nFor the super secret cloud contract ten billion dollars a year at the Pentagon I lay out there is to ask very clearly garden\nThis looks like Google is siding with the non transparent dictatorship and just standing there transparent military that protects Google copyright\nYeah I mean that's the only interpretation I can think of John and this is something that I think that first of all the president needs to think about and we need to start thinking about whether I'm you know in a company which is headquarters in the United states which does business in in our country\nWhose permitted to help the Chinese develop their military which is considering to kill Americans\nAnd brand and have you seen Google addressed this parrot talks in any fashion\nWell no and if anything there's you know they're they're they're continuing to do business in China I Will say though are in both cases of the the way I Am the quantum computing\nOr did they not actually going forward with it this is all you know starting the groundwork right now but I if went less awareness has risen I think\nI I think that things will go on without the American people knowing until it's too late and so part of my\nMy hope is to raise awareness among the American people to say hey maybe we shouldn't have some of our best companies going overseas investing in the centers that could be used to it or leave defeat the United states uh enough you know whether it's economic\nOr military competition and there's something very interesting that there is a man by the last few months later we have twenty seconds Brandon oh go ahead\nOr basically the there was the English English mint is the reason why we won the industrial revolution against Britain it was a British expatriate add name Slater they called them slate of a traitor in England and so the same thing might be happening with American companies going over to China building up our our rivals\nAre somehow that phrase that they liked early on and Google garden that don't evil thing to ...

we can do that themselves the students are saying things that can be construed as critical of China\nOr to send a chill or into the ranks of those students and it it really\nCuts against everything that we say that well when they come here to this country they're going to experience academic freedom and intellectual freedom and therefore they'll go back and change China and the fact is is that they feel probably even more under observation and more under surveillance here\nWhen they're studying abroad than they do in China\nYou know Michael what'd you say is absolutely ... percent correct about Chinese students here they are under surveillance by the Chinese government by the Chinese students and scholars association or embassy personnel\nBut you know some of them actually do express discontent like those who started that a hashtag not my president movement in California\nThose Chinese students were very clear that he didn't like the idea that ... was eliminating term limits for himself and for the vice presidents or this is a real indication but Chinese students do actually think and have views that are very different from the Communist Party\n[noise] sure and we and what we want to do is encourage that we want them to be able to number one be here and feel the freedom to speak their mind but but even perhaps more importantly than that be\nExposed to different views be exposed to a a critical set of um discussions about China China's role in the world the United states uh and the like um you know the the degree to which the students are are going to be influential back in China or in in which\nThe degree to which they carry these views forward as opposed to feeling some type of pressure to ah to abandon those views or do they stay here you know all of these are the open questions I think what we can say\nOr at least at at the the largest level of of looking at the data of Chinese students in the United states is that we now have the experience of millions of Chinese students having studied here many of them\nAre probably the majority having gone back\nTo China at least after some period of residents in the United states\nAnd as far as we can tell having very little effect on the path of society so it doesn't mean that we should uh turned our back on them or burn them we should be encouraging them uh but for the broader argument that what this is

[noise]\nI'm joined us from the the John ... a welcome Lara Brown\nLara bought them George Washington university to comment as a political scientist with days to go twenty Twenty one days to go to the midterm election what we see in the polling and how this comports with political science\nHistory about midterms following a close election or a White House held by the opposite party to the ambitious out of power party Laura a very good evening to you I think I cage that enough so that I didn't get too far ahead of myself\nThe elections that you are profiled these last weeks and months we've been talking about this\nIndicates that the Democrats are on the edge of doing the obvious which is winning the house from the Republicans somewhere between twenty six and thirty six seats is enough\nAt this point there's chatter about a blue wave there's also chowder better read where\nDo you think do you see anything inconsistent in the polling and the polling is very careful I'm watching the New York times polling they pull every night and they give the numbers as they do it you see anything in the polling to indicate a an interruption in the conventional wisdom that the Democrats will win a majority in the house of representatives good evening to\nGet evening thanks for having me on the most difficult part about polling is that pollsters half to\nEstimate and this is where the art is\nWhat the turnout is going to look like and the heart of that usually happens through screens of registered voters they asked them how likely you are to vote so you get what are called likely voters screens some of it also\nHappens I'm through the responses themselves you can start to tell by the the amount of sort of information people have are the enthusiasm that they have in certain questions that you ask them um how likely they are to participate and all of that\nInformation kind of helps a pollster understand what turnout may look like\nBut the problem is we're in something of an unusual mid term environment we're seeing both parties bases\n... very enthusiastic I'm almost equally enthusiastic not quite but almost and\nInterestingly enough people are saying that they're planning on voting with a high degree of certainty and that is just\nNot usual in a midterm election in other words mid term elections yes we have this dynamic of wave\nYes there are times where all of the sort of the enthusiasm of the out party builds up and sort of cast this referendum vote against the president but what we're seeing in this instance\nIs it both parties bases are very excited I'm and we're not really sure\nA little bit about the middle of the electorate\nThe middle of the electorate is nonpartisan it's either independent or not terribly excited either way it's waiting for that last week under that last day so is there another way to judge George to measure or to get some mid term does the money tell the story lower\nWell money certainly can suggest some enthusiasm and it is true that money has uh some very real\nImpacts on whether or not candidates are able to win I think as political scientists have long studied and Gary Jacobsen is I'm sort of high on the list of canon of political scientists who have understood these dynamics but one of the things that is true is that incumbents have to raise money\nLooking forward to our credit not breed will isn't it taught you financed with blood was born in each bring a generic as one of the best prices in cars with zero percent or if your for somebody to much you can be driving on the boards also models interest free walk on the job\nIn a defensive posture in other words um they need to raise more than the challengers but at the same time I'm every dollar that they spend\nDoesn't help them as much as say a dollar a challenger raises and spends and that just has to do with the familiarity of these candidates challengers are usually not known so every dollar that they spend um does\nMore to help them advance their causes in other words there's a better marginal return on their dollars spent but the truth of the matter is for both candidates the challenger and the income than there is essentially a saturation level\nUm or there is a diminishing returns that go with the additional dollars spent\nI'm told look I'm told about that saturation level that we passed it about a week ago that there are the ... minutes left on any TV channels anywhere in the important battleground districts\nThat's right and of course so much of half of this is also happening on line so there's a lot of digital advertising um where people are spending money but really what you're looking at here is\nIf a challenger hopes to sort of beat an incumbent they need to raise typically at least half as much as the incumbent raises and spend that amount what is pretty extraordinary about the election we appear to be in is that\nMany of the Democratic challengers have\nOut raised the Republican incumbents\nThat usually doesn't happen it is a rarity and it does suggest that the energy is on the Democratic side of the aisle but we do have to realize that um challengers need to kind of be known if they're going to essentially\nWhen there's a twist there too I saw the New York times feature of the story that the candidates for the Democrats in Texas a roar this is the Senate candidate against Ted Cruz has raised some spectacular amount of money tens of millions thirty eight million was not named I don't know what the total some is\nAnd and is not spreading it around the way Congress of the way members of Congress usually do and so there's all and all a lot of money this is New York times reporting was coming from California and New York in other words not from Texas\nAnd that's the power of online that's the power of crowd funding but at the same time I wonder if that's effective money Laurie is that a detail the political science can help with\nWell at the end of the day all money is good money and that you can spend it I mean I Do think that one of the things that Beto O'Rourke\nHas um declared is that he's not taking pac contributions so that is helping him at this level at which he can say all of this money\nWherever it's coming from is happening through individuals giving to me um and that\nDoes allow him to spend an extraordinary amount he did thirty eight million in the third quarter he did twenty three million in the second quarter so there is no doubt he has plenty of money for all of the media advertising buys\nHe wants to do um the real question is will it persuade\nAny Republicans because obviously the challenge for Beto O'Rourke is the voter\nUnderline voter distribution and registration in Texas we know that there are more Republicans there\nThough there are many Democrats who are not registered and this is sort of the new fight of the Democratic party which is do you engage in persuasion or do you try to turn out voters who have not voted before\nAnd in some of the states that they're in right now in particular some of 'em these more contested typically Republican states like Georgia I'm you are seeing a lot of of questions about\nUm who can actually vote and who should be voting\nLargest a detailed her with less than ... minutes ago the conventional wisdom also says that the Republicans retain the Senate in some fashion whether it's a pickup or stand pat do you see anything to interrupt that we have about thirty seconds\n[laughter] know again I think this is where the underlined distribution of voters matters a great deal um if you look at those states where Democrats are on the defensive granted their incumbents and they've raised money but they are in very Republican states and with a enthusiastic Republican\nBlood like

able to relieve that can be which is they're on board and bringing them back a within a\nTimeframe or allow it required by the by the expiration date of that so he was which is that right now in orbit so it's the kind of a juggle of several missions to several um uh several launches of the same time so so I use that they might actually launch early as they plan before\nDavid ... any chance they would make a decision to leave the space station without a crew and take the chances on that whether you're hearing about that are either\n... or a member of that before they launched that's ... that's pretty which was they plan to launch lethal as early as they have the other rockets with on land payloads which was military satellites essentially all lined up to me that that is that the lights on one cargo ship or through the station so those\nAre the so that their decision to launch the crew will be based on a successful launches so does the vehicles\n... if they discover any other problems or as a bomb putting in some brown into any other throw ... from the engineering standpoint or otherwise they have a choice essentially to bring him to clear which is on board the

and Ninety six divisions\nThe three Army Corps that are sent against the Serbs or in the hands of tiara who in the rival of Conrad and hold your eye he's even less effective as a commander and more Jericho as a man searching for victories and Conrad\nAnd what they what they wind up doing is trying to cross the dream river\nTo press into the mountains and we learn from the first time and Jeffrey's book that the Austrian citizens are totally unaware of how to fight a war\nThey're barely trained and this is the first and best of the draft ...\nThey don't have enough weapons is generally a Jeffrey said but they fight badly they bunch shop in charge would ban on into what's your insulating fire and it's a disaster in the heat and they were beaten by their own tactics and I said that correctly Jesse\nYeah yes exactly and and and you're right this really hasn't been covered if you look at history the real world one\nUh the the ... invasion it's it's quite puzzling how they actually lost but no historian has really gone any detail into how that campaign was fought and how it turned and uh you know what happened was the the ... and as you said these were the best troops and the author and good are these with along service groups\nAnd my book by the way he concludes by saying really by the end of Nineteen fourteen it's game over it because the train the army has been ... and\nThe train opposite been an island and they start getting annihilated and the Serbian campaign and the Russian Campaign Nineteen fourteen and what's happening here in August August September Nineteen fourteen they invade Serbia is we saying that\nThese troops even though they are technically the long service professionals or anything but and that's because the Australian Gehring army was so\n... that it it it didn't keep the troops very long with the colors and then when they and they and they would furlough the troops frequently and or in other words instead of keeping them two or three years of constant service\nThey would just send them off for six months back to their villages 'cause they couldn't afford to pay them so these guys were very lightly trained they had very little practice or with their rifles they had no practice infringing there'd been no combined\nArms practices maneuvers where infantry practice with\nThe artillery to sort of advanced with covering fire and deliver the artillery shoot them through enemy positions this was unheard of\nAnd so because the troops were so ah poorly trained and poorly equipped and also hard to leave because remember this is a ... army speaking\nA dozen different languages there is a German language of command eighty words that all recruits regardless of nationality need to know but you know realistically they don't really know them I mean you're taking uneducated peasants\nThey've probably heard these trends but they have a hard time remembering what they all mean\nAnd then the heat of battle the chaos about all these units completely come undone and you see total demoralization and suing against you know very light reverses where a whole unit will just turn around and retreat covering the ground with his weapons and equipment as it recruits are back out of Serbia\nSo the invasion of Serbia which was meant to be a\n... expedition a quick strike toward value or that would that would uh envelop the Serbian Army and then and occupation of Belgrade and the partition of the king them into little pieces much of which will be taken by Austria that rest by officers Balkan allies instead to serve the Austrian back\nAnd defeat them to defeat them in August they defeat them in September and then they defeat them\nHow would you like motor drenched twenty gene truck to be here for only one Ninety

Indiana\nOh it was absolutely commonplace and it was definitely known about are the two friends for rather rather separate uh\nSerbia was regarded as being a different kind of place than Galicia the rules were supposed to be more strictly enforced English there were no rules in Serbia because there was a great hatred between the kingdom of Serbia and the Austrian\nEmpire the Serbs called the ... you\nKnow the half spurts you know birds with borrowed feathers because they felt that they were camped out on\nCroatian territory Serbian Hungarian polish Ukrainian territory but what were the

... stations easier for whichever nationality was trying to make them\nAnd so the the the Austrians joined the difference was is that the Austrians were held to a higher standard they they went into Serbia saying they were going as a western civil ... agent and they were going to improve Serbia they were going to ah make Serbia you know ready for prime time and in fact they went in and they
