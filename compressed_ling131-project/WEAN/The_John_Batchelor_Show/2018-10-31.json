of Azerbaijan from food the energy to a knowledge economy\nThe republic of Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea bass in as a region well worth exploring we go immediately to a region that at this moment is undetermined that is Florida\nWhat on a group once your car any make any model what more than any dealer around because we're sort of by buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours more Bones Are all like horrible your dog\nI've heard from some very good questions about who is Andrew Gillum and he's the state of Florida that voted happily for Donald Trump is either about to move towards the Obama part\nOf the Democratic party or they're going for the Bernie Sanders even more radical than that part of the Democratic party Liz can we read Florida is it just going to be a different state every time there's an election\nThat's a really good question Andrew Gillum that democratic\nCandidate was a surprise winner in the primaries that were held I don't know when that was six weeks ago or so at no one really saw it coming he's the mayor of Tallahassee and\nA really there hadn't that not a whole lot was known about him his attractive African American a good speaker he is kind of a nearby la channel I guess you'd say\nOr or mold a but really no one knew a huge amount about this guy a\n... including the fact that there was a corruption scandal swirling around Tallahassee where he is mayor ah for the last year or so and it's a pretty serious one and one of his former campaign workers a has been subpoenaed to appear\nA ... he was um [noise]\nCaught up Gillum to an FBI a investigation uh where they ... it ... it's it's complicated but basically Gillum was has not been named in any indictment or subpoena but\nHe's pretty darn close to a lot of [noise] seeming bad stuff that went on having to do naturally with real estate development and pay off a ... and honestly I I have no idea what the outcome of that will be as I say he is not personally\nBeen mentioned but it's very close to his office which I think is tainted his um his run but more importantly I think for the voters of Florida I I have to say I sort of shake my head about this\nFlorida is a booming state one of the fastest growing states in the country one of the lowest unemployment rates\nAre under Governor Scott they've created an enormous number of jobs more than the country average uh and it just unimaginable of course from New York as I Do need to tell you there is a steady exodus heading to Florida because of the low tax\nRates there and the fact that it's a great place to die forgive me but the low inheritance rate and all the rest of that stuff\nUh you know a lot of wealthy New Yorkers make it their business to move to Florida a and when they retire so why Florida would want to change all that and that is what Gillum is promising higher taxes higher taxes particularly on a corporation this\nUh but higher taxes nonetheless this is a fellow who is funded heavily by George Soros and by organizations funded by George Soros he is not at all and the Obama political old and in fact his way left of Obama honestly it is astounding to me that he has gotten so much traction in this race\nLet's look at the big picture of the Democratic party being astonishing least successful in other races where the logic escapes me\nFor example were were under your your jobs because of the economy will affect the frustration here uh for me to figure this out with political science the Republican Party has delivered three point five percent following four point two percent of GDP\nThat that is supposed to to to dominate the conversation but it's not instead the conversation is turning obsessively about the conduct of Donald Trump is that the Democratic message is that is that the closing arguments Donald Trump that's it\nWell yes and I I mean that's exactly right if you can come up with any kind of coherent democratic platform that they're running on I'd really love to hear it because I don't think it exists a instead what you have is anti Trump fever\nUm and and the problem is because the president is out there\nA ... ... ... you know presiding over these enormous boisterous rallies day after day after day weighing in on all these contests\nIn a sense that Democrats are responding to his presence in these races now I think he's doing the right thing I think he does boost turnout I think he's out there reminding voters that voted for him you know our work is not done what\nObama did that in twenty ... do you recall those rallies in Philadelphia and Chicago he was always on the campaign trail with feverish attention talking about I remember particularly one don't give him the keys back big round the car into the ditch don't give him the kid back and he went to ... he was extremely popular and the ...\nGMC hotdog thank you for having common in for Steve for your own condition and then he should never again that's why I Know where to refer you own cars models incredible to John calm now\nTwenty cat that was entirely about Nancy Pelosi and healthcare that was ... ten and twenty fourteen where the Republicans held up quite fondly it was about jobs jobs jobs jobs I was the last midterm it wasn't about Obama although which has been a strike\nThe puzzle here is one of the Democrats promised to do\nIn this closing argument against all they promise to do is remove Donald Trump that's ... that's the campaign promise\nWell actually as you know how dire a wealthy Democrat back or has put a lot of money at this rate for candidates to promise\nTo pursue and Pete Smith a minute there in Congress I think there will be an effort to impeach the president a Maxine Waters is going to be head of the financial services committee and as a committee chair she will have the\nOpportunity to subpoena records on financial transactions all kinds of stuff\nFrom the president so she has promised to move on impeachment uh hearing process as quickly as possible and I'm sure so there that I think that that just grazing paying a little bit in you and I agree\nThat Republicans should be out there talking about the ... the economy right 'cause it deregulation but the Republicans are\nAs a columnist at Fox News columnist at the hill I'm John bachelor this segment of the global business report brought to you by the Republican about about Xiong from food energy to our knowledge economy the republic of Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea bass and as a region while we're exploring this is the John ... so\nMany years ago the woman on when [noise]\nThat for the first time in decades the blue collar folks are gaining wages faster than the white collar folks and I think again that has a lot to do with the supply side nature of this expansion where the corporate tax rate\nAre dropping to Twenty one percent the small business rates dropping too about Nineteen percent\nUm that is paying off\nSo that blue collars people who own and operate their own companies and businesses and they are hiring and that's why the blue collars are doing the best they've done\nIn many decades I think that's something that again many of my good friends on the other side of the trial or they don't want to talk about it but you know it Henry Kissinger used to say\nAn argument is always better John when it has benefitted by the facts and at some point are critics will have to acknowledge the fact\nI wanted to add to that about blue collar Larry because I Do small business reporting all the time\nAnd what I'm told repeatedly these last weeks is a small business confidence has never been higher and these were the first people to endorse or embrace wrong a Donald Trump early in the campaign cycling I puzzled about it what did they know that everybody all the smart guys don't know\nThey're still very confident about the economy and they're the ones who do the majority of hiring and all the jobs in America and the job creation\nWell I think you know going back to the campaign\nA candidate Trump argued again and again that the war against businesses over and the war against success is over and if you keep more of what you earn or risk or invest\nA you will be rewarded rather than penalized that's the beauty of the lower marginal tax rates and you know two years later that's what we are seeing\nSteve you have a question about business investment please\nI wanted to ask about this because I was just at a at a conference today and they can on the campus of recording out with a lot of the good news that low and it was talking about some of the skeptics Larry and I love your kind of response that as\nWe're saying well gee you know ... there were some really bad news in this latest report and the things that they say people simply said never get that for example that you know basically four percent growth now\nBut they were saying they were very disappointed with it\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed reason unbelievable prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on affords also models interest free log on to what Tom\nWhether you'd say that\nWell you know I think there were some glitches in that number I'm which will probably show up in a much stronger number in the fourth quarter and might show up in subsequent revisions um for example uh in the court ... court business investment spending\nShipments and cute three were up seven point seven percent and orders are up eight point five percent both that ad rates\nNow that doesn't really jive with uh the slowdown in business equipment which was only zero point four percent and I think that which will be straightened out a in a in cue for if not sooner but a key point here the national association that business economists nay\nThey are reporting a new record highs and profits and profit margins and I'm\nAre are the lifeblood of the economy and so I reckon as long as profits hold up and they are they may be having another shelf life here\nThat's going to really pro pal investments spending business investment spending which also the prophet increases are are they to function of the a reduction in marginal tax rates\nLarry our our consumers are driving this that's the way it should be right we're ... the film at all\nNo no I don't think so only in this quarter\nOnly in this quarter John I'm In the prior quarter as it was business investment in fact most of this expansion or the Trump expansion is coming from the business side uh although it was sloppy in this quarter and you're right a consumer spending was stronger but actually when you look at\nThe statistics um [noise] this is investments fixed investment up six point four percent over the past year a consumer spending a three percent so this really is a business investment driven and that's healthy because we have not seen this\nSince the mid to late Nineteen nineties and you can have\nA true strong economic recovery such as we are experiencing if it's just consumer spending after all supply creates its own demand business investment create more capital per worker which will lead to higher productivity\nAnd stronger real wages and again and the trend line a that is precisely what

available now you can order your uh your ... your your online version and\nYou can a pre order your online version it's war with Russia from putting in Ukraine to Trump in Russia gate we're dealing with Russia gate right now 'cause it's a week before\nThe midterm election where the allegation goes the Kremlin will once again be in the field to corrupt democracy we're dealing with the ironies of history how in the old Cold War they didn't tell them Margaret Thatcher that the Kremlin really had an agent in the election it was their opposite number Michael Foot in the labor party and in the new election\nOr they did they the Obama administration their intelligence apparatus their FBI either D. O. J. shouted to the rooftop Hillary Clinton shouted that Donald Trump isn't it as a Kremlin agent with no evidence that the world we live in the new Cold War is a real estate and with farcical elements but\nThere is damage here and Steve I Want to begin with legitimacy what does the allegation a week before the midterm do for the legitimacy of the American government\nWe talk we talked about the potential impact yeah a implications\nRamifications of this Russia the allegation that the Russians were manipulating the outcome of our elections in the case of Trump in two thousand sixty and as you say the media's pushing this now in regard to the house and congressional elections\nIn on November six [noise] so we you and I talked about this a little bit and it is a subject in my book war with Russia there was a question mark after it\nAnd the more I think about this I don't see this going away in the sense that as you said damage is being done we need that sense of process so here's what I asked myself and it's it's more a question\nThat an assertion but I think our folks listening ought to think about it or\nIf you say\nAnd you say it's for two and a half years\nEven though you can't produce any evidence that the Russians may have put Trump in the White House what have you done to the institution of the American presidency\nBecause it won't end with Trump because the idea that the Russians could do this the Kremlin do this and now they're saying the Chinese may want to do it but that a foreign power\nCould choose our president potentially dean legitimize is the presidency as an institution it cast a shadow on it or let's go to what's going to be the normal reaction the next Democratic president is going to get the same kinds of stuff thrown at him or her\nThat the Democrats are been throwing at Trump it isn't going to end so what we have to ask ourselves is first we get\nA almost a daily generalizing about our elections as a process\nBeginning with the presidential one or two sixteen now going into next Tuesday these questions had been raised so I have no doubt that if the Republicans hold the house a\nRemain a majority that a segment of the Democratic party and its media will be saying that the Russians were behind this or that the Russian ... you know tip the scale because they wanted to protect Trump so what do we then have a shadow over the presidency and over\nThe next Congress that's fairly serious and like my mine John and then that raises another question in my mind\nIf these people take this seriously what are they saying about American voters are on the ...\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model flood pays more than any dealer around because we're a certified buying center at will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nThe bedrock a representative democracy\nIs that the agency\nLies with voters that voters will make a rational a functional democratic decision and you live by their decision you would agree with that all that looked like the Oscars yet again with the premise\nThat go on from there to talk about institutions are representative government but you can't have institutions are representative government uh unless you get people to elect otherwise and some\nAuthoritarian systems have outwardly democratic parliament for example correct but they're essentially appointed and controlled it's called managed democracy but a real democracy and representative\nDemocracies the one we know are you need the voters but if the voters\nAre said to be as they are I mean he's Russia gate allegations forever\nSusceptible to a hundred thousand dollars worth of ads out of about forty billion ads bought or whatever it was a by some Russian wacko social media operation in St Petersburg and what does that single out to mark and people I mean we got to think this through at\nAbout other people you and I John where we lived our higher life inundated by advertising on television that we don't believe for him\nThat I mean I Know that if I buy that beautiful car it is not going to get me all those beautiful women that are leading a with a car I mean we had been raised to be intuitive skeptical\nOf the things that come to our attention I I think that's fair to say I mean advertising agencies try to manipulate us but we know what's going on so to say that the Russians are capable of relating American\nVoters you're saying something less about the Russians and about our own people but that is what these Russia gate allegations\nAre saying it is striking to me Steve remembering the election and just I was participating as a reporter and I was watching on Twitter I could tell when the Russians were on line because it was morning time in Petersburg so I Would often wish them very good morning in Russian\nAnd they would never respond because they didn't have a sense of humor they were working for money I understood that but it wasn't a threat it was kind of cheering\nThat they were so keen on trying to influence us with awkward statements like Tennessee for Trump you know that kinda thing right [laughter] it's really very persuasive very thank you very much picked a real hard date their work for the Republicans imagine ... so I I it never occurred to me that it would be\nIt would be concocted to be a threat to democracy it seemed it seemed kind of sweet of them that they want to get it that they that they wanted to get in on the process because they don't have anything comparable\nAnd Rick cause we talked about this I won't go into it but historically whatever meddling or interference the Russians did in to sixteen\nWas part of a long history of of all let let's turn to that just moments said press but about back meddling and there are elections where we'll check when we come back professor Stephen F ... new book is war with Russia question mark I'm John bachelor [noise]\n...

I mean it's preposterous that this guy if this broken soul down in Florida I\nDecided some were used for some reason to post a story about Syria what are they care about Syria we don't know yet what matters is as he got it out of the New York times Washington Post\nI I Want to ask it Shapes Our media and ... and when people walk up to me in the street and say Steve ... is ... I'm going to decide is putting gonna throw the house\nTo the Republicans the Democrats they aren't kidding and where did they get this they got up in the New York times of the Washington Post or they got it from cable TV which gets their segments from the New York times in the Washington Post that's why it\nMatters that's one of the actors the John ... says so you are kind of alternative source of news ... news analysis but you only got so many million viewers a we're a big country and a lot of people do believe this stuff not\nI Want to go to what is to be done with these allegations are one version of what has to be done is censorship how we see that underway right now in all directions because the social media sites are acting uh intermittently and\nAnd non transparently to censor or weed out Russian interference there are other things they're doing but where I'm concentrating on Russia right now Russian interference\nHow that actually affects the election I Can't tell you but I Do know it sets up the possibility that whoever loses on Tuesday is going to blame the Russians\nIt also sets up the possibility that there is never going to be a safe space for elections in America in perpetuity if this if this theme continuous tape our elections are always going to be vulnerable we can't shut the door fast enough\nAnd we have to find another way to go forward as the government which means distrust the mob trust the leadership that's where we're headed Steve trust the people who know best\nOr that's what worries me among other things and that's a theme and a a Bible all that whereas this leading up to me and you got to get the language right\nRussia gave has been an elite project yes and one of the things I Do in the book is I trace it back to the CIA and Brennan maybe even before to sixteen and the story to the extent that it's known\nI put in the book I don't claim to know at all because you never know everything that the intelligence services do that's why they're called intelligence services I guess but the problem here is is that they set into motion these narratives about what's going on\nPeople believe them they were coming to a moment as we now it's a week away we're one week away from the election\nAnd as you say are the losers are going to blame the Russians they will we've already had that in off year elections\nShow where how do we get our elections back now one thing we do you and I talked about it I won't go into it at great length that I heard something the other day that reminded me of it we did a broadcast maybe more than one on the long history of American meddling in Russian actions are Russian politics\nSure and I and I've lost six Nineteen Ninety six we throw money at it\nWhat we can start with Woodrow Wilson who sent troops to ride a bike ride Russian so I ... I mean it's a century long and we kind of gotten used to it but\nThe problem is we don't recognize as Russia gate phenomena is really is a rather modern day minor episode in his behavior somebody said the other day I'm not going to say who was because he's very famous uh I don't think he's a light ball but he's held a lot of really important positions\nHe said that we would that that he was in the Clinton and the uh\nUh the Clinton Administration and he remembers that at that time when Yeltsin was up for re election in Nineteen Ninety six right yeah and he was like seven percent in the polls so Washington mounted a big campaign to save your option but the one thing we didn't do this guy said is the main grievous against the outs\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator flood Lincoln if there were against it unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nChange that's absolutely not true it's a it's a matter of public record\nClinton got ... and an International Monetary fund loan I Can't remember if it was four billion or a billion dollars but it was specifically so Yeltsin could pay pensions and unpaid wages and that was raised\nBy bad and that was our critical and you'd establishments fact when we talked about potent if the threat of the pensioners said on that middle I'd make the Kremlin tremble\nIf we think about it and we think about our parents and our grandparents and the role of the Social Security is played I played in this country for for for decades and we think about how pensions today or a political subject in the United states and by the way in Russia to uh\nYou could almost I have to double negative you could not intervene more intimately in another country's\nPolitics than by intervening in the pensions you see what I'm getting a half yes I mean how intimate that is to the survival families and yet we did it now people might say well it was a good thing that Yeltsin won because of the communist would've\nCome back to power you could say that but to deny what we did to have amnesia about uh are very intimate intrusion and a Russian elections and then get all round up by a handful of Russian social media uh\nOh what a post in American electoral cycle seems to me to be stripped of all of\nHis ... at the we have very dangerous we have to turn to the other elections where the Kremlin is accused of bad acting I'm speaking with professor Stephen F ...

successful commercial rocket Bob what is wrong\nRocket lab is an American company which is mostly based in New Zealand um they were launched from New Zealand they have had to launch attempt to the second was successful they have a very small\nRocket called the electron rocket this is the focus is a company focused on launching small sets cube SATs making them its primary payloads and mayor of actual goal is to have a launch almost once a week if not more than that\nAnd ah this third launch is tentatively scheduled for November eleventh and they're they're touting that launch as their first commercial operational launch and they already had a bunch of uh a cube SATs satellites payloads signed up for that launch while the news here is they signed up\nAnother company to put two on satellites payloads on that launched so you're going to have those stupid these two satellites plus to all the communications satellites\nPlus an educational cube sad plus a drag sale technology demonstrator um and plus another uh what do you call it a optical satellite now that there's a law so it's a small satellite she's all small keeps that's on now is that even small of that and they're sending for November eleventh launch\nThis is that this is even though the calling operational there's still a test launch in a sense if that is successful they're going to follow up with another a launch in December and if that's successful I think it's pretty likely that come twenty Nineteen this company who can be launching almost weekly with keep sets it can be pretty exciting\nOut from their New Zealand London side or are they still talking about moving\n[noise] no they they they're not going to move\nThey talked to a week or so ago they announced that there are also going to launch in addition at some point out of wall of silence the mid ... a space sport that's in Virginia so what will happen eventually as they hope to be launching from both sites on a regular basis this means they can really get a lotta satellite allowed satellites off the ground to make some\nVery valuable as a settled for satellite companies\nNow the mother ship of commercial success pay tax uh

intending is it's going to put a lot of payload into orbit comparable to a Saturn five but that big goal with this rocket is it that we will be completely re usable\nThey thought they could maybe I'm a upgrade the falcon nine and the Falcon Heavy to be completely re usable because they don't use the upper stage but they've decided to be better this built from\nScratch with what they now know\nAnd the ... hours two stages of first stage which they know how to use that had to land that vertically the upper stages kind of like a ... a shuttle is using shuttle concepts\nAs it comes back in the atmosphere it uses its body like the shuttle did to shed speed so that can slow down enough to land but I'm like the shuttle it's not going to land on a runway they're going to use what they already know how to do and that's particularly land it\nAnd what they announced this week is that they're going to do the first top a test of the bill fat big falcon rockets upper stage it's out of their new space for facility in Boca she cut Texas that's near Brownsville near the tip of a Texas day they've been developing that space sport very slowly\nUh they've now made it clear that they're gonna use it for those protests these protests have similar when they were doing\nWhen they're developing the first stage capabilities of landing with the falcon one talking nine they were doing they were using

the Gaza Strip and claims that Israel was using rocketing from Gaza to justify attacks against the Palestinians\nAre and now we finally he Gillum training and the founder of dream defenders which boycotts Israel and he's claiming on the other and that he doesn't support the boycott of Israel and that he is pro Israel\nHis giving speeches and synagogues ... it'll be as one synagogue wearing a ... and talking about how much he loves Israel so a lot of questions about who is the real Andrew Gillum or is he the centrist or is he the founder which I found he is of this organization\nErin Erin how did you how did he how did this happen why wasn't he vetted why didn't he sanitize his background it does that I can explain this I mean I'm reading some of these statements from their mission he worked on his tail twenty Seventeen he didn't win the nomination till twenty Eighteen but gee they have some time here\nHe talks about community safety police brutality in prison abolition\nThey're

position because he's taking money from them and they're all this group that we're describing here is on the ground now and Florida are trying to get out the vote so I don't think he can\nJust sort of Alabama or even removed the activism given that he's not just too closely associated with them they formed the backbone of his\nCampaign and this is nonsense this is just nonsense and there are people in Florida who are Democrats who run newspapers are they reading this nonsense are how do they have an explanation for this I mean I wasn't getting him if he was a young person but he's not\nKnow the

Florida they care deeply about the corruption issue that's turning them off\nAnd then after corruption and the FBI issue is actually this is what I'm Talking about now which is dream defender so I think maybe he was relying on the media kind of shielding and in this cocoon of silence\nAnd it's it was happening in the beginning but now it's not actually I'm the mainstream media publications here

Gillum in the last few days suddenly the darling of the media he's actually dodging reporters for the first time in his candidacy\nAh the remarks about native tribes of their sovereignty ... it's more ... I won't read it but is there a radical faction of\nNative Americans that are working who are working for him I mean what is this not just this is this the rhetoric of the progressive that doesn't have any connection to reality\nYou know I don't know that it's for Native Americans I can tell you from being on the ground here in America by the way over this last year a and in New York I was actually in I'm In California the bay area just a few weeks ago and here in Florida\nI I've been with the young college age crowd and there is an element that truly believes in this stuff and I think that's originally it was targeting and now he's trying to balance that uh with the the the base here on the left in Israel which is in Florida which is more\nTo the center and and I do think\nThat that that's why this race is so defining if he ends up taking Florida with this radical background what that says about the Democratic party is very telling and also I I Know that\nSomebody like Kirsten Gillibrand a mainstream Democrat is going around with some of these same cast of characters and she's also associating herself with\nThis kind of ideology so it says a lot that the Democratic party as a whole\nIs now worry I think that's often the director him\nPretty much openly while the media is sort of ignoring it so let's see if he takes Florida and this is part of why I'm here and why I've been paying so careful attention to Florida to this particular race this is not just about today this is about the future I did write a crowded party\nAnd then also if Trump can carry Florida and twenty twenty\nAaron Klein of Breitbart Jerusalem I'm John bachelor this is the John bachelor show\nThe Russians have hacked our elections are infrastructure our government but the United states has master hackers to\nThe best one is in the eye cyber age who defies all notions of what a deadly violence\nIn by former intelligence agent Eric Anderson page turning knew from\nThe tables are turned in big power cyberwarfare\nEric ... new novel from done books by\nB.

war the Germans the British the Canadians the French and the Americans all use a weapon of mass destruction\nChemical warfare gas attacks against each other against their own troops how did that happen how does the Americans get involved in what we now understand is criminal behavior a new book how by our boys\nThe race for the world's deadliest weapons and the birds that the u._s. chemical warfare service C O M rejoined the oh a very good evening to you thank you John good to see the higher\nJobs not live from your book I I Walk through a cloud of gas but we have to transport ourselves to Nineteen sixteen America\nWhen the U.S is dealing with the possibility of entering into the first war and hasn't happened and Woodrow Wilson won't make the decision to declare war on Germany and Austria and till the spring of Nineteen Seventeen\nBy you take us to the creation of what will become the American the chemical weapons service and what they called it the time the gas score it starts in the winter of\n... a Nineteen sixteen and it starts in the hottest places the euro mines and a man named manning why why does manning take it up what is your opinion of gas warfare good evening to\nThank you thank you well a van manning is a fascinating character as you say a he was the director of the bureau of mine's a civilian was an agency within the department of interior\nAnd if the goal was set up to save lives in a U.S mine coal mines all around the country thousands of miners were dying and terrible accidents all over the country every year [noise]\nAnd if you're a ... mines was set up as a a life\nSaving agency or help prevent from any of those deaths that were happening I that also turned it into the only federal agency that had the scientific out west and the scientists know how\nTo be able to tackle the problem of gas warfare\nA waste of us are not in any way shape or form prepared for even though it had a gun in Nineteen sixteen and it's nice little sixteen went on and turn it in Nineteen Seventeen hear us vault man way now inevitable and yet it was very little preparation for chemical warfare\nOr leading up to or the U.S entry into the war

touring um us in the first war learning to use a weapon of\nMass destruction chemical weapons that they had called gas at the time and the race for the world's deadliest weapons includes a lot of false starts stock we've followed three major characters freezes now in France\nAnd the army and its fashion is going to put together what we would now call the gas service the American expeditionary forces landing in stages it will take up to a year to get up to a million men there but in the early days the U.S army to gather the thirtieth engineers the oh what's his tax [noise]\nWell uh that's the theory if engineers are there the full name with the thirtieth engineered gas in flames and this was essentially a gas regiment that was the Americans answer to or the German pioneer troops you use gas and the British equivalent of that was called the special brigade\n... engineers gas inflame was are going to be a recommendation going getting set to France to use chemical weapons against\nAh the German and initially it was going to be a relatively small group or a two companies at first and then expanded before and then six [noise]\nUm and it was a required a volunteers or and so I you know the starting in the around the fall of Nineteen Seventeen the army began I actively seeking recruits like when he adds the newspapers saying\nAre looking for people with experience in chemistry or things of that nature to lead a list in the in the new regimen to go to France\nAnd they were also selling gas warfare to the American public which was a not informed of the scale of the casualties for example CEO has a report to us about the scale\nOf what was happening at the ... for example in July of Seventeen to twenty thousand casualties wounded in action by the gas attacks by the German system real caught they\nThese noxious mustard gas is also Fox gene and they're still using claw a chlorine chlorine scene so while there were volunteers into the gas service at no point C O did I get the sense that the volunteers understood their risk and\nWhat would happen to them the rest of their lives [noise]\nIf it's not entirely clear to me to be honest with you I think it was a sense of 'em are kind of excitement to be on the part of the cutting edge effort and the way that it was hot sitting out in the craft with often are using terms like fighting fire with fire\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model what pays more than any dealer around because we're sort of by buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours more gone too far I car buyers on time\nTo be on a battlefield or with chemical weapons instead there was a little bit of a a kind of gee whiz uh a new kind of weapon um and and these soldiers were kind of pulled in by the attraction of being and this is cutting edge kind of weaponry without honestly like a real understanding of what that actually meant I think\nMeanwhile back at American University the first effort is defensive they want to develop a gas mask\nThat it's useful they can they can sell or provide to the British and the French remember for a long period of time\nThe U.S has been making a great deal of money on the first war before it gets involved but it's now in the war and they fail as their first gas mask which tells me that despite all the chemistry that they've gathered together they really do not understand the risks the oh\nI think that's true I mean there was also something else that they did not understand with it you know these are first few a man and they were all men who were brought into this effort to create the first gas mask these are scientists their academic\nOr they deal with a theoretical uh problems in question what they don't deal with something like industrial production and so\nWhat they did is they set out to ah create a kind of theoretical that gas mask without really understanding what it would mean to have to make millions and millions of them are in a very very fast paced\nAnd so these scientists really had these very inflated expectations and how quickly they could do this and how well they do it and the very first Mac it was created which was meant to be an American\nOr as distinct from the French a math and the British math\nUm where as you said they they were failures or they failed in a number of ways on and it was considered a great embarrassment for these soldiers who uh excuse me for the scientists who were at the top of their fields and some of the top research universities institutions around the country\nThey believe that it should be very easy and it turned out to be much much more difficult than they thought um and it took them a great deal longer to come up with the uh the first American math that could actually put in a mass production\nMeanwhile September of Seventeen there's a headline in the U.S papers following this story as if here we go to war us prepared for barbaric the ... on unquote\nWhat the army does is very carefully looked for who can manufacture gases and gas masks and he's seals reporting is exhaustive Dow Chemical gets involved of course old Barry electro chemical or not now ever falls no longer there American synthetic color company\nIn Stamford, Connecticut or they find a proving ground gunpowder neck in the ... and the Chesapeake ... uh Chesapeake Bay\nOr they are setting up a chemical production facilities across the east coast and into the mid west of the United states this is the war department spending money but the whole time the oh I got the sense\nAgain that they wanted an American stamp on their gases they didn't just want to imitate the British because if they did they would've just gone completely into mustard gas\nI that's true that's true I'm One of the uh features of the uh chemical weapons arms race was that essentially the Germans were always one step ahead um and so just when the British and the French had a created a gas mask that would a counter or the new with German\nGases they would unleash a new weapon and through the uh the the allies the British\nAnd the French and then eventually the American\nUh we're always one step behind the German the American you're right they wanted to they wanted to find a new weapon they wanted to find something that they could use a that the German and their allies did not have a that would be as much of a surprise for the German as the types of weapons that the Germans had been using on the hour\nOr so yes the ... immediately it as part of the enterprise at American University and it all the satellite labs all around the United states it was his effort underway to find new kinds of chemical weapons or that hadn't yet been used\nThey do find one that they eventually called Lewis site for the inventor in Illinois campus ... chemists who invented at a on American University Catholic university in Washington it will go to Cleveland to be produced and we'll follow that story when we come back because they're feeling their way through this we know now it's a horror\nBut they did not just as the Manhattan Project in the second war we know now they were creating the atomic weapons that are uh Har\nHowever the the creation of it required luck and determination and some bold moves by people who are outside the reach of the federal government the book is\nHeld fire boys the birth of the U. S. chemical war ... service in the race\nHow would you like motor trends twenty I keep track of the here for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty four and half the stuff that's for the best price anywhere from one hundred and Ninety nine dollars for four days\n\n[noise] or [noise]\nThat begins the mass murder that we know is the twentieth century it didn't happen here but it certainly was part of the American story and the New Yorker story and Steve tells that we'd go quickly to to a duo weight am Sunday July thirtieth\nNineteen sixteen suddenly in a place called black Tom which is on the waterfront south from Manhattan there's an explosion that sounds as if that approach is a small nuclear of banned it tears apart many box cars filled with dynamite who did it said\nWell we now we know now that it was a small group of German Savage tours a agent sent out a by the German government in Berlin\nTo blow up that blow sky high this a freight depot on the Jersey city waterfront known as black Tom decided which is today within liberty state park and there's a small plaque\nAbout a stark a marker there about it um the German this is before the U.S joins the war on the allied side which we didn't do until April Nineteen Seventy and this is December of Nineteen sixteen however by this point\nA New York our our mayor I should say American\nUh munitions manufactures merchants a Wall Street a finance ears like J.
