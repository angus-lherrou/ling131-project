of production we're right here actually in the garage that it's a lot nicer than that sounds as surrounded by\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explains it light up of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled Marjorie impeccable surface\nTeam at this old house now if you're not familiar with this area it's a very unique place with a lot of history Jamestown Rhode Island is a coastal town and says just across the Narragansett Bay from Newport which is home to many many famous mansions\nBut if you didn't happen to be named Vanderbilt door after or do you may have decided to build a more modest cottage right here in Jamestown and many of these houses date from the late Eighteen hundreds and early Nineteen hundreds when summer visitors built them to enjoy the ocean breeze isn't the Sandy beaches\nBut today many of those dwellings remain on insulated\nAnd since they were originally built just for the summer season there was really no need for installation back then and that's what brings us to this old house which was rebuilt to increase energy efficiency but keep the old charm now to kick things off I'm joined by this old house painting contractor Richard drifted we welcome Richard thanks so much\nSo Richard only say that the goal was to make this home energy efficient we're talking like insanely energy efficient here because the plan was to make this a net zero house so those are not familiar with net zero kind of explain that\nThere's a bunch of components to one is to make it insulated really well to make it incredibly tight and so we did that with our thirty walls in our forty ceilings and and we made it\nTight tight and then on top of it we we did another thing called aero barrier to make sure that we we control infiltration unbelievably I'll get back to the minute right so you got to make the place where they type\nThen you got to be able to make some electricity so we put Eighteen solar panels on this really designed garage which just as behind the building away so nobody sees it it's perfect dangle\nTelevision show this old house you can follow the progress on line at this old house dot com and catch the latest episode on your local PBS station and if all this talk of home remodeling has you thinking about your next project you can call in your home improvement question now to one eighty they money pit presented by home advisor dot com\nWell this project involve both Romagnoli number one hundred year old building in the building a brand new addition bringing those two together was the job or next guests Jeff swing are welcome just thank you\nNow you do a lot of building the Narragansett area and then we have a lot of summer houses here that we're probably never intended to be year round residents isn't here we are putting heating systems in them and air conditioning and\nAn insulation and trying to make it all work in this case you had even a tougher job because you had to make this net zero so that it basically\nEssentially made all the energy that it needed now to do that you need to rely on a lot of systems or one of which was the insulation still talk to me about the installation that made it possible here\nYou know as you said this was a summer cottage are designed a you know in the Nineteen twenties or so where you had some structural framing members that were only geared to support\nYou know could Ruth load itself right on now today's standards where the insulation in the energy codes we've got to make room for insulation or\nThey might say that he's not even enough\nSo we had to do a combination of insulated from the inside with super high officials stuff like\nClothes so a spray foam right then we also had to insulate on the exterior of the building so we added to the outside just as much as we added to the inside because we didn't have all room on the inside right now they advantage to the adding to the outside is that you create that thermal barrier\nAround the the framing members which are much more conductor than transfer heat also\nSo that was a critical part of this project now to the inside the finished I had a chance to walk through the house earlier just amazing carpentry in this job you guys that are really terrific uh works here with all the detail and the trims and she owns his own talk about\nUh well uh I give credit to the architect Don Powers who are really just thought about every space in the house and took advantage of\nHis expertise and the design world and and really created a masterful\nA depiction of of water cottage built in you know cozy atmosphere would be in a you know all we did was follow his lead and not and execute um but I I give credit to him he he took advantage of every single corner and the house\nAll the sounds are those are good partnership and unusual for you to have the architect is the home or you're killing his wife has resigned\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the only one night I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty four to one of the best for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars for only at Ford and he would\nUp to it it really\nTurned out to be a really mutual relationship you know we collaborated on a lot of things Don wasn't a so you know a male to thirty you know right we were able to exchange ideas and um they were right down the road so it eliminated a third party and the middle so it really ... really did work out well\nBut as you say communication really is key now the exterior of this home had a lot of work done landscape you get a landscape architect helping with that but ah you had to organize that part of the construction as well what was the challenge\nWhile the challenge was a it was a short period of time where we had to make a lot of things happen and we had three different porches which uh\nYou know cascaded down into the hearts tape\nAnd then we had a really extensive landscape plan you know it caught me by a little bit by surprise but when they started bringing the trees and the plants and\nI was amazed at how many plant things we ended up having and then they the landscape architect Tom Ryan did just a wonderful job that segment in different areas around the yard which are all\nMeaningful and well planned in a you know it it it came together\nWe can't wait to see it rollout Jeff swingers the builder on this project thanks so much for stopping by the money pit that was my pleasure you can follow along with all the progress here in Jamestown online at this old house dot com or on Twitter and Facebook hash tag tear wage

America's most popular home improvement show this old house and one of the guys\nWho's written part the fabric of this old house for over twenty five years is general contractor Tommy soda you just keep getting younger don't you\nTell yeah [laughter] well almost thirty five years there while five thirty six years to make yeah man it's amazing I hear and I'm Down in the first few years [laughter]\nWell you played hard to get I ... well maybe that's it that way will turn it down because I work for my dad we would just do my dad would he didn't want any part of the details anyway but now we're too busy to act on\nTV and stuff so I Want to talk with you I'm first about the fact that a lot of the construction here was pre fabricated and I think when people think pre fabric factory built they think well maybe it's not as good as what you could do my hand but that's not really the case here and and ... you write your circle you had two things that you did hear that were just fascinating to me\nThe foundation for her she said oh you can make everything in the house but you can't make the foundation\nNo no you guys actually got a foundation three hundred miles away and brought here they bring in ... well pre\nFoundation it's insulated it and it has a concrete reinforced steel reinforced studying it they're insulated so there's no thermal breaking that in that position and this does a pre drills\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one night I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty four to one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars for only a flood forward and he went into and there were against it\nWaterproof at the same time while and the building that we're in right now this is actually the garage that it probably the nicest girl jak you've ever seen right but this was factory billed as well as all the way this is a pre cut building well you put it together everything's caught\nOn a on a CNC so yeah so you know what's going to fit exactly right you put the puzzle together and you've got a beautiful barn that looks like it was built on site\nNow the challenge on this property was building at the net zero which means that basically has to be so tight so well insulated and uh so perfectly heated ... essentially makes all the energy needs to operate that involved a lot of different types of insulation or want to ask you about that because I I think it's unusual to see spray foam used to different types of Springfield open\nAnd close close though and then you had solar laws we own law rock well insulated in which ah actually I Love that isolation I mean I think of it it's it's basically rock right into a fire molten rock radio and and\nAnd you it's a great installation for found dead need for insulation and its water resistant well you know if it gets wet it's going to dry out\nNow you guys use a technique called warmer blanket on the exterior walls what does that mean well\nThat's the way you take the insulation the disown will actually right now are you can also use rigid phone\nAnd you apply it to the exterior surface of the building so you framed the building in this case we had the old building we had to deal with the conventional walls right those was ... on the outside of the sheeting you have to put a thermal barrier\nBecause you have to worry about the thermal bridging of the structure when it when it meets that different installations so in other words it could be some transfer of different temperature\nFrom the actual study ... and so you got to worry about condensation forming on the inside of the outside insulation is that makes sense though does enter the sandwich right so in other words you're putting something like\nA um it's it's ... like a house wrap that you put on before you put your installation on is like a range screens you know of any any condensation should occur in between that installation it will run down and not damaged she\nEmbodies especially it has to be completely storm only separated ... yeah yeah it's almost like when you're building sounded the buildings you put separate walls and never touch the same idea here which are firmly separating everything's in good shape than inflation ... exactly right yeah that's the trick\nNow you also had to install the solar right which is on this building and you also have a beautiful wouldn't shingle roof here now which single roof ... is there not done right and I've seen an awful lot of them to know you have to their ... like crazy\nSay rye fast if they're not you you have to ... you have to think of that ... uh which single today is not like a witch jingle was say fifty two hundred years ago
