so this is the John ... welcome Daniel ... deputy editor of the wall Street Journal's editorial page my colleague just speak I'm\nKevin I'm Dan writes wonderland for the wall Street Journal editorial

how to hold the final vote some time in these next hours Saturday is the target\nFor landing there has been a preliminary vote indicating that the Republican majority has fifty one votes which is a victory for the Republican nomination\nOf judge Brett Kavanaugh up to the Supreme Court then a very good evening to you the last days have been exhausting for those of us who are anxious that this election of twenty sixteen will never end\nYour column points to a couple of things that I had not seen ...\nEx located so I Want to feature them the first one that grabs me and it bothered me the whole time Dan is that there's something of the anti clerical voice in the opposition to judge Kavanaugh as if there is wrong with being a very well educated young Catholic man\nWho goes to adjust to a school and conduct himself well in the world it's a puzzle to me Dan how do you hear it you because you noted in your column in in one of the penultimate paragraphs but you didn't expand on that good evening to\nEither John while I was referring to the um the relentless references to a judge Kavanaugh attending\nGeorgetown Prep a and the idea of being conveyed implicitly in some cases more directly and articles and places like the Washington Post was the Georgetown Prep in suburban Washington in Maryland suburbs was a breeding ground in the Nineteen eighties\nFor ah abusers of women I thought it was a just a school for rich kids who got drunk and went out on the weekend and uh that did this sort of thing a Georgetown Prep in fact is an all\nBoys Jesuit high school it was founded in Seventeen eighty nine by archbishop John Carroll at the same time he was\nFounding Georgetown University the nation's oldest Catholic university\nIn Georgetown Prep is one of\nMany ... such Joseph what high schools across the country who are in fact uh give young man a an extraordinarily strong education rooted in Catholic ideas and uh just what principles and uh Neil Gorsuch for instance\nWhat

leader of murder and mayhem on Capitol Hill Capitol Hill is\nJust seen all kinds of turmoil these days so let's go to the news that affects the rest of us in the United states you know the three hundred million plus who have jobs and are looking forward to paying the bills and also sending our children to college and\nMaking the wedding happy Jemma very good evening to you the Commerce Department and the Labor Department reported in these last days lots of news that all looks positive to me but I'm a consumer of news and you are a newsman so\nThe jobless rate fell to a three point seven percent according to the Labor Department which is the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine I think that's Richard Nixon I was a young person in Nineteen sixty nine I had no idea we had it so good employers added a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs to payrolls\nI'm following Eric morass inherit tore and the wall Street Journal which\nIs a Ninety six straight month gain wages rose to point eight percent from a year old earlier solid if a if still an spectacular rise the quote from the chief economist at glass door this is the best job market in a generation or more\nMr McCray you are cautious to the point of being a bear is is good news for main street good evening to\nHi John yeah it's terrific news for main street it's not great news for Wall Street and all explain that\nBut in terms of the street or we saw in ... in all the good sectors we sold job gains and the high paying energy sector we saw job gains and the hype in construction sector we saw John gains in the high paying manufacturing sector\nOr where we did not where we purportedly so our says was in retail and they are phantom losses a corresponding Hurricane Florence a\nYear over year retail has actually added ... new jobs and there are\nA this is a positive sign a that are close to eight hundred and fifty thousand job openings in retail which is a record and the reason that's positive that is a retail jobs is a the next step up from slavery except if you're now at Amazon and getting Fifteen dollars an hour\nBut at the end most retail outlets or you're working at slave wages and people are just turning their nose up at their jobs because those jobs because they can that's a great a sign for the economy\nWe have some numbers here a gym that I Want to help you help me interpret I was always told that four percent was the lowest we could go but they're not projecting that we're going to get to three point five percent next year and and I mean this is hard to believe\nThat we'll have this uh at at remained below four percent through twenty Twenty one are we out of people I is this the robots what's doing this I didn't think this was possible ever and what we've got it for two years\nAh you know what it turns out the birth control pill wasn't such a great idea yeah we are short of people uh immigration reform a is really\nA front it should be a front burner issue and it isn't a you know you're here in my community I live in Alexandria, Virginia ah the public buses and not only do they flash the destination on their signs they have a one ad\nOr are they desperately need us drivers man you know your list or see it\nEverywhere help wanted signs everywhere there is a shortage of manpower\nIn the U.S and a lot of it is to turn the crackdown on illegal immigrants\nAnd stricter border controls now I'm not saying that's a bad thing but we need reform so that we can get a workers in another country ASAP\nWorkers for all levels of jobs but let's pay attention now to the part of the job the part of the jobs that Dr ... the high paying jobs where the wages go up is that what explains the two point eight percent remember we complained for years\nThat the wages were not moving they are moving now although we were not according to the wall Street Journal to associate the word spectacular with movement but they're still moving is is because people are bidding higher for their employees that what's doing this\n... yes is throughout the economy I mean you can see the stories in the paper about the facts\nWhat's your Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they're all in for Steve we own condition at what they need that you know I guess that's right over two hundred three on cars all may call models at incredible prices are going to flood auto dot com now\nSo I think you're seeing more companies offer some benefits to attract workers in many cases benefits outweigh\nThe pay increase them so that you know that two percent might seem low but but\nThere's something else going on and it's a I think it's a a an employee ease market right now\nIn other words the uh the employer has the employee has the upper hand\nThat would explain the Amazon although that I thought that was very shrewd on their part because it forces the competition to match them it's a it's a good headline I Want to look at why it is the Federal Reserve thinks the economy's going to continue so well off aren't they in charge of the money supply\nThe Federal Reserve is a saying that there's no recession insight and one could show up we could have a set back with a catastrophe like an asteroid and they are going to continue to raising rates and yet the market is ignoring it so let's go from Maine straight to Wall Street Wall Street's delighted with this gym\n[noise] it is but it's not necessarily good for the stock market it could be good for investors because what's happening is you know we talked about this in the past or the stock market was up in large part because it was being subsidized by the Federal Reserve\nThe Federal Reserve was keeping interest rates so low that the only game in town if you were looking for a positive return was stocks which which is really outside the risk profile of a lot of older Americans but our interest rates are\nOn the increase so you're going to the money coming out of the stock market and going into bonds and certificates of deposits\nWhich are offering a good return\nSo the stock market will pull back or you know a we'll have some sort of a correction maybe it'll last six months or so or I'm not saying we're having this correction now but we will as money comes out and goes elsewhere but as the money goes in the CDs\nIt gives the uh uh it's it increases our ... our savings so in the long run it means that banks will be able to offer credit\nAt a lower rate to industry so we'll have this transitional period where there'll be a ... an hour to an audience stocks but for the long run it's it's very good for the economy\nThe trade story we are at odds with China they're not talking about the deal is in place for\nWhat used to be called NAFTA now us M. C. A. the Europeans are looking for conversations bilateral deals our economy's doing extremely well four percent plus the last quarter and protections that same for this quarter\nEuropeans not so much Chinese negative Japan is even a little sluggish so is the trade story hurting us or is this why is this why we're booming and they're not\nThe ... story will hurt us going forward because really you know we're at China is has been waging a and underhanded war against the U.S economy we are just waking up to that Bloomberg kind of wonderful report this week with on how Chinese computer companies were putting ... chips in or\nYeah I saw that the dog that just just blatant piracy on their part caught yes\nYes so I mean I think this trade war with China is a long term if they are because of our national security and I think our manufacturers will be shifting to other countries are like Cambodia believe it or not and Vietnam a China's going to be hurt in the long run\nBecause of the militancy or the United states at some point we're all going to be playing it taking more money for things we take for granted to being cheap like sneakers and T shirts and that kinda stuff\nUh but I think Americans or whether they love ... a Trump or hate him will rally around the flag on this issue because again it's national security or the Chinese are trying to hurt us they're they're shipping illegal opioids into the country either you know they're they're stealing our our stuff\nI'm so a short term pain maybe in two thousand Ninety two thousand twenty or long term it's a good for the U.S economy\nJim McKay he's the author of the new book follow the leader murder and mayhem on Capitol Hill that's easy to imagine I'm John bachelor this is the John ...

artificial intelligence and those big investments also come with big vision statements that\nThey're able to tie different aspects of the country together in to meet the commercial sector that the government to beg you know has a primary influence over there's also a the military et cetera so uh one of the things that he's\nSuggesting brown and suggesting is that uh maybe it's time for the United states to begin to match from a government funding perspective some\nOf this research and development that we see coming out of China and also maybe to develop some of its own big vision statements its own Manhattan projects\nA toward some of these areas hyper sonics we are investing more in hyper sonics but it's a it's been an effort in fits and starts and and the Chinese are\nSurging very quickly to a head in some key areas artificial intelligence and we are standing up by the Pentagon is standing up a a new\nCenter for artificial intelligence research but that's military specific and we can bring in a commercial entities that also have their uses out of that and when you signed up to meet those needs you're going to have more success in in a few other areas and he also it was it was actually sort of interesting uh even though\nYou know uh it's it's now the Trump there he actually a structure very on Trump Ian chord are talking about how uh the most

away even though the defense department is now loose again because of the budgeting GI you things that wants more and in addition the controversy over remark that he makes and I agree with him immigration how does it work for and what does he want\nRight now and this is also a something that\nRight now you see a big\nA sort of pitch battle happening within the executive branch and and really across government where you have a\nYou know within the executive branch voices like Stephen Miller that are looking to curb a not not only to deport undocumented immigrants by the hundreds of thousands but also to curb the amount of legal immigration that can take place and browns point as a you know this\nEconomy ah works great and it it serves the national security purpose when it

competitive against a peer competitors like Russia or China because we have an attractive place not only to come and study but also potentially to start to make money and to really tie into the system\nAh so the one of the best things that he advocates that the country as a whole and again it's not actually geared entirely towards the defense department it's really a holistic look at you know how to begin this competition\nOut one of the things he suggests is making it easier for folks to come to study it and and to stay or if they're these you know folks were especially working in

the\nNew cover pieces sky and telescope magazine which you if you follow magazines about the astronomy this is the ... he's the author of the alchemy of having searching for meaning of the Milky Way can I follow your reporting\nThis is a James people's Princeton University he ... he ... he reports to you from the point of view of a cosmologist the enigma is how few stars there are in this boy are there's speculation as to why that happened do we have theories care\nWell the question is are there in fact additional galaxies in the local voice that we don't know about and the answer is we don't because no one knows the answer to that but perhaps amateur astronomers may supply that answer\nLet me explain the problem that the local void maybe protesting now as I mentioned earlier as the universe expands you do expect that the under dense regions are going to get more and more under dead\nAnd so the voids are perfectly compatible with standard cosmology and theory predicts that a void should have about ten percent doesn't mean density of the universe\nBut in fact when we look at the galaxies that we know of in the local boy and calculate what is their number relative to the being in the universe it's only about one percent so there is a factor of ten shortfall\nThe local law and that leads to the question will where all the galaxies and where are their start\nIs it possible that there are galaxies in the local boy that we don't know about and the answer is a definite maybe and it's that amateur astronomers working at very dark site very far from city lights\nWith good telescope could perhaps discovered new galaxies in the local law\nSimply because the nearest ... fairly nearby so there's a potential here for astronomers especially amateur astronomers to make discoveries that would help cosmologist reconcile theory with observation now on the other hand there are other people who\nSay well this problem actually isn't that much of a problem because in a boy you expect\nThat the material\nMay not have been able to create star so that in other words the matter is still there you still have this ten percent\nMattered to the of the universe in avoiding including and local boy\nBut it just hasn't been able to convert itself into stars and so that's the reason we don't see these galaxies so you might have you know very dark galaxies out there that consists basically of dark matter and maybe a little bit of\nGas but no start so the reason we haven't discovered those galaxies is simply because they you know radiation\nSo right now it's a it's a mystery it's a question\n[noise] what auto group once your car any make any model what more than any dealer around because we're a sort of by buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours more gone too far I car buyers are Tom\nAnd the questions that you just ... potatoes about where are all the stars this is something that's been going on for Twenty years Thirty years how how recent\nWell the local boy was discovered by Britain totally and\nRichard Fisher in Nineteen eighty seven they they were measuring distances of nearby galaxies which he used to be a much more difficult thing that is today you know the very large telescopes we have today and it you know you can measure distances quite easily to take that back then it was a struggle you had to do each galaxy individually\nAnd they published an outlet in Nineteen eighty seven and a rent totally notice hey there's a whole sector of the sky that basically empty of galaxies and that was the discovery\nOf the local boy back in Nineteen eighty seven so we've known about the local void since then and even before that we knew about other voice in the universe so it's not a surprise instance that there is you're given a that the universe is full of\nClusters of super clusters and voice it's not surprising that there is a boy that is the very nearest one and that is simply the local forward as far as the shortfall of galaxies in the local boy\nThat is a paper that was published Twenty one by James peoples and that's when that problem which a cult avoid phenomena started to be known to astronomers so\nThe the discovery of the local avoid goes back about Thirty years but the the problem of the shortfall of galaxies in the local Floyd is a is it more recent\nProblems and you are and your formula of how quickly we're moving is that a new discovery these forces that are compelling us that are pushing it pushing and pulling us it's six hundred and thirty kilometers per second is that fresh\nThe actual number there goes back many decades but the explanation as part of the local boys\nAre really goes back to a very important paper that appeared about ten years ago and twenty eight a lead off it was ... totally at the University of Hawaii and his team showed that you need the local boy in addition to these galaxy clusters to explain our full Moshe\nThrough the universe I'm now I should say that there are some galaxies known in the local the local void and the two near a story about twenty five million light years from earth\nThey're dwarfed irregular Cal seizing see pictures of them in the sky telescope article and there is surprisingly normal you know despite their very bizarre environment to their rather similar to pour for regular galaxies in the local group so that message seems\nTo be that even if you live in a in a void you can be a fairly normal how are they moving towards us her we gathering the men\n[noise] yes yes and in fact a yes vote the local boy does basically trying to fix these galaxies or another way to look at it is the galaxies in the local sheets\nAre gravitational pull is called I'm pulling of them toward us so that yes they are fleeing the local boy didn't if we could wait a few billion years\nIt's entirely possible there'll be part of the local sheet or at least much closer to it\nThey are now but in terms of you know forming stars are having no problem making new stars they've got gas which is the raw material for making the stars and so they seem to resemble fairly normal gal says but as you say they are indeed fleeing the local boy\nDoctor can cross while the article is the uh the ... says sky telescope the local boy the boy next door ducks come across well as the author of the lives of stars I'm John bachelor the outcome of

solid or data or a reader so Sean is using doing surveys of the\nOuter solar system to try to see if they can locate an additional planet\nI'm doing that they discovered and extremely distant object they think it's about two hundred miles in diameter that's orbiting the sun from six billion to two hundred and Thirteen billion miles that's how\nDistant it's all it is its closest approach is six billion miles which is about the distance of Pluto but it can go out to six hundred to two hundred and Thirteen billion miles which puts it out to the you know or the cloud which just means this is maybe the first\nReal evidence of an cloud existence that you know that actually is orbiting in that distance I'm\nBased extrapolating the three objects we presently no that exists out there in these far distances that scientists have extrapolated that that could be as many as two million objects bigger than twenty five miles in diameter out there\nAnd to put it mildly there's a lot of uncertainty in that extra Appalachian but nonetheless they found the third they call it got the ... and they nicknamed at that because it's so far away it's getting\nVery Bob Bob just this disrupt the search for planet X. or the speculated large body that has just ... the court rebels and perhaps even the inner planets over these last tens of thousands of ... according\nTo the scientists no in fact they say it's presidents\nFits the president models that say there's a large body out there um but I haven't found the large body and uh you know you're looking you'd think you'd find the bigger object first try 'em but they have it so it doesn't prove or disprove anything and I think that the models and the daddy here is so uncertain\nAnything they say is waiving hands and shouldn't be taken very seriously\nNow a moment to enjoy ourselves there was an article in the wall Street Journal these last days\nWritten by young woman I Know Mr smelter and it turns on a papers that are submitted to journals academic journals I Do not know about academic journals I read nature and science that are not academic really their professional magazine\nIt turns out that peer reviewed magazines or being a are publishing articles so bizarre and so disconnected from my experience not specialized language but weird interpretations of human behavior\nThat it was possible for three academics or two men and women a woman to submit papers based on complete nonsense kept them accepted and published online I guess some of them in magazine form and the question here Bob is\nJust this connect to all of the peer reviewed magazines or is this just in the social sciences where they're moving around adverse\n[noise] I I personally think this applies to the entire academic community which in many ways is becoming increasingly bankrupt we've talked about the corruption in the climate field which is hard science but it's so hard anymore that vicious\nPoisoning the entire academic community this is not a new story what these academics did these three academics as they were very disturbed by the by the what they call ... of a lot of these ethnic\nA woman is a feminist um A L v y forgive gender or ethnic uh departments\nAnd the journals set a publishing academic house just like nature and science and those are not professional those academic journals as well that peer review and they were disturbed by the lack of rigor and the science so excited to get together and they\nThey they created twenty fake papers they sent out they said they could have done a lot more but they had to end this finally seven got accepted\nSeveral whoa what pending rewrites we're probably been accepted with time they expected they could have gotten half these fake papers accepted and the subjects that sometimes absurd one of the most absurd absurd one was uh\nUh they fix it they wrote up a paper is talking about how dog parks are an example of rape culture\nThat dogs in dog parks getting humped\nOil that was just nonsense Bob and it was obvious that was nonsense it's obvious the moment you say it it was obvious to everybody you read it in the wall Street Journal and I wish they had to\nThis journal they published it and they gave it an award for a great example of good research in\nHow would you like motor trench twenty or gene truck to be here for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty four to one fifty best drug for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars for only a port board and he went into ...\nAnd the fat studies I I thought science studies was to send it fooled me I I I I'm In fact we could found journals right now that might get accepted you know the right for example are excellent moon colonies we could we could put up a journal like that and probably get papers\nAnd the thing that you could actually be more real their knees or ethnics gender feminist or a woman\nMuch is this is what is right it's a whole is in ... is is also in the academic community there is bankrupt off ...\nOff I care about hard science is I don't care about this ostracized for social scientists do you measure that this is going on in the hard science is that basically leaking\nInto the hearts of science as a poison is I've reported on behind the black several times about how the same thinking a feminist feminist glaciers glaciers or sometimes feminist or how engineering\nShould know you're making it a make or gender appliance air are known for a minute why Charles patron ...\nYou've got to back off on this or are no feminist glaciers that's just send up right\nNow there was an actual paper that argued that\nAnd and it was published in one of these journals and there have been a a journal articles similarly stating that uh uh engineering and math can't have a feminist aspect and it is oppressive the modern mess that we have and physics\nWe have to do the hard science is ... do the hard science has published these are these in the social science max\nHe's written a social science but here's the problem a lot of the thinking in this and this is what these academics or by the way that the flies left wing these three academics\nRight and they also I say that they don't believe they'll get jobs again or they think there'll be punished for doing yes\nMore important they say they think it's poisoning the entire academic community because it's teaching people fall for knowledge what they call soft history and it's not real knowledge it's not real search for truth\nAnd its poisonous and I made a big problem with this is that this is not a new story Allen so called did exactly the same thing the sociology a journalist sociology general in Nineteen Ninety six\nEveryone said oh my God this stuff is junk we
