and Mexico and Canada the U.S MCI along with Japan are looking to speak with one voice to correct or to urge China to correct\nIt's a in correct trading practices\nOf these last year's violations WTO does China anticipating one voice with it from its trading partners at this moment Andrew good morning to\nA good even tried um no I mean I think a couple of I was dreaming a there's it's very unlikely that you're close to the United states and Mexico will be a whole page on this\nYear at pools are desperate for growth and they don't want to offend China and uh because they have a lot of businesses that operate ... quite a bit of money from China\nSo I expect very liberal agreement between those three parties on this and the Chinese are are\nI think are going on that because they know that the Europeans are kind of split with the Americans right now both politically and economically\nAndrew I'm what is the state of the Chinese economy today I mean especially after the September numbers is it a better than people say or where do you see it going\nWell in the number so far that exports were up fairly helpfully reports were up uh I have the August numbers with Trump twenty percent which is pretty good showing 'em so there's a bit of we will be export powerhouse area of qualities do hopping from the south with it what's it called for twenty percent of exports\nAnd they're starting to see a bit of a recession so we may be fooled the digital files but so far the economy's been how holding up the ... well and\nIs that because of trade friction or is it just some other factor\nOh I'm pretty sure that they we can go out and do this because of trade friction or the data inconclusive at this point but given that they have a lot of small businesses export uh different kinds of caught and good than other countries that states I'm shirts trade related\nAnd one other question on on just the technical aspects of this it took me a little bit by surprise but I saw that China's going to borrow three billion dollars why are they doing that\nWell because it basically investors in the west to that a Chinese government that is perfectly sell to us because they have a large a trade surplus they have a three trillion dollars of overseas and foreign exchange and they have not defaulted on any national\nBlood legion is southern Rhode Island's premier luxury

Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of never against it unparalleled luxury impeccable there's\nA lot of extensive capital and domestically there's a huge amount of debt so they're looking to try to extend that into a new source of the capital overseas it's it's a reasonable strategy\nThe puzzle China is looking for a negotiation with the United states or not the U.S is looking for a negotiation with China or not are they in a waiting game Andrew and how long the wait how long before things deteriorate\nI think the Chinese have more or less given up because of the Trump Administration is it's I don't think it's really interested in a settlement there's actually asking the Chinese to change the entire basis of their economy\nWhich the Chinese are are unable to do\nIt would be one thing if the Trump Administration said okay look you've got a few stolen some of our technology or in certain cases you're steel mills are being supported by the government\nEither an area that we think you should focus on instead the Trump Baby a couple of the others make very broad brush statements and the Chinese are thick are starting to get to the point where they're washing the hands of the whole thing of figure it took a political football\nSo if they wash their hands what is the timeline does anybody advance a timeline ... spring Nineteen spring twenty how long\nI think this is going to go to go on for a number of years because the Trump Administration as I said it's not going to alter its behavior so far we've not seen that\nAnd the Chinese themselves have figured that um so they're going to try to deal with their own domestic economic problems in terms of slowing growth the only thing that I think it help is just a lot of small businesses in America stopped a start going on or having large unemployment and putting pressure on Trump's base we haven't seen that yet though\nSo Andrew in Hong Kong what is the mood about the Chinese economy long term I'm I get the sense that people are pretty optimistic but where do you see it\nThey are pretty optimistic because so far the crash that all people have been predicting happened\nOr the economy is definitely slowing a but we're not seeing massive defaults we are seeing an increase in default and corporations and small lenders but not massive default\nAnd the leadership is titled script over the riskier banks in the system so so far it's been a kind of a of a gradual decline but no collapsed and then you got that booming tech sector with the huge\nA bike do ten cent um and other ... about the Amazon of China that are doing very well and doing very well for western investors so that's a a an OK picture\nAnd I get I gather the central bank is basically decided to um ease up a little bit on the money supply basically make a little bit more ... and that has been able to get the country's true right\nThat's exactly it they basically after tighten credit for awhile and shutting down some of the risky fast\nThey now start are starting to open the spigot again and they're hoping to fuel growth in small businesses that have a lot of employees to keep employment up\nUnfortunately it looks like a lot of the credit just going to go to the state firms that are the most inefficient so this is really not good for China's long term a structural growth but it's just the way the Chinese system operates\nA we have about a

Baines Johnson and the end of the Vietnam War conflict as we understood it altogether but roe v Wade is still with us where the others are history books built a very good evening to you present the case\nThat the odd assaults on judge Kavanaugh's character\nHave their origin in the doubts about roe v Wade who doubt to build good evening to\nLeaving a well as you know I'm the champions of the

ending all the state laws and fifty states I'm On abortion that that is a singular president precedent that is fixed and sacred and it's a bad decision even pro choice\nI'm curious recognize how bad it was frankly the Supreme Court recognized how bad it wasn't Planned Parenthood versus Casey when they basically gutted the ruling but kept the outcome so I think what happens is that the the champions of roe no how brittle that laws and they know that\nA serious jurist\nGive it it is a hard look I'm might find it very vulnerable so whenever they think there's the fifth vote that could affect row they thought that with Robert bark they thought it with uh Clarence Thomas remember at the time they thought Kennedy might be an anti rowboat to be for Planned Parenthood versus Casey\nAnd they think with Brett Kavanaugh even though it's not clear to me you know how Brecht would vote since he's talked about it is a precedent that's been reaffirmed is a precedent so\nBut that's they're

anything to coalesce around\nUh in in just a ... in his mid ... they do now and it's not around Trump which I think is a very important things that they're coming together and they are energized\nOver what they believe is and I I like the tale this and the great revolt is is um that that culture meaning the big political parties the big political system along with the media and along with pop culture\nPopular culture um are sort of against them and don't understand them and with 'em and and that is the case with Kavanaugh they believe that has been heavy handed against him and they projected that on to themself\nDoes that mean turnout your models are are are going to change for foreign against you see this exciting turnout in Texas or Missouri in North Dakota as well for both sides Selena\nWill vote Republican Democrat Charlie ... or just to show our over already AT T right well we were looking to see was what is the this populous coalition was going to do it to be energized to come out um\nAnd um for the nit turns ... this has done it um you know now are independents are always sort of where we're not sure where they are but you're both parties are at equal levels and because so many Democrats that are up\nFor reelection in red states that puts them at the disadvantage to not only will um is Texas and and the story right for Republican either hold and or pick up but I've seen movement in Florida\nAnd Indiana and uh I I I think North Dakota is gone and and I keep an eye on Montana so ... this is a\nA game changing moment I mean I I you know I feel bad for what they have in our family as it has gone through but it has been the best thing for\nThe Republicans a ... in the ... in the final weeks of the midterm\nLaura good evening few political science here I Am I'm On aware helped me teach me is there a political science version of what we've spoken about it but the house these last years months that are following a close election the advantages to the party out of power does that work in the Senate as well Laura good evening she\nGood evening John thanks for having me on yes it does\nWhat we can in southern Rhode Island from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit wider of Lincoln Lincoln Lincoln MTV I mean all new twenty or do Lincoln Navigator was willing to give its own parallel Marjorie impractical\nParty does do better and much of that has to do with some of what we're dealing with this time around and that is the class of senators who are up and which party is sort of more on the defensive to begin with as we know in this election\nThe Democrats are incumbents and a number of states that the Republicans won handily in twenty sixteen and so they're already was a sort of Senate lean toward the Republicans\nWave elections all\nSeats both in the house and Senate tend to fall in one direction and that's where you saw what Selena was just talking about that\nYou know a few weeks ago people were saying well you know maybe the Senate could in fact um do a little bit better than the Democrats than people are thinking maybe Beto O'Rourke is really in a good place um because those sort of wave numbers were starting to be there\n... absolutely right that the Kavanaugh hearings have energize the Republican base but the one I'm cautionary note I Would say is that I'm not certain that\nIn our world today that energy and enthusiasm will stay there for another five weeks in other words it is very possible to me\nThat um Kavanaugh\nEnded up getting confirmed at the end of this week and that by next week you see Republicans um and the enthusiasm that they have this week\nSomewhat more complacent about well we got it it's done the war's been one and you start to then see the Democrats even more upset and enraged\nBy the fact that Kavanaugh's nomination went through so I'm not sure where we're going to be a couple of weeks from now\nI also think it's important to realize that when we do look at the polling um there is essentially a reality that\nMore independence both men and women I Believe a Dr Ford than believe a judge Kavanaugh is also true that um that when you look at just\nWomen independence um the belief around Ford's testimony over Kavanaugh's was fifty six percent to twenty four percent so\nYou know there is going to be a very interesting shakeout of who are we talking about as the swing voters because white women college educated\nUm Republicans may not stay with I'm sort of the Republicans in Kavanaugh and they may in fact I'm uphold more affords testimony\nOr detail here we just have a thirty seconds or so for both of you of the house is a is a is in a trajectory to go to the Democrats and the next week says the term all going to affect us Leno just about Fifteen seconds do you see the turmoil\nAlso bumping the house or is that on a glide path to land\nYou know and I see at the Republican or Democrat skating at least seven at this moment um all the way up to thirty five I think at the end of the day were and where are the prize either side in the majority\nLara or do you have the turmoil here that you just noted you know next week will be a new new scandal is the out is the house settling into concrete what are these metaphors you you like in Washington so the ... is a case to bake I think that's what I like best or is it still play\nI don't know that the cake is yet baked but I Do believe that\nJust as Selina was saying this cabinet hearing I'm kind of woke up a lot of President Trump's base especially those um blue collar workers I think it is also true that ...\nIt has distanced more college educated suburban women and that will matter in the house races\nLara Brown of George Washington University in Salina details Washington

somebody found the student loan or have you with a good argument you could follow the good argument now on the ... you have to follow the bad argument even if you think it's wrong and so you see case after case doing this and Gorsuch\nAnd cabinet that started with essentially with the following very simple proposition as a constitutional matter let alone that statutory matter\nYou're looking at the situation and you know courts is supposed to decide questions of wall and executive branches are not supposed to do that and so we think that this offends the basic principle of separation of powers\nThe point is sufficiently strong\nThat even if they decided to change the text of the administrative procedure act which has been constant since Nineteen forty six they would say you could not do it so the stakes are very high on this particular question\nAnd I think that the Gorsuch cabinet position is correct about long held that particular view but it used to be a voice crying in the wilderness and now it turns out that we're getting closer to the point where this doctrine may be toppled\n... Richard I want I Want to use an example here and see if I understand is I'll let you have to clean Air Act a which allowed the EPA to interpret the law claiming this was ambiguous and therefore here's our ruling you said that it permitted the EPA to say that if you have a piece of equipment and you want to upgrade it\nThat is permitted if the amount of pollution doesn't change that's what that's what the ruling yet in this instance however\nThe question is what's a piece of equipment rice and you know there's a bit of a philosophical puzzle here it's this half the heat the heat is a part of a piece of equipment a piece of equipment\nAnd his factory something you can upgrade without having to ask for new permits and go through the process of the\nDemocratic rule no the moment you decided to shift the amount of emissions from one smokestack to another you have to start over this could be years\nAnd and that is that's partisanship of the uh the chef ... and it would change from administrative ... that's exactly what was feared and it and it happens\nIt happens in this particular case\nAnd my view about it is that the stability of expectations that you want out of law means that you should have judges decide these things and if they're going to build a rule is going to be by an act of Congress or in some cases where the agency may do so they could change the administrative\nRule in one form or another but it is generally understood when you start to change these rules on an ad hoc basis or the retroactive application is suspect\nPolitically there's a lot of resistance and at least before the recent ... um it was generally thought that um are there would be legal problems I should put Chevron in context because at the same time that the courts with dealing with Chevron what we did is we had a number of cases involving a question\nOf whether or not when the government made a deal with people you joined this particular pension fund and if you don't think that we're doing things correctly you can pull out without recrimination the argument was that you know\nThat when a government agency says something it is perfectly foreseeable that they will not can\nKeep their work so when you make your decision you have to assume that these guys may well be acting in bad faith and so long as it's the ... are you are bound by the change in decision now the whole principle of the rule of law as we know that government officials can act in bad faith and so the reason we\nProtect ourselves against retroactive changes with massive wealth consequences is to make sure that they don't the fact that it's ... that this thing will happen if you let them go is the strongest reasons to saying you will never let them go so this is in the middle of the Reagan Administration\nAnd what happens is it turns out that there is a remarkably low threshold\nFor the protection of vested rights they don't protect them at all and this whole situation creates all sorts of uncertainty in the way in which government or to run and the Republicans have been as much to blame for months of this is the defendants\nAnd there's a story for example about and you know ... there's a case called outweigh you eat on a and what it did is involved the question of how we define certain kinds of police officers and or the department of labor under Clinton came up with the obviously absurd position on that day a sergeant\nOr a lieutenant was not and the and administrator and executive or a professional\nUnder the fair labor standards act and
