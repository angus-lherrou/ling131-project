the the there's the reds running route across the whole holy from it\nBecause it is everything he talked about in the twenties sixteen campaign that took the Republican Party by storm and overwhelmed

they're marching through Mexico not seeking refuge in Mexico which offers to them asylum if they're\nFearful of conditions in their own countries Honduras Guatemala or El Salvador and they're marching toward the border Donald Trump doesn't have any have to do anything more than stand there and say witness I Will stop this\nYeah honestly I think that's true because I think every American should be

assuming that we are\nIn effect and able to stop the flow we have no policies in place to really prevent them from coming into the country and I have to\nSay if there is one issue where Congress has

problem and it needs to be fixed and by the way this is a very good time for Republicans to remind people that Trump made a proposal as you remember he had a several step proposal\nOn the table or to

it is it has a very single sole purpose which has to embarrass the United states\nA ... ... you know what it is embarrassing to the United states but not in the way they had hoped it's really

American president\nWas busted\nBy one of these assaults on our border we all remember a ... in a two thousand twelve I think it was when you had that surge across the border during Obama's presidency and Americans were horrified and all of us on all the polling on immigration reform went very hard nosed and sort of\nBack fired for President Obama because people held him accountable for not fixing

that doesn't affect you at all because you're not going to come to United States anyway and you probably don't have big bank accounts or investments in the United states if you met Mohammed bin salt

Soviet Union and Russia from the pouring\nMissile defense installations which meant what let's go back to what was called mad what kept the new therapies ever since the beginning of the atomic age was this doctrine of mutual assured destruction that if one side attack the other\nIn an attempt to destroy it ... itself would be attacked and destroy and that rain but that could lead to this or an accident\nKept either side from protecting itself from a retaliatory strike so when Bush left it he opened the door to a profound revision isn't that eventually underline this intermediate range tree\nAnd the Russians began when they saw what was going on to develop a counter or they began violating the treaty I whether they deploy these missiles or not is open to question but they certainly developed them and they tested\nOr they haven't deployed them so the United states by doing that now remember something else happened\nWhen the United states violated another agreement one it made with Gorbachev that it would not move NATO eastward toward Russia when NATO began to expand to Russia's borders and today John we all know we're right on Russia's borders NATO was\nThe missile defense installations which we are now being implemented because Bush had left the treaty prohibiting then became a NATO project where NATO went missile defense with so the result is\nAnd I'll get to the end of this point but I think it's very important the result is today as we talk Russia is ran by American NATO missile defense installations so you say so ... how does that relate to what Trump has died\nAnd it's because the Russians are climbing and American nuclear scientists who are independent such as professor Theodore postal at MIT have agreed that these missile defense installations can fire\nIntermediate range missiles that is there not only defensive installations they are often so we've been building their capacity to fire cruise missiles as they were called which had been banned for almost a decade now and the Russians have complained bitterly\nAnd we have not responded so we have a situation so when the Russians began to respond they probably violated the treaty but they were reacting to us\nAnd and the age of system that we moved on shore just yes actually\nRight exactly and even though the the IMF band land base missiles the age is complicated\nA lot of them are on ships but they are in fact the land that based develop missiles put on ships they it's blurred the distinction between see inland oh I think it's fair to say\nAnd you might get on somebody and get somebody on like an ally of John ... who says my narratives not correct but I leave it to be that as his true with the history of the Cold War we have mindlessly or\nYou know with intent in mind done profoundly unwise things in regard to Russia to which Russia has reacted\nAnd we see where that leads to because this treaty this act of nuclear abolition isn't was symbolically and historically of enormous importance now maybe it'll be say\nThere are six months you have to give notice six months in advance may me it's a bluff by Trump to get the Russians to do something a trumped by putting are

about living creature that doesn't have a happy habitat\nIn Mississippi where it's named and what has been profiting for many hundreds of thousands of years but right now the fish and Wildlife Service if at found Fifteen hundred and forty four privately held out ... acres in Louisiana which is kind of next door and they've designated those acres so they're privately held\nHabitat what does that mean what is the power of habitat and Richard I go to the all arguments\nYou preview this by saying Justice Kagan introduced the hypothetical of landowners and the designation of critical habitat\nAnd she asked whether a job making a slight improvement that's the quote you get a would be adequate Justice Roberts on the other hand um it I read it mocking the\nAsk the question can you build a giant greenhouse implant long leaf pine in Alaska and call that a habitat now both seem to be making fun of fish and Wildlife Service Sarah have I have I misunderstood the sobriety if the court\nWell I mean what they're all trying to do is to figure out how something relates to the key statutory term that if the Supreme Court when it took this case was not interested in for his principles there is a statute which says that the fish and Wildlife Service\nCan designate essential critical habitat for ... purposes and the actual disputed in the court was a semantic one is what does it mean to be essential\nAnd what Justice Kagan hypothetical was designed to establish is that you can have an essential habitat which is not currently occupied by any members of the species\nThat is in some sense redundant because the statute actually anticipates that and does have procedures for an occupied habitat the chief justice coming at this from the other end says this term\nAre essential makeup of some cases but it's not infinitely elastic and certainly would not say that habitat is going to be essential if you pick some random part of the forest up there in Alaska decide to cover it up with some kind of a\nDome and then put some pine trees in it and do it you could not designate that land and the answer that Justice Kagan would give is we was found a frog of this particular sort of in this area so\nWe are closer to the situation of not being an arbitrary selection\nWhich is true I don't think you could say this was all betray capricious but what it is is it's highly remote and so the question then becomes is\nHow essential is essential is the question they had the baby and you would never have to debate this question if the issue was put to the fish and Wildlife Service if you want to designate this land is habitat condemn it\nAt which point you can do whatever you want within the clue some of it off but the sweet home case that you referred to was bad but\nSaid essentially when the government does engaging in habitat designation\nIs prevent the animals from being harmed by the destruction of habitat\nAnd that is something which they can do as of right under the statute which says you're not allowed to take endangered species\nAnd the terms of listed there oh you're not allowed to capture not allowed to produce not allowed to hunter not allowed to slaughter one form or another and then the issue is whether or not the word home which is kind of diffuse covered habitat destruction as opposed to something that's not listed on that list like poisoning an animal and there was a\nBig argument about it and Justice Stevens said look as far as I'm concerned the government may think it's more efficient to designate a habitat than it is to buy it and who am I that's\nThe Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free on condition at what point and he's written a generic ... that's right over two hundred three on cars all all models and incredible prices on to flood auto dot com now\n... is now essentially a regarded as an anti harm measure rather than as a provision\nBut at that means you know one way or the ... that means the government doesn't even have to deal with the controversy of taking any more you can just designate something like Central Park a habitat and nothing will ever happened to it you don't have ... and\nWell the question is do you meet the essential test and if you read essential narrowly than they can't succeed because it's not critical because it's not as central to centrally broadly you can do it the takings problem just eliminates that problem because you know you want to take it didn't take it whether it's essential and I do you figure it out\nDo you have to do you have to compensate if you ... as opposed to that yes yes you do so because the fish and Wildlife Service money if they said take money at\nThe day for gains tomorrow what they do and governments typically condemned property for sites they sell part of it off in order to recoup part right right\nNo because what happened the way the Supreme Court works is once a precedent is decided I'm In the course of oral arguments you're not allowed to reopen that particular point\nSo the only thing they could do is to look at a dictionary and similar sources most of them when they use the word essential are talking about indispensable viable without which something can't worry going to the core of the essence of things\nAnd I would think as a straight linguistic matter a future use of property\nWhich is going to require future payments which are not yet made which may never happened could hardly be regarded as essential but Justice Kagan is trying to say look I get these guys that for instance if I give these guys deference\nThey know more about the environment than we do we know they did this extremely careful study which they didn't do it was exactly this study would want to do if you're going to condemn the land the differences if you can buy if a zero as you can with designation you'll take it but if you have to pay thirty four million dollars is not a very likely chance that they would put their money up\nFor that so at the takings clause is designed to do is to establish a market as against the government uh which will reduce its appetite and as I keep stressing when you teach this or you talk about it\nIs the greatest importance of the takings clause is not that it gives compensation when property is taken which is nice the really important thing is you put a price up\nThere and all of a sudden some hair brain scans of some dubious games are not worth the price that you have to have so you don't do it there was a famous case called Lucas in which the government designated certain land\nUm as being essential to keep it empty even though it was worth five hundred thousand dollars and Justice Scalia wrote an opinion saying if you designate this so it can't be used for anything it's taking\nWhat the government was then required to do is to buy the land pay Mr Lucas five hundred thousand dollars now and it's titled little lamb which cost at five hundred thousand dollars and what do you think they promptly did\nThey sold it because it wasn't worth five hundred thousand dollars to a neighbor offered them to pay three hundred and fifty thousand dollars I said where am I going to get the rest of the money for this so essentially what they did is they put it up to orange and that's what it is if you\nActually have to take possession of the property you don't want that what you do as you say of my better off selling off this thing and taking the money and using it for real habitat preservation or doing preservation or do I want to keep this used\nOut Richard you introduce the possibility of wiggle room here when the court decides that it turns on the word essential how can they fish and Wildlife Service make a rational argument that inventing

grandfather was that he wasn't Armenian and the shake except him and accepted him and\nTook him in and ended up you know treating him like a son and my grandfather stayed with a shack\nAnd what resonates with me is just this this shake ignored the propaganda of the time that these Armenians were dangerous people and I'm couldn't be trusted instead did the opposite and took my grandfather and\nAnd they just had this and and saved his life and so to me that was one of the most important parts of the story\nAnd close the circle you return there and two thousand seven and again in two
