got to make the place where the ...\nThen you got to be able to make some electricity so we put Eighteen solar panels on this brilliantly designed garage which just is behind the building away so nobody sees it it's the perfect angle\nOld house you can follow the progress on line that this old house dot com and catch the latest episode on your local PBS station and if all this talk of home remodeling has you thinking about your next project you can call in your home improvement question now to one eighty they money pit presented by home advisor dot com\nWell this project involve both remodeling number one hundred year old building in the building a brand new addition bringing those two together was the job or next guests Jeff swinger welcome just thank you\nKnow you do a lot of building the Narragansett area and then we have a lot of summer houses here we're probably never intended to be your own residences and here we are putting heating systems in them and air conditioning\nAnd insulation and just trying to make it all work in this case you had even a tougher job because you had to make this ... euro so that it basically\nIt's actually made all the energy that is needed now to do that you need to rely on a lot of systems one of which was the installations we'll talk to me about the insulation that made it possible\nHere you know as you said this was a summer cottage are designed a you know in the Nineteen twenties or so where you had some structure\nChevy GMC Honda and Toyota and siblings have in common they are all in for Steve condition and what they need to know where I guess that's right over two hundred cars incredible onto now\nThey're it's with the insulation in the energy codes we've got to make room for insulation or\nThey might say that it's not even enough\nSo we had to do a combination of insulated from the inside with super high a fish and stuff like\nQuote sell a spray foam right then we also had to insulate on the exterior of the building so we added to the outside just as much as we added to the inside because we didn't have all of a room on the inside right they are they advantage to to adding to the outside is that you create that thermal barrier\nAround the the framing members which are much more conducted transfer heat last so\nSo that was a critical part of this project now to the inside the finish I had a chance to walk through the house earlier just amazing carpentry in this job you guys that are really terrific uh works here with all the detail in the trends in ceilings and stuff to talk about that\nWell uh I give credit to the architect on powers who are really just thought about every space in the house and took advantage of his expertise in the design world and and really created a masterful\nA depiction of of water cottage built in you know cozy atmosphere would be in a you know all we did was follow his lead and not and execute a but I I give credit to him he he took advantage of every single corner in the house\nAll the sounds are those are good partnership and unusual for you to have the architect is the home or you're killing his wife has the designer\nYeah well it was it was really a little bit intimidating to start with that because um I you know held to a little bit of a higher standard has left us do it\nIt really turned out to be a really mutual relationship you know we collaborated on a lot of things Don wasn't a so you know our mail to thirty you know right we were able to exchange ideas and um\nThey were right down the road so it eliminated a third party in the middle so it really really did work out well\nIn but as you say communication really is key now the exterior of this home and a lot of work done landscape you had a landscape architect helping with that but ah you had to organize a part of the construction as well what was the challenge\nWhile the challenge was a it was a short period of time where we had to make a lot of things happen and we had three different porches which uh\nYou know cascaded down into the hearts gate and then we had a really extensive landscape plan you know it caught me by a little bit by surprise but when they started bringing the trees and the plants and I was amazed at how many plant things we ended up having\nAnd then they the landscape architect Tom Ryan did just a wonderful job that segment in different areas around the yard which are all\nMeaningful and well planned in a you know it it it came together\nWe can't wait to see it rollout Jeff swingers the builder on this project thanks so much for stopping by the money pit that was my pleasure you can follow along with all the progress here in Jamestown online at this old house dot com or on Twitter and Facebook has tacked tear wage

home improvement shows coming to you today on location from Jamestown Rhode Island the site of the current project ... forties season of America's most popular home improvement show this old house and one of the guys\nWho's been part of the fabric of this old house for over twenty five years is general contractor Tommy soda you just keep getting younger don't\nYou're talking yeah [laughter] well almost thirty five years there wow five thirty six years to make their fan it's amazing I Aaron I'm Down in the first few years [laughter] way played hard to get I ... well maybe that's it that way and turn it down because I work\nFor my dad we would just do my dad would he had didn't want any part of the details anyway but now we're too busy\nTo act on TV and stuff so I Want to talk with you first about the fact that a lot of the construction here was pre fabricated and I think when people think prefab a factory built in take well maybe it's not as good as what you could do my hand\nBut that's not really the case here and and and I said you were to circle you had two things that you did hear that were just fascinating to me the foundation first you think you can make everything in the house but you can't make the foundation\nNow you know you guys actually got a foundation three hundred miles away and brought here they bring in ... well pre cast\nFoundation it's insulated it and it has a concrete reinforced steel reinforced studying it insulated so there's no thermal breaking that in that position and the ... a free drilled for the electrician to run his wires through and it's a fast efficient way to put a foundation and\nThat's basically waterproof at the same time\nWhile in the building that we're in right now this is actually the garage that it probably the nicest girl jak you've ever seen right but this was factory billed as well as soon as\nThis is a pre cut building well you put it together everything's caught on a on a CNC so yeah so you know what's going to fit exactly right you know put the puzzle together and you've got a beautiful barn that looks like it was built onsite\nNow the challenge on this property was building into net zero which means that basically has to be so tight so well insulated and uh so perfectly heated um that it it essentially makes all the energy needs to operate that involved a lot of different types of insulation or want to ask you about that because I I think it's unusual to see spray foam used to different types of Springfield open\nAnd close close though and then you had solar laws we own law rock well insulated in which are actually I Love that insulation I mean I think of it it's it's basically rock right funding to fire molten rock and ...\nAnd ... it's right insulation for sounded need for insulation and its water resistant well you know if it gets wet it's going to dry out\nNow you guys use a technique called warmer blanket on the exterior walls what does that mean well\nThat's the way you take the insulation the the stone will actually right now are you can also use rigid film\nAnd you apply it to the exterior surface\nOf the building so you framed the building in this case we had the old building we had to deal with the conventional walls right those was ... on the outside of the sheeting you have to put a thermal barrier\nBecause you have to worry about the thermal bridging of the structure when it when it meets that different installations so in other words it could be some transfer of different temperature\nFrom the actual study ... and so you got to worry about compensation forming on the inside of the outside insulation is that makes sense though it does enter the sandwich right so in other words you're putting something like\nA um it's it's called like a house wrap that you put on before you put your installation and it's like a range screens you know of any any condensation should occur in between that insulation it will run down and not damage the sheet\nAnd but it certainly has to be completely formally separated ... yeah yeah yeah it's almost like when you're building sounded the buildings you put separate walls and never touch the same idea here which are firmly separating everything she ... she that insulation exactly right yeah that's the trick\nNow you also how do and solve the solar right which is on this building and you also have a beautiful wooded shingle roof here now which single roof ... is there not done right and I've seen an awful lot of them and do you have to their ... like crazy say rye\nFast if they're not you you

and it really unusual house they've taken one hundred euro seaside house that when it was originally built was probably never intended for anything other than summer residency they bolted on a brand

up this hour we're going to get all the details on that project straight from the chia which team including Kevin O'Connor Roger Cook plus norm ... will be by to talk about a very special mouse to reach by very few programs\nBecause this is the ... season of this old house\nSo let's get to kick things off I'm very pleased to welcome a great friend of the money pit Tim and the kind of welcome Kevin and I mean that figuratively and literally because not only are you are now but you've been a friend too many homeowners now for\nMany many years in your role as host and congratulations on the forty a season at this old house wow\nYeah well he's forty sees it forty years it's something we're very proud of his you know I Can't take any credit for that I've only been doing it for the last Fifteen or the other boys are at twenty five years ahead of me on that but it's a testament to\nWhat norm Roger Richard in time he started back in Nineteen Seventy nine I'm Still going that it's still

take the ferry to go to school for the year to the mainland we're now connected by bridges but it's always been sort of you know one step removed from the ... of Newport\nKind of a draft these small inefficient summer home to watch probably one of the most efficient homes in the areas and it's been expanded a lot so you have to figure out how to make space for all that in the landscape so tell me about that process because I think a lot of our listeners maybe\nI've never worked with a landscape architect mhm [noise]\nWell we uh we took a look at the lot and on a lot this guy is usually try to use every square inch is a lot is usable space for the people that are here\nAnd uh so we we took a look at the layout of the new house and try to relate spaces outside inside so there is a a kitchen backdoor entrance where\nThey come and go most of the time in a trash comes in and out we place to grill near the back door a there is the\nBarn or that they're in and out of the new projects it's a it's a family of of of\nAh constructors right that's bill ... definitely builds yeah\nSo we created a working yard off that garage in off the kitchen with a a with an old flat open space a little area of of paving a little vegetable garden and there's a sliding door between the garage in this open space so it's kind of the overflow workspace\nSo and so it's kind of like I'm bringing the indoors out in the outdoors in addition airy space where it's just very comfortable moving from one zones and the next ... exactly that's what a design comes in in his eyes from the design\nHow you've got to actually plan the physical elements actually perform what that intent is yes yes so\nWe gave them both are in an area of heart surfers in an area of grass a design defense of this come in the back wall of this space put up a hedge between the house\nAnd the working yard which takes out some of the view of the mess that might be there in the back yard right out of the out of the kitchen windows yup uh and then there's also the circulation space in the back into the back back yard\nA which is a larger grassy area for their two young boys to get out and do it young boys do\nNo if folks are listening to this thinking you know what process show I go through if I Want to improve my backyard space what kind of chips would you give them to kind of get them started will either\nWhich you mentioned before about relating the inside of the outside is vitally important okay so you can have a great space outside but you can't get to it it doesn't do a lot of good right [laughter] and and you want to go inside and look out all the windows you know because you're going to live in a in this New England\nWe live inside quite a lot of the time I owe a lot of use out the windows are just as important as the views of the house or the views in the open space and then to zone those different areas as they relate to the house and then as they relate to the outside property lines\nWe don't really think of the outside in the room but in a sense of ... exactly the ruins and and the smaller the house the more useful those rooms are more important they are right\nIf you got five acre lie to you have a house in ... usually in line and you know everything kinda bleeds out when you have a small house like this those outside edge has become more defined and they become more inter grew into the living in the house\nSo all really important things to do you keep in mind if you're\nYou know if you just completed the summer and you're thinking about now\nIs one of those are planning for next year you got\nAbout six or eight months now the ... of those windows and thinking about those faces ... and you know really living for it in your head ... may be making a paper model of it I always just because people sometimes can imagine the space shuttle sets up but now the time to do that and that's great information so congratulations on well done project\nHere Tom Ryan landscape architect

grass can use so you don't need to fertilize it\nRoger when it comes to fertilizing and getting the the long chemicals just write that something trips a lot of people up right\nWhere we spend a lot of time on our lawns trying to get them just right and usually it's in the past it's always been a bluegrass lawn right bluegrass lawn so a lot of water and a lot to feed and then you go to spray for weeds and bugs and everything else\nThis type of ... you see a lot of commercial is it unusual to put it in a residence\nWell we just started growing this in the past few years in right so it's something that's going on we see is the future\nIs going to keep going ... how does it stand up in terms of like wear and tear I mean this house has has two kids are growing up in it you know the top of that\nIt's tough for that at the idea house a couple of weeks ago here for this old house so that quite a bit of traffic and cross that lawn and ah I was back there last week with the professor from Penn State that research on this stuff look gorgeous he was a very happy to see\nSo when you put down a side Roger as opposed to you know growing one from scratch once the prep involved\nUh I think the same as we've always been doing right we take what soil is there and we wrote to scare a fire and losing it all All right so that the roots that are coming in could get down into a tank of themselves and get whatever moisturizers there than we find greed will ... will put in some lime if it needs it and then to see this on\nNow we're in the midst of a parental rainstorm right now I had to eat I finished you know it's kind of a health issue irrigation today but does it take the same amount of water or less or more than you wear traditional long we'd get\nAnother one of the beautiful things about it is does not use a lot a lot of water and they'll yeah we have the effect we have to educate people who are not watering so much\nThat's right yeah at the idea house I've already had to contact the irrigation contractor and say shut the water off the I had enough [noise] so\nHow can you add this to an existing or do you always have to start from scratch with San I think with the micro clover you can over seated into it but I Would say I wouldn't want to do it into a bluegrass lawn because that's not really a drought tolerant we're on alert more than ... current and that's just not because they're not going to get along right\nThose two types right yeah we've put it in with the tall fast you that's more drought tolerant now this is a harsh\nEnvironment because it's right here on the coast I guess it's an appropriate products for a seaside community\nAre yes it is a lot of salt in it all down to actually more of salt resist them bluegrass\nIs well that's why I Love about this old house I mean you know you were things that you just wouldn't imagine really exist I mean the fact that there's this very specialized type of side that has all these benefits to it\nIs is so cool I'm In a while you guys\nYou know always sort of pushing the envelope and coming up with this stuff for projects like that it's just you know it just keeps fashioning the audience that's probably why they're around for for forty years now is the end of the forty a season so congratulations on all the good work you put into that Roger ... some around here\nYeah well you talk

from\nNext need to know what kind of wallpaper you're dealing with if the papers the type ... strip of all moving it is pretty easy you just grab a corner and peel but more than likely it's not which leaves you with two options soaking in scraping Demian off\nNow if you're stuck in the paper that requires just the right amount of warm water wallpaper solving the applied to San drywall though and it gets too wet walk and become damage\nNow wants that well is wet paper gets scraped off usually a little at a time and it's a pretty slow process and the other option is steaming now with plaster walls you really can't hurt them too much\nBut for Dr but once you get any need to be careful too much team and they could become water damage now the type of wall wallpaper you have an impact the cost of pro were charged with a process but most pros will charge by the hour for this job and should be able to quote an estimated price ahead of time based on the size of the room\nAnd that's the

matter what the type of job ... fast and easy to hire the best local pros\nWell own homes come with a lot of old wiring and that was certainly the case with this old house as well lots of wiring that had outlived its usefulness including what would have been probably the original wiring for one hundred your home it's a type called not into\nSo with us to talk about the safety of all that old wiring and what needs to be done with it is electric ... been Giles welcome bent areas we're good thanks for stopping by the money that this is a interesting area lots of lots of history right here\nLots of old homes and would you agree that ... it was probably the first ... wearing the may have been as these buildings\nYeah for sure that was the first modern type of wiring that could be afforded by your average person it wasn't as steel type installation are saying that was highly labor intensive to install so it was pretty widely used in the early Nineteen hundreds as one of the first real residential methods of wiring\nNow it's interesting for those that are unfamiliar with not been tube or actually talking about real knobs and real to cheer when it was run through beams you drill hole that we put like a ceramic tube through it\nTo sort of inflate the wire from the wood and then when it went perils of the themes that would be strung on these ceramic knobs and it was essentially an air cooled just so air had to circulate around it\nBut then we decided we were going to have these homes and insulation and what happens\nWell it heats up the other thing I think that happens to a lot in these older homes is you know in the homes are originally built designed they weren't designed for things like vacuum cleaners dishwashers air conditioners all these modern appliances that when they have today\nAnd all of those things these days are grounded a lot of the time so\nWhat you get is people kind of tagging new wiring on to the old system in unsafe way race\nAnd using it incorrectly a and again those systems were never intended to carry those kind of loads coupled with solar installation techniques of newer wiring and they and the increased loads of the homes it just creates some dangerous situations but the original installation the way that it was intended to be used was actually not to add one right is fairly safe\nIt was it was the environment changed around it now for this house here in Jamestown did you find any existing nominate two of them are still active\nOh yeah there was definitely most of the house had some now been too then there were a lot of things topped off of that now than to just like I just said people trying to get something that they didn't have and make it work with the existing system [noise] um so it was definitely a\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai key a Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own tradition and blood for Denise religion Narragansett that's right

Tom Chrysler and today is a very exciting show for us because we're coming to you from Jamestown Rhode Island\nThis is the site of the latest project for the forty season of this old house in today is the final day of production but right here actually in the garage is a lot nicer than that sounds the surrounded by the cameras and the saw us to bring you the story of a very cool just completed\nBy the spectacular team at this old house now if you're not familiar with this area it's a very unique place with a lot of history Jamestown Rhode Island is a coastal town it's it's just across the Narragansett Bay from Newport which is home to many many famous mansions\nBut if you didn't happen to be named Vanderbilt door after Duke you may have decided to build a more modest cottage right here in Jamestown and many of these houses do from the late Eighteen hundreds and early Nineteen hundreds when summer visitors\nBuilt them to enjoy the ocean breeze isn't the Sandy beaches but today many of those dwellings remain on insulated\nAnd since they were originally built just for the summer season there was really no need for insulation back then and that's what brings us to this old house which was rebuilt\nTo increase energy efficiency but keep the old charm now to kick things off I'm joined by this old house virtually any contractor Richard truth do we walk and Richard thanks so much So Richard when we say that the goal was to make this home energy efficient we're talking like insane we energy efficient here because\nThe plan was to make this a net zero house so those are not familiar with that Europe is kind of explain that\nThere's a bunch of components to one is to make it insulated really well to make it incredibly tight and so we did that with our thirty walls in our forty feelings and and we made it tight tight tight and then on top of that we we did another thing called aero barrier to make sure that we we controlled infiltration unduly\nWhat like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer during Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled Marjorie impeccable service\nTelevision show this old house you can follow the progress on line at this old house dot com and catch the latest episode on your local PBS stations and if all this talk of home remodeling has you thinking about your next project\nYou can call in your home improvement question now to one eighty they money pit presented by home advisor dot com\nWell this project involve both remodeling of a one hundred year old building in the building a brand new addition bringing those two together was the job of our next guests Jeff swinger welcome just thank you now you do a lot of building the Narragansett area and then we have a lot of summer houses here that we're probably never intended to be year round residents isn't here we are putting heating systems in them and\nAir conditioning and insulation and trying to make it all work in this case you had even a tougher job because you had to make this net zero so that it basically\nEssentially made all the energy that it needed now to do that you need to rely on a lot of systems or one of which was the insulation still talk to me about the installation that made it possible here\nYou know as you said this was a summer cottage are designed a you know in the Nineteen twenties or so where you had some structural framing members that were only geared to support you know the roof load itself right now today's standards with the insulation in the energy codes\nWe've got to make room for insulation or\nThey might say that it's not even enough\nSo we had to do a combination of insulated from the inside with super high a fish and stuff like\nQuote sell a spray foam right then we also had to insulate on the exterior of the building so we added to the outside just as much as we added to the inside because we didn't have all room on the inside right now they advantage to to adding to the outside is that you create that thermal barrier\nAround the the framing members which are much more conductor even transfer heat also\nSo that was a critical part of this project now to the inside the finish I'd had a chance to walk through the house earlier just amazing carpentry in this job you guys that are really terrific uh work here with all the detail in the trends and she only to talk about uh\nWell uh I give credit to the architect on powers who are really just thought about every space in the house and took advantage of his expertise and the design world and and really created a masterful\nA depiction of of what a cottage built in you know cozy atmosphere would be in a you know all we did was follow his lead and not and execute a but I I give credit to him he he took advantage of every single corner in the house\nSo sounds are those are good partnership and unusual for you to have the architect is the home or you're killing his wife has the designer\nYeah well it was it was really a little bit intimidating to start with because um I you know held to a little bit of a higher standard has left us do it\nIt really turned out to be a really mutual relationship you know we collaborated on a lot of things Don wasn't a so you know a male to thirty you know right we were able to exchange ideas and um\nThey were right down the road so it eliminated a third party and the middle so it really ... really did work out well\nBut as you say communication really is key now the exterior of this home and a lot of work done landscape you had a landscape architect helping with that but ah you had to organize a part of the construction as well what was the challenge\nWhile the challenge was a it was a short period of time where we had to make a lot of things happen and we had three different porches which uh\nYou know cascaded down into the hearts gate and then we had a really extensive landscape plan you know it caught me by a little bit by surprise but when they started bringing the trees and the plants and I was amazed at how many plant things we ended up having\nAnd then they the landscape architect Tom Ryan did just a wonderful job that segment in different areas around the yard which are all\nMeaningful and well planned in a you know it it it came together\nCan't wait to see it rollout Jeff swingers the builder on this project thanks so much for stopping by the money pit that was my pleasure you can follow along with all the progress

good description yeah it was a good description did you get that from the marine corps the balance of efficiency and quality yeah it was it was definitely something I'd probably picked up some traits in the marine corps and help out was\nWhat kinds of experience did you gather working here on this project I got thrown into a lot of different projects\nThat I haven't ever touched before like doing a western red cedar Ruth I write in her I've never weeds orange cat before I was a new experience for\nMe the whole uh insulation layers insulation and a zip panels\nFor this house route or something

made up for it to sink in that I uh I actually thought that I didn't get it because the the uh contact us about a week after when they told us that we're going to do a little bit of the cage and rice\nAnd then a center called me and told me that we got it and those kind of a kind of taken back by it well you know it was a good a good experience and a road that high for a couple of ...\nAnd and Mary thirty seconds or what was it like for you\nAnd and I kind of little\n[laughter]\n... yeah never imagined it right out all the while you're representing a lot of young people that are interested in the building trades and I know that you've been a great example for those and inspired those that are thinking about getting into this themselves so\nThanks for your efforts I'm really

home improvement show coming to you today on location from Jamestown Rhode Island the site of the current project ... forty season of America's most popular home improvement show this old house and one of the guys\nWho's been part of the fabric of this old house for over twenty five years is general contractor Tommy soda you just keep getting younger\nDon't you tell yeah [laughter] well almost thirty five years there wow five thirty six years I mean yeah man it's amazing I hear and I'm Down in the first few years [laughter]\nWay played hard to get I get well maybe that's it that way I turned it down because I work for my dad we would just do my dad he didn't want any part of the details anyway but now we're too busy to\nDirect TV and stuff so I Want to talk with you first about the fact that a lot of the construction here was pre fabricated and I think when people think prefab a factory built a thick well maybe it's not as good as what you could do my hand\nBut that's not really the case here and and and I said you weren't your circle you had two things that you did hear that were just fascinating to me the foundation for us you think oh you can make everything in the house but you can't make the foundation\nNo no you guys actually got a foundation three hundred miles away and brought her here they bring\nIn ... well pre cast foundation it's insulated it and it has a concrete reinforced steel reinforced studying it they're insulated so there's no thermal breaking that in that position and the ... does a pre drilled for the electrician to run his wires through and it's a fast\nEfficient way to put a foundation and\nThat's basically what group at the same time\nWhile in the building that we're in right now this is actually the garage that it probably the nicest girl jak you've ever seen right but this was factory billed as well so\nThis is a pre cut building well you put it together everything's caught on a on a CNC so yeah so you know what's going to fit exactly right you put the puzzle together and you've got a beautiful barn that looks like it was built onsite\nNow the challenge on this property was building at the net zero which means that basically has to be so tight so well insulated and uh so perfectly heated um that it it essentially makes all the energy needs to operate that involved a lot of different types of inflation or want to ask you about that because I I think it's unusual to see spray foam used to different types of Spring Hill open\nAnd close close though and then you had solar laws we own law rock well insulated in which are actually I Love that insulation I mean I think of it is it's basically rock right into a fire molten rock\nAnd ... and ... it's right insulation for sounded need for insulation and its water resistant well you know if it gets wet it's going to dry out\nNow you guys use a technique called warmer blanket on the exterior walls what does that mean well\nThat's the way you take the insulation the\nDisown will actually right now are you can also use rigid film and you apply it to the exterior surface of the building so you framed the building in this case we had the old building we had to deal with the conventional walls right those was ... on the outside of the sheeting you have to put a thermal barrier\nBecause you have to worry about the thermal bridging of the structure when you when it meets\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda Toyota and super all have in common they are all in for free on tradition at what for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred three on cars all make all models and incredible prices on to flood auto job now\nAnd so you got to worry about condensation forming on the\nInside of the outside insulation is that makes you know it does enter the sandwich right so in other words you're putting something like\nA um it's it's called like a house wrap that you put on before you put your installation is like a range Greenville if any any condensation should occur in between that and so they shouldn't it will run down and not damaged she\nWas actually has to be completely storm only separated\n... yeah yeah yeah it's almost like when you're building sounded the\nBuildings you put separate walls and never touch the same idea here right up with your thoroughly separating everything she could she than inflation exactly right yeah that's the trick now you also had to install the solar right which is on this building and you also the beautiful wouldn't shingle roof here now\nWhich single roof ... it's not done right and I've seen an awful lot of them I Know you have to Neeraj like crazy a rod fast if\nThey're not you you have to ... you have to think of that ... a ... today is not like which was say fifty two hundred
