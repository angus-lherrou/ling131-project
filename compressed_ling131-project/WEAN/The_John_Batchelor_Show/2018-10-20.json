Democrats face um it is one of going through a difficult adjustment a Republican or a read a elites are no smarter than their Democrat\nEither I emphasize that there that the the leadership is feeling its way here is the host of on the outside of the Javits Center in what we're doing\nI I Would suggest I'm humbly that it was a gift the ... election of twenty ten and the election of Barack Obama in that it it tended to set in train\nA tumultuous process of reconsideration and the Tea Party or in in the larger cultural saps really did or the Republicans have big favor because what it is dead is bring front and center\nThe demands of the people to be represented\nBy their leaders and to get out of the Washington thing and you know the leadership did not do that and the one person who did what Trump and that's why he swept away all all of the contenders he faced and the nomination process and twenty six team and in fact\nThe uh red politically that is has stolen the march on blue because it has had the advantage of of being awakened to this\nEarlier they the southern platter aristocracy before the civil war now I'm not comparing the two obviously\nIn terms of their belief system but I Am comparing them to the difficulty of making adjustments to a changing reality in effect change in society they're not as adaptable they the plan or aristocracy would rather go to the civil war\nAnd come up with an alternative solution and this it seems to me is the challenge faced\nBy blue elites and it's it's a bad it by the fact that they are so increasingly out of touch with regular people and what we're saying for example in California which is hemorrhaging\nEmma grace you know who are fleeing to places like California the Pacific northwest and the only people coming into California these days are yuppies the rich and that bodes ill\nWe've got thirty seconds I caught that party I I I Do not believe in your article you find any more sustainability for the readily either they're being used right now but they're not their future is bright unless they change also we have got thirty second\nBest right and a red red elite such as they are or have been scrambling but they've got a long way to go and in fact\nThe the larger outcome of of the civil war but I Believe is is sweeping American society will inevitably create a a a different set of leads\nEventually and that of course is the reason you have civil wars or is that you\nCan't achieve change and readjustment any other way and that's perhaps unfortunate because of the violence that without a leash but that is in fact

the party so we're just now starting to adapt some of these techniques for use in kind of figuring out who might have been involved in a shark bite\nThe I read from the reporting that the U.S has more unprovoked shark attacks than any other nation that was true in twenty Seventeen\nOr that nationwide we have ... more than fifty and Florida has a lot of attacks is there a pattern here that's emerging Chris or is this is this just better data and or something like the shock lab um accumulating the data\nWell there's a number of factors involved in this so one factor is now it gets so much media attention that when these incidents occurred they always get reported\nFifty sixty eight years ago you know it was sometimes never reported or sometimes that people never made it back to the beach to know that\nAn incident occurred and the other thing is we actually don't refer to these two shark attacks anymore because we don't know the motivation of the shark so we simply refer to them a shark bite so until we figure out\nYou know whether the sharks intent\nWas to deliberately attacked some thing um it could be just simply mistaken identity shark didn't know what it was a thought it was a\nA food item it bit into it and it decided we just don't taste good so that really isn't an attack that's I'm a sampling if you will but nonetheless a little bite from a big shark can do a lot of damage\nAnd what's remarkable and what we've seen in more recent years\nIs the severity of some of these little bites so to speak and how many people survive those and that's really attributed to first responder on responses and and and saving these people\nSo we're getting more data because we have more survivors and we move quicker and our communication system allows us to know when something's going on in Cape Cod and two weeks later going on in San Diego county that's why\nWell that's one of the reasons the other reason is there are more people using the ocean recreation than ever before in history\nAnd in the U.S we have locations in our country where people can use the water you're around and they do\nSo when you think about how people use the ocean now for recreation and how much time different user groups spending the ocean like surfers swimmers but the borders waiter stand up paddle borders when you look at the amount of time they actually spending the ocean now is\nExponentially greater than it was twenty thirty fifty years ago so that's the other thing that we have to put into context they're more simply more people in the ocean than ever before\nWe've looked at it from the human point of view that size homo sapiens and why we're now going to turn when we come back from the shock point of view why how did the shark see is why the sharks in

very very flexible and I read and Reuters\nAnd unprecedented volume of Iranian crude oil set to arrive at China's northeast dally in Port this month\nIn early November before us sanctions on Iran take effect according to an Iranian shipping source and data on a website\nA very good evening to you and the Iranians are sending a fleet of oil tankers to China now and in future is this the way to defeat sanctions does this work good evening to you about him\nGood evening John thanks for having me get to be back with you I think this uh armada of Iranian oil I think that's been termed a is one very powerful way in the run up to sanctions that the Iranians are looking to offset some of the impending penalties I don't think in the future\nOr having these very highly publicized uh uh you know uh basically fleets are a lot of\nUh of Iranian oil to China and re exporting it or something that the Iranians are going to draw much attention to\nThat we've already had issues with tankers turning off the trans ponder is making it harder for these multiple private take her track or companies to actually be able to determine where a Iranian takers are at at what point they're stopping talking or at actually delivering this oil\nUm it's one of many work around the run into it a try but of course it's one of the things that we must be vigilant against\nChina goes along with it I just trying to have a waiver from the United states or from a anybody to take a rainy an oil\nPresently there is no country that has received a waiver but we do know that there are countries like China like India like South Korea\nStill negotiating still fighting to get a waiver the administration as we know has has kind of waffles on this issue of absolutely zero Iraqi oil imports past November four and then saying as close to zero as possible but of course there's always the discussion of the case by case exemptions and I think that\nThe real trick is is how to use us sanctions to their maximum effect without ruptured oil markets it is absolutely possible and it is possible to take into account the greater bilateral issues that exist in the U.S China relationship\nHow would you like ... twenty gene

evening thanks for having me I I think it's still too early to call\nThe relationship between us and turkey at budding romance or certainly the release of us past it Andrew Brunson or has prevented the imposition of a second round of sanctions on turkey but that are still a number of issues at the table\nRanging from Turkey's purchase of Russian as four hundred batteries or to the men beach issue\nTo Iran sanctions and to others us hostages including three State Department employees so until these other issues I dealt with I think us Turkish relations will continue to be tense\nBut it's his correct to say that that is a falling off relations are from its low point in August when us imposed global Magnitsky sanctions against to a Turkish ministers are which happen for the first time in history\n... economy is struggling have the sanctions hurt it\nCertainly are following the global Magnitsky sanctions in August we have seen the Turkish leader\nOr take a dive and only after the release of pastor Brunson last week\nLead a a recovered to ah it's pre crisis levels but structural problems remain a twenty Nineteen there'll be a difficulty for the Turkish economy or everyone expects stagflation and it will be key for on ... to to get Washington's help\nOr in accessing a bailout package or from the IMF which seems to be the only way in which Turkey's Turkish economy can be back on track\nThe president mystery of the disappearance and presumed murder of the columnist for the Washington Post this mostly relates to Saudi Arabia and MBA asked about\n... part of this so far has been a in some fashion Turkish authorities have been providing an enormous amount of information some of it\nHas been confirmed some of it is still speculative is it in ... is it in air to want interest to participate in this tragedy and to ah to contribute information that disturbs the relationship between Washington and Riyadh\nNow I think Adam\nWonder Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru

use this to the max a first or to extract the economic concessions church it could use a some of that Saudi Petra dollars second or add one will try to\nAnd demand is Saudi Arabia to ease and its\nBlockade on cut ties and he you know soften its crackdown on Muslim Brotherhood as much as he can get a soft as he knows that he has a chokehold on Saudi Arabia as the drip\nFeeds a Turkish and global media with embarrassing details of this gruesome murders and I think we will continue to see this ongoing negotiation behind closed doors\nA puzzle about the source of that information a Turkish security is very good MIT\nI yeah I find it impossible to imagine the two aircraft from Saudi Arabia a discouraging Fifteen very vigorous men and more to Saudi nationals were not was not watched entirely by MIT coming in and going out\nAnd did and does the MIT have a role in this or did they watch this happen because it suits here to one or is this opportunistic for them as well\nNow what we know at this point is that was close surveillance off the conflict genital of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul it's safe to assume that there was both audio and video surveillance\nOr as well as there were some a human assets are among the staffers are off this conflict but this does not necessarily mean that a Turkish government or Turkish intelligence\nHad the ability or the foresight or to realize what was happening and prevent it I think that the the dilemma here for the Turkish government is as some of the evidence\nOr that can prove what act actually transpired\nWould be too explosive to release because it would also be self incriminating evidence\nProving that a turkey has bugged the Saudi consulates or has had a audio and video surveillance right or had assets there are so it's it has to be these leaks at two Turkish and international media you know very carefully\nDrip fed leaks ah but I think uh it wouldn't be realistic to expect the fool's records to be shared with the global audiences\nBack to Moscow mock trials watching all this with a smile or with a frown what is your estimate I\n[noise] I think both Russia and Iran are watching this uh with great delight ah this the first of all on their minds um the on the Iran coalition us is trying to build in the middle east\nOr it's potentially a\nCould lead to further tensions are between you
