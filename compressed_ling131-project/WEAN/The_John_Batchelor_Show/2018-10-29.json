got for the warm weather Steve and you're running a real tight and outside story\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island for a mere luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lighter of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty eight ... Lincoln Navigator was Lincoln if there were against it unparalleled Marjorie impeccable\nAre for important things you have to can hitter and we've got the chips in today's ... project presented my advisor dot com\nNow first the average cost to build a shit is a pretty wide range we're talking about between eight hundred and four grand and it depends on the troops choosing whether you're going to build yourself or hire a pro but what do you decide to be a white or not there are several basic questions to ask you saw before you start shopping\nYeah first of all do you need a permit I think a lot of people forget and think oh it's my house and I can do whatever I Want and I'm going to do the thing I'm going to put up a fan\nYou can't always just go and do that you have to check your local building codes first to determine if you need a permit to build a shadow on your property now you don't want to find out after\nYou finished the project that it's got to come down because it violated some building code orange zoning code I mean that's the last thing you want to do in fact a bunch of money and then have to take it all down and then do it again\nNow the other big thing you've got to think about and what does your shed needs to be and what do you want it to be you know do you need something simple and you know primarily for just business needs putting things in there and not making a cute or any other functions or do you want something decorative\nThere are so many different styles and size is out there that you really need to evaluate your home and your property and how you're going to use that and that you can determine the style for what your ... going to be\nYeah and part of that as a society where the should is going to go I mean depending on the size of your property you get a lot of different options for the place from that shit you know folks very calmly might put it close to the house which makes running power and water one's easy or\nSometimes folks will tuck it sort of to the side or the back of the property so that it's less obvious but what some fall into that because you're gonna be going back and forth a lot and you don't want to regret that decision\nAnd finally what your budget I mean did you get a tight budget you build a very simple should that gives the job done without a lot of frills\nBut it's got some wiggle room you could think about adding some extra features like integrated shelving inside decorative trim on the outside or you can go all out man cave or she's shed and maybe at electricity sheet swimming\nWall to wall stereo I don't know you know you can really totally decked out those are fun too but I think it through in mind that budget so that comes out just the way you expect\nNow if you do go pro we recommend getting estimates from at least two or three contractors before you choose the one pro that's going to help you with the project\nAnd that saves pro project presented back home advisor dot com went

fast and easy to her the best liberal approach\nNow it's got cancer Adelphi on the line who is looking for a better shot or\nWe see today I'm Hi I'm calling because I wanted to find out um I had an old Victorian house and I have a three three three\nI had a ... and when I if someone's going to shower the second floor and then I Want to take a shower or on the water up there on the earth or the shower go with coke and I've been an egg creme contractors and my former and I'm not getting a consistent answer so I like to remedy that says I'm do remodeling\nOkay so are you opening up walls is part of remodeling\nYes I'm completely stripped down to the\nGreat so first of all the reasons you have reduced water pressure an older homes are generally because you have old steel pipes that suffer from internal resting and they clog the closed down ... surgery and then you can't push enough water through it\nAnd that could be your main water pipe there could be the supply pipes that are inside the house\nOr a combination of them and so since you're taking the walls are for the general rule of thumb is whenever you expose these old steel pipes you want to replace them with copper pipes um war with tax was different to a newer type of plumbing pipe now the other thing is you may have enough water pressure coming in from the street\nWell one of the pressure is not that big of a deal because I think the pressure guy is just that like basically we have to bear from than out and you can only use one at a time by the water completely goes ice cold air to shower somebody come than eager to think\nWell that's because the the pipes may not be supplying the hot water the may not be moving into hot water which I was worried or do you have um forty hours or less minimum size but should be okay for for two bathrooms okay and as an an older water heater um no I just\nReplace or to hear when you replace the changing of the ... this is going through the steel pipes\nThat they changed the hype around the no I don't think so\nYou need to talk with your plumbers about what kind of pipes you have whether or not that's the problem and need to know where the water pressure\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit light up of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator for Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled Marjorie impeccable surface\nA pressure ballot now what they were many issue at all\nSo pressure valve valve is designed to be used primarily in the shower and what it does it keeps the mix between hot and cold balance so that you don't get scorching or freezing cold waters when the pressure drops so if somebody wants to say run hot water downstairs and they'll rubble at hot water from the upstairs shower\nIt would not change the balance of water from the mix of water between hot and cold so the flow would be less you'd have less of the stream but it wouldn't be the the temperature wouldn't change okay right okay no that's not it I don't think that's the cause I mean that would that would certainly be a good thing to have\nSomething you should consider but I don't think that's the reason you're not getting hot water on the second floor I just don't think ... moving enough water up there\nOkay so basically what I Need to do is tell them to check the piping around the water heater again\nA plumber should know this not only run the water heater would basically if you're going to one of those walls what kind of pipes do you have\nAnd are they corroded and should they be replaced to help groups are up to help alleviate this okay I'm In of all else fails you could always had a second water heater upstairs you could add a checklist water heater which would be a really small unit and it would supply additional water that second for bathroom\nOkay okay okay well I think that kind of remedy the problem\nAll
