R. E. T. it's quick creek concrete patching compound good stuff Mary thanks so much for calling us at a date money that\nI got that right there in Illinois and the line and getting some water through the foundation tells what's going on\nWhat it is or time I've got a ranch house where they walk out basement and on the walk out when you come out there is a retaining wall\nIt was about eight foot tall where it meets the house it hasn't really separated from the house but\nThere is water they get between ... and the foundation and then they read it bottom on a heavy rain and then teach back into the basement so trying to figure out the previous owner that had this houses put something in there like a call ... or some type of a hard time and\nIt's not falling down too much\nSo this is a gravity situation so let's give you a gravity solution let's have the drainage work with you and not against you and by the way\nYou can steal this so the cows come home and it's still going to find that on its way in which you have to do is stop the water from accumulating so on the opposite side of this retaining wall I'm guessing that there's some run off that goes towards the wall and yes there is\nSo what you're going to want to do is is intercept that run off so we don't get as much water that collects in that area where we're going to try to do is limit the amount of water that gets in an area that just direct rainfall with no runoff that means\nNo gutter discharge no runoff from higher elevations so the way we do that is is first of all examine the situation and make sure there's no water dropping\nAt the high side of this war could work its way down if there is you've got to run a pipe underground to get it to a place where it's not going to interfere with ah with leaders into the basement secondly in terms of intercepting the run off what you could do is installed something called a courting drained Richard it's really it's a rather simple drain you might construct yourself\nYou take a trench that's about twelve inches deep and twelve inches wide he puts in stone that trench then you put a ... type on top of the stone surrounded with more stone ...\nHe's a filter cloth across the top and cover with soil so it's all done it's invisible in the end of that dream that you just installed should exit the daylights somewhere so you figure out the best way to do that based on the configuration of your yard will that will do is they'll intercept the water that's coming down from higher elevations\nFor the phone in a trench come up and down the pipe and then run around the house as opposed to collecting in that particular corner\nIf we can keep the water from collecting in that area you will probably be just fine because it's rare that just direct rainfall accumulates enough water to actually leaving the house it's almost always the runoff from gutters and from drainage\nWell and needless to say I probably have to do some uh get rid of landscaping because this guy\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us
