Sebastian Gorka is the author of why we fight his new book defeating America's enemies with no apologies devote himself in the book to foreign affairs this is a man who came to us because of the violence of these last decades he was in hungry on the nine eleven attack\nAnd he's here now as the national security strategy the Fox news also the author of why we fight but we turn to\nPartisan politics in the United states because we've got days to go to the mid term there is an advantage to the Democrats there's always an advantage to the party out of power in the White House it the first mid term that's political science\nEspecially in the house of representatives following a close election which was twenty six team you\nMake your case you choose your candidates you take it to the people and you vote on one particular day\nHowever it is impossible to ignore a remark made by a former attorney general at a steamed attorney as far as I can see Eric Holder\nRecommending that Democrats in these closing days of the of the campaign kick Republicans said I don't make any sense of this was he being clever does he do this all the time Eric Holder seems to have forgotten the responsibilities he has as a former attorney general\nSean the only attorney general in American history to ever be held in contempt of Congress\nBut the real cold or a man who while all the Sunday general publicly that I Am proud\nTo be President Obama's wearing\nA that's not a kind of statement we expect from the most senior Lauren post office the other thing the president so I I think it's very clear Eric Holder wasn't having us anything we didn't know when when when he said if your enemy you down\nYou just pick them because what how we just with this in the middle of\nA metal they spelling reputation with twelve years on the federal bench\nIn the space for one week going from having a book lists rectal than being accused of being multiple rapist to drought were women when he was in high school about what Eric Holder was talking about in my life is\nThat the that they knew more than what we've for Saturday with the president justly righteously declare it\nDropped Kevin O's and us from the White House the my expectation was maybe the Democrats look at the mirror and say okay we went to her but according to Eric Holder the worst is yet to come\nNow here's the puzzle sapped the house look very favorable for the Democrats and that's what that's what you expect to pick up that the first mid term of the first president to as a first term of a new president the Senate does not looked favorable for them that probably has to do with the cabinet story we've seen numbers moving the republic\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator one Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled Marjorie impeccable surface\nTo understand why Eric Holder and also Mrs Clinton\nWould use language recommending not just incivility\nBut aggression aggression towards Republicans you win on election day you don't win intimidating people\nAnd this idea that you take it to the streets with pay or what looks to be a subsidized protesters that that's not the mark of somebody who has confidence that they're going to win at the back of the ballot box\nI it's just a function I I Believe and you're right or Hillary Clinton just said it alone but that we will behave ourselves off we win\nThat's not the American coal pack that any kind of social contract that I've ever heard of at least not in the representative democracy or republic so yes I think it's very clear that this is just what happens when\nYour policies fail at the ballot box but you still the mom to be in power whether it's this much and innocent man so that you can\nMaintain control of the Supreme Court to turn it into a law making body or whether it is doing the kinds of things we saw it on the streets of Washington D.C.'s\nI return to my Republicans\nTo say that violence is unacceptable violence you win at the ballot box you don't win in the street you don't win by confronting people in the subway or at the coffee shop you win at the ballot box and anyone any Republican who thinks that violence is going to be successful is foolish I don't\nI don't want to I don't want to associate with them that's a pretty simple thing to say and Mrs Clinton and Eric Holder could say\nYes but it's not our job you're absolutely right this has to come from the leaders of the Democrat Party we have to hear this from the ... but they're not going to say it when you have the leading left wing media talking heads saying\nWell it's not a law really was being chased out of the restaurants are creating a situation where Iran polls wife now says she has to sleep with a loaded gun ... bedside and of course this is let's not forget whatever you think of Rand Paul's politics\nThis is a man who was on the baseball field as James Hodgkinson they Bernie Saunders solitaire\nWas firing his rifle at trying to kill all the Republicans at that chart the baseball game and almost succeeding in killing Representative Steve ... so you know there's only one side of the political\nLandscape critters normalizing violence or allowing it to be used as a tool without challenge and it happens to be the Democratic party John\nFinally to have a little fun here at the end let's say positive Kanye West in the oval office today was was you can't produce that that's just kind of happened that that was that was his turn right there ... ... I'm Still trying to figure out what it meant but it certainly was happy to watch\nYeah I I I'll tell you what it means it means that\nI don't know who it is where the bills signed the new head of the press and admitted to the White House or whether it's the president himself the White House has been ... the most important message with the late Andrew Breitbart the politics is downstream from culture\nKanye with one five minute cultural inject it more than any political tone at for the Republican Party is I'm In the last two years so uh yeah it was history and it's a very different kind of history but it was politics as much as it was culture\nI liked the laughter stab I liked the laughter and the smiles in the oval office even even the troubled media who don't seem to understand that we're enjoying ourselves and our prosperous time were laughing I saw them all laughing\nI I ... I was with a member of the press cool to see that your conservative off and he was ... with how\nEverybody else from the mainstream media not literally could not comprehend what was going on with ...

have been better for example we've talked in the past if we'd had a ... class to run the freedom of navigation act and not put in our biggest battleships\nWealth John I wrote this this essay at National Review online a which appeared yesterday\nIn response to a series of opinion pieces that have come out recently that was arguing that we were we were doing wrong by making investments in increased capacity meaning growing the size of the Army Navy air force in the navy\nAnd in fact these are these other voices were arguing that the money would be better spent in in investing in increased capabilities more high technology and my argument was that was strong civilian leadership we can do both and in fact we must\nSo the U.S military has a broader strategy of both attempting to preserve the peace that currently exists which requires that we have the capacity to have presidents and all the areas where we have interest while also increasing capabilities are so that we have a war winning capabilities when we need them\nAnd so the argument I make in here is it's possible to do both it's it's possible literally to walk and chew gum at the same time ah but I think that there's been sort of a series of false straw man that's been thrown out there\nThat attempt to say we either must do one or the other uh and I think there's some other political um you know arguments are in the background that money would be better spent in other areas or that the physical environment is getting to constrain with rising a debt and deficit but\nYou know we're in a great power competition and we either need to make the right investments to be able to survive within that competition or we don't we lose and we'd decline\nAnd therefore area denial do we have the ships to do it you know two eighty three fifty five what were we put a note three fifty five second deal with the Chinese aggression\nWell again we need to continue the investment in these high end destroyers which we just purchased a more over the next five year but we also know to buy need to buy those forget so you and I discuss on\nMany of them what about air frames Jerry what what would the navy need to deal with the Chinese rap\nFor the navy needs to make it a significant investment in modernizing its carrier air wings in order to get additional long range or aircraft back on the carrier deck and I have repeatedly called\nFor significant investments in unmanned long range precision strike platforms in order to have the aircraft carriers be relevant up against some of the new modern standoff anti access systems with the Chinese and the Russians are employing\nAnd right now we have not done that so that is an area where the navy needs to make a substantial investment to bring new capabilities on the carrier deck in order for that the aircraft carrier or to continue to exercise influence in the future\nHowever the Decatur incident uh we're not going to build a fleet overnight do we have the capability right now to deal with the increased ten grand aggression the south China Sea or any of the passages in the first time and change\nRight now we're holding our own but just barely a so the\nChinese are building up rapidly and in fact\nIn in just a few years they will have a larger navy than we do a a larger navy that's not as capable but the problem that we face as China only has to be great or over ... in one area of the world right now which is essentially the western Pacific in the end of the Indian Ocean\nWhereas we still have to maintain security everywhere in the world that we have interests which is broadly everywhere so uh our forces are spread thin we need to build up as rapidly as we can unfortunately right now the Navy's buildup planned at three fifty five does not get us there until the twenty fifties and that will be far too late\nFar too late Jerry Hendricks captain Jerry Hendricks\nUS Navy retired aviator writing at the national Review Online of what needs

I can to itself explain indefinitely\nI think there's one person who can decide that John and that's the president and and let me explain\nWhy I think that's so um you're quite right that if all that information were put out that is all this this written work product whatever was a done contemporaneously to memorialize these conversations that would clear up\nThe mystery that we're discussing the problem of course is that not everybody has a motive to see that cleared up publicly there may be a number of people who do but I think there's a number of people don't and I fear that Mr Rosenstein maybe one of them\nAnd the reason that that is significant is that if he's left to his own devices\nAre in terms of whether this ever gets disclosure not what I assume he would be saying is that because these are discussions between him\nHimself that is the deputy attorney general and the chief counsel to the FBI and someone like Lisa Page was also an an attorney for the FBI the only person that can break that log log jam or is the president because these these of\nExecutive privilege is belong to him\nOr to the extent as any attorney client privilege here uh I I I doubt there is but to the extent there is it belongs to the president if there's any executive privilege it belongs to the president if there's any deliberative process privilege which is also a component of executive privilege it belongs to the president\nSo I think until the president decides to waive all that and say put the information out I Would think that Rosenstein would it be taking the position that these are things that can be withheld and don't need to be disclosed to Congress\nThaddeus [laughter] Andy mirror ... these accusations\nAbout him are true or not and you're right out of ground requirement may be controlled and start why are they coming out now [noise]\nThink that he is because Baker agree to give her the interview to the committee\nI you know and the Trump in the Trump or news cycle everything so jumps together that I Can't remember now at this point if that was two weeks ago or one week ago but I Believe it's probably a function of the fact that as we've heard and we haven't seen transcripts or anything but as we've heard\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln him get access Lincoln him Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator flood Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nBut all the questions is the quote Andy answered all the ...\nRight I ... now sometimes of course John answering all the questions doesn't necessarily mean that somebody's being cooperative but my understanding of the way that was described as a ... pages testimony\nOr is that that was the case but she answered all the questions in good faith wave at where she is trying to see if we ever get to see the interview notes the transcript and then Baker who I should underscore here\nUm has a very fine\nReputation in terms of uh uh it is um integrity and his forthrightness um you can disagree with judgment calls but uh uh you know in terms of calling a spade a spade my understanding is that Baker has always\nBeen pretty upright or he gave a uh he gave an interview to the committee a week or two ago and I think that he is that that the the news coverage of that\nUh coupled with this is a big story this big article that came out in the New York times again a week or two ago that sort of a constellation of facts is what has driven this into a public story\nWe're speaking with Andrew McCarthy of the national Review Online Thaddeus McCotter W.
