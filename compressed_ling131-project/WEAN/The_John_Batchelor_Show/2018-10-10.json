colleague Gregory ... he's in Australia his native Australia\nAnd we're speaking of some of my thoughts reading his new book sovereignty and the twenty first century we were dealing with China and the threat\nThe nationalist sort of try to do with that will encroach upon all of its neighbors and the twenty first century and two big dogs got to fight however we turned out to the governance of the United states which has been in the news these last weeks he might have noticed all much talked about the constitution responsibility advise and consent\nGregory does the United states have a constitutional monarchy\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east British and they were against that have the best financed reason unbelievable prices in cars with zero percent NPR for Seventy two months you can be driving on the boards also models interest free log on to what I Do not come\nTo frame the constitution\nActually a muddled it on Georgia in Britain and then uh the ... the king be elected every four years now in order to provide the the continuity historical continuity which monarchy or ... provides\nA the United states imbued it's\nGreat documents the declaration of independence the constitution bill of rights or with a mystical house and the symbols of the United states including the flags on became a ... a comic\nOr to the point where they actually represent the mysticism of of the crowd in\nA while the the president or as elected has not any of the ... the powers of it more like a but in fact has more power in the U.S presidential a hands than any constitutional monarchy has had a ... anywhere in the world for the past couple of hundred years\nWith the possible exception of the uh the early part of the mid ... century and the Dow Jones has to she but basically we were looking at the U.S with a all of the uh thirty of that except for the unfortunate aspect that\nThe u._s. monarchs us presidents are\nFrom political parties and become partisan and so you always have a U.S president representing essentially half the population whereas an historical constitutional monarchy represents the entire nation and leaves the partisanship down into that\nCertainly what we've struggled with these last week so the what the president what our constitutional monarch has now blessed is a hoax\nIn the advise and consent process for a now associate justice Brett Kavanaugh was partisanship bare knuckle partisanship and it continues air Greg Greg we're waiting for you to come home and the experience\n[laughter] is what I've been watching it a ... minute by minute\nA and look it it's no different here where we're seeing a lot of um a constitutional monarchy is Canada Australia and the like are becoming more presidential in their approach to politics they the crown as is often disregarded a and you get prime ministers starting particularly with Tony Blair and Britain\nAre who are basically uh act as though that with a lot of ex um now I I think we're seeing a swing away from that which is positive\nOr an ... is the it's interesting thing although Trump or was nominally Republican or he attempted to come in as someone who represented the historical interest of\nThe United states the which is the balance nation state\nWhich has been forgotten essentially since World War two balanced nation state uh became basically the urban state dominating everything and that was contributed to buy the enormous growth of of productivity by the agricultural sector which enabled more and more people to leave the ... the city's\nSo ... really distorted the balance\nBut trust me from chief resistance is in the urban global as society here on the coast this special east coast that's where he finds the opposition and it continues through the Kavanaugh experience we have thirty seconds here Gregory\nThis the swing to nationals and we're just as the beginning of the cycle correct we can't we can't we can't at this point predict where we're going but isn't that natural consequence of nationalism clashes along borderlands\n... uh the\nConflict in clashes a human nature people always ultimately protect the that geography a ... and that clans so whether you call it national is or anything else uh basically that will always happen in times of crisis in times of transition so it's not\nA function of nationalism it's a function of human society\nYes we are seeing a revival of ... of a focus on sovereignty and nationalism a but basically because we saw such a pendulum swing\nIcy towards globalism a from a at the end of World War two\nHurry hurry home Gregory this segment of the global business reporters been brought to you by the republic of Azerbaijan from food to energy to a

I'm just not sure how much long term strategic thinking that cock his head I think they were caught up in a moment so determined to bring the mad cow they didn't look at the bigger picture\nFlorida Rick Scott the very popular successful governor is running against the long standing Senator Bill Nelson this is a non Kavanaugh story you're reporting for\nIt is a Florida is interesting for a couple of reasons first of all the early turnout has worked heavily for Democrats in Miami Dade ah what effect it to be about ... is two things ... ... thing really John that's environment it's environment in terms of a catastrophe going on in the form of red algae and red tide and blue algae\nOr the governor blazes senator Senator Blanche the governor for this problem ... bad the question is who they take it out on and now we have something else coming into play and that hurricane politics as we speak or a hurricane is barely out on the Florida Panhandle uh\nWatch senator Nelson watch Governor Scott just theme of the actions of it is a nobody would ... steak but if there's ever such things for tourist town it's one of the center is up for reelection the governor's challenge to that center and they will bend over backwards to help the state\nBill the puzzle about Florida here is that this is more of the president's state than New York yes he's very keen on the Florida vote that was a critical factor for his success is he is he a weapon here in the last weekend for ...\nAh ... mainly for Santa I think it's the one to look for John\nI say the governor's right when the governor\nOr I can write who is who is tight with Trump much tighter that Scott as so see if Trump is invited down there to campaign\nAnd this is why the metros are interesting and it's not just for or what also in Wisconsin where where Scott Walker is running for yet another term ... Scott Walter Scott Walker election is not just about Scott Walker John it's also about Republicans organized for the presidential election remember Walker this is what the fourth time though I think at Walker's Run statewide he's run twice\nIn regular schedule lectures John there's a recall effort they defeated\nAnd one thing about the last time that Walker a red in Wisconsin which is totally fourteen John that was in some respects a dress rehearsal for Republicans and twenty six to eight in the presidential very easy to convert his resources that are presidential candidate is one of the reasons John what Donald Trump ended up winning that state so let's see in states like Wisconsin in Florida\nAnd he had been so vain and Ohio State or federal Detroit's election but see how organized Republicans are and how that we've had the chance for Trump in twenty twenty\nImpeachment bill final question here you you mentioned Tom style or who campaigns all the time to improve if he's the president but I noticed that ah the putative chair of the house Judiciary Committee\n... from Manhattan mentioned impeachment about cabinet impeachment much in the air I think that hurts the Democrats but they keep it up can they stop at bell\nOr I don't know if they can control themselves look if teaching Donald Trump\nWe can agree as politically a dead end job why Democrats right Democrats control Congress they might have enough votes to get out of committee puts you got out on the floor John but it goes to said they will not sixty seven votes to convict all Trump out whatever they charge him if that is a waste of time I think\nTrying to impeach Brett Kavanaugh's just politically brain dead and I can understand why they even go down that road\nUh but yet there are there are Democrats who are just you know hell bent on revenge in some way for this and we'll try to push it so that's a plus if she wants to be that house speaker she has a lot of juggling next one is try to appease the president and the second one is whether or not to go to the cul de sac\nWhich is an issue for a Capitol Hill Whalen for the Hoover Institution and he keeps the blog\nOr the ... the pod cast area forty five when he talks to his colleagues but I get to talk to a building his colleagues as well\nOn John ... this is the John bachelor show in this segment of the global business report has been brought to you by the republic of Azerbaijan from food to energy to a knowledge economy the Republican has won by John and the Caspian Sea bass is a region well worth exploring [noise]\nCorporate profile but it is brought you buy the green organic touch with\nA Canadian licensed cannabis producers\nQuickly becoming the world's largest organic cannabis brand God has a massive fully funded expansion underway building nearly one point five million square feet of hybrid production facilities capable of producing over three hundred Seventy five thousand pounds of premium organic ... ... is a global\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood what born in east Greenwich and there were against it of the best financed reason unbeatable prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on the boards also models interest free log onto what auto job\nThe ability to invest even more this corporate profile but it has been brought you buy the green organic dutchman one of the largest ... producers of Canada's ...

but no apologies what is fresh here is that there are two new follows that through the Obama administration\nAnd the Bush administration and the Clinton Administration it was not clear to those of us who watch national security that the U.S what's going to focus on ... threat we're now focused let's start with Russia\nOr your experience with Russia from your dad and mom is that no matter how they dress it up their aggressive\nAnd they're aggressive especially along the boundaries of the empire\nIs it your opinion that the Trump Administration is addressing it adequately now after the failures of the Obama administration to see what Ukraine represent\nI think sending traveling anti tank missiles to Kiev instead of socks and blankets is is a very a serious improvement from the Obama years so yes and uh the personalities while making the decisions not just in the White House but but elsewhere for example the gender of the joint chiefs general dumped it\nFully appreciate that uh\nUh KGB

business let's do this yes\nThe Kremlin has never work like that whether it was run by a song whether it was run by stalling or by KGB total\nSo we now have the requisite knowledge and understanding that these are bad actors not the Soviet Union this is a nation in ... in demographic and economic collapse\nBut a nation that will constantly endeavor to create Eddie is will that will wins and we'll

Gray's though that's just wrapping on on old phones irregular warfare what is different is the combination and the serious ... the seriousness with which they apply irregular warfare\nEverything is in direct the focus is on the will on the non kinetic they'll send in a little green men eventually but we now know unclassified open source that prior to the Crimean intervention\nRussia had been undermining the Ukrainian nation state for a\nDecade with sub Bush and with uh other means of television they were ... they were so they say yes they were preaching propaganda millions of dollars worth of propaganda being pushed into the region into the Baltic region as well right now so it it is\nIt is the comprehensive this of their understanding of\nIrregular warfare that is the danger\nWhen you got to the national defense university ah as the son of a man who fought the Soviets did you perceive that they saw Russia and Russia's action Russia's very good at this and always has that did they see it\nI have to admit when I arrived a there was that you could take many courses on two cities right you could take many courses on Guadalcanal\nAnd and the the the most modern thing you could do the most relevant thing you could do is take courses on the Balkan Wars of the Nineteen nineties so it was it was an aspect of the the syllabus of the J shape you meet the drawing professional military education system was kind of frozen in the Nineteen nineties but this is during\nThe Bush administration when you're ... and the Obama administration did not improve on them off

ISIS\nBecause when you were in the campaign ISIS was understood by the Obama administration as an excess ... ex essential threat that we have to live with a generational Fred I I\nIt's flabbergasted to review the language at the time I guess I can argue that they were so burned by their collapse in Libya they didn't want to engage anything else that\nPredated that predated the collapse of Libya if you think about the fact\nSo I just won a illustration that near the end of the administration those are very there's a speech the president gave a press conference with those uh\nOvertones of petras where he said what difference is it what I call the threat do you remember that yeah so this is actually addressing candidate Trump bought differences at what I call the threat\nWas clearly in twenty eleven it made a big difference to the Obama administration because in twenty eleven before ISIS befall it'd be before the collapse of Syria\nThe White House decreed in a memo to the shadow of the joint chiefs and to the attorney general that you must not use the word jihad and you must not mentioned Islam in all federal counterterrorism training of federal agents or the U.S armed

call themselves jihadist that was the schizophrenia of the Obama use\nAnd candidate Trump and then transition president elect Trump and then President Trump addressed directly to his military we when

I have your back yes I'm back to the politics of you in a campaign\nHere you are making a case we know now your first book and defeating jihad and now the new book why we fight you're making a case

alternative they need somebody who is going to put New York first think about New York at health in New York not my challenger who is on everybody's top ten list for running for president\nOn it is outrageous a million people have left New York since the last census which isn't any great surprise when property taxes are the highest in New York and uh by county than they are any other state\nUm it's crazy and us tax bill really hurt high tax states like my\nMy in my state of New York and your state of Connecticut quite a bit because there wasn't anybody there fighting for this\nElimination

press on on this issue\nWhat you're saying is so common sense circle and your campaigning against the Democratic machine that counts on higher and higher and higher taxes what do you hear on the trail from New Yorkers who pay these taxes are they aware of how out of step New York is with their ... with other states\nSadly they are aware and they are proving it with their feet I mean I'm constantly

welcome mocked Tom he's the c._e._o. of energy to fuel this is the story of uranium in America in twenty eight team mark a very good evening to you you are trading on the New York stock exchange traded in\nI Believe that ts acts as well you have uranium mines and you also produce the navy but I Want to concentrate on the Iranian mines because this is a story from the twentieth century\nWhere are your minds and where are your production facilities right now in America and how much are they producing of what the United States needs for uranium good evening to you um are\nYou know a good day to you John um I mean we have a number of projects that are located and mainly in the four corners region of the United states but we have projects from the state of Wyoming or down south through Colorado\nI'm Utah Arizona New Mexico into Texas so right now we have a three production centers that are actually producing of an eight or ... or and two of those are are producing as we speak\nThat Nichols ranch I in Wyoming a ... white may say in Utah and also ... in Texas\nYes the only one that's on standby is all tomatoes in Texas\nAnd you have uranium mines around these production facility so how does it physically work I've never visited uranium mine ... mine and new truck and where does it go\nWell we we we have um the the three production centers are are are have are different is that a couple of ways that we have conventional facilities where you actually physically mind drill and blast the the the or\nI'm transported to the processing facility in this case is white Mason meal where it's conventionally protest um which is crushing grinding and chemical extracting uranium orbit ATM within our project in Wyoming and in Texas are called is set to recovery and it's such a recovery is where you actually\nDissolve the uranium in place in the ground you actually don't physically mind is so so they're they're two different methodologies and about half the uranium United States is in in in the world actually is mind by both methods so about fifty percent is either conventional or it's such a recovery\nAnd your company's doing very well and people can participate but there's a lot but the body as how much does the United states need in uranium and how much does the U.S produce and where do we get it\nYeah well the um United States the largest consumer uranium the world of between power generation which was about twenty percent of our electric power in the\nUnited States and then you have the nuclear navy um my a calculation\nWe consume about one third of the poll uranium consumed in in the world\nUm but but just for power generation lonely because the actual use for the military is classified um but for power generation alone we consume about fifty million pounds\nOf uranium per year for power generation now currently a worldly Marty in a a ... percent of our requirements which is a shocking shortfall\nBecause Russia that's coming in from imports from both our allies but also from a number of a former or a communist countries like Russia or it cause Exxon or its allies and um it was ... even China so um\nThat is why we filed a section two thirty to petition to limit or imports of uranium primarily from uh allies with a former Soviet Union\nLet me restate that is if I understand this doesn't sound commonsense ago we're importing the uranium we need for our nuclear plants and our nuclear fleet we're importing it from Russia and from China\nOr unless something changed that tells me our supply chain is in the hands of our fellows correct\n[noise] well yeah I mean that's that's the point of our petition is is the United states the United states as the largest consumer of uranium in the world\nUm is is are we ready to turn over the reins to um you know to those countries you know I I I don't\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne as over one hundred brand new Ford Escape

start a producing a gym again we we last produced avium in two thousand Thirteen\nA we actually mine the ore are in the surrounding mines and the district and we transport it by truck as I mentioned earlier\nAbout this initial campaign were actually recover even atrium that is in solution I entertain these facilities\nThat are holding paws so we're very excited about this is the demand for an ATM climbing\nA the demand is climbing a quite substantially probably six seven percent per year\nAnd um the price of an ATM has the increase from\nA brown four five six dollars per pound to three years ago up to north of twenty dollars per pound so um it's you hear a lot of talk about the battery elements hum metals a you know like lithium graphite\nCobalt or will the navy I Am a is sort of the next to the cue when it comes from an energy renewable energy storage uh type metal\nUh but still at this they currently the largest consumption is for our voice and and ah there's currently a a news owning a in China this requiring the rebar\nUh to be a certain strength and it's very difficult to achieve that without using but avium so there's a new source of demand which is the rebar and the way into\nBatteries back to your conversation with the Trump Administration about uranium\nWe need much more uranium than the United states is now producing your the number one producer of uranium in the country so what can be done what is the department of commerce I'm looking into what is the investigation tell us\nWell we we we follow the petition and and we asked for two things we asked for a quota another Tara quota\nThat the United states should produce at least twenty five percent of the requirements\nAre from domestic sources to allow enough critical mass so that we actually have a uranium mining industry sustainable in the United states we also asked for by American uranium and and you know the the administration has his you know by American\nOr in the first place so that fits in nicely with with our request so\nUh but it's just it's a quota and it's a buy America the uranium and the key here is to maintain a healthy\nUh funding and the fuel cycle that does not put us dependent on ah the forest sorcery uranium primarily from these uh uh you know countries that are associated with former Soviet Union\nAnd mark we just we have less than a minute here uh do do are follows China and Russia did they subsidize their uranium industry in order to out compete\n... yes they do I mean the the Russia and China and they have national programs that support the nuclear fuel cycle\nAnd the United states used to but it no longer has that so that's why it's so important right now because if if if we allow the nuclear fuel cycle to completely go way and the United states ah countries like Russia and China are not going to lead there's go way they're going to continue to advance for\nMark ... is the c._e._o. of energy fuels and traded publicly more to the point

what's Vandenberg stating mother went to space sports but they need Vandenberg right now is because you really cannot do solo synchronous orbits these orbits around the polls from Kennedy\nBecause

they built a land landing site literally right next to the launch pad literally within sight within fifty four hundred two hundred yards of it and they brought that uh that first stage back it was a block five first stage which is the first\nThat that finally the ration their how this was that gold if they get it to land right next to launch pad they could turn it around and maybe launch within

putting more money and do the scheduling low launches with the interim upper stage which isn't as powerful and if there is even handset they're going to discontinue work on that more powerful upper stage\nThis is only after maybe five years of work on that more powerful upper stage spending lots and lots of money and they've just decided that can't afford to build it so they'll go with the ... stage\nThere during this process so I on the road put this up on behind the black and they quote the vice president and program manager space launch system for Boeing and he makes this statement\nI'm

war team that's going to show up and\nThis is a turf war within the bureaucracy um you know Trump is pushing for a new space Boston so the military bureaucracy\nIs putting forth all kinds of falls about what they should do [noise] um\nI'm not sure even plan is a good while on both of that one of them from the agency from the military itself suggests creating an agency that they say a smaller and will be more lean Michael Griffin who is for them and that's certainly a straight who's now been put in\nA on our secretary of defense for research and engineering Mike\n... yes and he was basically fit into the space area it's supposed to be there to deal with military space he's proposing a different idea which would create a new space agency for the military with the staff of a hundred and twelve people and I have to say when reading just initial report it seemed like his was more bloated than the other I'm not sure which is right\nUm ... the one thing that Griffin was doing that the military proposed\nAir force secretary Heather Wilson hell yes as well to\nThat she's in charge so Griffin was pushing law the threat to trends that transition the military to using private commercial assets rather than building it's all and uh\nBut his apparent love to build his own empire here might work against that goal I'm not sure which works I I once again my real reservations about the state's forces that I'm worried it's going to just turn into a a big bureaucracy that won't really accomplish very much they just simply need to consolidate the ups and\nBob you're not thinking of us we need our space uniforms we need patches of merchandise we need all those things you're trying to bypass Bob it's Washington they only build empires that is what they do\nI Know this is the tragedy that's why I have reservations about the whole idea I'm not sure they're going to ... that the people who work in Washington to my mind the bureaucrats they're all very little interested in the national interest nowadays the only thing they seem to be interested in it appears to me is their own agency interests\nAnd they read as a national interest can go to act by Bob\nYeah I I have to get that uniform and the patch and so if they need to build an empire to get to it All right fine we go now to China because there's news on Chang eat for this is the next lunar
