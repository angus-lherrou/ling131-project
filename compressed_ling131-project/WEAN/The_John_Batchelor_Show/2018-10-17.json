well worth exploring I welcome Josh ...\nRiding global opinion for the Washington Post and we start not with the mystery of the missing perhaps murdered\nA journalist for the Washington Post in the Saudi embassy in Istanbul we start with the number one hundred and ten billion dollars of arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nAnnounced claimed asserted by the Trump Administration that is part of the mystery of ...\nJosh I'm very good evening to you one hundred and ten billion dollars sizeable and the president was commenting on it most recently in his interview with sixty minutes\nThis hundred and ten billion dollars is a guaranteed is Congress part of this conversation about Saudi Arabia are arms sales are GDP our jobs and the murder of a journalist good evening to\nWell good evening John the issue of us arms sales to Saudi Arabia is back in the news because members of\nCongress in both parties in both chambers have are looking for ways to exert pressure on the Saudi regime to give up information about the disappearance of ... and uh this is the thing that they think that they can use to\nUm at at least try to convince the Saudis to reveal what they know and uh participate in a investigation and the way that she has laid on his disappearance now going on over two weeks and of\nCourse when president was asked about this immediately said no no no we can't do that you know his excuse is reasons were that it would affect us jobs and that Saudi Arabia might\nTurn to us rivals like Russia and China are but it's also important to note that President Trump likes these arms sales because he helps them as a major achievement in the U.S Saudi Arabia relationship that he introduced himself a mostly because when he went to Riyadh on his first ever trip abroad last year\nThey this is what the big announcement was this was the big deliver ... this is what he says itchy now if you look at it that a hundred and ten billion dollars is grossly exaggerated\nSome of it it feels that have been in the pipeline to the Obama administration summit are aspirational deals that may or may not ever materialize and then there's a small subset of that where those deals are actually moving but those deals that are actually moving are now in limbo because they have to go through a congressional process to and there's no way that in this current environment without\nSome sort of resolution to the question of the Saudi regime Roland is your most parents that\nCongress is going to let this happen now what I argued today in the Washington Post very simple as that you know whether or not you believe that our arms sales to Saudi Arabia represents leverage that we could use to pressure them what President Trump is done by taking it off the table by saying that actually\nKnow this is something that we need from the study is he's completely reverse that dynamic he's turned it into Saudi leverage on us\nFor no particular reason that I can see you and you know what that's done is sort of now ... states in a position where any country who is telling us arms has it easy\nGet out of jail free card whenever they run afoul of something that we believe violates

of his quiver disappears a genuine geostrategic paradox Josh I mentioned that staying with Riad we also have to deal with Iran\nWe also have to deal with Ankara and then there is the Gulf Cooperation council so there are cross purposes in all directions as we go forward I cheat on the hundred and ten billion dollars of arms sales because that is a way of supporting what is our all ally in the contest with the wrong\nAnd I've puzzled by Congress and that contest putting pressure on Saudi Arabia doesn't taboos Tehran isn't that also a factor here in addition to the money\nWell you're right there's no doubt that a U.S Saudi diplomatic flare up\nUndermines this trip administrations main\nDiplomatic initiative right now which is to coalesce coalition supports pushback against Iran's malign influence cut off around in oil which depends on the Saudis pumping more oil and given that we're not working with the Europeans on that really you know the goal fees are the ones that are going to have that\nCame up with us this Iran strategy that Trump is already announced an already done is is ... it has any chance of being a success\nSo yes it's a pickle you know there is no clear way out of this for the Trump Administration their tactic right now it seems to be uh to to try to avoid you coming to the point where they have to make a decision whether or not to punish the Saudis if and when we actually discovered that they did this thing to me that they have this thing\nUm it undermines struck the ministries land to\nRoll out of a Middle East peace plan because that Middle East peace plan is based according to the White House on getting Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf countries to throw in and also undermines the effort that chair 'cause you're always talks about to build the middle east security alliance an Arab NATO out\nThe critics they made us racial will say that all of these policies were destined to fail your\nAnyway the Palestinians are not going to come to the table while the Trump restrictions punishing them there's very little chance Iran is going to come back to the table negotiated deal and Saudi Arabia itself blew up the idea\nSo to speak their choice of words you of having a Middle East NATO when they started embargo against cuts are so you know if you believe that there was a reasonable chance ... ministers are pulling off his hat trick of really complicated difficult policies the middle east\nYou have to see that this crisis hurts their ability to do all sorts of things that you can understand why the White House is resisting dealing with his head on\nJosh it's possible we've been on this road for some time and the reports from Yemen about the indiscriminate bombing and the aggression by the by the surrogates for Saudi Arabia for Riyadh\nHave been have have troubled Congress for a long time and it looks like that's all now galvanized with the murder of the journalists but it isn't it isn't an isolated complain about Saudi Arabia\nRight and you know the there is no doubt that there are some\nA lot of people who already had issues with us Saudi relationship we are now taking the opportunity of this crisis to push forward an agenda they are the worst namely to break up the he was Saturday alliance in ... that but when you add that to the people who are genuinely\nConcerned about the disappearance of Jamal which are a lot of people that begins to create a momentum that could actually have the effect of changing me was that it really we don't know\nHow it's all going to turn out or you know it's sort of Americans generally gives the government a pass to do things or national security that have collateral damage and you know that doesn't really affect American\nSoldiers right so if the Saudis are killing a lot of innocent people in Yemen you know there there's not a big likelihood that your your average American and therefore average congressman is going to raise a big snake out of that but when something like this happening I can sometimes have the effect of wrong the public's attention\nTo our ally Saudi Arabia and the ... just practice is on a range of friends in a unique way crystallize is it for people okay and this is kind of blend\nThe relationships change and when you know a a a small movement in Congress to stop the set us aid to Saudi Arabia and being in war to really gained momentum and I think that's what you're saying\nHappening right now ... for the Washington Post Tom ... or this is the John ...\n[noise]\nDid you have your house for sale this last year and it didn't sell

Richard\nKnow this book you're talking about changes in temperature at the global level now which are running in under ten degrees a tenth of a degree in a year would be an enormous civil\nWar is is that it's just in the last Eighteen years the increase has probably been in the order of about one tenth of the great now I was standing at Thirteen percent increase in carbon dioxide levels what really determines forest fires are a bunch of other things like the much of a\nBasically fungible material ... material burn up all material which gathers and if\nYou were to improve the management the public lands for example would make that much greater difference and the severity of forest fires than trying to do anything for global warming\nThe contrast between fires on private lands which are very low and on public managed lands are very very great if you look at the aggregate I I went back and check some of these now as far as far as it down globally about Seventy or eighty percent from what they were around Nineteen hundred\nIt's a striking decline that is going on and so is every you don't want to look at a dramatic incident that day but you have to do is to get aggregate data and the aggregate\nData doesn't support the claim that the fire system is going out of control and to the extent that there are changes the thought that somehow other would want to change the entire economy instead of figuring out how to manage farce than a more sensible fashion\nIs wildly older brought you're looking at the wrong thing there are now solutions that would work better either way you build houses the kind of clear as you're doing so for many many things that could be done to deal with fires without having to have the kinds of transformation that the PCC is talking\nAbout hurricanes so our side clones the allegation is made that they will deepen an increase in severity and striking the land you provide a chart in your defining ideas piece\nThat suggests we're not looking at increases we're looking at cycles and this goes back to Nineteen Seventy I'm going to guess that if we go back even farther anecdotally will see the same cycle\nYes generally speaking the data gets a little bit spot here's who go earlier but it's the same thing and\nThere were huge hurricanes in Nineteen forty five I still remember living through hurricane hazel in Nineteen fifty for not attributed to global warming the worst storm ever to hit mainland United States is still the Galveston hurricane of Nineteen thirty of Nineteen hundred oh there are pictures of\nHouston being flooded and twenty six Tina twenty Seventeen they're also pictures of Houston being flooded in Nineteen thirty five\nAnd they're essentially the same kind of fiction the cyclical phenomena are pretty much uniform with respect to everything that we look at and the basic problem the global warming theorists is\nIf in fact you have all these things going up and down up and down you can't explain the ups and downs by a movement than carbon dioxide levels which has been consistently but gradually up with over very long period of time so you've got to get other forces to explain what's going on\nWhen Richard Lyndon gave his lecture in England but he says you know they're a bunch of other forces like water vapor was for example that can be doing it and there are other things that are local which do this so if you're trying to figure out the way in which the system works\nIt's a terrible mistake to assume that the only independent very would you have any source or significance is carbon dioxide\nThe dependent variable is temperature or what happens is there is a law known as a rainiest this law which says that given certain sensitivity assumptions as carbon dioxide changes you take the law for them to the base to the base the um it means that you're gonna get a slower\nThan linear increase in the amount of carbon dioxide but that's everything else being equal but the moment you realized that water vapor is probably the more powerful greenhouse gas\nAnything you do to change what's happening to carbon dioxide may be able to fix a fifth of the problem but it's not going to touch the other eighty percent of that particular problem so the return from investments are going to be lower\nAnd you don't see anything whatsoever in the ... the\nStudies that I've looked at which kind of try to do an intelligent of cost benefit analysis of where we go my own do all this stuff is uh if you could basically have orderly technological progress on based upon other kinds of considerations\nIn the end if you reduce the amount of pollution if in the end you managed to increase the overall\nEfficiencies of all the legal or the business infrastructure systems we have this

resigned as of December and there was a virtual\nLove then at the White House she went to the oval office she in Trump publicly\nLoved each other it was very smiley he was so glad she had served but interestingly he didn't look very unhappy she was leaving and I think we ought to ask ourselves because the media and Alice as of this has been that\nShe was an easy with Trump She has hope for a major political career perhaps running for the presidency eventually and it was ... she leaves were glory but I don't think that's an accurate analysis because during the time she was there\nAnd we discussed some examples on your broadcast she has said\nThings about Russia and also by the way about North Korea\nCompletely conflicting with what Trump himself has said this is very unusual because they are United in a UN ambassador normally very faithfully reflects the will of the president you would agree with that yes and yet why Trump is saying that it would be great to cooperate\nWith

Reagan's part he was then president that his very hard line rhetoric Cold War rather wreck actually could lead to nuclear war he never thought that was possible Reagan hated the idea of nuclear war and that's what began to turn Reagan as he would later say\nTo wait for a Soviet leader ready to do big time any Cold War detente with him\nReagan later complain when he asked why it took so long and he's right Soviet leaders kept dying on him because after Brezhnev died in eighty to ... uh uh I'm drawing of who you've talked about becomes leader\nAnd died in eighty five I had the uh with all the year thank you Steve he bought\nOff of the point is and drop of already was suffering\nKidding me the writer he was on dialysis\nI Know about dialysis my mother had kidney and it's three days a week on dialysis you can't be a leader on dialysis that's probably why the other show the leaders wanted him they knew he couldn't\nBecome a strong leader and then he was succeeded by a leader Chang is

sixty four eighty four when she met him\nMore than that he was literally living in a hospital doing is business as the new general secretary and I think he lasted Thirteen months I mean we're we we divert from the story but it's worth reminding ourselves that at that moment I studied this very carefully man in the early eighties\nAfter the death a resident of and Nineteen eighty two right the Soviet leadership did not want a strong leader they were becoming geriatric they didn't want a vigorous leader who would replace them\nSo they kept choosing literally dying that and Gorbachev at fifty three enrolled last one of them said when it was clear that they couldn't stop Gorbachev he is criminally young criminal you're young they were already\nApproaching eighty so we divert from the story of that but it raises the it also points to another moment when intelligence agencies can have exceedingly important political influence at the top and that is when there's opposition to the leader

there and CIA here or FBI around my five or am I six are not ambitious in a similar fashion if they think the country has lost the argument against the opponent\nAnd that raises the question for the rest of us\nI don't know that we can say that intelligence services\nIn Russia in the u._k. in the United states and Saudi Arabia elsewhere are playing a bigger role than they ever played in history before I wouldn't say that I don't know enough but I Would say that they're it's clear you and I'm now agree that they are playing a very big role today\nThey are not a constitutional branch of our

in Nineteen Seventy five in the Senate there was the famous bipartisan church committee investigation\nInto the CIA operations ah it published a five or six by a report in Nineteen Seventy six it was for a bipartisan that is in the mid seventies concerned about what the CIA was doing I become so great\nThat the two political parties including conservative Republicans did a major investigation and

we're following the mid term [noise]\nThe midterms in Arizona turn out to be especially colorful\nBecause the Democratic candidate for the Senate hopeful\nLouis told well I Believe in that it's a very competitive race\nAgainst mix Sally she has a colorful past that connects with Andrew McCarthy's experience as a prosecutor against the cutthroat sisters back in the late twentieth century especially a man named Omar Abdel rock and no longer with us\nAnd an attorney who at the time Lynn Stewart within the news all the time I missed is Andy this was amazing to me when you published a piece of National Review online because I followed Lynn Stewart\nAnd to call her radical lawyers an understatement I did not know that she intersected with now Democratic Senate hopeful in Arizona\nKirsten Sinema how is their ... what is their connection in the past and Lynn Stewart is no longer with us so we have to speak for her good evening to Andy\nGood evening John well after the blind shake was convicted Lyn uh got herself\nIn her own mess Lynn by the way had been the ones who were had been the blind shakes a main defense lawyer at our prosecution of him and his a jihadist cohort in Nineteen Ninety five\nAnd then in a in the late nineties lend got herself\nJammed up as it were a for helping the blind shake get messages communicated from him in his prison confinement to his Egyptian terrorist organization the lot all is Loni or the Islamic group or in Egypt and Lynn herself\nEnded up being prosecuted for material support to terrorism\nIn a ... the year two thousand two two thousand three uh and and so going forward and that is where she intersects with Kirsten Sinema who hosted her\nA at a couple of events at Arizona State university where the cinema was studying law in two thousand three\nTwo thousand three that the intersection and at the time Lynn Stewart was not a small story maybe in New York it was a very large story would there have been reason to believe that Arizona was full import of formed of Lynn stores activity\nOh John the whole reason that she was being hosted is because she was as you say a very big story she was a big national story and she was a ... of the uh\nOf the radical left which pretended that she was being prosecuted for her labor's as a defense lawyer for the blind shake which interestingly and to me amusing way a ... is the\nStory that are missing them a is sticking with I guess we should call representative cinema she's a congresswoman from the nights district of uh of Arizona [noise] ah but you know she continues\nTo contend that ah they were simply protecting or arguing in favor of due process\nAnd lower against the prosecution of Lynn Stewart because it was in a way criminalizing the work of a criminal defense lawyer which is an absurd position to take by the time Lynn\nWas transmitted messages for the blonde shake\nOut of the prison a blind shake have long been convicted his appeals had run all of his ability to appeal to the court or for any relief or had passed and Lynn was not performing the shake was not an accused ... under American law\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model flood pays more than any dealer around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours more gone too far I car buyers are tough\nWater now representative center of our hope to get out of this arrangement [noise]\nI think she'd like to stick our head in the sand and and protecting the rich been there for ... actually um I think this is a quote this is a situation\nA fatty is where um she was trying to put herself on the map\nPolitically and in her community and the ah the way to do that at the time was to appeal to her fellow radicals and then when she thought that it was a expedient in Arizona or to to change spots\nAs it were in order to rise politically uh she met a more focused as a\nI'm a I guess you would call a moderate progressive and that's the uh sheep's clothing she's been in ever since the problem for her I think is that\nShe's now trying to go for statewide office rather than just her uh her her place that she had in the ninth a district in\nArizona and so Rice's much more competitive there are many more eyes on it there's a lot more money involved in it and her her past is catching up with her\nLet's be very specific Andy for people who are not less with us in the late twentieth century the blind shake he was convicted for participating in the attacks the first attack on the world Trade Center\nAnd those that attack did not lead to mass casualties it could have as I recall that explosion was capable of causing mass casualties it did not bring down the building because maybe we just got lucky the first time\nThat's exactly right John it was a fourteen hundred pound\nChemical explosive that the jihadists are not only composed with an idea of I'm knocking one of the towers of the of the world Trade Center as it appeared at the time into the other tower or they also attempted to air raid\nCyanide in the course of the explosion they had hydrogen tanks Senate and a cyanide or which\nThe bomb\nAnd the idea was that when it exploded the hope was that the tanks would explode and they would be able to kill people not only at the epicenter of the explosion but also very remote they were hoping to kill tens of thousands of people and the fact that they only killed six remains one of the\nUh really major miracles of modern time\nAnd it's not it's not rational to conclude that cinema did not know this connection between the blind shake and the attempted mass murder of Americans and her hosting stores that would have been entirely available for send them at the time\nI think the only reason that land was notable John was because of that\nRepresentation and and the reason that she was particularly famous or infamous depending on your perspective of it at the time was because\nShe was under indictment this was very publicly known a she was under indictment for helping the blind shake basically run his Egyptian terrorist organization so if you would go through the the uh the labor is of hosting her or it would be because she had this notoriety\nOr minutes at ... go ahead\n[noise] sounds very or can we shared a radical ... we saw her up six where the lawyer who does something wrong or quite sure does something wrong then becomes a cause for what the left as soon as an allergist and the situation doesn't it\nNot only does that he is I think that Lynn had her roots in ... in precisely that ... the writer lawyers have been Ninety six she worked closely with ah with Bill counselor who of course was one of the\nLawyers on the Chicago Seven um so yeah I Do it all goes back I think for the same thing\nAndrew McCarthy riding the national Review Online this is about a Senate contest that is right now we're looking at the midterms\nA curse in cinema is the Democratic Senate hopeful and a mixed mixed Sally a market and make Sally is that correct Saturdays Martha Martha ... is the Republican candidate but Andrew McCarthy has done is the favor of connecting some of the dots that perhaps\nMiss

telescope\nLeaving nothing for replacements for these so war costs telescopes Hubble you know we know what's happened with the Web it's been it's now a decade behind schedule and it's cost has gone up

through Nineteen sixty one he's fired again it takes up a command in Italy but Conrad is a\nA very typical great war general um none of these generals in any power had seen uh much in the way of fighting because ah except for colonial campaigns that just hadn't been a great war since the Franco ... war of Eighteen Seventy so\nThey they were all on blooded they were all quite theoretical outlook and Conrad you know like ... in France\nLike egg and Great Britain was it you know with someone who wrote about about tactics who wrote about warfare and yeah that's how he made his name he was considered a bright young thing a he had been a staff officer during the occupation of Bosnia and Eighteen Seventy eight then he climbed ... through the general staff\nThe general staff have been run for decades by an old boon companion of the emperor's named a free drink back\nWho was a long serving general staff chief till he was finally ousted by the Archduke and replaced with Conrad at Nineteen oh five\nBut a ... in in in Beck's general staff Conrad was a really hard working guy who you know took on a lot of the hard jobs in proved himself in staff work but he he really knew nothing about men do nothing about leading men he knew nothing about organizing men\nAnd he didn't know anything about the hard realities that war imposes on leadership\nHe had one and he had one right well let's let's compare him to a rival if we can't find someone in the twenty first century TRL his\nRival at the time was ... was another guy who will be his principles figure in this story and his name as general all scar puts your and put your was another one of these general staff officers around the same age as Conrad\nWho'd grown up in this back general staff doing the hard work of the lazy senior leadership\nAnd uh you know building solid portfolios but again someone who had never had any real combat experience someone whose experience of war was entirely theoretical someone who is qualifications were entirely bureaucratic\nAnd this is sort of the thing about Conrad and put your their qualifications or you're a crowd of these guys built little empires inside the so called grey house the old war ministry building which has the general staff as well\nAnd they built these very powerful cliques that had powerful mentors and the case of Conrad the Archduke Franz Ferdinand in the case of posts York old general Frederick back who is the best friend of the emperor the movie it was known in the public mouth is the vice and purr of Australia was so powerful\nAnd yet neither man had ever really been an action neither man had any idea what the war would actually be like and when the war actually broke out and they were exposed to the hard realities and the friction of it all they proved utterly incompetent at reacting\nMentally and intelligently the problem with Conrad overhaul is that he was a deeply flawed personality\nWho he was a widower\nBut he was you know he was still young enough to be interested in sex in marriage\nAnd instead of just finding a nice you know Vietnamese flour to settle down with\nHe settled on the wife of a very wealthy businessman and carried on this semi public affairs in the way the lay of the you know the way of the early twentieth century the businessman made a calculation he was an arms merchant he ran a couple of big\nFactories that made guns and ammunition I had big contracts with the government he thought hey this might be good for business if my wife has an affair with general Conrad so he tolerated but you know someone like the Archduke who is you know a very pious very Roman Catholic\nHated the idea that his hand picked general staff she was carrying on an extramarital affair but anyway\nSo uh but you know Conrad just proved as he was a defective personality who was in love with this woman I show throughout this book about how throughout the war he's just only distracting\nLet us go to war with
