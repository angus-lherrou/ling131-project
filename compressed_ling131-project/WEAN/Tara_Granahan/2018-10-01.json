I think that if you know it might come\nDown to just that it's not that they were in court right or wasn't some kind of an inauguration where you use the Bible but just for a congressional or Senate hearing they don't use them probably\nI can look it up I don't know Joe ...\nThat might be a new president I don't know I I'm trying to remember\nOthers and I'm trying to remember what's the last hearing that we sat and watched through um I don't I don't I can look it up until I can tell you I don't I don't know certainly when somebody you know it was getting sworn into office they've got a a Bible or they also have\nWhen you're in court you know stand up for it until the whole truth nothing but the truth I don't know if if they if maybe Joe was thinking they took it out of this situation but I don't know if this is they're not in court there in a Senate hearing\nUh it's it's not you know everything you say you know you better be telling the truth in front of the Senate that kind of a thing huh All right for three eight nine seven seven six four three eight WPRI we have judge Robert Flanders coming up\nHe of course as a Republican challenging democratic senator\nSheldon Whitehouse if he's going to add to that plus he's been a sitting ... you know he's been a judge for many years so he knows the ins and outs and I'm also going to a wonder if anything comes out of the I guess you could call it the fake story that fake news\nThat made its way through the office of Senator Sheldon Whitehouse to the FBI to judge Kavanaugh and then the guy said oh I I I made it up I didn't mean it I was confused I don't know who on earth would want to insert themselves in this story and then also of course the third accuser of judge Kavanaugh\nThe woman who said he was involved in rape parties was present there and she went back multiple times um she is now being dissected of course through the media and through the opposition as having a lot of 'em and involvement in legal issues are legal cases\nUh memories play tricks and people can't naturally remember things so it's very difficult and the law in a legal proceeding would not even in most cases let let these claims to see the light of day because of that very reason\nSo this is I'm just coincidental timing right but you're in a in a race in Europe putting a lot of time and energy and I would imagine money into this race to unseat Sheldon Whitehouse he's now\nOne of the key you know people that are being focused on one of the key lawmakers rather um because of his line of questioning whether you think it's funny or not\nBut here's the backstory this this this fake person right because we were looking at a Twitter account who has apologized for saying hey I Know about another incident in Newport on a boat with these two guys and a woman and I went over there and beat him up the next day because they attacked her and one of them happened to be you know this is according to the\nStory that went out\nHe contacts Senator Sheldon Whitehouse his office and that for all we can understand is Senator Whitehouse then takes it to the FBI but also to a reporter somewhere\nWell that's where that's where he really went off the rails because I think it was a dishonorable of him to do that he was trying to feed a media frenzy over this whole situation instead of just living the investigatory process take its course by having the FBI or the Senate committee look into this\nHe also simultaneously apparently sense at all since his him off to a ... a reporter to investigate this supposedly but knowing that once you get it in the hands of the reporter the story is going to come out before it's been vetted before it's been investigated and not surprisingly it turns out to be\nA a false accusation men re cans a yet in the meantime it as a to um the ah the Lynch mob mentality around this a candidate\nSo any kind of legal issues or what kind of a or sanction what what can happen to some of the White House if in fact\n... I don't know anything could happen the sooner the White House but this person who made the false claim a ... is in trouble because Senator Grassley has referred him too\nRhode Island's number one for dealer is setting the standard I get it again flood board as over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine Vermont flood as every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nTo to look into these things and not just assumed that because somebody makes an accusation well it must be true\nI have all the sympathy in the world for an understanding for\nWhy women don't many women who have been the victims of these sexual abuse situations do report them right away but we can't assume that just because someone makes an accusation particularly one that's uh this old uh decades and a half without ever being reported\nA or complained about that is necessarily true and particularly when it's a criminal accusation it's very important that um\nThe American tradition of uh of respecting an accused person as innocent until proven guilty be honored\nAnd also that the the accuser bears the burden of proof\nTo make this accusation a stick\nAnd so that's a that's what the I think the Senate committee is grappling with\nIts wow it's uh it it is a\nMulti layered kind of a I guess the story or side of that were involved in what would you would you be surprised or did you think at any moment that a judge Kavanaugh would step aside and say I can't I don't want to do this to my family anymore at my my reputation did you think any of that can happen in the beginning I thought it might well I think\nIt was it was a possibility because I don't think he believed that this would be one of the outcomes of the hearing and who wants to put themselves or their family or through the sort of an ordeal particularly when these charges or\nA in his view totally a fabricated or false or in his case so I think once uh his integrity and honor and his conduct was be submerged by these allegations he said look I I've gone to defend this to the hills\nAnd I think they do that in part at least explains\nA the anger and demeanor that he displayed at the hearings where he he fought back a rather vigorously and perhaps overzealous lead to some of the questioning but\nIn the context of his reputation of being destroyed by these folks because let's face it no matter what the outcome if even if he was appointed to the Supreme Court\nAh perhaps half as many as half of the people in the country are still going to suspect that perhaps he did do what he was accused of a because we will never are likely to get to the bottom of what really happened here and so that's the unfortunate outcome of this whole situation\nIf nothing else I'm speaking with judge Robert ... the Republican candidate for US Senate hearing what island if nothing else comes out this week while the FBI is doing whatever they have got to do\nA and it and we're in the same position or we've got the knowledge that we have we've got the testimony that we have we've got the women's version of events that we have would you if you were sitting senator vote for him\nI Would because as I said I I think uh the allegation here has not been corroborated will confirm yet it may yet be a perhaps but to date it hasn't been in fact it seems to be refuted by the people that are the accuser says we're in the in the room or at the event\nUh she can't see where it happened doesn't know how she got there how she got home or they're just so many sketchy details about this whole accusation and well something may have happened to her uh it doesn't I don't think she's proven that this individual was the responsible person so\nA given his exemplary a career\nOr as an adult as a judge as a father as a coach as a law professor\nA so all all and all of his record us for thirty five years or in public life at the highest levels of our government or to have it be undone by an unproven allegations I think is a bit much\nAnd to flip the story here to flip the coin if in fact something comes up and I don't know mark judge comes out of wherever he is down to the beach house somewhere or maybe the woman that was at the party who says she might have some medical situation that she's dealing with if it's in fact something comes out\nTo further prove Dr Ford side of you know this story\nThen do you say you know what this this isn't worth it if we vote him through then then what they did then you have to go back you know they can get get him outta there would wonder what any then I mean how does that work\nIf if uh if it ever were to be shown a proven that he was lying to the committee a and that this incident in fact it happened and he was responsible that of course\nNot only should not be appointed to the Supreme Court you ought to be booted off a the second highest court in the land that he's been sitting on for twelve years because um this this that itself would be a crime that he has committed so uh\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition at what for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred three on cars all make all models and incredible prices are going to flood auto John job now\nHis whole life is at stake it's not just as you may not be able to teach law you may not be able to coach we see which seems to like to do with young people um so it's not just the Supreme Court said since the this man's life is at stake and he's fighting for his life literally\nI was speaking with Robert Flanders stretch Flanders who was running for Senate a quick aside question uh someone called in and asked why they weren't putting their hand on a Bible in those hearings when they swear them and that's just in in court right well\nIt or even in court or people are given the opportunity to affirm a under penalties of perjury that they're going to be telling the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so that uh witnesses don't feel in particular cases where there might be religious objections that to the Bible they may not believe in God they may not\nBe over religion which would respect the Bible so to give some people leeway are often it's just some simply an affirmation under under oath or was knowledge that you're going to be subject to penalties of perjury rather than swearing on a Bible\nGot it All right that that should answer that question for the call I call them and I got some emails on it as well they have it All right we're going to come back we're going to catch up on the local race here and what's happening with Robert Flanders when we come back for three eight nine seven

well my father who's Ninety is an alcoholic and he still goes to AA meetings and Kevin I was going well did did did you know judge Kavanaugh saying well did you ever drink did you do it was very uncomfortable that bar where she's just like she's looking out I'm like I just told you that my father is still going to AA meetings and he's Ninety\nOr and and he just he was either highly offended or upset over the questioning and they went on and on it's a SNL Cindy scream and I like beer I like they're going like we have it\nJust went on and on but that's the takeaway I Know we're laughing and some some of you or not some of you or not I'm getting your email I Know where you're coming from but this is what was talked about all weekend I got into a couple of different I'm\nJust talking you know ... certainly no one was yelling but they too can you believe this and people this is like their own I I'm I ran into people that they're they're breaking it down better than the pundits on TV\nWell what about when she said this well what about when he said that what about his temperament what about you know how come she can not remember coming and going but you remember she only had one beer and what if she's got the wrong guys and and what about the second lady that's all I heard all weekend I was getting to the point where I Know I just got an email from someone who said I'm not saying because you know\nWe shouldn't be talking about well this is what everybody's talking about\nThis person this individual this judge\nCould heavy lifetime appointment\nAnd the highest court of our land\nSo while we are laughing to a certain extent and it was it was damn funny on Saturday Night live the portrayal because if you looked at it for if you can't you lead it from another planet and you watch those hearings you'd say well what are these people even talking about thirty six years ago\nBut I Know there's a lot of people out there that are taking this very very seriously on both sides so we will ah well let's play one more bit because I thought I did think that\nMatt Damon and I know you you may not follow down the lines of his political life he's very outspoken as far as politics he's very to the left is very liberal\nUm he did a really funny judge Kavanaugh I'm sure the cabinet they're not laughing although that woman that you just played Rachel draft was playing that senator and I'm blanking on her name\nWho's talked about her father being an alcoholic\nUm she got on social media and thanked the comedian the actress Rachel trash said boy that was a really good impersonation of me so at least you got a sense of humor 'cause she she he had to come back remember they took a break and judge Kavanaugh apologized to her thing you know I I think I was on the line there would ever say a when you were talking about your father\nAnd he kept saying well what about you did you did your blackout I mean that was his temperament could be called into question whether or not people want to line up with the fact you were going to say something Nick we're going to say your favorite part of that whole thing\nRiver bed quit did agree or the one part that made me were legitimate whoever wild ridges or did you ever been to many beers was a cool\nYeah yeah what does that make people yeah [noise] I listen I Know people are saying to me this is you know there's nothing funny about this um it's it's you know whether or not there was something you know a sexual crime you know so many years ago or if he just was that it you know maybe he just was a\nIt sounds to me and everybody can relate I think you know there was a group of Jacques right and you talk about it working out and doing labs that does that so and so's house with the father and they were all about you know getting all tuned up and and drinking beer and ...\nThat there's an element to that in high school and college and you can probably name your names from your class\nSeventy eight eighty to eighty four eighty five or ... you know the Yahoo's if you will that kind of paraded around they were the you know the tough cooled Jackie guys I mean we have to do is watch um\nEighty eight already was okay so eighty eight ... uses the term of what some folks say that he lied and wasn't about I Know sounds insane and this is what we're talking about it is what it's come to a either having sex with people or um\nFlatulence so it's a very short clip I think because she goes on to swear and we don't wanna put that out there but it was Julia Roberts she's all mad at her sister in the movie a who was a falling for the father of the kids she babysit for and she stood her up she was supposed to work for blah blah blah and she's yelling at her saying well you know this is what you're doing with the guy that you're\nHow would you like motor dredge twenty or gene trucks will be here for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty eight year for the last century the best for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars for a full year what board and he went into and there were gathered\nTogether anyway that's what I like [noise]\nIf I told you sound stupid it would sound sad to say if I have a decent area they're really old story at all [noise]\nDaddy boxing the babysitter so that's that's what people are saying that he was referring to it wasn't about uh you know flatulent it was about having sex and and people are saying that that is they feel he's lying under oath\nNow I don't know if this means a whole heck of a lot to you on a Monday morning ah but that's what people were talking about all weekend and they're flipping out about Senator Whitehouse his role in this and of course it's actually the winner in this whole thing is the man I was just speaking to in\nIn the studio is Robert Flanders he said he's got he this weekend he received\nMore donations and he could have thought about from people he never met before who watched the Kavanaugh hearings and saw Senator Sheldon Whitehouse asking about the yearbook and all these ... things\nAnd so he now he said he's in a great position he is benefiting from people in Arizona California Florida saying get that guy out of their here's a donation to you Bob planners so that's where the twist comes in now whether or not\nI'm Senator Whitehouse gets tangled up in this whole fake phony report from a man in Rhode Island who said oh something happened on a boat in Newport in Nineteen eighty five ah that also is you know having people yack about it and thinking they know maybe something more than they don't know\nAnd whether or not it can come to anything certainly the guy that made up the phony story can get into some kind of trouble he's being looked at a that's a dumb thing to do but the office of Senator Sheldon Whitehouse went to the press at the same time now does he get in any kind of a you know\nSome kind of trouble because of protocol that you would just go to the FBI widely get to the press you're undermining the FBI is what people are calling for they're calling for something to happen but luckily that part where judge Flanders\nWas with me in the last hour and he talked about a fake story in Rhode Island goes to Senator Sheldon Whitehouse his office he takes it to the FBI and cabinet judge Kavanaugh but also to the press\nThis fake person right because we were looking at a Twitter account who has apologized for saying hey I Know about another incident in Newport on a boat with these two guys and a woman and I went over there and beat him up the next day because they attacked her and one of them happened to be you know this is according to the story that went out\nHe contacts Senator Sheldon Whitehouse his office and from what all we can understand is Senator Whitehouse then takes it to the FBI but also to a reporter somewhere\nWell that's where that's where he really went off the rails because I think it was a dishonorable of him to do that he was trying to feed a media frenzy over this whole situation instead of just living the investigatory process take its course by having the FBI or the Senate of committing look into this\nHe also simultaneously apparently ... sons him off to a reporter to investigate this supposedly but knowing that once you get it in the hands of the report the story is going to come out before it's been vetted before it's been investigated and not surprisingly it turns out to be\nA false accusations of men re chance a yet in the meantime it is to um [noise] the ah the Lynch mob mentality around this candidate\nSo any kind of legal issues uh what kind of a or sanction what what can happen to some of the White House if in fact\nWell ... I don't know the sooner the White House but this person who made the false claim is in trouble because Senator Grassley has referred him\nTo prosecuting authorities for making a false charge in recounting isn't so that's why it's important to look into these things and not just assumed that because somebody to make sure that accusation well it must be true\n... that's judge Robert Flanders and he obviously is a Republican running for the seat of Senator Sheldon Whitehouse will write\nFor three eight nine seven seven six four three totally PR oh this portion of the program is sponsored by Providence auto body the first and only facility in Rhode Island and Massachusetts\nCertified to repair the all new all aluminum Cadillac CTX when we come back we'll hear a little bit from former vice president Joe Biden who was in town obviously for the Democrats and we come back\n[noise] Ninety nine seven ... am sick WPRI\nCountries I Would certainly be an informed voter listen to news of Ninety nine seven FM Pan Am six thirty WPRI road then get out to vote\nHow would you like motor trends twenty gene trucks will be here for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty eighty four to one fifty so distraught for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a point forward and he went into and there were against it\nOr by on less like Marshall building and remodeling adopting a new path Moriarty fence can help their pet safety solutions work year round them so today\nWith offices in Portsmouth war would head north to show me to call the eight hundred two to five ... visited that evaluation and estimate for schedule on line of ... dot com\nDiscover one more medals resent that professionals Jews Moriarty spent your invisible fence Brent pet solutions experts Moriarty spent eight hundred two to five ... keeping up safe since Nineteen eighty six guaranteed\nBy I'm Joe diets with ice cream with Kayla Williams frailty I'm a baby boom all like so many of your listeners if you're looking assault downsize\nOr just won a second home moved to another state or have an estate property we can help what over thirty five years experience coal mo for all one six three nine three one six three I'm not bragging I'm applying for a job I Wanna be your real tough stress free listings flexible freeze no upfront costs cancel anytime\nDon't sell your home or to get my free information package because our mortgage partner for movement mortgage\nBanks Joe it's no secret that we're in a seller's market were bars are almost always facing multiple offers situations that as wide as central to put yourself in the strongest position financially\nTo avoid missing out on the home of your dreams and movement mortgage we pride ourselves on giving up buyers a distinct leg up on the market with our new movement buyers advantage program called three three nine\nTo three or four to nine eight eight today CEO we help our buyers achieved the American dream ... or you do an equal housing opportunity and molest id three nine one seven nine Adam ... and my last one six to for nine seven four\nStates safely on the road sharpen your driving skills and maybe even save money on your vehicle insurance evergreen nursing in rehabilitation and he's\nProvidence invites you to attend an A.
