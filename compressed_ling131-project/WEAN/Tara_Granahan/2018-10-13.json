T. because just like with Don\nYou know we hear a certain size depending upon which channel you're watching you get kind of this filtered view of the world Katie is great because he's he's an insider but he's not\nWonder Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai key a Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition at what board and he's really Janeiro or against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models at incredible prices logged on to flood Otto John job now\nRight now what are insiders seeing as the after effects of that especially as we Wade through the next couple of weeks after the midterms\nDon't pay the hardcore em Ali Baba rent\nA micron did pay ... way back\nWhen your book I don't any more um my question is should I don't really know on the\nStock and reinvest in the ones that do pay the ...\nWell there's you know it it's a great question so there's a couple of things going on here um is what I like to do is is really two things I like to focus on the the clients goal that they're trying to accomplish and then as a function of that I only want to take on the least amount of risk\nThat I got to take on for the client to be able to reach that goal and so with twenty Seventeen it was a a banner year for the market uh you know your stocks have probably done well here over the summer months\nBut it it may you may be um [noise]\nYou may be presented with an opportunity right now to kind of clear the board reevaluate what you're trying to do\nAnd and really get yourself into some different investments different types of investments so that you're better position for what we see coming here the rest of the year and then twenty Nineteen\nAnd now the thing about the evidence is this evidence or great until they're not there anymore and just because of the company's paying dividends right now in stocks doesn't mean that that's going to continue in the in the future\nSo give me a sense of you know ... you know with all that in mind give me a sense of what else you might be doing do you have any other investments any other accounts are you married what your wife doing and her four oh one K. outside of these you know handful of stocks that you've got right now\nMy wife and I am married or white or before they were when they record company\nUm she's been there probably Fifteen to Twenty years were for the company she works for we uh we have from annuity that pay a lower rate for the you know I'm I think we have one would have been haircut annuities and the other work in the\n... just for a nice chunk of money and put in there and I think we've got about three point one per ...\nFor that also alright are these are ... for five years All right we\nAlso have a ... uh we got a little bit of money in there and they pay out I'm a once a year in December\n... read that little ... from their okay um we're both fifty nine years old my wife will tell you you're fifty eight [noise]\nBut she's ready to turn Fifteen dollars are in a on fifty ... a mortgage okay\nAnd I'm a real estate broker and she works for um a manufacturing company\nOkay so ... so here's how I Would look at this you've got a lot of different elements a lot of different variables that are running right now in what I Would call your overall financial picture you've got your\nUh your your IRA and this handful of stocks you've got the four one K. that air your wife has the four one K. you're still working\nI'm you're trying to plan\nFor kind of this next run\nBefore you retire at some point you're going to have Social Security that you have to account for\nWhat I Would want you to do is in vast with the end in mind okay where do you want to be an X. number of years if you're\nFifty nine if she's fifty eight what's your retirement plan do you want to retire at sixty five sixty six with real estate brokerage is this something that you want to continue for awhile give me a sense of what the time horizon is on this\nWorld for me were really afraid I'll probably continue to do with the largest can do it anymore because I enjoy doing it [noise] um my wife she's talked about retiring for your call\nAny debt you have any debt right now\nA real heavy there over there we have is our is our home and now we've talked about paying it off but we haven't done it ... or\nSo there's um if if if you think about things imagine you had a a piece of paper on the table in front of you and your draw a circle\nThere's lots of different parts inside that circle\nOr you've got Social Security your investments how you're going to ... yeah you create a retirement income stream or what to do with your wife four one K. had to pay for health care you know what to do with the mortgage all those different things it would probably make some sense um you know to sit down and I\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again what board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine Vermont flood as every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nSocks that you pay of ten how you approached it and just the fact that you have a dividend strategy and and and are trying to figure out what to do [noise]\nYou've got this opportunity to kind of pivot and get ready for kind of this next phase of your life it may be that you still hold a little bit of Pepsi\nOr it may be that you do some different things with your wife four one K. or maybe that you do some different things with the annuities\nBut really what you want to try to do is get ready for twenty Nineteen and you do that you know with trying to evaluate alright why do we need these annuities do we need these annuities um you know with your income can you save\nInside of a set fire re if you're kind of an independent contractor or you know depending upon what you're doing there you can still save you can still invest\nBut you know again I Would use this opportunity to kind of not quite wiped the board or you know wipe the slate clean but really say All right I've got this chunk of money what do I need to be doing right now\nTo get ready for twenty Nineteen and so it's not so much evidence strategy versus non dividends strategy it's not so much joy so micron or Anna Lee or what to do with Ali Baba it's\nWhat what types of investments do I need does that make sense I mean you you okay so I mean if you hold on here um I Want to confirm that I've got some information for you know that we have a telephone number but we'll we'll talk about some things are fair\nBut really man you've done everything right and what I Want to do is kind of trim around the edges and get you ready for the next you know a couple of quarters\nSo that no matter what comes at us in the market just like what you know no matter what came match you with the hurricane you were ready for for different things you know based on what based on what happened from Kurt Warner brothers you hold on and we'll get to some good help\nOr are you very much\nNow we have an email that Kenny has sent to our inbox it asks candy and investing cents dot com and Kenny writes\nI used to be a smoker and had recently become a successful nonsmoker I decided to turn my interest to things that I've been intrigued by like investing my question is where do you suggest starting for a beginner things to read or websites to visit that sort of thing anything helps and keep up the great show\nMan Kenny you are awesome uh for\nFor quitting smoking congrats I Know that you know how difficult it can be but how life changing that it really is and and really I Love hearing that you are intrigued by investing All right I mean learn how the financial system in this country works participating as and and you know as an investor\nThese can be pretty pretty rewarding things right so a couple of ideas here real quick\nFirst totally keep listening to investing sense I most of what Bob and I do is you know we try to educate listeners okay at past that think about um invest the media\nAre like it sounds it's this online encyclopedia on investing so invested ... dot com and then Morningstar or they've got tons of free education and tons of research they also have an Academy of sorts that you can kind of step through\nSo Kenny I'd start there it's been a few months kind of devouring everything that you can and then get back to me and we'll ... we'll go from there\nNow mark has a question he's calling from Ohio at eight eight eight eight three three eight six three seven mark thanks for calling how can we help\nBut my son is Seventeen years old and he would like to start a rod IRA he work and not only business and getting paid on it to get started in Iraq Iran not sure what kind of a fun way to put that in its plan that you\nPut money into it for or by ear and they just leave it and let it go they'll just trying to get in fights with them on where for him to put money for a start up IRA\nMark good for you here for helping your son gets started like this I I might have you reconsider having your son put money into this Roth IRA instead a thing about opening a brokerage account and that would have everything to do with you having a little bit more flexibility and option Audi with with the money\nSo that tax free benefit of the Roth that you feel better about their ability of the brokerage account the ...\nMaybe a and really this demand for flexibility is a function of his son's age okay either way or the portfolio that I've been recommending for young investors like your son is you know our sixty thirty ten portfolio and\nAh so these are the allegations to three different asset classes that your son might consider that going to talk investments because it's just kind of broad ethic classes okay so\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for free on condition at what for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices are going to flood auto John job now\nThis is a this is a virtual portfolio could get your son started saving for a very long term goal uh you know retirement could be a starting point for buying a house getting married could get him squared away for some other life events you know that he would see in the next five to ten years but just think that sixty thirty ten and and go from there so coming up\nAnd this week's portfolio was sent to us from Henry and Henry writes I all of my retirement money at the bank and an IRA CD I'm sixty eight and a half\nAnd still working and I don't have any plans to retire I've been collecting Social Security for a few years and I just put the money in savings even if I wasn't working I could be about the same financially what if any other suggestions would you have for me\nWell first of all I'm really glad that you reached out here a Henry we talk a lot about risk on investing sense and a lot of times it's from the perspective of a the potential of losing money\nBut you might actually be exposing your heart or in savings to some overlooked risks are namely longevity and inflation K but set set those aside here for for a moment I think what this comes down to is that you might not be taking enough risk with these with the savings\nWill Henry wrote that he's sixty eight and still working and then said I don't have any plans to retire that's a lot different than other sixty eight year old and it sounds like that those are a couple of signs that you may be in good health and and could live for a good while longer\nRight so and he sounds like a hardworking guy right uh yeah so Henry I might actually have you think about getting your money to work a little bit harder for you\nOr you've got these dual income sources sounds like you're in a pretty good financial position um you know I might have you consider a portfolio that a little bit more balanced right fifty percent stock fifty percent bond because\nYou know you're you're not taking any risk with your ear you think that you're not taking any risk with your savings but you're forgetting about inflation and how those could eat into your CD returns so then all of a sudden there's this solid risk that your CD returns are going to be falling short of of what you need and putting you in a position where you could be losing a lot of money\nAnd I I went ahead and log on to bank right dot com and I'm looking at the CD a returns right now here's what I'm seeing the national average for one year CDs two point four percent\nOr the average return for a three year CD is two point four seven percent and the national average for a five year CD to point seven three percent so that gives you an idea of where CD rates are\nSo what about the historical rates for the return of the fifty fifty stock bond portfolio that you just mentioned\nRight so vanguard studied this fifty fifty portfolio fifty percent stocks fifty percent bond and it went back and they looked at its historical performance going all the way back to Nineteen twenty six so here's what they found\nThe average annual return was eight point four percent are the best year was in Nineteen thirty three portfolio returns thirty two percent\nThe worst year was in Nineteen thirty one when the portfolio last twenty two percent but since Nineteen twenty six this portfolio has had Seventeen losing years right now has sounds kind of lousy but if you step back and think about that that means since Nineteen twenty six\nThis fifty fifty portfolio stocks bonds it's been profitable on a yearly basis a little bit more than ... eighty percent of the time\nThey'll confirming the annual average return for the fifty percent stocks fifty percent bond portfolio going back to Nineteen twenty six was was eight point four percent correct right okay so I'm thinking of a simple way to try and compare the return of\nOf that portfolio to the three years CD um because that's where Henry said all of his money is in his Iraq right\nSo and then with our as you're thinking about like the requirement of distribution is that right so you know strip that I'll just keep it simple look at the returns in a hypothetical taxable brokerage account run that same example over the next ten years starting balance of four hundred grand\nA use that twenty two percent marginal tax rate just don't make it more complicated than it\nOK okay well then that that\nThe formula that you just stated that comes to four hundred and eighty four thousand dollars a ban so let me run that same example with the returns from uh the stock bond portfolio at eight point four percent\nAnd at the end of ten years you would have about seven hundred and fifty four thousand dollars that the traumatic different\nA lot of money right yeah I mean that's the power of compound growth I'm signed called it a miracle to seize this opportunity you got to be willing to take at least some risk with your investments if you do you know it's possible that you could be in a much better place financially than if you'd\nHow would you like motor dreads twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty eight Ford F. one fifty the best

D but you have to get that prescription coverage because that's where the penalty will come and\nI'm also if you opt out of poverty and you don't have a credible coverage to an employer and you say well I don't want to pay that one thirty four months of the government I'm healthy\nThat's another that's another penalty that can come into play so you really want to make sure you know what you're you're getting yourself into\nNow when you talk about the um the the ... you have to take this this uh you got to take something right\nHave to take ... yeah you generally have to take part in poverty if you know long have credible coverage some guys lawyer so what does that typically run a pot be yellow\nLike if the the basic if I had to get the basic medical care yeah so ah ... generally it's about one thirty four month that changes each year so they would take one thirty four months out of your Social Security ability quarterly if you're not collecting Social Security yet right and then you have to ... to a party or ...
