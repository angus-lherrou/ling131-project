I mean this could than I Do believe that something did happen [noise] okay [noise]\nUm but then you have the judge who is being overly destroy not only in his family\nUnderstood I Would listen I Love your ... you know I Know if you're ... years you're going to fight back but\nNow you especially here in Rhode Island we're not used to them fighting back because they usually wrong and they lie but

the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars for only a flood forward and he went into and there were against it\nI'm sad because I Can't I Can't latch onto almost anything this woman says and she backtracking she backpedaled and it was uncomfortable to watch only because she was just having a great time\nIt's real lobbing bombs about both men almost you know in a in a very specific way but no proof no backup no nothing now I'm I'm noticing\nJust on social media talking about it here putting things up where the women no it doesn't seem that you know she's getting the same response as Dr Christine for it\nI very hard to defend this woman or take her side because she just seems like she is having a heck of a time and she likes being on TV and she has no backup at all\nI ... it's um this is this is detrimental this woman not to judge Kavanaugh to any other victim\nThat feels they can come forward or should come forward or want to come forward I find now if I'm wrong I'll be the first one to say it she's got the creepy lawyer no two ways about it this guy is in it for the for the showboat and she is just\nHer her delivery and her being\nSo flip flop beyond the details but also so confident sitting there in the sense that I'm going to nail this guy I don't know what their relationship was\nHe a capital has said that this woman Julie sweating again this is a complete joke not a clue at least he said he you know he knew the other players you know the other people rather that we're at a the Dr Ford party says it didn't happen but he knew some of them this\nOne I'm finding very little support for this woman and this is why this can be so so so tragic ... because I I listen I've had people write to me and say now I can tell my story they've called up on the radio and told their story\nBut if it's this kind of a thing it looks like NBC the with the woman was uncomfortable interviewing her she she she's going into all the details of what happened to these parties\nAnd then she doesn't really say she said she was attacked\nOn like Dr Ford who ... says she remembers every single detail this one was like oh yeah well I don't know if he was never let me tell you how bad it was well what happened well it was really really bad and they made me feel useless will\nYou know how far you push the woman on national TV to do it just I don't I'm I'm I'm kind of baffled as to why NBC aired this I Am and and and they almost looked at to\nLouis in Providence WPRI thanks for holding low\nYeah you do I first of all I don't I never really believe anything at face value no matter who it is just by their their testimony you have to have evidence I mean I think men and women can all agree that when you have a situation you have to have evidence that it's like for example if you like you see some of the famous cases recently with the Catholic Church and you have the one\nA Sandusky and you have all these other ones are there had there's been a pattern or maybe the come forward you know all kinds of things come up to to support whoever the story\nI I think the Democrats are getting off on the drinking thing you know it's really funny about the drinking thing you've got these liberal cultures that are run by absolute liberals and people on the left of I'll say like Brown University walked down or you go down the ... or any time over weekend drug or you'll see the kids walking around staggering around\n[laughter] ... you know so I mean you know you were worried that Democrats all of a sudden so holier than thou when it comes to like drinking and part and this is this ... this is absurd\nWell they want to nail this this particular judge but do you think that that that I don't well listen I went to your right and back in the years it was the number one party school it was rated on some list for\nFor many years and then it switched over to somebody else maybe it was somebody down in Miami University and here's a here's a point

promoting this but you cannot wear their findings and said there were so many inconsistencies in the Ford touched them already I mean major\nShe was a woman sitting there asking the questions on behalf of the republic\nLike blatantly inconsistency she like there are differences in what year are when it took place at one time she said it took place in the early eighties and the ...\nThey couldn't even like focus on this this Nineteen eighty two until they got down to like you know uh to to right before the testimony and that was possibly me up you didn't even a Mitchell says that it was possibly manipulated by the Democrats or committee and her lawyers which made her do the uh uh there there's the time\nBlood legion is southern Rhode Island's Vermeer luxury dealer featuring

legit you got to get in their witnesses\nLet's go that to me is understandable going back to a police report in Nineteen eighty five after a concert where people were hustling in a bar and he threw ice on him for some quote unknown reason probably to stop a fight\nYou know it's like you put the hose on the dogs\nOh my I don't I don't know for ... for some on drone on real reason he threw the ice

his adulthood his political career I don't know\nI suppose well maybe they don't go back to the ninth grade [laughter] don't\nKnow they went back to is is a junior high and high school\nAnd I said they talked to his teachers as a as you go what wouldn't you check back grown on police report\nWell he he wasn't charged with anything he was questioned so maybe if you're looking for okay let's see if the guy ever got charged with anything let's see if the guy going to a condition convicted of anything heaven forbid maybe just because he answered a couple of questions on a night where somebody got into a fight does not come up I mean I don't know how it works but it's it's certainly seemed in a minor\nYou was ... he was questioned right that's what I said okay so maybe that doesn't come up when you do a search with a legitimate\nStory or is this the one thing that's being corroborated than the ... for the New York times come up with this this\nUm it started with the New York times yes according to the New York times [laughter]\nWell they are they are heavily involved in this aren't they here and make it sound doesn't it sound like though Steve that people are calling into that paper you know if you had to be a betting person I Would you know we're all trying to sit here and say well why would Senator Whitehouse called the premise of because of the New York times is really ingrained in this in this situation will vote or either\n... this ... this trial is being a trade in public opinion\nOf course it is yeah which which shouldn't\nWhich is not all riled but the yeah yeah the nomination\nBorders it is it is on trial basically yeah for the people that come out and say well this is a job interview that be a a most people's legs they'll get destroyed for a job interview so\nWell I you know and as a part of me that says boy who'd ever want to go through this right who would ever and that's the detriment to the whole thing is that people are just well certainly not if you're you're in that system if you're if you're trying to get into the you know that high up into the\nJudicial system but it's certainly gives\nThem the truth and I think he knows he's innocent and he wants to write this really doesn't want to give up because if he gives up they're going to say he's guilty but he was you were going all the\nAll right yeah you always got to ride it out now he's got to go or\nYeah he's got a ride it out now at the moment I thought he wasn't going to was after his opening statement and he was so upset and you know you're hurting my family and I thought maybe he would say I'm not doing this but now he's all in\nRight what else can you do a there's nothing else we can do but the thing that worries me was one White House the book than your blood before one of the brakes was saying well I think it's a\nIt's going on you know it's a credible investigation I think a week was enough time so they they must have something else in the back pocket there was a ringleader and the leak hey goes ... what do you\nSay this this is enough time and it's a it's a bowl of is the ... we would seem like enough time that doesn't make sense to me I don't know if it makes sense for you all of a sudden changes as well it must have something else really\nWell yeah that's a good point Steve I you know it's going to be one of those weeks I I I find it fascinating I Can't imagine being a any member of his family are parents I mean it's got to be difficult but\nI I Can't find I don't know I I maintain a lot of friendships friendships mean a lot to me growing up I Know you know I have family members that say you know we we stick with the family stick with the family of course when I have a lot of friends in in life long friends and I can't imagine my life without I Can't imagine getting through things I Can't imagine male and female\nBy the way and so\nI but I Can't think of any one of them and they they're all really good people that hasn't done something stupid since we were in high school in college I Can't think of anyone but this is the world that he has entered\nAnd they're going to dig through and people I think people are coming forward to talk to the New York times to get to take to either you know expose him or paying back right I Want to look at it but to say that he he was accused of throwing nice on someone\nWhat's your Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve real condition it was more than any religion or against us that's right over two hundred and ... all my role models out incredible prices will go to John John no\nAh I'm confused [laughter] I don't know this but it was because of the far far at all because of this\nGoes and where you make an astounding so like All right all these ... was because you know these guys who are somebody in a bar fight\nWell there haven't been there how I'll explain that you want they're having an FBI investigation now for this week\nFriday is the vote according to Mitch McConnell Senator McConnell they're digging around and they're getting reports from people and median whoever that they now have to look at because they they opened up his FBI investigation so the last the latest thing that they have found is he was\nInvolved in a police report he wasn't charged with anything because he may or may not have thrown ice had someone\nOut of ... of British show that but if you're the one with any time of stuff like that I'm pretty sure\nThat okay I'm telling you what do I mean how did you I'm
