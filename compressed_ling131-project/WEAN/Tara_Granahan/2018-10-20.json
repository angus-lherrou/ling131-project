investing shifts financial insurance is America's largest independent registered investment advisor by investment news every week we help you make sense to invest my retirement Social Security much much more laws\nWe are I'm sure your calls and emails now host Bob Richards nationally recognized certified financial planner professional Andy Smith [noise]\nI'd Bob Richards\nThe guy standing next to me as Andy Smith have Andy it has been white an October already yeah really quite a year\nAnd that to help us sort through all of what's been happening we're going to start the show today with news about a limited time offer for a free portfolio review and Social Security optimization report had investing sense dot com\nRight so we're running this limited time offer for a couple of reasons or one you know this recent market volatility might have you reconsidering the risk that you were taken right now and this is important\nRight now so many of you are reaching retirement age the last thing that you want is to delay retirement because of you know any sort of market drop\nTo you know the second reason for us having this limited time offer at investing sense dot com like Bob was talking about I mean it goes back to so many of you reaching retirement age right now many of you could be making a huge mistake by claiming Social Security or planning on taking Social Security too soon\nI threw the show you know we're going to explain how you could be leaving lots of Social Security dollars on the table\nIf you're applying are planning on applying the wrong claiming strategy you know in the meantime just cut to the chase learned more claim that free portfolio review that Social Security optimization report it or if they're investing sense dot com ...\nWhen it comes to reaching a goal like retirement for most Americans that means having two sources of income source number one is your savings and investments and source number to Social Security and for some American couples the total lifetime benefits from Social Security can be over a million dollars so when you add that\nTo a nest egg in a four one K. or an IRA and maybe a little income on the side and all of a sudden there is no retirement crisis I mean at least for most people listening who I don't think are facing retirement crisis but Andy when it comes to the investment piece of this formula\nHow do you work with clients and take them to that next step and move into retirement whatever that retirement ends up looking like\nAll right so it all starts with a conversation that I have to get to know your needs and your once because ultimately I'm going to build a very personalized plan around your specific needs and wants and that plan can help you take certain steps and make critical changes to what you may be doing right now\nThe thing is this could be a huge mistake because you know claiming Social Security before your full retirement age actually reduces the amount of money that you could be receiving a you can be missing out on what is yeah it's like basically a guaranteed increase over a couple of years which is what happens when you wait\nAnd you know if you're still working while you claim benefits before full retirement age Social Security is actually going to reduce your benefits even more\nSo I mean think about it you can't get an increase like this than any other investment period and this is from a guy who you know make a living helping you invest in the markets\nAnd why would you want the Social Security administration to take more money away from you with these reductions in benefits simply because you're still working\nAnd I mean really all of us a financial engines are worried that Americans are taking risks that they don't fully understand and that's why for this limited time as part of our offer for free portfolio review will also run a Social Security and\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model what pays more than any Ziegler around because we're a circle by buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours more gone too far high car buyers on Tom\nGive you an example of how important it is to apply to correct claiming strategy\nAnd to explain how sometimes it's difficult to know what that strategy actually is\nWe're thrilled to have ... joined us on the show ... is a wonderful thing and financial engine he's a senior instructor and he travels around the country teaching people and places like Boeing and Ford how to better prepare for their future and we've invited Kyle to join us to tell a story about his mom\nAnd how he helped her get more out of Social Security when it comes to spouse benefits\nKyle ... is great to have you on the show with us today we're all anxious to hear the story that you have to share\nAbout one of your own family members and how they almost left tens of thousands of dollars in Social Security benefits on the table please share that story with us\nAbsolutely Bob my dad started to receive Social Security benefits because of disability in his early sixties my mom's planted always been to delay taking her Social Security benefits until Seventy given her above average life expectancy\nA you know really I mean just her knowing that kind of puts her a pretty far away from most of the people who know what the different Social Security claiming options are so it's awesome that your mom had this information where did you learn all of her different options here\nWell she had always been a good planner and she definitely done her homework she looked at several different claiming strategies wall factoring in some of her other sources of income\nAnd she basically determined which strategy wouldn't make the most sense for her overall retirement plan now when the bipartisan budget act of two thousand and Fifteen was passed\nEliminating violence to spend with restricted application she assumed that she couldn't claim spousal benefits and that are only option was to wait to turn on her benefit at Seventy and to continue to receive my dad's Social Security benefit as a source of retirement income\nSo Kyle I I I'd like to have you back up just a second and explain for us you mentioned the bipartisan budget act twenty Fifteen explain for us what that is\nAbsolutely the bipartisan budget act of two thousand and Fifteen it changed the rules around the voluntary suspension of benefits so for married couples\nSomewhat have one spouse file a restricted application at therefore retirement age so that they could claim spousal benefits wall allowing their own benefit to grow until age Seventy so for anyone born January second Nineteen fifty four or later\nThat option was no longer available what also happens with these changes is that if you spend your benefits all benefits based upon your record will also be suspended so if your benefits are suspended\nYour spouse can no longer claim a spouse will benefit because that benefit would also be suspended here's the part of the bipartisan budget act that my mom overlooked this changed the right to file a restricted application for those born on or after\nJanuary second Nineteen fifty four\nShe was born in Nineteen fifty two and since my dad was already receiving his Social Security benefit\nShe was still able to use a restricted application so once she reached her for retirement age and since she had not started taking her own Social Security benefit she could claim the spouse will benefit wall letting her own benefit continue to grow\nSo I'll I'll go back again I'm too where you started talking about the the changes you know specifically with Social Security but if your mother knew about violence has been in restricted application in spousal benefits and everything else my gases and she\nKind of game plan what the different benefit numbers would have been to her\nSo how much more in benefits you know did she started getting one she filed for this restricted application\nThis was the best part of the entire story as soon as she turned sixty six which was her full retirement age she filed the restricted application and she started to collect nine hundred dollars a month\nAs a spouse will benefit off of my dad's record so this was over forty three thousand dollars that she would have left on the table between the ages of sixty six in Seventy had she and I had this conversation\nAbout restricted applications and most importantly about the changes that did and did not affect her because of this bipartisan budget\nKyle this has been a huge benefits for our listeners having you on the show thank you so much for being with us\nAbsolutely you're very welcome thank you\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai key a Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in pristine free own tradition at what board and he's written a generic as if that's right over two hundred free on cars all make all models and incredible prices are going to flood Otto John job now\nIs that Tom but this story you know really motivates me here and what we're doing right and and for this I Want to speak directly to women right now I still like the guys to play to pay close attention to what I'm about to say I especially if you care about your wives or your partners\nBut Social Security is so important to women and it's because on average at least you know women earn less than men you can find lots of statistics on this but women generally are in about twenty percent last uh for women of color the pay gap is even more pronounced\nThis is why choosing the rights Social Security strategy is so important to women\nAnd the other reasons that Social Security is so important I mean women tend to take more time off to raise children for example ah women tend to accumulate lessons savings women tend to live longer which we talk about all the time on investing sense now about that about that longevity in men verses women\nWomen it is vital that you account for life span when you're selecting a Social Security strategy women represent more than half of Social Security beneficiaries in their sixties\nUh women represent Seventy percent of Social Security beneficiaries in their nineties women make up Ninety seven percent Ninety seven percent of all Social Security survivor beneficiaries you have\nTo be making the right decisions all along now if you even step back a little bit further and think about things that a little bit more global level\nWe've been adjusting client portfolios we want to reduce risk before we see additional volatility in the markets that volatility alone\nShould've expose white as Social Security you\nKnow claim early and invested strategy just bonkers that's what the global level if you zoom in it the

doing cigars now\nThe whole cigar craze really kind of ignited in the nineties it you know get ours have been around in the early nineties and in the early nineties it just all of a sudden people discovered cigars again and they in fact I I was one of a back then and I used to keep a cigar diary and this is how crazy it was oh Yahoo you smoked\nRhode Island's number one Ford dealer is setting
