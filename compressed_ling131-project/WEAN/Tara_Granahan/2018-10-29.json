something has been deterrent you don't know that because it's it doesn't happen and it's not reported so how can you say it doesn't work you you're talking about this and didn't want to have failed\nYou look at the active shooter report that the FBI put out a couple of years ago and you can Google this and find that it's very easy to fight they look they took a look at a hundred and sixty

to the U.S will be in the situation and in the steamy a hundred and sixty incidents Twenty one times on our own citizens were able to get involved and physically restrain the shooter in calm the
