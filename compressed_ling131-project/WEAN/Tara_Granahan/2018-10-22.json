the Twitter account Cathy Greg who is a whole knowing over there at the Providence Journal and she said I she wrote first time question mark and I'm I don't recall um ads coming from a local race\nBut that's Nick ... online inside asking people to share it and Cranston and you know urging voters to get out there next or in the next two weeks and make your decision it's going to be a it's seemingly a tight race and Cranston once again for Nick ... versus Stephen fries they had a real good probably one of the better debate\nWith I'm Kim white and hit me see overt channel twelve you listen to the newsmakers segment this week David is in Warren and we were talking about a one of the benchmarks that Nick Betty yellow has laid forth about eliminating the car tax he wanted to speak about that David\nHow're you doing good how are you\nAre um but yeah I just want to correct a gentleman when he mentioned that you know the bucket that for the fact that it isn't how's it going to be hurt that's not true I'm just going to reimburse them out any money that they do on the ...\nSo you're really not going to be I think\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they're all in for Steve free own condition it was more than ... religion or against it that's right over two hundred free on cars all makes all models and incredible prices are going to flood Otto John job now\nThem out for instance but he ...\nOr where's it gonna but where where does it come from in other words I think when he was saying if you start to eliminate the car tax you got to get the money somewhere else to fill that hole in the budget right everything goes to the general fund\nWell that's true um but that's the state level not it is and how do they want to reimburse the cities and towns and yet wherever they get the money from they are going to get the money from\nBut then he said if you own property it's probably going to be their\nNope nope not at all\nHow how do you figure out you know you you have a crystal ball because I Want some\nNon Samantha I'm pretty well informed about Syria what what ... okay go ahead sorry what happens\nIs if they are the ... the of the problem they collect what's at stake and million dollars a year in motor vehicle\nThat they want that get phased out on that is going to reimburse you problem and million dollars on the local level you're probably really not going to increase because of that\nWherever the stick it ten million dollars from that might be ruining tax increase but not from a local property ...\nOkay so my question again as you're talking specifically about one town so that for example east Providence where do you think the ten million dollars gets made up from where does it come from from\nThe ... the power or where does the state get it\nThat that's what I'm saying wherever they're going to get it from who knows what it's not going to be from the local real estate your property tax\nYour property or they were saying that your property taxes go up because of it that's not true\nBut they may increase you know a certain rate of uh you know your income tax they may start coming up with different views on whatever but locally your property tax your real estate property will not be\nAll right I you know I\nI appreciate that David I appreciate your calling in I don't know how you can be so I'm\nConvinced but I I I appreciate the call\nYour right to some some see that as a a a lack of confidence in your ability to win this race\nNot at all you know it's they got me to the certain point early on when I was waiting for the matching funds are there was a definitely much lift and held a you know have them invest a million dollars\nAs well as to what they've done it was more than what they've invested in fourteen uh gave us that year cover a as well as you know the males into people's a swing homes a really nice target now it's our responsibility to you know use our dollars effectively wisely\nOgden definitely up halfway and for two or three of them are so\nUsed to see a pathway to victory for\nYour absolutely see that I Want all round of it to know one thing the general Monday was not going to fire the selection for her money out of state more than I was false negative ads that are you know no one's calling or on except awesome\nIt's frustrating but I Am not the truth you know I've gone through it once before we've seen that this governor all she cares about is money honesty you know that's how our policies or influence I Am one that's going to bring it back for the little guys are not deterred we're going through through November six\nAnd the patch would ever thought that there were going to come back to that first Superbowl for what they do is they had that last Dr coming down and stuff for the last minute a winning field goal and we don't intend on his meal break room turn it on sending me through much fix\nAll right so that was at the forum this morning you could hear it's a meet and greet and I don't know if it's a breakfast thing but I'm the bulk up I I I I Would assume Joe ... was there as well but definitely governor a Monday was there she got up and gave the opening a speeches I'll tell you a little bit about what she said and then also Alan fungus up boy I'm\nGovernor among does that a a real presence if you will on social media in the sense that anything that the ... campaign puts up there her a former chief spokesperson and now working for the campaign he just\nGoes right back at them it's pretty it's pretty uh [noise]\n... group launched your car anyway any model what more than ... row because we're a survive by center at will buy yours even if you do ... hours logged onto our car buyers are\nThat funny you should just heard Ellen ... campaign it's interesting and you can't really judge anything by social media because people are I you know I ... I Hope that you're you know saying how you truly feel I put up just a a spontaneous poll I like to do it from time to time I put it on Twitter and I put it on Facebook overwhelmingly\nIn the last what half hour on Facebook if you're on that free social media site\nYou get a wealth of information but you also get a lot of opinion overwhelmingly people said Allen Fung if they were to vote today they would vote for Alan ... and then on Twitter you can put a little poll up there as well and that gives you percentages\nI'm ... and Armstrong was up there too at the meet and greet I ... I can see a picture of her on the Clintons Twitter site A L overwhelmingly again on Twitter a hundred and twelve oaks came in and just uh I did it right before I came on the air fifty five minutes ago for less than an hour\nSixty four percent Allan Fung the Seventeen percent Gina Raimondo eleven percent ... percent right in or other I'm certainly not scientific certainly skewed because social media um you can get on and ah\nYou might you might be ... you might be fooling around with me but um it's it's just interesting to see I think they're closer together I think that if the tighter race\nThan what we're all walking around all weekend long right you run into people you see people in social settings you talk to family had a birthday celebration for my daughter last night and people start talking about the different races and um [noise]\nIt's you'd be surprised how many people say coral these people are voting for governor among do if we're still stuck at what forty fifth forty six forty seven percent um or rather\nListed as far as a successful states and also with the popularity\nAnd the approval ratings uh there's the morning console poll that comes out every other month it feels like end next door governor Charlie Baker is at the top number one\nProof approval rating and governor Raimondo hovers around that forty forty to forty four so that's the question that I hear and certainly she has a huge following she's got a lot of support she's ahead in the polls I don't know when it comes to election day in two weeks\nHow that shakes out I have people writing to me saying I've already voted and the majority of those people from who's writing to me they said I voted and I voted for Alan ... I Want to make sure it gets in so will that early voting\nOr that we saw so much hullabaloo about a couple of years ago or four years ago now I'm Will that early voting have anything to do with if it comes down to Alan funding Gina Raimondo that will be interesting to watch a\nAnd again from now until election day if you voted early I'd like to hear\nWhy how and who\nIf you can uh if you wanted to weigh in a you know some people don't like to say who they voted for others are very happy to say they voted for for three eight nine seven seven six four three eight WPRI I think is going to be very interesting to see the numbers\nParticularly in the governor's race of early voting and in that Cranston race with\nSpeaker Nick mellow and Stephen Fry is because the mail in ballots\nEmergency early voting whatever you want to call them is would tip the scales for Nick ... last time he knew on election night before you counted the mail ballots that he had about two hundred already voted\nAnd that's the ground game ... a lot of people want to say well how did he know how to do you know how did you know you knew because they were going out and collecting them\nSo if it comes down to the mail ballots ... those two races could be closer than we think we know that the ... race is going to be close I think between Gina Raimondo an Alan song it could be closer than we think\nFor three eight nine seven seven six four three eight WPN let me take some phone calls here we're also going to hear a I've been trying for days now I wanted to hear from the ACLU on the\nRichard gardener case they put out a statement and we're going to be speaking with Steve and brown also a neighbor is going to weigh in with us a little bit later on in the morning for three eight nine seven seven six us go right to the phones Elaine and Lincoln and there'll be a hero\nHigh there are a wire good\nUh I I voted or a tree and now I'm not going to be in the state on election day\nOkay fair enough to order to do now and you mailed it in and you're all set and you feel good about it I did I it was very good\nAll right Elaine ... travels wherever you're going to be an election day understood Helen\nBlood

are in a couple of billion\n... ahead of them meaning ah not ... not on the right side of the lender George's in Providence WPRI George\nYeah so you know I didn't vote early but I don't just based

I hope that money is in\nCollege or what your lecture but it it almost trend that way right and yes but I mean her record in general it's just horrible\nAnd I don't you know go to all the absolute

second but there are ... offices and they are our studios in their uh the Rhode Island\nYou know politics has two weeks from tomorrow we are heading to the polls but I Want to tell you what's happening at the tuck it we have Steve Clinton there from our WPRI newsroom and it's a\nA tense scene at the whole arch East Village if you're on the site there if you work there if you have first hand knowledge they're inside the building there was a collapse of sorts a steep said it was under construction in some parts of this is a huge building\nA and if you've been there and put a kit and they read the whole mill very similar to the uh in a war with their across from the mall\nI'm Still going to call in\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again the blood borne has over one of them are brand new borders game for just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine Vermont flood of every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nThing is the whole arch East Village a giant mill into tuck it on the east and I was saying I was in eastern it's eaten street I'll let's go to the plant can go I go right ahead see\nHigher power or faster and yet and I both are longing to be at the you know ... it's on the backside of\nWalk back from a main street behind the ah Hobart mill the least tell me it was called ... and beat back inside several construction crews working\nQuite an hour ago now where apparently portable war parents pay down inside every three workers inside were taken out five fire rescue crews taking the hospitals defenders not yet known what ... what we were just told us that everybody inside has now been accounted for right now there's a huge response fire\nFighters are brought in and the police well also the state farm article a has arrived on the states they say that it's more or less standard procedure and right now a real hard bit on different structure there we're going to re habits and\nFill out I'm a apartments is part of the heart a hundred of Harvard units on old\nSo we're we're going on inside in the courier when a part of Florida where it's hard to tell I'm standing at the corner of ...\nAnd ... let me see what the cross street is I had if you're not going to do it the Warren avenue so it's on the backside and believe it or not it could be this milk from the highway from our I Ninety five\nOr infrastructure just before the alarm bell avenue actor so it'd be your block long a brick or ... bucks in milk or story all the all of the windows are gone because it's been under pressure so it looks a little on the\n... so we were in one quarter of a writer for ESPN and the uh\n[noise] than ah the Warren avenues but um\nWhere firefighters were bringing out a person is I arrived and put them into a rescue\nUnit and right now a days they had a huge group are not a fire fighter\nGetting a car from one of their commanders and then they've apparently stood at ease at least for now the mar apparatus all still hear the inspector from the ah fire marshal here remains to be being a you know what the cause and right now the\nFire chief of police chief started climbing talk with us they say they need to get more information so what we know is apparently free people hurting the partial collapse inside of this you Rick of mill and\nThey've been taken out they tell us everyone else has been accounted for are still a very active here Sarah\nIn great well the good news in the sense that they see everyone's been accounted for you because social media can take over sometimes and people are saying that people were trapped but you said they're all accounted for three people taking to the hospital\nOkay the plankton that's fine he was alive at the scene and we will ah will continue to monitor this a huge response off of its ... didn't they came in a couple of different ways obviously people were ... you know running to the scene and trying to\nUh abide by staying out of the way of emergency crews but several people were taken out of that building and Second Avenue in ... and I think most people in that area in from around have a new one as whole parties right it's a very popular area with the artist\nWith a they do a lot of functions over that I've been in that building it's absolutely huge so I think they were very lucky\nTo have everyone accounted for within an hour\nAnd a and there was a very heavy response and as soon as you hear collapse it was from the inside the were renovating the old mill and as Steve mentioned\nHow people call it the candy\nFactory over there so if you're familiar with that in Kentucky and just about an hour ago but not like a nine thirty nine forty five calls were coming in then a floor inside the mill pancakes they call it pancake collapse inside the building so\nWhen it comes across the um\nThe scanners and things like that people were saying building collapsed was inside\nSeveral workers were in their several people at least three taken into the rescue units and they are hospitalized according to see Clinton who's on the scene from our newsroom and other conditions are unknown so I think the key thing is that he mentioned right off the top Steve that everyone was accounted for\nIn the building and taken out um and I know a lot of people are writing oh my goodness you know I work over there or I live right over there they seen is kicked off obviously and emergency crews are still there a heavy presence and three people were taken to the hospital so floor collapsed and I'm Steve said pancakes\nWell before dark credit not break we'll talk your financial flood warnings religion never desert of the best financed returned prices and cars with zero percent if your for somebody to much you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto job\nPossibly housing so we'll keep an eye on that three people hospitalized conditions unknown but everyone accounted

Nairobi at parties furniture and mattresses create new memories today\nAnd you can get a new dynamic dining room from parties furniture mattresses take advantage of up to five years interest free financing at parties or earlier today I spoke with the ACLU the situation has not lessened at all in Providence in Washington park with\nThe arrival if you will after Thirty years in prison of Richard gardener and they are still vowing we had a neighbor someone who lives right there in his family members also live right across the street from Richard Gardner\nIs a convicted child rapist and molester or a kidnapper and how he's out now he has served his time I know a lot of people are I'm not happy with that phrase he served his time because he was given over a hundred years in prison but because of the way the system is set up\nMost people don't serve their full term and or the all of that time and so he got out in about just about Thirty years he's fifty one you got married over the weekend\nAnd uh in Cranston in the backyard of someone that they know and there are people there all dressed up and flowers and everything and tuxedos and listen\nBecause of Michigan's law being put on the books years after he was convicted he predates that\nSo he can come and go as he pleases this person the neighbors aren't happy ... neighborhood wasn't happy that he was getting married in their neighborhood over the weekend it is what it is\nHowever I think it's the responsibility and you can weigh in on this for three eight nine seven seven six of the mayor of Providence to handle the situation he popped up\nWhich is unusual for the mayor because usually traveling and not around or you know during the bike trail thing and ribbon cutting and oh festivals and things like that and when it's time to crunch down and make decisions he made the wrong one\nHe called on the neighbor the neighbors rather to chase the guy out\nAnd then his police department is standing there saying well this isn't something we normally do we don't want him here get them out of the neighborhoods so now the police are stuck now they're watching Richard gardener twenty four seven they went to the wedding over the weekend let's play channel ten they had a very uh interesting piece over the weekend\nRichard Gardner goes from Providence to crafted by the way all the neighbors that I've spoken to
