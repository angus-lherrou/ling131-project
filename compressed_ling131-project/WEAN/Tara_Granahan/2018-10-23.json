opportunity to embrace a project if we work again what's going on the economy just simply the stock market this morning it's open below wandered once you're starting to tell us okay there's a

miles away it's a back then\nAnd that German mock them any or just only a hundred million dollars for the San Francisco children hospital ... not only that he's in the process of doing an operation Chicago bringing five thousand jobs for cargo\nWe just don't understand the ripple effect when you can bring in people like this to have the ability to build a project\nWhat else they can do for the community you're going to Boston is absolutely amazing you know have you on a Saturday Night and then became a get a parking spot you walk around the city you go to New York what they're doing Hudson got\nThey got over two hundred builders are five hundred feet tall\nWe're right in the middle how do you miss ... don't you get older comedy this sounded turn a little bit the opportunity to have a back up like I say a beacon of ... of a structure you look at the Superman building I mean when you look at it and you just you just can't understand how that build it could be bake it we're seeing it will happen with has\nJourney you don't want you know it's going to happen with the state you're going to stop who just some of those big employers because there's not going to be a reason to be here when you bring in a project like this is a big your age we have a leader in the state that type of people that gives us a vision\nThat gives us hope the states you know what we can be something how do you miss and we just ice you know what I don't know what were you lack I don't know what the ambition is\nI don't know where they expect the revenues that come from a down economy\nI don't know where they expect people to drop three hundred million dollars out of this guy he's been he's just do ... what do we do we basically say no no no no no\nYou know what somebody would that's the capital can go anywhere because apple is mobile and it's going to go where it's well going up where people got to be treated right where it's obviously it's an opportunity to do so much of a ripple effect\nAnd we wish the vision of the state the city the people were you what I you know it's it's mind boggling you don't get short changing of the country there's the people of this state because they're going to be burden because the money is not going to be there to support the services and everything else they want need or expect\nBecause like I said we're going to be lost in the middle\nOf two ... two like I say Boston New York that it just I mean that's why they did have a hurricane buy wine in the right direction and where in the opposite direction and we still don't get it I'm not sure we'll ever get it and that's so sad\nI noticed the as I said I'm right with you it's we're afraid of it thank you Steve you you sound a lot there and I really appreciate it we're afraid of things to be too big we're afraid of things to be\nToo fast were afraid of things to me there's no risk taking and I see that in the sense of\nThis putting in this instance this isn't the puck stadium where they wanted public money they want to ... a lot of your money this is the he wants to put in most of his own money he's a successful developer he wants to to get his hands on prominence he wants to dig in and were saying you don't want to come back to me in a few more months I\nDon't know where the mayor and he's not even at the meeting it's unbelievable to me it is unbelievable to me that you wouldn't want to

gentleman watch yes speed cameras that not a cash give me\nAnd if you and anybody in the state college that they're not only for cash your drink at the same Kool Aid that I'm a restricted from the mayor you're saying they are a cash crop\nOf course they are they're not there shape because if they were there for safety every single school to have them every school not select schools that's number one number two is I live in the area\nAnd going from Schmidt street to my pleasure to have you every single site street now as speed bumps rubbish being bumped screwed it to the ground and you catch the show ... if you really want to speak so to speak out\nToward the speed bumps and let the department of public works put them in getting paid every day and it's not getting kickbacks to another company the speed cameras are getting kickbacks to another company so anybody that believes that they're not\nThere and they're not collecting money and it's not a tax revenue for the city drink shame Kool Aid that Steve ... restricted that ... that number one and number two in vain building that's what they call it mhm\nYou every other city they're beautiful big building a reason that building is not going up and immediately I don't want it to go up\nIs because this gentleman is ... is a money no tax money going into it no politician habit can have a say on a what they want to do because they're getting money from it and it\nI guess people are getting kickbacks the neat\nThing yeah there's something really calm I think there's something really bizarre with the fact that ... this this developer wants to come in and spend the night this is what we talked about nine o'clock hour but\nUh the nine ... a skinny three hundred million dollars a lot of his own money and you say no to that and you don't want development and you want to be Picayune about there's been plenty of cities I'm sure we could do a quick Google Search about you know that moment in the seventies or the Yankees were giant what potential tower goes up beacon goes up and changes the whole\nJust the feel and the look and the personality of a city in Providence can't get out of its own way Mike some
