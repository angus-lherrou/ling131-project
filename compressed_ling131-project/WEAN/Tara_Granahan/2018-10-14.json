you doing down where are you call oh okay well record island then we\nGo David said well this is my question okay it regarding the probate I mean they will be an executive and if they wanted the dish in the court to be an executor there were no ... with the except from an automobile which I Know can be done outside of pro they want them in the executor\nShould I filed a petition filed for a well we know that that's what we or should I put it in what voluntary informal executive of a small state\nWhat is it that you're trying to actually probing is it just the vehicle\nWould be the only thing okay and what what is the value of the vehicle votes even though it could be done outside of probate right\nA ... well yes you can check with the DMV on that I Believe one a spouse passes away the other spouse can get the vehicle or without having to go through probate but I think if it's if it's other than that\nYou in this case uh assuming it's only the vehicle you need to get the funeral bill\nYou need to get the uh paid funeral bill I'm a and you would filed the uh informal\nA probate petition now just so everybody knows who's listening this two different types of ways to probate number one is in informal probate when the assets of the state are less than Fifteen thousand dollars that means for example\nOr you have a perhaps somebody passed away with a bank account name of six thousand the bank will not release the funds without that document\nOr the informal probing or perhaps is just a vehicle that you need to transfer title and again you need to have that\nSo in this particular circumstance you can do that the other type of probate is a full probate full probate\nUm there's other things that have to happen for example the executive office of health and Human Services gets notified the Rhode Island division of taxation guess it's a little bit more of a process so with the informal probate\nYou have to wait thirty days after the person passes away then you go with the paid funeral bill\nA death certificate along formed adjusted to forget you can file that the court will generally send you a letter saying that you're appointed as the informal executor and wish that you can go to the deep yet DMV and transfer title to the vehicle\nOkay so you write best approach would be the go with the the the smallest state absolutely yup\nAll right I Am not a spouse I Am at a trial though or\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they're all in for Steve for your own condition it was more than ... religion or against us that's right over two hundred three on cars all my whole models and incredible prices are going to flood auto John job now\nOn the states with that's typical of appointments you'll be able to take that document and the title\nOkay with with the name that needs to be transferred to transfer the title to whoever you need to\nOkay that is something that I can do\nIt something you can do and of course if you if you stumble along though you have a problem you can just give me a call now I'll help you through the process it's it's it's a relatively straightforward process and most of the court even though they'll tell you they can't give you a legal advice we'll give you the forms and tell you what to fill out\nIs it necessary for me to add anything like as a for instance like for it or inside the house\n[noise] yes ordinarily when you're filling out that formed they want a complete list\nOf what it is in the state so most of the time I'll just give you an example if there's a bank account they want the name of the bank the account number in the last statement showing the amount in it\nIf it's a vehicle sometimes he wants to name make model of the vehicle and the mileage and perhaps the Kelley Blue book value because they want to make sure that the value of what assets are a lesson Fifteen thousand dollars\nOkay okay All right well thank you very much Steven oh very\nGood good question Chris thank you for calling in All right next up we have a Marion\nAnd married yes Hi Marion this is Stephen\nAh you're my producer says you're following up on a call how can I help you\nI Am attorney Lindsay I'm ready to go out of my mind I call you and may I with Mary and I'm not down at that time All right um\nWe got in my daddy thing that ... years and his guardianship\nAnd his estate there'll be an ... and my mom and dad or eight years\nA state that ... and the brother and sister still living in the house will hey they could buy it within I my mother that I'm not that that was November twenty nine\nThousand and I'm Sorry November twenty nine and ten\nOn the condition that they keep it up they they haven't kept it up\nAlready I I Do recall your call Marion I called talking to you about it in the in this is a tough situation you know it's ultimately these situations drag on because one party is on represented in other words\nMost of the time if you have an attorney you can go to court with an attorney you can file petitions for review and see if you can get the estate buttoned up\nThe interesting thing in Rhode Island just so you know when you die with the will write\nThe law favors vest sting of a will as soon as practical so what's that means is if you die with a will and you have named beneficiaries\nLaw says that technically probate is supposed to be as happen as soon as it can to affect the transfer of assets as soon as possible\n[noise] um in in that situation you know that's obviously not happening in your case and that's a problem\nSo um you know I I understand what you're saying and it seems to me that\nYou either one of two things you either need to do a petition the probate courts and see if you can get an order from the probate courts would be appeal to the superior court and see if you can get an order from the superior court which would compel the parties to have to comply with the terms and conditions of the will indoor\nForce the person who's serving as administrator to be removed\nWell that\nThat was Aaron by to me and that I showed up in August with my ... to have them removed um brother showed up within ... with the lawyer now in\n... I'm not down on he claims he's representing the state which is fine by individual\nIt's clearly or from my brother on at that hearing the judge really ate my brother a mouthful and he told and\nOnly reason he wasn't a moving and was that they showed up with an attorney my brother had all kinds of it if\nSo what happened to the judge or the property sold or what\nWell no it it it I think it'd be seven or eight things\nHow would you like motor treads twenty gene truck if the here for only one night I mean I Will say hello to port boards twenty four to one fifty the best drug for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a plug for it and he joined Narragansett\nTo get your money and they will change down that discharge for you they actually have a complete service for this which means that you could have gotten your Seventy five thousand dollars they would have a team to discharge a mortgage\nAnd um and it would have gotten process probably a lot faster because it sounds like jokes if you didn't find that discharge a mortgage or probably you would have been calling me saying how do I get my money\nRight yeah so there were there are services out there for this exact situation Joe and it sounds like you weren't advice that\nNo I mean looking back I should have just said I'm not close in on this property until it gets settled in in a cloud over it I mean I'm sure that they could have found that eventually but at what cost you know attorney said and I we can try to correct style of\nCourse of course like well not only that joke think of the interest you lost on your money it costs you money to get through this transaction and and to show up at the closing in somebody to say by the way we're going to hold back Seventy five thousand dollars my opinion would have been your your gut instincts were a hundred percent correct I Would have said to you\nJoe perhaps we don't closed today was given a couple of weeks let me see if I can research ... let me see if I get in touch with my a title insurance companies see what they can do you know what I mean and that way you do when you close\nYou get your money the worst situation as when you close the money is held in escrow and there's an escrow never do that just close and B you want to closure transaction and you want to be done and move on\nYes I mean if I didn't find that a lot of that money\nNo but you I probably I probably would have been able to get it for you um but you know you probably would have still been waiting sure you you're not going to lose the money you wouldn't lose the money\nWith a bang for it I mean let's say it was never charged\nIt doesn't matter because older yeah even when the banks fold their products are sold to a different servicing company and what happens is we're able to get the discharge a mortgage from that other servicing company so we can't trace it down it can be done so\nI remember years ago I ... in the house and then they sent me the paper from the bank said it's up to you to discharge ... let's see if I didn't let this wasn't sure what I'm saying I'm fortunately it was I mean I found the paper but um if it was never discharged\nThat would still be would it be outer case to poor for\nHim no because we would have uh like I told you Joey would have to chase it down but the reality is now a days just so everybody's clear Ninety nine percent of the lenders healthier automatically when you pay off a mortgage they send in the discharge to the recorder of deeds\nSo you don't have to worry about it but um yeah next time I'm mix you give me a call when you're buying and selling All right well thank you All right Joe you got to take yeah\nAll right next up we're battling ... Hi you're on the air with Stephen\nI can Bernie I'm\nI have a um a question for you ... um what are the laws in state of Rhode Island concern or pools and ... of the pool\nOh what's going on\n[noise] well I have a NATO was a very large pool [noise] around above ground pool and she's not going to censor property Shirley for war the neighbor to think that on either side\nThis in um I like a twenty seven for their\nUm it is covered um but that covers the non for about five years that is beginning to age I'm In a lot of water through the summertime which you know I Would do that though it Jack Lew is you know\nShe does have a um a deal that flu type their ladder to get up at but you know like late I don't have a pool I used to and I was completely ... by\nMany years but I'm I'm the fence it got old and it got run away and um her tree actually finished taking down life and [noise]\nBut um [noise] you know she refuses to censor property now she is open on both sides of her home\nWhich anybody ... child anybody could get in and I asked her many times you know like do you want to go hat\nThat she's not one who is going to go have I'm ... now than they do it and she said she simply cannot afford it but in my mind I feel if you're going to have some\nHow would you like motor trench twenty or gene trucks will be here for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty four to one fifty best for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars for only a point forward and he went into and there were against it\nSure that's a um that see a really good question\nAnd I'm generally in Rhode Island each town and municipalities has their own a building inspector in and they have their own zoning code as far as when a pool needs an enclosure now most towns require that a pool be enclosed\nA for example by a fence of the minimum height of four feet in actually because of your closing a pool defense go up to eight or ten feet whatever it may be\nUh you live in Cobb injury and um you know being in college and treat the building inspector might have different rules and regulations\nA but generally I Would say it's four feet high at least the minimum you have to navigate locking gate so these are like building code issues you have to have a locking gate you have to have\nA material such as chain link would cement or metal has to be something structural something sound\nAnd if a person has a pool and they don't have this it essentially it's up to the building inspector to issue a notice a violation which would be a notice saying that hey look you got a pool you're supposed to have a fence put the fence up ... take the pool down\nThose are the those are the kinds of things so it may very well start with your building inspectors office and making a call to them and expressing your concerns\nAs a neighbor and as a resident that you know you don't want to see something happen bad here in you've asked and now\nYou're concerned about this maybe you have grandchildren maybe you have children or whatever that may get injured are hurt if they think this pool is what's called an attractive nuisance\nWhich is something where for example children are gravitate towards pools they gravitate towards fireworks they gravitate towards big holes in the ground you know those types of things then you have to provide protection for that\nSo I guess at this particular juncture you've done what you could recommend you give me a building inspector recall and just ask them the question and see if that's something they can come out and take a look at\nYeah they will do that and I just wanted to ask something by you also can't claim that because for poll is by foot high she doesn't mean it was\n... well that that could be something in common tree I don't know maybe she's already checked with the building inspector but you know I Would probably just check in with them and say\nI'm going to do that All right I'm ... and\nI'm going to give your office the call I asked the question\nOh no problem Emma thank you so much have a good do\nYou too Bye bye good question you know those issues come up a lot\nAnd like I said each town in municipalities has their own rules and regulations and\nThe and it always starts with the building inspector they're the best well informed person as far as whether or not somebody is in violation of a covered building codes all righty so the number here is four oh one for three eight nine seven seven section one hundred and three two one WPRI oh this is the attorney ... and
