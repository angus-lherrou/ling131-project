become a [noise]\nWell that's a political football a very serious one however in the governor's race so good morning everyone we're going to get right to it or talk about a press conference that Alan ... had a yesterday laying out plans for D.C YIF reforms\nAnd he was standing in front of the department of children youth and families yesterday and he accuses governor Gina Raimondo of quote gross mismanagement\nAnd laying out the changes that he would make as the governor and we'll dig into what he says about gross mismanagement it is a very important department obviously it's always had issues I'm not so sure if it's under funded\nNot running well I've spoken to you about during those oversight committees and I have talked about them extensively with the oversight chairperson which is represented Patricia ... where she informed us\nAt one point uh the folks that are working within the D.C ... didn't even know which manager or which department leader they were to go to so they had to put up\nA poster sort of a chart\nTo tell people where they should be going in in twenty Eighteen that sounds insane to me that's always stuck in my head that little piece of information\nYou know ... you have a you're desperate for you have a family campaign and you're rooting for tragedy this is also from my grand from ... team Romano\nAnd talking about a D.C wife which will be ... we started off talking about uh how is your campaign going financially or you pushing through the last couple of weeks or what's going on there\nAh it's despicable first uh that he's saying I'm rooting for tragedy I'm just reporting facts facts that he can't dispute and he's the one that is being dishonest or trying to spin away from you know what is happening\nI Am laying out my plans for fundamental change I've been crisscrossing the state uh throughout these last now twenty days tower and you know we're doing well financially it's very difficult because of the governor is\nBuying this election trying to buy it with all of her out of state interest uh it's unconscionable how much money she said I had to laugh tower and that last debate it you are right when the question came up about negative ads\nAnd you know I got her first I you know I laid out what I've been doing in my plans my positive ads about change talking about our small business when it came to her she said\nHave positive ads I almost with my head around looking at her like I kidding me [laughter] I just didn't have the opportunity to respond because every single thing after the primary has been nothing more than\nA hundreds of thousands if not millions targeted negative ads are dishonest negative ads about Cranston about me and my positions and that's what this governor has been about from day one she is the one I'm rolling by jumping into the mud and continue to play and outlawed\nI'm going to keep talking to voters making sure they know about my plans are about the incompetence of the governor the gross mismanagement not only at D.C why yeah at the age at all because of her political appointments all costing millions and the message I left\nWith many of the voters um that I tried to get out there at that you are right debate was this\nThe governor of budget has increased\nOn this close to four years nearly a billion dollars like you better for it today ah then when she first started we still have long lines\nKnow ... do you see why you have a was cited but we can't even get stupid trash cans Tara down at ... at each in the summer and trashes littering the place it's crazy this is

S. right Human Services you have problems or they still sit at home on the phone for hours trying to get some kind of answers\nAbout nursing home payments placements etcetera and it's on\nBelievable when you break it down it's easy to avoid because nobody likes to see the ugliness right nobody likes to see the ugly stuff\nLet's talk about all the you know computers in the classroom I I Know that's all important but I don't think it rivals the importance of the feeling departments and they've been overlooked for very long time or let's take some phone calls for three eight nine seven seven six Josie Johnston until the apparel Hi Joe\nWanted a high there oh you good how are you a\n... a ... what are the use of having a Republican governor and a Republican president or just off the top yeah what are the advantages for the people of Rhode Island\nYou tell me what's the advantage of having a democratic uh\nGovernor and a Democratic president I mean I don't know what what we're we're going we're\nTalking about DC Wyeth will tell me how this all comes together oh\nThe federal ... the the local government\nWe do get federal dollars issue our\n... is the dollars that can come into the state of Rhode Island oh\nWell I say I think you have to keep a closer eye than on what your for delegates in Washington are doing they bring home the federal monies right we can settle it up and we have screwed it up under this administration between losing you know we've gotten federally find\nA with the EU hip situation we've got federal fines or with the scooping I Believe coming with the scooping of the nine one one money's so if you don't play by the rules and you don't answer the federal inquiries and they come into town yeah that's a problem\nSo I mean the president has two more years in office I think being a smart economic ... I think we should all think up ... as far as what the federal government can do to help us you know and ...\nAnd here's an email though you can bring in the federal dollars and Senator Jack Reed is really good at that ... but then where does it go once he does what he has to do and he brought in what one point two billion dollars for roads and bridges have you seen that money put to work\nWhere to go did go into the general fund\nRight so that that so then the people have at the state house can decide how to do it how to use it that you that is the real problem Joe I don't know I I Know what I see and when I read and the information that we get has people in the media jak Reid's office brings in a ton of money\nNow how it gets doled out I have no idea because Everytime you ask for shouldn't we audit the general fund do you know the governor said the other night that she's the one that she doesn't see a need for the inspector general's\nOffice go go\nPut that in your hat on that was that that you are I debate they went right down the line would you look at a you know and are you going to instill if you become the governor is for people on the stage inspector general I Do believe she was the one that said I don't see a need for that\nSo that that's troublesome [laughter]\nWe don't want an independent entity trying to figure out where all this money is going to have a nine billion dollar budget but we don't need to know where how it's all being handed out that's concerning to me thank you Joe for three eight nine seven seven six pizza ...\nThank you for having me on the program sure ...
