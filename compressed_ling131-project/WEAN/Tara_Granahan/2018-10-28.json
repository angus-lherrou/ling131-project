I'll give you my ... best a worker's comp the answer when I'm handling workers' comp cases in folks come in to see me\nA ordinarily what I tell them is while they're receiving the benefits and while the insurance company is doing what they're doing\nMost of the time they're okay you know the words you can continue on when you get to the point that you just hit the wall where they're telling you that because of your injury might not be able to return to work\nYou need representation it's at this point that the insurance companies going to take one of two courses of action one course of action is where they will issue a a notice that you've reached maximum medical improvement\nAnd perhaps even try to stop your weekly compensation payments and take some other course of action\nI'm so by retaining counsel at this point if especially if you're not going to be able to or may not be able to return to your full time employment because of the injury is is a very good course of action Michael I strongly recommend that you give me a call at this point\nOkay All right we're um yeah yeah I appreciate you know\nOf course my ... my office numbers for nine zero forty nine hundred

they're paying you a weekly rate on a regular basis it's not a problem once you get to the end of that stand\nThen it becomes an issue more like a negotiation with in with the uh insurance company to try to determine what are they gonna do not only for your future medical needs\nBut also for your future earnings that you're gonna be entitled to and and that's when you need to seek counsel cause you definitely need to get somebody on your side who's going to be able to steer you guide you through that process\nWhether it be a commutation process or a memorandum of agreement there's a couple of different avenues workers' comp can go\nI Know I'm getting into deep into workers' comp I Apologize it's just Michael had a very important question already we have Joni in Cranston Hi Joan you're on the air\nHigh a I Am Seventy six years so I got a house that's paid for\nI've got a life a say in the house and I got my ... names on it what happens when I go to the nursing home and I run out of money\nOkay how long have you had that life has said on your house\nA fight is\nOkay so what will happen is um when you go to the nursing home you they you have to disclose all of your assets so part of your assets include a life is state\nHowever a life a state is not subject to a Medicare Medicaid lean so what would happen is God Forbid you went into a nursing home and passed away\nYour children because they don't have to go to probate would end up owning the property free and clear of any lean from the nursing home\nSo how would I get a lane and if you wouldn't you'd be free and clear\nBut but what happens when I run out of money at the same taste for it\nOkay so if you have savings and you have like money and accounts that you can utilize to pay for your care\nWhat will happen is they'll require that you spend down that money in other words pay for your care while you can write them when you've depleted that amount of money and you have less than roughly four thousand dollars of assets in total\nYou can apply for Medicaid and become eligible where the government will step in and pay for your or care to the Medicaid program\nThey will not go after my kids to pay for it for them is an army and on the house this ... you\nKnow that's a very rare now there are there a lot of people here this so I just if I can take a moment there are a couple of laws in Rhode Island one law in Rhode Island says that if your spouse\nGoes in for emergency medical treatment the other spouse can be held responsible for the entire bill if there's no insurance is another law that says if you're a parent and goes in\nAnd you're essentially the primary caregiver you could be held responsible but that is hardly ever enforced so I matter of fact I've never seen it enforced [noise]\nSo I don't think they're going to have a problem oh okay so once you've spent ... once you end up spending down whatever you need to spend down in your on your accounts\nAnd you're under the threshold\nYou'll be eligible to apply for that Medicaid benefits and then you'll be a you'll be covered you'll receive your care and your children will own the home\nFree and clear thank you very much alright thank you\nHave no problem Jones you got it\nYou know that's in that and that's a good thing Joan did she planned in advance you know just like when you tax\nPlan and you plan for things in advance a there are things that you can play in advance so a lot of businesses can take deductions one year or take the deductions the following year or take a certain type of deduction one year depending on what their income flows will be\nAnd it's the same thing with planning planning your state\nWhen you're a state planning you're basically planning how you're going to apply your deductions\nTo maximize the maximum a tax benefits so to speak so that you can have your assets for the future it's very interesting area of law one that I really enjoy helping people with\nSo the number here is four oh one for three eight nine seven seven six oh one eight hundred three two one W.

Hi you're on the air with Stephen\nHi I have a quite slick are for power\nOn\nUh the woman who called and he mentioned that island law regarding next to Ken and the liability for elsewhere ties in with the the nursing home\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model what pays more than ... around because we're a certified buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nThe state and having the financial issues that we have with our you know government as well as the nursing homes and the hospitals that might be a point where they decide hey that's the kind of short and so uh that we can plug for\nIt budget so my concern is if they did they can go after the next the pen\nOn say it was myself\nI have a house and I had to things and I were like ... or whatever I don't know a lot of what like hey but still couldn't they could have run on my house that they put that they use my savings\nSo very good question so if the way the war is written it's written as if um the spouses are meant to take care of each other so if your spouse does go into the hospital there has already been a Supreme Court case in Rhode Island believe it or not which has said\nThat the statute which imposes the liability for unpaid medical bills upon the ... upon the spot surviving spouse is constitutional\nAnd so therefore I'm\nA debt collectors are people who collect for the hospital can file civil claims against spouses to collect on those bills\nAs far as children goes the only time I've seen it happen has been when parents had made massive distributions to their children\nTo do you liquidate their estate in other words to try to give it all the way right away and then the state or the uh executive office of health and human resources say a oh wait a minute\nThat money should have been used to pay for their care and in that case they go after the kids and say either you a choice a\nPay the money or choice B you provide the care uh so it's it's a scary consequences but I haven't seen it enforced where you take mom to the hospital mom gets a nine thousand dollar bill and now they're sending you the bill I have I haven't seen that I'm not seeing it wouldn't happen\nBut I haven't seen it and um but if you if they did try to win force that bill against you\nAre yes it eventually if they sued you and you didn't fight it they could get a judgment and get a lean on your home so to speak yes but a a ... that one has not been tested in the courts like the other like the one between spouses does that help\nOkay so that's in the case where the parent liquid liquefied their state before anything happened ... ...\nRight and then tries to give it all due to one or two kids right and then all of a sudden they say I don't have any money in the state says well wait a minute where did the money go and then you know now the now ... now it's the hunt is on but in certain cases like you take mom to the hospital to get cataract surgery and she is eleven hundred dollar co pay\nI haven't seen yet be where they take the statue and now ... down from ... eleven hundred dollar co pay\nOkay so I have\nA big heat on our house and I've had it for a while and beyond five years okay and so in that house is sold than a ... and at this point is the on a grasp of says the state the nursing home whatever that is true\nThough so they couldn't come back and say hey oh yeah you know we know that you ... it had this house\nUm that it was subject to this but it's been beyond five years but you know too that we're going to go after you anyway that's not going to be the case no um it sounds like if she didn't date liquefy it if he didn't liquid by her it's eight\nOr just before something happened mhm I'm that I'm not liable for anything current even on the book\nYou write so the there's a difference there's a difference between estate planning where you're planning in advance just like you do with tax returns and stuff like that versus simply digesting yourself of everything and then saying you don't have anything you know that that's this two different two different things\nTo thank you for calling in good question good question good follow up question I Love it\nAlready is the number here is four oh one for free eight nine seven seven six or one eight hundred three two one W.

I'm here until eleven o'clock we're here we're gonna talk real estate you're talking about mortgages if you'd like most importantly the anything that's on your mind we'd like to hear from you our listeners talking to you is what moves this program along with it is the reason I come\nHere on Sundays if I if I didn't have an opportunity to speak with the listeners I Would not do the show because I'm not here to preach it you I'm here to converse with you and maybe help you with your problems I'm someone who's been in real estate for\nA close to three decades now so getting getting up there buying and selling homes building homes um I have some rental properties a couple of commercial property so mostly residential I've I've done everything around the residential transaction right now along with my partner's Susan rolls I own Windsor ... real estate\nAnd we're helping people buy and sell all the time that we've\nWe've closed dime over five hundred homes so far this year and uh so that's a number of transactions that's a number of problems that we've run into\nAnd typically when when a problem occurs once it's going to occur again it might not occur for several years but it's good to to have dealt with it before so ... with my experience here\nI'm here to help you if you have an issue um and if you're a real estate professional and you want to share something with us\nYour ideas on the market or um or anything that you might want to share with us you can call in again our number is four three nine seven seven six or one eight hundred three two one W. P. R. O. um you know I was just looking at the numbers and like\nI I think I have P. T. S. D. from the last market crash you know 'cause it was so deep and and so hard and so\nYou know I I don't I think I'm a little leery of what's happening in the market but then I look at the numbers I say you know what things are still strong things are still strong we're looking with us far\nThis month we've had seven hundred and Seventy one closings in the medium price is two hundred and Seventy five thousand and that's right in line with the same amount of closings as last year and actually the medium prices up nearly five percent\nThe days on market is down five days so things are still looking strong despite the rates are rising\nUm although rates did take back a little bit this week there were four seven five I think last week and in the overnight or the weekly average was four seven for thirty year fix this week I were to go to the phone lines to John in common tree your morning John how are you today\nYeah I mean they almost like cancelled the morning news to do the post game shows and all that stuff\nYeah yeah that's they said that the uh\nThe sports acres were still there as the morning show guys were coming in which is unusual yeah\nSo anyway so we're all tired and now the Celtics have been playing and I'm a basketball fans and I enjoy\nWhen the Celtics are good staying up and watching those games and that's when they start you know east coast time and I can I can watch the football game and get to the end um any how are you guys glad that you've heard my ah [laughter] what\nHappens in my household at night yeah I'm All right so we're going to talk a little bit about you know if you're somebody out there and you're considering selling your home there's a lot of talk this way or that way to say what should I Do\nUm should I put it on the market now or should I wait until the spring where it's traditionally we'll all say a stronger market and I'm going to say when somebody asked me the question what's the best time to sell my standards\n... group wants your car any make any model flood pays more than anything around because we're a certified buying center at will vie yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nOn a follow up questions so I Would say to you though it's whenever you were ready whenever your red he's the best time to sell so you know um\nIf your homes prepared and your motivated and you have a reason you want to be leaving your home right now then I think now is as good a time as any to sell it if you have\nYou know work to do and things like that is you know a lot of times and you got to get that stuff done before you put it on the market and I'd rather see you\nYou know put I'd rather see you put a properly prepared in priced house on the market in the off selling season then one that is not those things in the prime selling season ... I'll tell you some of the advantages of selling right now\nThere are there is less competition out there okay now right now there are\nA we're in an environment where the\nInventory is creeping up a little bit I'm just pulling some numbers before the show there's thirty two hundred and fifty one single family homes for sale in the state of Rhode Island over the course of the last Ninety Days we've closed twenty nine hundred and forty one I'm so basically\nIt's almost the same number which would mean that it's a three months worth of immature it's a little more than three months worth of inventory out there so it is low low inventory environment still um and it makes a difference you know if you're so let's say you have a condo\nAnd you put your condo on the market and you're in association where a lot of the units are very similar and there's four other units out there for sale\nThat's going to be difficult for you to be the one the one to sell because I don't know why are they going to buy your is it's either going to be the superior location superior condition or a better price um but if you're the only one on\nAnd you're the only game in town then if you of attracted somebody to that association or or if in a case of a house it's attracted somebody to that neighborhood you're the only game in town maybe you can negotiate a little stronger whole you know not giving on certain certain um\nThings that a buyer might ask for because they don't have another place to go um you know what else is a good part about selling this year and it's actually\nEven though it's difficult for us as agents to get used to the slowing down like we we just came from an environment where\nIt was difficult to even get back to people at the end of the day and call all the people that have called you throughout the course of the day and that that it's slowed down considerably but the number of sales haven't slowed down equal to that and it's seasonal so what you get in the in the fall in the winter\nAre serious buyers that are motivated\nTo look at property because they want to buy property there's a lot less of those people that are just kind of scouting things out you know you know the person that would would just go to an open house because\nIt's something to do well that person in the in the winter\nOr the fall maybe they're driving around looking at leaves today and they're going to go look at Christmas lights you know in a few weeks but they're not coming to open houses and they're not scheduling appointments to look at properties so you're getting just a serious buyer so your hip ratios better\nBy hit ratio I mean the number of showing that it takes to get to a sale so even though the length of time might be longer to sell the property the time that your disturbed\nAnd removed from your house and having to prepare your home for sale is limited\nBecause of the lower amount of showing so that is an advantage um [noise]\nThen you have the homes that are I'll call them a winter like you know they say people are a winter spring or an autumn or whatever but I I feel like Holmes\nEach individual home looks better at a particular time of year so like my house my house or the focal point of our\nOur property is our pool and I'm In the summertime my wife has that place looking fantastic when planting and flowers and you know a\nPatio furniture would colors that pop and it's just my house is a summer I'm never I'm or it's a spring summer it's got to\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator one Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nThat's what I'm selling is outdoor living summertime living spring living now\nThere's other properties that maybe they look better in the wintertime maybe I'm\nMaybe there's views that you get because there's no leaves on the trees so it's better to look at them then or maybe maybe your grass in your in your\nLandscaping isn't beautiful\nAnd it kind of looks the same in the winter as it does in the summer like maybe maybe that's the type of house that you know it's better to put off this time of year maybe your roof is a little\nShocked clot right and uh [laughter] you you want to sell it would snow over so does it say no and that's that but you know what I'm you get the point that you know if their\nPay in the summertime right people walk around your property and they really inspect the heck out of it in the winter time they're just getting in the front door and kicking the snow off their boots and and you know\nTry to warm up and so if it I'm not saying I'm trust me I'm not telling you to pass on like a bad issue to people but what I'm trying to say is that people will be more forgiving of some of those ... things in the wintertime when it's not the focal point of what they're looking at\nAnd they're more coming into your house and we owe fire ... fire if you have a fireplace such good\nMaybe to sell this time of year so those are those are some of the things\nUm\nYou also can look at interest rates and where we anticipate them going I mentioned on the top of the show they actually kicked down a little bit to four point seven percent from four point seven five last time I was in the studio um but we do anticipate\nWith the fed raising the rate that banks borrow money from each other I Believe that that will lead into our third year fixed rate continuing to rise overtime so\nBuyers tend to buy payments okay if rates are going up\nThan buyers buyer borrowing power if everything else states still\nIs being reduced so the amount that they're willing to pay for property is being reduced now we we have to take into account other factors besides just rates in the economy and if jobs are people getting paid more and there's more jobs um you know that\nThan we do have room for prices to rise even in a rising rate environment but\nIf you're somebody considering selling and you're not sure you know none of us can really be sure where rates are going to be in what's going to be going on with the economy after a you know a month from now never mind after\nWe have a whole new Congress and the new Senate and um new government here in Rhode Island possibly you know so you look at things and you say well with the ... in in this rate rising environment maybe I'm Better off to put my home on the market today um\nYou know the other thing is\nRight now you do have people that are paying attention so you know you have motivated buyers which is great you have\nMortgage brokers in real estate agents who are less taxed and home inspectors who are less taxed so the process of selling a home or buying a home right now it you get paid more attention to so it's more of a\nI don't know I'm going to say a boutique feeling but you you just you know somebody who's\n... take somebody who's selling fifty houses a year in in June that person is might have twelve closings in December they might have three so if you're their customer in June you're not getting the same attention it's like going to a restaurant on a Tuesday night instead of instead of a friday night you know I'm\nBuyers are going to view that property no matter what you're offering for compensation to the co broke but the ... you know they're the ones in vi buyers they're the ones right so they don't have to they don't even know any man has to know that this person's a moving them away from his property but they're doing it\nAnd and ... and but you know\nThat's out there to my friend the agent them to do this job is one that won like there are a lot of that going on you know and and I didn't realize it was so I've been doing this\nWell you know\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in East Village and there were against it of the best financed reason unbeatable prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what are those are Tom\n... says oh if this person shows my house we're going to pay them less than they pay ... and that\n... to me if an agency is getting their clients involved in that type of crap then then that's a mistake like I wouldn't I wouldn't work with any agency that was that was doing any of that business you know because because all it is is\nYou know you want you want to get your house so that's your goal\nAnd you want to do it and you don't mind paying your agent now you don't want to give them an arm and a leg sometimes you look and see what agents making go chiefs they're making a fortune and it's sometimes it feels like we are you know for for a in some cases for what we're doing but for everyone that goes smooth there's another one that\nThat you know I have a house right now I haven't I've been around for two years\nOn my on my own so I got to decide do I dropped my certain amount of drama I Am I going to know and I'm like oh or like I said\nThat's not going to\nThe gym and a half percent is not going to make a difference except for the fact that industry you know\nAs I say it's not going to make a difference it's not going to get more eyes on your property it's not like when that changes it's not going to go back through the computer is a new listing nothing's gonna change only I Know that guy and so your best bet is get to the right price for the consumer\nAnd and and the truth is I mean you got to pay the real estate agents to do the job if you want them to work on your behalf\nYou you have to pay a you know you have to pay them and and they're going to get paid what no matter what so so like in your case right if you were if you if I was working with the client and I saw your Angela's listening offering to present\nI Would have already had a conversation with my ... a head of time about my expectation of how much I Want to get paid\nFor no matter what I showed them because I don't want to be a person who only shows them houses that I'm getting paid more on and stuff so I lay out my expectation and I say if the seller is now offering this amount than in our off or we're going to ask that I get paid that on your behalf\nAnd so that's how that's how you know at my company we we want our agents to show\nEverything you know maybe you know what I\nMean you know it's a bad one stick out there's a lot of really good agents and sometimes I feel like like I'm On some negative towards towards real estate agents I'm I feel like there's a lot of a Yahoo is out there and that the the barriers to entry into the\nInto the profession isn't as great as I Would like to see any oversight\nFrom the actual individual broke ridges on each transaction isn't as great as I'd like to see they've they've turned the real estate agent into the star of the show for some reason\nSo a lot of these companies um they really each individual real estate agent is running their own show under the umbrella of a brokerage\nAnd there's really limited over say on how they run their business and and the guidance that people\nNeed you know so [laughter] yeah but there's a lot of good agent Smith and and God Bless you know I Know you're not you know I'm with you know but but you know what they weren't\nThey ... they but but know that you're eight like I'm Thanksgiving last year I was in my truck negotiating a deal while my family's inside eating dinner you know what I mean like like there's that\nI'm not the only one\nMan I ... I get emails from people midnight one in the morning from agents that are finding time so so\nYou know you're you've got to be on all the time you ... it's kinda like being a doctor on call almost you know as a God Knows we're not dealing with life and death and all that\nBut you're available to your clients at times that in other businesses you're not and you do deserve something for that you do deserve some hazard pay [laughter] think I'm not\nSaying one thing I'm not I'm not on\nWhy are you on all the sites hold on one second okay can you hold on one second Tyler I Know we have to take a commercial I'm talkative Angelo\nQuit acting like a monkey back to [laughter] no no he just got mad that I scolded him on there it wasn't a scolding it was a it was it was a warm I got your title\nBut anyway it was a point statement [laughter] but um [laughter] no you don't know and so on and on the MLS\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln MTC and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator flood Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nAnd ... so\nYou're going to look at your your listing agreement if you want me to review it for you I Will have to you know but you're going to look at it and see a if that\nCould be on right now I just think that I'm not good enough I don't want to mess around and I got my cell phone or the first time that you're just\nYou know can I tell you something in my opinion you know not knowing the price of your house in the specifics four percent is low fee that that the person's charging you and sometimes it doesn't give you the money that you need to do all the\n... to God and that's just you know All right I\nDo I'm trying to get everybody to go on strike I Want to I Want to whatever you want I Want to not want to do to march ... not going to\nKnow right don't get it out to me it it will never hurt you to put it out it was made people as you can as long as the photos look good the description that you know\nRussia you know I Wish I could give it the line what\nAge will catch me I'm gonna give you my cell number you got a second\n[laughter] and I like to talk with you\nKnow talking to you know six for one yeah three three three seven let me know the address I'll take a quick look it up and I'll look I'll share it with my people at the at work\nOr you know you don't want to get through two and a half right\nOr or or or or even possibly [laughter] ... you never know\nIt took you are right [noise] oh good times good times I Love I Love our listeners I Love I Love real estate so fun you know until it's not no All right let's take a break\nA\nHello may I help you I'm looking for an engagement ring well I assure you we have what you're looking for I'm looking for forever mark diamond a yes or\nDo you carry them did you know before World War two only ten percent of engagement rings had diamonds in them no my fiance watch only a forever mark diamond I assume you know they're not only the highest quality that responsibly source throughout their entire journey and I assume you know the the global diamond industry employees ten million people imagine [laughter]\nActually I'm imagining putting up forever more diamond on my fiance finger do you have them [laughter] and there's your answer\nBack scary is the only to live in Rhode Island that carries forever my diamond ring necklaces earrings and bracelets age comes with the promise that it is beautiful\nAnd responsibly sorry I'm going to head over to\n... if you weren't so sure of what you were looking for we would have it I think you're setting as a few pong\nFast cultivating relationships since Nineteen sixty\nMessage in ... we could try an MBA course on line before applying to the program with the University of Illinois you can there ...
