I think a lot of people feel she's closed off\n... that's probably a campaign and thank you good points I appreciate it for three eight nine seven seven six four three eight WPRI let's break it down with kidney see from WPRI channel twelve or in conjunction with Roger Williams university they have the latest poll the mornings had\nGood morning to how you doing good I'm gonna have to pick your brain on the other story that you're dropped on us last night as well would you do your duty [laughter] and I should have just come in and do the show with me now [laughter] but I Know you're very busy and the\nReally appreciate you having me unfair because they can here and I've been listening to your your caller um and I ... that there are questions ... and how it works I appreciate the opportunity to talk a little more to help people understand why regular at how we do it and and what we would not critical out there we didn't think was right and they're\nNo absolutely ... people just try to you know this is where I was at an event last night myself and people said did you do to see the new pull did you see the new pole and then you know inevitably a woman who was sitting alongside said oh I've got a phone call and that was in the campaigns are making all these phone\nCalls as well so yes than any more than we are yes what Joe Fleming\nIs doing and what channel twelve is doing with regimens university and other pollsters is very very different than the that random call you get we happen to be walking by the microwave and the phone rings in the kitchen\nAnd you can you know immediately who they're calling for and it's a campaign by the tone of the questions and how they're the leading question this is very different is that are we in the same page Ted's\nYeah I mean look we all we all conduct the basic thing we all do it the same right we're calling a landlines the cell phones past people questions about their voting behaviors and they're you know how they're planning to vote but the campaigns are usually also asking\nFrequently they're asking people think they are asking a lot of questions like let's say you've got to today and they were like how would you if you knew Gina Raimondo blue six hundred plus million dollars on your hip and you know still hadn't had it\nRight and you might say oh well that's that's a biased question you know the governor that's that's really nasty governor or how would you feel new balance on how to handle in his police department so but that's often the campaigns testing what messages will affect voters most when they go out and can't ... I\nBelieve yeah what what what do I go to my next commercial right\nIt messaging to what we're doing\nYeah what what what do I get in my next commercial right\nYeah it's it's a messaging so what we're doing is we're basically just asking like where do you think you're gonna vote for how do you feel about the candidates and usually a couple of issues questions like and we asked about legalizing marijuana the journal somebody looking at that rate out mhm um\nAnd so yeah it's we there's as you I was so you pointed out that Tim pointed out in this story last night on channel twelve there's a margin of error I'd point so\nThat means we have ... at forty five that means in\nOur poll is actually saying she somewhere between forty and fifty but you know we think the ... it's close to forty five ... either thirty four well that means he could be as high as thirty nine and as I was twenty um and it's that or and so\nI think it's I think what people what sometimes is hard to understand when you see these hard numbers is we're saying it's a round that ... like what you really should increase in the polls is not the specific number it's the sort of\n... and the thrust is we've never seen a public poll where Alan ... and if anything all the polls are showing her with a bigger lead this fall and she had previously and I think\nIt's dangerous for voters to be overly dismissive of that because it really is sending a message you don't want you know under reelected you don't like this you should be you should spend your entire weekend at the phone campaign headquarters girl of campaign headquarters knocking doors and canvassing because as you said there's undecided man people ship their vote by\nYou know that the campaigns I'm I'm fully confident this is the bare representation of the race a lead for governor a Monday but she has not put it away\nRight so we've got it and I like the way you broke down to five percent could go either way so that you have governor or Monday at forty five she could go she could did some something crazy could blow the state house again right and it could go either forty hours a day\nAnd a couple of weeks ago I said my my goodness she has the ability to hit fifty which I did not think would happen but she does she also has the ability to go to forty right\nYes and I think you know even I heard the last caller said oh you know the polls were wrong about\nDonald Trump and Hillary Clinton I get that a lot I I I think people are a little bit missed remembering what happened I read that there were not a lot of poll that showed Donald Trump the head of Hillary and in fact if you remember\nThere were one the number of votes by three million but she lost the electoral college which a poll was never going to tell you I'm his votes were just in the right place the Trump campaign was brilliant about where they put their resources ... um\nBut even in that race okay so I think of the final month of how that went or October eleventh act Hollywood it comes out a big blow to the Trump campaign\nRight people think oh boy that's it you're going to go down people are mad\nBut then October twenty eight the new James Comey letter comes out against Hillary Clinton all of a sudden she takes a while at the last minute so as you said sorry if some news comes out of the state house today involving the governor big news out of Cranston about the mayor\nThat could totally shifting even since our coal here it's just a snapshot of where the voters were as you said about ten to six to ten days ago\nYeah it's I it's it's amazing because if you shift you if you shift at the top and that whole um give or take five percent\nAnd and if people are either whatever ... they change their mind or they and they didn't want to be forthcoming or however the numbers come out she could go down to forty Alan ... go to thirty nine\n... it in his perfect world right certainly ... uh and the undecideds maybe or you know maybe ... decides whatever he decides to do but I I just I heard from him last night he's not going anywhere\nAre you still talking forty thirty nine then you've got the chunk for low in the trunk of others in the chunk of undecided so that's it you know if you I'm sure that some people are saying we could still do this\nWell exactly right you know look it's I've I think if they were being honest the funk campaign would say\nIt they're very much under dogs at the moment right they have a bear the polls aren't they're not a head\nAll the public polls there behind my understanding is they have around to make up in the private pulling the campaigns looking at too so\nBut when you that you know he's a thirty four in our policies or well let's say a couple of jokes or low voters go back to Alan ... go to Alan ... okay that gets him to let's say seven or eight than let's say you get most of the undecided voters suddenly he's right near governor reminders forty five now\nThe problem is the governor's campaign is not going to spend the next week standing still either right and they are well aware that they they need to work hard to keep their ... and try to win this race and so\nYou know the funk campaign right now really need to have a really good I Know a week you know very active really hitting messages that the voters really want to hear\nThen they probably also need the governor's campaign to slip up\nI'm more significantly than we've seen them do so far\nAs they're almost on you\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again what borders over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine promote flood of every dollar every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nOr there's a chance you could change and they are very close Raimondo and phone\nYeah that's it yeah terribly added that I'm In the last election two for our final call again partly to help people understand what the old saying though\nIn this even in article\n... about a little more than two thirds and the phone voters actually a bit more than two thirds of their voters they definitely voting that even leave the trunk of each of their voters who could change their mind is your local or a third of them told us that you could build change their mind\nUm and so that shows that even these numbers the forty five ... thirty for her phone guy patrol oh\nIs plenty of room for voters to shift to change their mind and that's in addition to the ... or so I don't want an overly undermined the poll I Do think generally we're giving people a sense of where the race bad but I also want to be clear snapshot and it you know an estimate an approximation\nAbsolutely and then of course the ... we ... you looked at a couple of different things I don't think there's any real big surprises as far as the Senate race with Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and judge Robert Flanders uh he's far ahead senator way yeah I\nThought to be honest I thought you might you know a couple a little pick up for Robert Flanders you know he did um you mean such a big deal out of children White Houses questioning at the Kavanaugh hearing\nAnd he did well in you know eight yeah\nExactly people generally I heard positive reviews of him and that to be so you know I it's a blue state we have an elected\nAny Republicans who weren't named ... to the Senate since the Nineteen thirties so we knew it would be an uphill battle but\nUh I was a little surprised that we came in almost exactly the same like it didn't seem you know it appears me ... made a positive effect on people argue with him but didn't pick up\nUndecided and didn't bring over Sheldon Whitehouse orders which is a debate caught\n... and one more thing Ted nice he WPRI a as well as Roger Williams university with Joe Fleming they did a poll released it yesterday afternoon you look at marijuana should the state legalize recreational marijuana that's across the board right not not ...\nNot medical recreational marijuana and a sense of shame um voters were asked is correct four hundred and six hundred\nAnd fifty six percent think that the state should legalize walls thirty seven percent said no\nYeah I thought that was an interesting finding again if you say ... probably not a shock to people it seems like this is the way\nPublic opinion is trending on I Want us sort of a live and let live kind of approach to that where you know about it but no need to make it illegal anymore we're seeing nationally do the numbers that legalized pot or trendy in favor um but it is interesting because the general assembly has a commission meeting right now\nYou know frankly I it's why I'm I Know people have their frustrations with the media but it's why I only read more reporters in Rhode Island because I I think there's more story then all of us can even get to some of the time [laughter]\n'cause you need a couple of hours of sleep and I had

I can tell it's infuriating ... he calls it you're macho Abou fraternal oh is it move for Raimondo I Will give you this it's sticking that has stuck that ... that has stuck by it's not helping you move in these polls either\nWell here's what it is we're we're gonna have to make sure that that his numbers go down and it's a numbers game it's a mathematics game and the only way to really enact change in our state\nIs to get his numbers down have those individuals come in to see that on the only one or that can change our state uh this change that our state so desperately needs and I've got to get that\nYou know out to his voters but most importantly to those independents that is still undecided and you know it's working or we're seeing it work within that poll that you know we're coming out swinging a about the governor's incompetence from a you hit the six hundred sixty million dollar debacle\nYou know we had D.C YIF ah ads run earlier you know we're going to continue hitting her on all these mistakes the corporate welfare giveaways\nWere holding a press conference later today to you know give a tally of all these mistakes or the governor has made remind voters about even something as simple as cooler warmer that cost US dollars\nYou know putting Iceland in a photo or instead of Rhode Island in that video\nYou know these things matter to run around there's it's a pocketbook this election is too important and all I can keep saying is that George ... is not going to be governor in any poll and even that fictitious pulled that he says he took that shows immigrated in Seventeen percent cut Tara\nWe're not stupid we all follow the campaign finance reports he hasn't spent the single dollar on a poll\nOn anyone that believe Joe chose the right answer or is just wasting their evil you know he's never going to be governor no poll shows that I'm the only real chance that the state has to take out you know this regress if progressive agenda the governor a and really set it back for all of us\nI Will tell you I think a because each each feeling like a repeat of\nThe last election and I think that people are you there they're really um consumed with negativity in the sense of look at the national picture right there's been a lot of tragedy there's been a lot of division\nAnd then you didn't need they're tired you can feel you can see if you talk to you I Know you're talking to people in in what we what I Do for a living you know I'm I'm with big groups here and there as well and you just see people are tired and they want something different I don't know why\nI'm were heavily democratic state obviously so you have you quite a challenge but if you if because today we're focused on this one pool and pulls into past\nGovernor ... does not moving and you are not moving what are you thinking is don't give me your campaign on stuff you're Rhode Island there I Know that when you go out and I've seen un events and I've and I've seen everyone I've seen them in every Monday and events\nUh from afar you were right behind me in the personal fourth of July parade people do respond to you yeah um what is it that is stopping you from breaking that threshold\nAnd I'm being honest with you ... you know as much as people hate negative ads they work and the governor spending\nSignificant amount of dollars to pay me as a person that I'm not that are trying to time me to Washington DC trying to you don't make me out to this bad person who can effectively manage Cranston which is not true at all but you know I'm not discouraged and here's why\nBecause you know you've seen the response that I've gotten in you know the parades you've seen people respond to me and polls only tell apart they're a snapshot in time and if ah and if the polls hold true\nYou know you wouldn't have a governor Sununu up in New Hampshire you wouldn't have a governor Larry Hogan down in Maryland two blue states that you know polls both for those individuals sitting governor is now had them down just before the election that mine is ten\nSo you know if people decide late and this is one of the good things about\nHow would you like motor drenched warrior gene drug to be your only one Ninety nine will forge twenty more than one fish fries anywhere you one hundred Ninety nine dollars for only a board and he went into it\nYou know emergency mail about law so that we have de facto early voting which we all ate\nA people make up their mind late in this game and that's why we're putting all of our resources or to not only are ads are both on TV and digital but me getting out there because people do respond you've seen it yourself Tara and it's a different feel when we're out in the ground\nAnd you know I get a good positive five at the doors in the fairs and festivals and were you know doing whatever we can to identify these individuals make sure they get up to vote on election day and it's going to ... and it's going to come down to that\nShe would Allan Fung the Republican candidate for governor there's only a week left what can you what do you have anything up your sleeves you have I mean I Know you're going to have probably several more press conferences\nPointing out flaws in in your uh you know your challenger not your challenges but you're a you know the other candidates obviously um ... what more can you do\nTo our it's nothing about like uh this Hail Mary my campaign has never been about\nA Hail Mary it's about doing the hard work that has to go in every single day grinding it out you know I Love

lower numbers um take some of those independents dropped you know the governor's numbers that top halfway to victory and it's because of hardworking Rhode Island is not the outer state money that funds the governor to fund all these negative ads that just simply not true\nAll right he is the Republican candidate for governor Alan Cranston mayor one week to go so good luck with everything All
