rapist serves about Thirty years between Massachusetts in Rhode Island he gets let out and he picks Providence and he can live there by law\nOh boy so you know I Know that major oil painting was on and they're trying to keep a a a relatively calm responsible tone in that neighborhood but it's a little worse than when he was\nTo because if you look at the Providence Journal story\nUm they were the neighbors were really upset angry they were flashing lights into the windows of this house on New York cab it's no surprise and it's no secret because it that that address has been out for days and nobody wanted to say it because they didn't want anything to happen over there\nAnd by the residents got together they spread it spread like wildfire is watching it a couple of nights ago on Facebook\nHe does not have to wear a GPS an ankle bracelet he's not required by law to wear and he's sort of grandfathered in because he was in before making law was passed\nSo when you have ... come out who by the way was a housing court judge probably knows the ins and outs of this saying we don't want him here we're going to run them out you don't ... you can't\nThat's that's nonsense now he by luck and stay there but how long will he stay there if he knows prominence police are watching him twenty four seven and we do have some um\nSound from major oil painting this morning with gene they'll essentially saying this is this is all we can do right now is watch him and watch out for him it's a sick twisted situation over there I don't know what's going to happen it could be coming to a community near you\nCameras in Providence WPRI Hi Karen\nHow good morning Hi um I guess I just wanted to stop I don't care a lot of stuff on there and um I I think that the people and then\nPut up a gang illegal aliens it's totally different situation than if they can get that led all ready what people should be fighting about why he went well\nTo try to get him where you know he's the man in law and he doesn't have to try that what they should be fighting this may need your tracker and he needs to be somehow or another we're going to get into that they can walk because he is a threat to that community I don't believe that and\nOr I'm not sure there's a neighborhood that saying come live with us you've done your time we embrace you I I'm pretty sure you're not gonna find that\nBut he's he is exempt from the law because it went in after he was in prison so doesn't apply to him he they said would you like to wear a GPS bracelet and he said no I Would not like to wear that because he doesn't have to\nI don't know how many convicted criminals that finally you'll get out say sure I I'd love to be trapped and they don't do that so the products police I don't know if this is unprecedented I Wish I I'm Will go back and listen to a little bit of what a ... century there were a couple of questions that I had a he can pick up and leave\nAnd go to another community if the neighbors in Washington park province\nOr don't give up and it doesn't sound like they're going to for quite some time he does have narrow loss of standing there telling his constituents he doesn't have the right yes he does\nSo let's get the facts straight I wouldn't like it you ... you wouldn't like it they don't like it but they're stuck right now if he wants to live there\nSo what's going to happen either they're going to be some kind of a an altercation he blows his top or a neighbor loses their control it's a really difficult situation in his up a boiling pot\nAlso you are asking me you know nobody likes the fact that you've got a child rape is living in the neighborhood next to the community center which I Believe doubles as a daycare center that sun not the\nUltimate solution however is as harassment and I know you and say well he did he did he got a hundred years you only served dirty listen the law's the law right you can you you might not like it now what do you do you're going to turn around and say they're harassing me\nAnd and the police the police department it's a horrible situation I don't know where he dealt with this one for three eight nine seven seven six let's play what major look Peyton said this morning about how they're going to you know nonstop watch this guy he could turn around and say I'm I'm afraid I'm a free man\nI don't want to be tailed I you know it's going to be very interesting to see if this guy either ducks and runs to another area and tries to live somewhere else or turns around and says oh guess what I'm a free person and I can do this you can't arrest me let's hear what the major said this morning\nTo you know go through what we have to do that delivered 'cause it takes us um you know the meeting was but it was hundreds of people but from a Washington Parker area here and they have really a legitimate concerns\nGood people I Know ... if you looked on on the news you saw the Yellen's remember there was no real motives in that crowd religious per family or [noise]\nJust completely upset about you know what's going on in the neighborhood right so we'd have to do you have to do\nAs a major right now the gene they'll send you this morning it was a tough situation so they're gonna tell them they're going to stay there twenty four seven Providence detective ah [noise] it's gonna be interesting to see what the ACLU has to say trying to get a hold of them this morning\nCombine lives in Providence morning combine good morning\nFor holding on is a tough situation if you live in that area\nI live in Providence I Do not believe in that area okay and my my answer to you is what they need to do is not going to be too popular but it's the correct thing to do the number one prominent police department has one of the best besides crash but one of the best police departments in the state\nAnd the a supervisor in the ministry is outstanding mhm the mayor\nIs a crowd and that's how I can say any meat she'll go\nShe doesn't know show for four years he comes out makes a crowd of himself by saying we got to get rid of this guy you know you don't have to get rid of this guy who um you know legal ... to get rid of the guy the guy is a bad guy yes the guy did bad things\nAnd as a taxpayer if they're paying overtime for the police to watch them twenty four hours a day they need to stop because they're wasting taxpayers' dollars\nYes I Want to watch a show actually but the guy is legally and the right and remember that the girl before the break all day in office and we shouldn't ... I'm going I'm having finds made up as we speak right now I live a major change where we should eat I'm going to put him on his house because\nHe has the police departments hands tied\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again for a boy and his over one of them are brand new border states we're just one twenty nine Vermont that's like one twenty nine promote flood of every dollar every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nRight and I am following can monitor every operate because that's legitimate clearly I mean following me over\nMy head that Mitch mood I'm In the community now on the following them they're just they're dangerous and this guy so again the mayor is using this as a political point hopefully what his political well\nHe hasn't been a no show he has been traveling astronomically he he never shows up when you've got you know three shootings and stabbing over the weekend there's never a Monday morning press conference he sends out his police officials which fantastic they do a great job they they are running\nA ... that portion of of city issues and then you and I always say you know the the pseudo mayor is David Salvador then because he comes to the he comes to the table and he tries to you know get solution can you try to\nAt least talk about them the mayor never does he shows up last night because he's got an audience of two hundred angry people that if you say yeah\nLet's get them out of here you've got that you know oh look look the mayor is doing for us they can't they can't get him outta there unless he wants to leave\nSo it's so foolish combine thank you he just doesn't know how to he was like oh goody lesson will not let a situation go to waste I'll go over there and round them up let's great know what's gonna happen something bad is going to happen gyms in Providence on WPRI Jim\nLehrer all the other gentleman or all\nAre also do so that it will look up a a free up all that do voted

offenders\nAnd there and Cranston and they're in North ... they're everywhere at this case the has gotten a lot of attention because this\nThis case this case has gotten a lot of it's gotten a lot of attention because\nOf what he did and he just got out of jail and because it doesn't have the register but they're all around the roll around\nUnderstood what is this Providence neighborhood do now there they said they they said they they claim they\nWhat they ought to do is take a look back and watch him but they ought to look at how many of the earth or say what they want us to go so they're still in the ... you know\nI Know that I Know that Jim ... and you know if you have children in any public school system you get a letter every time someone's release any kind of a convicted child molester or sexual offender you get a letter\nTo say if you have school age children I used to get them\nAnd ... there's a picture of them even and this is where they going to live because they're in a certain amount of radius to your home and that that's been going on for years and years and years the situation is different is volatile he he can go wherever he wants to go he doesn't have to check in because he he was\nIncarcerated and convicted before ...\nAnd that's where it's tricky and then you have the the prominence mayor I don't know if he does is unaware of the fact he goes and insights the crowd and saying you know we're going we're not going to take this he doesn't belong in our neighborhood you haven't belong anywhere if you ask them any neighborhood nobody probably watch the guy but he can live anywhere he want and\nThat's what we're stuck with Bob from Oregon WPRI Bob Hi Ira how are you good how are you\nGood I'm Out the other guy kind of said what I Want to stay but uh\nYeah this guy as right and he did his time and they're everywhere these got started in women that are that I've done that but just the last one was really a ticks me off this guy\nOh I got a stage

rapist in Providence you have this haunting all of us for a couple of years will continue to watch those stories but I thought it was kind of funny because [noise] how many people have made a mistake with a tattoo\nNot you know the guy was drunk did my tattooing misspelled something but you made a mistake\nOr you thought they were the love of real life\nAnd you got the ... tattooed on your body somewhere Ariana Grande day was a big pop star she's had a rough couple of things happened she should that horrific horrible a shooting mass shooting in her concert\nAnd then she was dating someone who um I think he owed IED a rising rap guy and now she was with Pete Davidson from Saturday Night live\nAnd they were the big hot ... coming up and now they've already split up they're going to get married now they split up but she put a tattoo of his name on her finger and so after\nThey split you know the old ... wants to get the first look at her and she was doing some kind of a big musical event and she came out with a band aid on her finger was her first appearance I Know you're like ...\nOr it's not news it's entertainment and I kind of like it every once in a while so I can stop talking about the child rapist that being said\nI made me think of all the people that have tattoos are first of all they're expensive\nAnd I have lots of young people in my family they have a lot of tattoos\nAnd I first of all I Can't believe how much it's gonna hurt\nDepending on where it is but then when you break up money into it if it's someone's name either have to go over it or you get it there's a big big business of tattoo removal now and that hurts like a son of a gun supposedly I don't have any I don't have any thoughts wasn't my thing\nUh so she comes out with a tattoo over the name Pete because she's not going out with him anymore and it made me think how many people have gotten attached to that they either regret or they had to go cover it up or get it removed\nSo I Want to hear two stories and somehow I fall on this morning a story about Dolly Parton I didn't know this there's some kind of weird rumor urban legend type of thing and then I thought no you never see her arms\nThat they made such a big deal that Ariana Grande came out of after a break up and the guy that she was with Pete Davidson she put a band aid over a finger\nTo cover his name as if that's going to I don't know ruined the night I Do know people that have broken up\nWith the their significant\nOther and they've got the name now and now what do you do do they have to go over it and put flowers on it or ... or whatever make it into a plant I don't know\n[noise] or get it removed so I just want to read you a little uh\nThis is I'm of a friend of my family friend of mine went to England got drunk with a tattoo artist and he had the tattoo artist do attached to when they were both drunk he woke up the next morning and all it said was blue powers\nInstead of blues oh blues power like the
