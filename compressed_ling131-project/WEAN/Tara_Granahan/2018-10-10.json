there were kids fighting in the neighborhood I go over there and screaming and yelling here's what happened this is according to jokes\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lineup of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator for Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled Marjorie impeccable surface\nWhen people get it together I'm an enabler\nI'm an I'm an enabler I'm an enabler in the seventies Joe ... admits to breaking up some kind of shenanigans with a bunch of kids in the neighborhood because his neighbors aren't home the adults aren't home they leave the kids that's the seventies probably doesn't happen a lot now\nAre probably you don't have your kid with a belt now either I Hope\nThe seventies or a little different people who are writing to me yeah the neighbors watched us and they come over here and and it's screaming yelling up against the side of the house have your beating each other up so there's a girl in the house she's screaming Joe ... he's the adult he's Thirty years old he's like Mr Kravitz\nNot Mrs Kravitz but Mr Kravitz he's the guy in the neighborhood apparently that up the kids act out the old guy here comes here comes Mr Grillo not saying it's good or bad thing terrier an enabler [noise]\nWhat are you talking about I came up the top of the show I said this is a circus we're digging out old stories\nWhere absolutely trying to hurt people to their core in the governor's race by bringing out a fatal accident we we are just in the garden digging up the mud and guess who's laughing all the way to the polls in three and a half\nWeeks governor Mondo I'm Sorry folks you if you're not watching the polls she could double digits on Allan Fung according to this latest polls not worth anything are okay I'm just telling you\nAh she's not going to the Nineteen seventies to dig out a cassette tapes or maybe somebody forwarded on a cassette tape and sent it to their neighbor I don't know what's next\nBut they are knocking each other out keeps swinging guys she's laughing all the way to gene a to point out I Am I saying that I support another four years of not being able to get you know real serious answers on certain\nIssues that need to be uncovered and discussed no that's my that's my personal a issue with the ... the ... minutes ration not getting a good sit down\nFull picture with this governor it's a lot of sound bites it and I I you know I don't necessarily blame her I blame the people that surround her and I said this for years\nLet her be her let people get to know her no no we're gonna pick and choose and take some of the younger reporters out for coffee or did you sell these you want to play this game the real hard questions can't get an asked because we're not going to sit down and do long form okay you know I I offer I offer it now\nUm but you know what with Joe ... bringing up the accident of Alan ... and Alan ... people are digging out you know he hit some kid and he's a ... you know people are going hilarious\nThat they're they're finding it hilarious rather that it happens to be ... because that is only in Rhode Island you're going to hear that Eighteen thousand times today and it's a hash tag okay go ahead hash tag away only in Rhode Island\nOr because it isn't saying and it is if people grow up next to each other\nAnd this is who we are and he doesn't really seem to care Nick ... yellow he's not a ... they work together they laugh it off I'm not saying it's funny if some guy came over and it might get trust me in the nineties and the two thousand there'd be hell to pay with a different time\nSo now I'm a I'm unable in a child abuse or this is what people are writing to me this is how far off the ledge you have gone\nDo yourself a favor pull it back\nPull it back let's get down to who is the best leader for the state it could be any one of them with the circus that we are now entrenched and we're going through the whole Kavanaugh saying here\nWe're just going to try to find dirt dirt dirt and it it it really is I think it's beneath us folks\nI think it's beneath us and and if that's what you want and you're one of those people that's running around and social media and calling people names and calling their family names and calling their spouses names then you get what you deserve\nDirty rotten stinking juvenile sophomore politics and to their credit Gina to point out okay I said it you can boo and his and call me all kinds of names I look at it
