migrants you cover all forms of politics obviously with your columns\nUh in in in all of your inside your analysis Eileen so I so appreciate your time\nYou've been following this I'm I'm assuming that I'm yeah because I wanted to talk about the governor's race but also the cabin on whether or not he gets confirmed and how the vocals John first of all your ... your your initial thoughts on how the hearings went in all the it was an awful lot of emotion and drama and holes in stories\nUm and his temperament what's your initial reaction\nWell the ... that entire hearing really showed me the crisis in democracy\nOr that we have in the United states of America I think the polarization is so\nAdamant and people are so adamant that I really do fear for the future and I know some people say oh well you know back in the days of Madison and\nA even a founding fathers all of this all happened and that's true but it's not as widespread as it is particularly among the average people who can't even talk to one another so before I even comment I cabinet let me just\nBring up a study that I just recently read a and a terror it stands for the proposition that we tend to listen to a pins\nThat only baptize our own viewpoint and here's the kicker we might be hard wired to do that\nMeeting our brains seek out confirmation of where we are already spent\nRight so I think it's critically important uh that uh and they said this to the young Republicans months ago even before I read this report when I had the great opportunity to speak with them that regardless of what your position is\nYou have to get trained to look at what other people are saying that oppose your point of view because there were nuggets of truth\nOn every side of the issue and if you're going to be an intelligent person you have to listen to the other side and really just sir and do they have anything to say in this debate right right so now we've come to the cabin or hearing it is absolutely no question that there is a clash of values that are going on here\nThe values of which are good so for example you're innocent until proven guilty or that's the mantra that's invoked by folks that are already leaning toward a judge Kavanaugh\nOn the other side is the obviously cultural issue that many people are not marinated in and that is the culture of what happens with women who are sexually abused\nA regrettably I had too much experience with that as a prosecutor prosecuting these cases of sexual assault I've when I was in that office\nThere were times I remembered visiting among family in Providence because without question the door to had been raped but it was a disgrace and the family would not allow her to testify and this brutal rape because it made the family look bad\nAnd they felt culturally it would make her look bad ah so you have to understand all the permutations of culture classes as well\nWhich so quick to make a decision right uh yeah I Know who I Believe her I Believe her we we hadn't even heard from her and so it's so hard to you know I think it's tough to be a woman of course but it's tough to be a woman who wants to say listen I of course I Want to believe a victim any victim yeah when I Can't make a I Can't say I believe someone if I've never even met them or heard them\nMhm yeah well you know again I get that is a valid position then the issue becomes then if that is what your basic position is is to look at but why not what's the opposite side of this particular issue so first of all one thing is for sure\nRegardless of who's right and wrong and that is\nA democracy has taken a black guy with a question you know a here but the worst part of it is for me the inability to people with opposing views to in good faith\nI come to a conclusion now and sometimes we're blinded you know ... what are the things I just recently talking with a friend yesterday and ah when I was running for office my opponent would bring out what was wrong with why I shouldn't be attorney general now people will say that's political he's running against her\nWell yes of course his political but the other part of it is you got to analyze\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nEndorsements don't matter what really matters is making sure that we get our message out about the corruption that is really happening up at that state house and we don't need any more state house insiders uh like Joe trail oh like Patricia Morgan cutting deals\nWith our governor you know one ... the question you know what is Joe what is Patricia really getting out of it you know what the ... the end she caught with Governor Mondo because we've seen historically because those who have walked the state ... for over two decades now that I'm even supporting the governor on her\nPass budgets with uh millions in corporate welfare and expanding our sales tax\nAnd you used ... America ... here's the thing\nUh it's it's ... troubled continues to say he's corrupt without backing it up then I think the theory is if I keep saying it over and over again maybe people will start to believe me if you keep saying there's a deal with Governor ... know you're kind of doing the same thing ... keeps hanging over and over but we really don't know if there was a deal people may start to believe me do you see why people are getting frustrated\nPeople are getting frustrated because of what's going on and Smith hill for years and that's what Joe trail and Patricia Morgan represent\nKnow and like I said endorsements don't matter what really matters is the people that have been hurt by governor I'm ondo uh them\nYou know kids that are still waiting for the benefits families still waiting for 'em you know their food stamps and the like uh what people you know seniors waiting for nursing home benefits are because of the you hit the disaster\nYou know we've seen the um\n... corruption that was going on from our governor with the Y. F. I've got proof of what the governor has done mismanaged government hurt so many others that's why we need new leadership if Joe and Patricia of\nAfraid of the real change real reform that I Will bring just like what I've done ... turn this around then so be it\nA marathon is on the line I Know people have asked you ... have asked you ... just seems to be such animosity between the two of you have you been in the same room and someone step on the other ones you know did you take ... deep and the problem I mean what is going on\nYou know I don't know what's going ... why he hates me so much you know because you have ... pretty big word\nI won't give 'em anything like ... look ... the history of deal cutting up at the state house for sixteen years I don't promise jobs with support I don't promised contracts that are I don't do any of that I own nobody but I Know that probably frustrates the guy like Joe so be it\nYou know I Am going to shake things up and that is\nFrom day one of a a ... I'm gonna fix you hit I'm gonna put incompetent people\nMy record a joke and just keep blowing it's hot here but you know the listeners know that he has no shocked when the vote for ... gonna be nothing more than a goal for general Mondo and the same for years I've been ... leadership that we've seen so far\nAll right ... if I could put you on hold and want to play for the listeners because I Know you want to have something to say about this representative Patricia Morgan was on this morning with gene Dallas anti and she\nI think she's tapped danced around this whole situation of the phone call and primary night on the hours following um uh Alan ... winning the primary beating Patricia Morgan who called who who ... who's endorsement there's some confusion here and there's accusations lying so this is what she said this morning with gene\nStraighten out this phone call that ... you had where he did he did he did he ask you for the endorsement outright\nHate was speaking ... ... ...\nAnd what did he say Hi pat listen it's all over let's get together what decided\nCongregation five at conversation [laughter] nothing prime it you know that [laughter] and that's why that [laughter]\nSo oh he did ask you obviously you turned him down\nI\nI Am not endorsing Alan ... forgot that now that ...\nThat to me are having been an interviewer for twenty something years that's a very frustrating back and forth because are we gonna we want a straight answer ... can we get a straight answer from you Alan ...\nAbsolutely that was an imaginary conversation and you hear the hesitation and Patricia's voice over the last time I talked with Patricia Morgan was when she called to concede on primary night and it was a quick conversation now is it and I really that conversation that night so all there was ...\nI Know it's tough so I gave her a few days then reached out through ... tax and I still have that takes two days afterwards\nAnd then when she didn't respond I reached out again and nothing but by the way ...\nI'm smart enough 'cause I anticipated this I Know how ... insiders work\nKnow I had when I made that phone call to reach out again I had people that were by my side as I left a message note time since\nWhat is your Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and we all have in common they're all in which these we own decision and what they need really Janeiro against essentially to would you agree on cars homemade models in political move on to John John now\nHave people with you left a message in that message did you ask for her endorsement\nOh asked I asked for her support absolutely because you know tower\nI Am let's indifference mayor what's the difference\nNo endorsement support however you want to freeze is the same thing but the bottom line is I I did reach out and there was never a conversation\nWho cares tower the bottom line is is I'm willing to make that change necessary at that state house you know and we all know you know I'd love to have everyone together even\nFour years ago can block it took a little time but he came by my side we had a professor at the state house talking about what we need to do United and that's why I was reaching out because we have to be you know we can't have these factions going on a is look we have to be United because the real problem in this state is governor Raimondo\nYou know we can't continue on another four years I'm the only candidate that can be or Joe trouble can't win\nAll your listeners know that so the bottom line is we've got to keep turning things around in on that agent for change\nAll right so just to wrap up the phone call and whenever you said he had its its semi Alan and I'd love you support\nUh how'd that do\nNothing I never had a conversation with\nHer I mean what did you say you you say I Love your support or can I ...\nNo I just follow up on the tax all I all I left in that message tower was yeah Hi Pat a hope you got my tax from a couple of days ago I Know it's not easy loved to speak with you about your support gave me a call when you're right that was it\nPlain and simple I Know other top Republican leaders I had also reached out to her absolutely and I she didn't get back so\nAnd they write and summer she did speak with others she did speak with others you know all those that reached out as well and the bottom line is even to those others you know she didn't you know she wasn't making a commitment but\nI Move on because ultimately it's about saving our state from governor among those mismanagement and incompetence and the people that you were\nI've got a real plans to reform D.C Wyeth reform you have put in this specter general make sure that we are turning government back around for us the little guys and one island\nAlready know earlier in the conversation ... ... you said you know indoor since don't matter if you mean just Patricia Morgan's adores him because if somebody comes along and says hey I Want to support you you know we've got to get the Republicans back in the office of the governor you're not going to say hey not endorsing it doesn't matter if it's somebody fabulous oh\nI'm asking for everyone support but here's a prime example Patricia Morgan also recruited has supported showing her lawn against the fries and not run a couple of years ago how did that work out for her\nLook what's gonna really matter as me getting out there in the neighborhoods talking about my mission my vision for turning around Rhode Island my plans to turn on and that's what I've been focused on day one everyone knows that Joe\nHas none of that he just the blowhard a that really just wants to you know said things that are uncorroborated he cannot win\nOn the real candidates in this race or anything but a vote for me is going to help get Gina Raimondo back in in four more years of incompetence and hurting around there's\nAre you doing some polling a mayor from\nI haven't done any polling we're going to you know right now we are having a people out in the neighborhoods you know a field director is a leading teams out there knocking on doors identifying voters we are going to do what we need to to get our message out and drive out the vote\nAnd or anyone else you know I spoke with Arlene violent a few moments ago Amir funding she mentioned she she's willing to work with anyone she really wants the office of inspector general but she said she's\nA concerned with you working with you she wanted to have a conversation to walk through the two thousand fourteen I Believe a police report when the the police came in and tried to figure out what's going on with your grandson police department she said that was a warning sign\nWell let me take a step back first you know I support that position of inspector general I support the independence in that position but I unlike you know Mr ... unlike Patricia Morgan who cuts deals and says oh I'm going to put in this person I don't promise jobs you\nKnow and I like in a respected the work that attorney general you know former attorney general violations done but\nI'm not going to promise their job if she wants that position you know she's

been holding on Hi Debra\nHi good morning I just wanted if they're really enjoy your show and and your your discussion is a very very informative I had thanks that comment mhm I'm the first of all is on the demeanor of of the judge a during the hearing I felt\nUm it was certainly appropriate given what he was being charged with a rape is a very serious crime if the accusation alone could cause Woodward will ruin someone's reputation\nAnd he that particular instance it was a you know a an a sexual assault [noise] exactly but the but the other stories that came it did involve you know a rapist parties et cetera and that he\nMay have arrived writing factual Fulbright that alone are just\nAn accusation is just very serious yup on my second comment was that\nI felt that whatever form out at the heroes we'll all be is a professional women that came forward that spoke about him\nEmpowering assisting them in the workforce I feel that he stands up for women and I think that the Democrats if it is proven that they have used this as a as a political ploy which is you know that information has been coming out\nI think it's really going to hurt them\nBecause this is a man who was championed women\nAnd isn't it sad that they are picking on him because they disagree with one of the specific viewpoint that or something they think it's going to happen if the advances to the court\nHim being one of nine justices\nSomehow it being claimed that he alone is going to make a decision or quantum decision or I understand being a part of a majority but I just feel that we really don't know we had a Justice Souter that was asked by the conservative and he voted very liberally on many many cases so\nI think we really don't know um but the second thing again is I feel his champions women and isn't that sad\n... group wants your car anyway any model what more than ... row because we're a certified bowling center and we'll buy yours even if you do ... hours more going
