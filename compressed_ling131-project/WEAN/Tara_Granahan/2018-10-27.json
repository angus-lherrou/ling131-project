Y. two three five zero three five zero\n\n\n\nAnd you know without Jones industrial average on Wednesday dropping over six hundred points uh that's nothing compared to the fact that the Dow is it twenty five thousand before the drop occurred uh and that's really the the key point isn't it is that we can't be focusing on the point drop\nWe have to look up a percentage drop\nBecause if we put it in that kind of a context on a percentage basis the drought really wasn't all that newsworthy wasn't all that material but regardless of that we do have to acknowledge the facts and the fact is that as a result of the volatility this week year today\nThe Dow Jones industrial average is down one percent the S. and P. five hundred stock index is down one percent the easy index which is the index of foreign stocks that's the Europe Australia and far eastern index is down twelve percent for the year\nIt's not just that the town yes in pay and the ISI are down one percent one percent twelve percent it's actually even worse than that\nThere are thirty stocks and the Dow Jones industrial average sixty percent of them are down ten percent or more from their hobbies so although the overall Dow is only down one sixty percent of those thirty socks\nEighteen of them\nAre down ten percent or more in the S P five hundred thousand he itself is down one percent for the year but eighty percent\nOf the S. and P. five hundred\nWe're talking for a hundred of the five hundred stocks\nAre down ten percent or more from their hives in the ISI Ninety percent are down ... percent or more from their hives and the jak\nEighty seven percent of the stocks and the NASDAQ are down ten percent or more from their eyes so if you look at your market performance recently you will see some pretty substantial declines year to date it means that\nWe have had all the profits accumulated so far this year from January one of the September\nThose gains have been largely wiped out the Dow down one yes and the down along the ISI down twelve and it's not just limited to that gold is down six percent year to date\nThe real estate market as measured by the ... real estate index down four percent for the year the bond market as measured by the Barclays aggregate bond index down four percent\nFor the year pretty much everything everywhere is down oh not everything oil is up ... percent\nDemonstrating the critical importance of diversification not everything always goes down simultaneously some stuff goes up while other stuff is going down the problem is you can't predict what that'll be we don't know what's going to go up next we don't know what's going to go down next so instead of making a big\nMess\nWe diversify we diversity\nFor supply among asset classes yes she won't socks but yes you should also I'm bonds and you should also on foreign securities and you should also on commodities and oil and gas and natural resources and precious metals\nAn exponential technologies we should have a highly diversified portfolio because their safety in numbers instead of having twelve eggs in one basket have one egg in each of twelve baskets this way if you like one you gotta love and left that's the first point of diversification the second point\nIs that when you do decide you're going to invest some of your money into stocks that you\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the year for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty eight Ford F. one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at point forward and he went into the Narragansett\nIs down one percent for the year but eighty percent of the stocks have lost ten percent or more in recent weeks eighty percent of them are down ten percent in just a few weeks even though the index itself is only done one person for the year and that's the point instead of trying to pick individual stocks and hoping that they do better than the index you're\nBetter off owning a market instead of trying to beat the market because the academic data is very clear\nActively managed mutual funds\nMeaning mutual funds that hire a professional manager whose job it is is to pick stocks that will beat the market\nThey have a dismal track record the overwhelming majority of active managers fail to beat their index they failed to beat the benchmark\nAnd it doesn't matter what stock sector we're talking about big stocks midsize stocks are small stocks growth stocks are value stocks us stocks versus foreign stocks doesn't matter it also doesn't matter what time period you look at you could look at your date you could look at the past year three year five years seven year ten year it doesn't matter what time period you look at\nThe data is consistent\nFund managers are notoriously unable to beat the market and here's what makes it even worse even when you find a manager that does succeed beating the market that manager is unable to duplicate their success so while there will be some managers who do beat the market they aren't the same managers year after year after year so if you pick\nThis year the manager that did best last year\nThey're not going to be able to repeat their success it's a different manager that does it and that's why instead of trying to beat the market it's better to be the market\nThird\nMaintain a

for one eight hundred three two one W. P. R. O.\nDiscussion at the John Laughlin Shelley sponsored by yacht club soda makers of Rhode Island's official Saturday since Nineteen Fifteen family own Enron company that's all about the environment and made right here in Rhode Island\n[noise] and we are back eleven twenty five ... also with you on the John Lawson\nRadio broadcasts where you can call in to be part of the show I just wanted to highlight that uh you are a Center for excellence in explosives because it's not something I I knew we had and\nUm I think it's amazing that uh the work that they do they have been involved in the world trade centers and all these other bombings and not involved in the bombing but\nInvolved in trying to figure out who did it and and all of the forensics ego involved in that are involved in that and it was pretty amazing that they were so rapidly be able to uh apprehend the suspect in these pipe bombs um that that's a that's pretty good it's a testament the law enforcement\nUh we're also tracking right now is situation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where there's been reported shooting a they say that a news report saying they have a suspect in custody so it's no longer an active shooter running around\nUh but I've heard does scattered different reports from as many as four to eight people are shot or at the bottom of the hour Doug lives that will have an update on that so we'll get you to all of the latest information on that following that these active\nShooter things are just um it's incredibly didn't happen twenty five thirty years ago but now it seems like there are\nAt least a monthly occurrence um and I don't know what the answer is there um I don't know for three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WPRI coming up after the news at the bottom of the hour we're going to open up the phone lines and and do a little phone poll when are we going to see who your pick as the election is a little over a week away\nUm we're still trying to put together the finishing touches on our big gubernatorial debate which will be um that'll be Joe the barber are representing the Democratic side in our good friends south in little Compton representing the Republican slash independent side\nA and I will have a little debate for you and hopefully will even be able to get the uh the anchorman that come in and a week and it's great when you see 'em on the weekend you know he comes in and his bathrobe typically\nA and it's got the big channel ten logo right on the bad for which is nice ah so he'll be here on a Saturday morning to to help us out with that as well so we're looking forward to that for three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WPRI oh if you have a pick for governor we're going to do our little informal John last one show poll were pretty accurate uh we usually get the wrong person\n[laughter] almost every time\nBecause you know frankly our listeners tend to skew a little bit more conservative and so the conservatives do much much better\nOn our poll than they do in in real life but uh but that's because you were better audience you know it was the whole world was you are and we will be able to deal with that as well\nUm [noise] then a little bit after that we're going to touch base with the Mike Wells Mike Wells is the proprietor of the ya ya Maria I haven't been to ya Maria to check them out there aren't\nA Cranston street in the ... section of Cranston a which is easy to find there if you could on Park Avenue a you take the right on the crisis reading it right on the right inside and and a boy what a perfect day to maybe\nGet some takeout from ya Maria heated up in the a conventional love under the microwave oven and enjoy some nice comfort food on a rainy windy day we're also tracking the nor'easter that's bearing down and it's all a lot going on on the show and we will keep the up to speed on all of it was we are as we follow these breaking developments once again is shooting\nTook place in Pittsburgh at a synagogue a and we will bring you the latest details on that and we still have our our north eastern coming up after the news your chance to call in and tell us who's going to win the governor's race it up for three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model flood pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nIt's obviously before the end of the show so we'll know at least what the voting preferences of the drama in radio listener so\nThat's always an important data point and again next Saturday or is the big debate or Joe the barbers south in little Compton a an anchorman Jean Val Sandy it's like a it's like a three ring circus here it's wonderful when they come into genes these very serious he\nHe does these things well you know you get that whole news Mitt they go I asked goofy questions but uh but he he knows how to do the the actual real questioning so ah the we've got two great advocates we did the same thing uh during the presidential debate where a Joe the barber was ah was Hillary Clinton's advocate\nUh that's why you may have seen the Democratic party actually sent out a drug dealer mellow mailer joked furlough mailer none of drove driller male oh that would make no sense H real mailer\nUh in in support his campaign so I mean that's that's how the links they're going to because they recognize\nOr the better that they can get his vote totals up or the the better that looks for the incumbent governor Gina Raimondo so\nUh so they are actively working that way in a in a two person race this would be um I think pretty easily call for Alan ...\nA in Allen one would have an opportunity to to give us is is ... ship and see how that goes as well for three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one W. P. R. O. uh your opportunity to weigh in um I don't think I'm you know the other smattering of independent candidates will probably draw three to five percent on their own maybe\nUm and then the rest of it is going to go between the the major candidates\nAre and we'll see which way that goes and I'm curious if especially if you were a um you were fortunate low if you're not new more\nAs you changed your opinion you know it's I hate to say it's common sense you know I mean literally if you vote for the guy you're voting for Gina Raimondo and and I and I know all of the good government stuff you know even if we ever rate in this country to vote for whoever won yet but we do but we also have practical reality [laughter]\nAnd the practical reality in this particular instance is it's pretty obvious um what what the vote means and what happens because I'm In and I'll be curious to see also there's another channel twelve Roger Williams poll due out I'm On a Monday\nAnd I don't know when that poll was taken a but I'd be curious to see if that was taken before or after cooking done gate\nOr [laughter] or he is with that more through eight Ninety seven seven six eight hundred three to one of the euro criticism Cumberland Chris thank you for calling the John ... who you are on the air\nJohn how are you I'm well thanks how are you good good so I Want to make a quick point now you can make three our true we don't we don't charge by the point\n[laughter] I'll be supporting fun and I still think that if we can crawl out under ten percent although not\nAlthough on like late ... had the chance right so I'll I'll leave it at that well what what excites me the most about this election John from a nationwide perspective is the prospect for the Senate looking very bright right now\nIt does in fact I'm I was just before the show at the site that I like to to look at for national politics it's called ... real clear politics dot com\nAnd they basically aggregate polls from across the country and they kind of boil it all down for you I'm In you know we could literally pick up and the the GOP could pick up more seats in the Senate which would be ... be very helpful\nThey could they could and and or you know it could it could stay fifty one forty nine which wouldn't be terrible you want that cushion twenty twenty when a lot of other ... got to be up what you got the thing is is I I think\nI think unfortunately the house will be flipped when it won't be by march\nAnd it's certainly not gonna give polo see a a mandate because they're not going to have\nWent way since when did they ever needed a mandate to ACT UP [laughter] now I now I Know that\nThey're terrible and and and one last thing they're going to do everything in their power to exaggerate crises and everything they can do in the next week and a half to try and change public opinion rice store it this week and unfortunately it went and got God Bless the people in Pittsburgh um I just hope you know\nWe don't start to politicize that too but but they will they\nAnd in fact I'm unfortunately I think you're absolutely correct Chris thank you for the Gulf War three eight nine seven seven six\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than ... around because we're a certified buying center had will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our high car buyers are tough\nIs I like to say is that you're going to be in a situation where all of the committee chairs will be Democrats\nI'm In the Democratic house will then have the ability to subpoena individuals' records in and everything else they need and they will basically paralyze the Trump Administration for the next two years there there won't be anything that the Trump Administration will be able to do\nBecause a significant portion of the time is going to be spent testifying in Congress responding to subpoena is a ... every other things going on and if they decide to impeach uh and keep in mind impeachment is a political process it's not a legal process per se\nOr if they decide to impeach or they can impeach the president or in the Congress I'm with they've got the sufficient votes to do it\nUh but the actual conviction has to take place in the Senate so you know the impeachment think of it as like a grand jury that's the indictment and then the trial takes place in the Senate um and so you know that's where that would go that's why holding the Senate is important for President Trump but\nYou know it literally is if if the end of the Trump Administration if the house flipped a because what's going to happen is that you're going to have complete paralysis or in that administration is not going to be able to get any of its priorities are initiatives done 'em to any extent at all and and that may actually help\nThe GOP in the twenty twenty election believe it or not\nOr because of the general public is going to get a really good exposure\nOr two and a half years to Nancy Pelosi and and uh you know Maxine Waters as a committee chair and all the other\nA wild eyed Democrats in and it may actually be helpful for the twenty twenty election believe it or not or three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WPRI talking more about the gubernatorial race and how you see it where you have got so far where\nThe Allen song is leading into votes by one [laughter] ... zero in a ... jokes rule has done in a be curious to find out\nWhat you think where you come down on this race um I'm not going to tell you were in voting but I think you could probably figure it out to be listening to show once or twice um but uh I'm curious what you are your thoughts are on and not only who who you're supporting but\nNow you think the election is going to turn out uh what do you think is going to happen or three eight\nNine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WPRI you can also email\nJohn L at six thirty WPRI road dot com coming up at a I guess noontime or we're going to check in with pat quarter lesson a pack or less is running for secretary of state or against ... uh and we'll check in with him he's got a lot going on and we want to find out what how that campaign is going\nUm you know I mean it's it's not hard to prognosticators race uh in in it hasn't been from the beginning\nUm so it's going to be fascinating to see how many people you actually see through it\nAnd and vote in a way that are removed because I think there's a lot of anti Gina Raimondo sentiment out there\nUh and so it'd be curious to see how much of that sentiment is going to translate into votes for an opposition candidate in which opposition candidate because they're going to go to for three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WBFO Scott is in North probably dozens of Scott\nYou are on the job losses they don't know what I wrote a load of about ... ... oh my God male and body because [laughter] I like try anyway I'm a big Charlie bad\nI'm I'm In a while but I said I'm a big trolley ... does it right now is what he's doing as far as my vote I think from but it's not with my four hot it's no I got you got to get this thing out of here you've got to get around it I created ten thousand jobs and they pay X. amount of dollars and the taxpayers paying for that yeah\nYou know I I Know me and all that and then ... and and then that just the way she steals other people's ideas\nI'm somebody want to let her know Hillary's died she's gone [laughter] she was supposed to be\nThis my and my biggest fear Scott is that a a gene a to point out um she's going to want to be a standout on the national stage coming up\nIn the twenty twenty or and so every politically left wing social justice you know while I was coming down the pike carbon taxes\nAll of that uh she's going to want to be the leader in so that she can position yourself well in twenty twenty or to have some sort of deciding role in that so it's going to be worse than gene at one point out if you think he thought she'd at one point I was bad you know buckle your seatbelt gene a to point I was going to be one progressive hadn't right\nExactly it's all engineered I mean somebody want to know Hillary last night and this isn't going to work anymore\nI I don't I don't understand where the money comes from from\nPlayboy mansion in our states why is it coming at it that should tell you
