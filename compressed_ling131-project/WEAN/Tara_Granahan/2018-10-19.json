are already on snap benefits maybe even SSI Medicare Medicaid I don't know how that works books I haven't spent any time in prison except to interview people\nUm if if you have and you know that's um that's interesting they they do you get hooked up with a benefit package\nIf you've been in prison for a while a discharge plan wow\nI bet we could save some money there ... if anyone knows if you have served time\nIn prison maybe it's X amount of time 'cause you need time to get back on your feet I have no idea if you are more insulin that maybe you had to do some time maybe relative to veto

get out of prison\nMy goodness and here's another disturbing email and I I I I I think I understand what this person is saying\nDoug writes this is what drives a person meaning the people in the streets and shining the lights of banging pots I understand that frustration but he's saying this is the wrong way to go about it this is what drives the person to either commit suicide or re offend\nSo that he can go back to jail and at least has a place to live now I Do know people I've done stories on people that were set up as a rate that um you think while they finally get out\nAnd because that's all they know\nIf it's a long sentence you finally get out and then you ... you can get back in because it's a safe it's almost a safer place I Know it's hard to believe folks would have you been locked up that's um I've done a bunch of stories on and this uh Doug writes\nAh you know if he re offense now certainly nobody wants to see that now you might say oh yeah let's get back in jail but guess what refunding means another child life\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again for foreigners over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just

everybody can change and\nClose the prison and second chances that doesn't apply to this guy that's a well thought out email because no one is I don't think he's being empathetic to a child rapist\nHowever if if the chaos surrounding the situation continues and it does\nCause him to re offend you are talking about a child oh it just it's tough to have to figure this out James is in the

like eating stuff like that they are eligible for all of that wow no I actually am a client was registered\nA sound out after I get older\nBoy it's um [noise] you know I I realize I back back when I was doing street reporting or that's the gate of recording it was somewhere around forty thousand dollars a year to feed and clothe the prisoner in Rhode Island I Want to say it was around there which was ironically or or [noise]\nYou know unbelievably for the the average salary right in our state\nYeah didn't qualify salary that allowed\nWhile uh but I mean what the average person was making back then maybe forty fifty thousand and and you you you put that money altogether if someone's working forty hours a week right to make of that and then we're spending that on someone who's incarcerated it's a no win situation we all know that but I didn't know they get a benefit package when you get out\nI mean I don't dig it up you know but I'm kind of say why\nAre some kind of it\nAs long as they need to be a guideline then\nThat's it I I understand maybe\nYou know they want to just contain this situation get a handle on it and as I mentioned a little earlier maybe someone goes in from the city and tries to be some kind of a liaison\nWith this guy who like it or not has the right to be there maybe they talk him into some kind of a I don't know a\nProcedure to go somewhere else [laughter] and I supposed to be moved out of state he wouldn't get all the let's play a major look Peyton just because people are calling in and writing to me about well maybe he he does have to say where he's going now he doesn't have to say we're going this is what was said yesterday morning major locating from the prominence police department\nDoesn't really have is basically always grew restrictions on him that he has to do with us\nIf you move your weather's below the twenty four hours and you can't move within three hundred feet or the school\nHave to register with us as to register with us he said so does that mean than they notify where he's going that's my question\nOne more time that I Know we were you and I are interpreting this differently so this is the the three things ... ... excuse me ... saying that Richard Gardner has to do he said register with us now I don't know maybe we can get some clarification\nDoes that mean okay registered with us as Providence than to Providence have to say well he's going to go to whatever Fall River or new can I I don't know\nI mean we really have is basically always through restrictions on him that he has to do with us if you move your weather's below the twenty four hours and you can't move within three hundred feet or the school\nHuh\nSee what I'm saying there so so does the place that he's moving to the city or town that he's moving to does he have to notify them or does Providence police notify them\nGo do the interpretation she would have to notify them because when he said yes to notify us started representing 'cause he lives here now so that's a human notify us he has to register with us because we lived there so I mean if you move somewhere else you would have to register there as well\n...

I don't want to say that he's smart I think it's it's interesting we even use the different vehicle this morning 'cause he recognizes my animal control officers truck and he would take off\nWhat did you just give them a job Mary sounded pretty probably do a lot better [laughter] than others than others [laughter] I'll leave it at that\nWe as I said before the concern is that I don't want him to be kind of ... what happened to nor do I want someone getting into a car accident and flying through and actually he was running at a very rapid pace\nOr down in the middle of out what happened to this morning and kind of took off and flew under the there's like an overpass yeah and I'm saying to myself my God he's relentless and I'm really not happy [laughter]\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model what pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nHe can pressing so to speak and\nWell I I can imagine it now it's getting a ... you're spending a lot of time you've got man hours out there is there anyone in you know out there that I knew I needed ... to work here now over channel twelve her family owns that turkey farm correct or they're people that are experts in this that know how to lure him in\nWell we had we had experts come the first time before the first two were caught and we were able to get lucky catch two or three and this and I believe this was a male because that's what I've been told by the you know throw up\nAnd he's running down the middle of a without it in the center lane whether you'll once when I was just concerned because I've been getting phone calls from people who are jacking up for the kind of swimming over not to hit them and and thank God they haven't hit him yet\nThat is Johnson's mayor Joe policy now that the evasive any loose in Turkey in town\nThey can't get them they had some kind of a device ... shoot it out with the oath to the net was supposed to pop out and it missed by he was kicked off\nBut that was one heck of a funny conversation I had with mayor policy and we will podcast that six thirty WPRI duck on someone just came in and said that's a funny thing I've I've heard in a long time that segment we'll podcasts that they can't catch the turkey and he will not be having turkey for Thanksgiving he told his wife I don't even want to see a turkey\nFor a long time they're gonna go for the lasagna oh that was hilarious and then he's Providence on WPRI ad\nOn I'm going good how are you there for a while where what I say it again we're not I'm I'm I'm ... I'm wrong I mean while he's okay\nAnyway wouldn't wouldn't even know on on your own\nJokes all the truth [laughter] lender or [laughter] way he got\nHe got rid of turkeys in the long the mother in law is this for real\nReal you asked Joe you'll do you owe me and my gun out of them\nAre well he can fix a lot of things he probably couldn't get it does show that he grabbed that during the ...\nOh my gosh that's so funny and thank you All right uh the turkey aside and again if you want to good if you want to hear a good a\nBack and forth he just laid out the the this this turkey and Johnson goes to Starbucks that's the best part he's a fancy turkey he goes to Starbucks and they feed him out the window you can't do that\nAnd then he wobbles over and he goes over and get some fries and a little ... of a cheeseburger and the fast food place are feeding them it's it is pretty tight over there there's a lot of stores a lot of shops a lot of\nUh eating places you can't do the turkey and then they sent a fake turkey I didn't ... I saw that there was a turkey singing and dancing around Johnson a town hall I it it's a guy dressed up as a as a turkey\nAnd he delivered a picture of the turkey that they can't catch the real turkey I didn't know the other mayors did that that is a funny story so uh by all means listen to that interview on six thirty WPRI dot com oh probably a write up a little story to go with it so that people click on it that is hilarious All right so what's a\nNot so funny but a little bit more serious and I'm not going to get too carried away but I I promised that we would depend to channel twelve debate\nNick Matty yellow in Stephen Fry is round two going for that Cranston state representative seat which of course would lead to you know who becomes the speak or does the speaker maintain his position up at the state house they just they discussed a lot Tim white to D.C pre she ate their hard work and we\nSort of ... the ... was a lengthy back and forth between the two candidates abortion rights and what did they think how could they agreed Gina Raimondo an elephant I'd like to hear that part for first this\nIs channel twelve newsmakers appreciate the audio and the debate is between ... and Republican Steven fries\nLetter grade Mr fry us for the job performance of governor general Mondo a throughout\nThe ...\nAll right I I don't grid coats they never have what I Do supporter and she's doing a good job moving forward\nChannel twelve called your house with our poll and we ask of for job performance excellent good fare for what would you say\nI I I just do it\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's for me or luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lineup of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln him can you actually can MTC and the only twenty eight Lincoln Navigator flood Lincoln of never against it unparalleled Marjorie impeccable surface\n[noise] they just don't grave collies what he's done a good job as as mayor of credit for the moment I thought it was the first ... cups they threw us on non mayor Allen ... a minus and\nA minus okay fair enough\nOr sometimes folks ah you know ... ... the speed round they won't give a yes or no they won't give a letter grade interestingly enough but as Steven Reiss it then they mentioned abortion rights which I Am interested to hear what they had to say about that because a\nSocial issues if you will sometimes and I don't know where they factor in but again they've asked\nUs Steven fries to Republican challenger to Nick Matty yellow for district Fifteen that seat up at the state house here's their answer\nMr price Rhode Island lawmakers are considering a bill called the reproductive health CARE Act which would kind of fire abortion rights and state law do you support or oppose that bill it does more than that and I pose it out I'm Sorry what was it the reproductive health health care act do support or oppose I'm pro\nLife but I understand there's a big concern so will you know will certainly have discussions and uh you have to respect what segments of\nThe population wouldn't let me just ask you this specific to you Mr Matty yellow you're under a lot of pressure to bring that bill up for vote or from women in your conscious will you let that happen next year\nWe're going to have a discussion about it I you know I I've got a lot of colleagues and and cheer folks and we'll we'll talk with them but I Do recognize\nThat there's a big segment of the population that has interest and then and you you certainly tried to respect the people that you represent\nAll right Nick Matty Alou and Stephen Fry it and then of course I think people want to hear this oh a back and forth between what happened with the ... who's to blame for the past socks again this is a taping of newsmakers it's a debate between Nick Matty yellow and Steven fries\n[noise] All right let's move on to an issue that dominated the series assembly session that was the Sox\nUm stir fry we'll start with you unless you were a vocal opponent of taxpayer support for a new ... stadium in New Hampshire Mr Mann yellow on that issue in the end though Mr Mandela back to build it was so stingy ineffective teams now leaving from Worcester his decisions mean round taxpayers won't be on the hook for new ballpark now so that means their credit from you on that and\nThat's like somebody who tripped over themselves a and fell on a bed of roses and it was by intent\nOK I mean that's what happened here was\nHe was exactly around politically so let's start out with this quickly twenty Fifteen he supported a new paw soccer stadium improv is where the cost taxpayers a hundred twenty million dollars used to attack people who opposed it then he almost got defeated in twenty sixteen I started talking about the politics issue and so then he started saying I'm going to listen to the people\nBut then his caucus starts had given him problems and twenty Eighteen about it and the Senate is giving him grief so he starts trying to figure out some plan to come out of here so that he can figure out a way to satisfy the public and satisfy the political people straight comes up to the junk bond plant\nAnd I don't know what his ... around was intended but what I Know is that the reason we don't have a taxpayer from the stadium is not because he was standing up for the taxpayers he was executive around and we lucked out\nOur image many all your response to that version of that ...\nIt's an interesting self serving characterization um I did like the Providence stadium but I always said in a way back then that it was subject to vote or prove one subject to seeing what the voters said about it and what I've said very early on the Kentucky proposal\nWas that we would see what the will of the people was we work real hard at working at figuring out whether that was I came to the conclusion they did not want\nA states backing of the stadium\nSo we came to the conclusion and then I listened to a lot of my colleagues also and they were all learning the same thing\nSo we we responded to that and we came to the conclusion that would be no that proposal would not move forward late in the process somewhat brought to me the proposal of a special revenue bond and in that case you simply commit a revenue stream side of junk bond did say that the commitment of the revenue stream and what we committed\nWas exactly the amount of money we would lose if the ... their sales tax revenue and their income tax revenue\nNo backing the investor would take all the risk it would not cost the taxpayers one dollar more than that no taxpayer backing and no Pataki back in the midst of fries cited clearly just doesn't understand the plan special revenue bonds the revenues would be the only thing back and yet\nYou know unfortunately what's the came came up with a one hundred million dollar plus deal it was too rich Rhode Island would never do that and should not do that\nAnd I think the taxpayers who are wise and at the end of the day we responded to the will of the taxpayers I you know I'm not sure how anybody could have", "show_name": "Tara Granahan", "year": "2018", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day":
