P. R. O. [noise]\nListen through there was an unfortunate for the because I I was you know I I got a chance to watch the mentally ill will grow up to be such a nice gentleman and he was just the typical kid he was a little while to control but he was a typical kid\nWe've seen Joe an injury thought at that Joe as history of hedge but it's only in a road island moment that you have that incident happened with the heart of the matter a Jesus loving thirty someone in thirty\nYou know flapping punching whatever you want to talk about it a Thirteen year old that's not a laughing matter\nAll right that obviously was out ... last week with gene Dallas anti and then ... low independent candidate for governor was on the New York on friday so\nWorldly can as southern Rhode Island from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit wider of Lincoln Lincoln Lincoln him during the um the older twenty or gene Lincoln never was willing to go switch phones here a low budget resumes ...\nIs on a typewriter right it's typed out and the kids are Thirteen Years old so their handwriting looks that of a Thirteen year old trying to ah suffer through some cursive writing here\nAnd uh you know there's a some curse words in there about what supposedly Joe ... said uh and and how he hit them over the head with some kind of cooking gun compound to\nAnd listen it was the talk of the week and it's been the talk for a couple of weeks now interestingly enough let me just say this before I read what Joe ... put out this morning there was a Providence Journal\nArticle ah where in\nJoe ... said I'm not going to get out of this race I'll stay in this race even if I get two percent I don't want to see Allen funds become the governor and that line right there was alarming to many of us saying already so you're you're only staying in to sing\nA one of the competitors there's been talk constantly\nEvery one of us gets uh the emails about well why don't you ask\nHim about his daughter All right it's a step daughter well why don't you see what governor Monday promised him otherwise he wouldn't be in this race\nOr he has said repeatedly he'd rather what did he say chose on legs off cut his own arms off something like that than do a favor for governor Mondo or to you know to curry favor with Governor Mondo this has been going on so long uh the N. word was used and I'm Out at the N. word out out out I don't care what year it is but again\nIf you have if you take yourself out of it\nAnd what is disturbing to you and what you you know what would change your opinion on someone that's in the words and and the writings of a Thirteen year old\nWho obviously a ... parents were fighting constantly with the trail of family I mean this does sound like a ridiculous soap opera but this is our real lives and it affects our governor's race one hundred percent it affects this governor's race Allan Fung is putting out um messages\n... you know group emails whatever email blasts all his messaging with his logo saying this is now a two person race they have discounted Joe ...\nAnd they are calling it a two person race because of this story so yes it does in fact have an effect the average person who I don't know maybe you don't get the journal anymore right maybe uh I saw sitting on a couple of counters running around this weekend it's on the front page of the paper\nBut does he is the average person affected by this particular Nineteen Seventy five case regarding Joe ... that's what I Want to know now I think a lot of people have heard about it because it started off as a funny ha ha he went over there he's the neighbor he's cranky he's screaming at everybody and somehow his arm wax\nNick Young ... teenager not even a team like Thirteen Years old right I'd say teenager I think you're driving a cart sixteen a pre teen whatever the hell you are a new teenager\nNow it seems like there was a maybe an F. word maybe an N. word and therefore it doesn't bother me but the N. word does um certainly I don't I Can't imagine running over and ... you know dropping bombs on a bunch of kids in my neighborhood but hey whatever however hitting them with a piece of something I don't ... gone\nUm and also saying I'll have a bunch of have a group of\nUsing the N. word come over here and crush your bones now are those are the words of a child who's upset or\nDoes it did this really happen and if in fact it does does it affect you so many people are saying okay enough we've had enough I don't want to hear any more get out of the race and let it be a two person race they've got the lead Alan ... versus Gina Raimondo oh Gina Raimondo saying about this I as I said\nLast week I think it was Wednesday\nShe deserves to win if all these shenanigans continue now we only have three weeks left she she deserved to win none on her record not necessarily on on the on the political stance that I I Would not agree with her on I don't I don't disagree with her on a hundred percent I disagree with her on a lot of things and the we heard ministry and behaves\nOr they won't come to the table and they won't give you a lot of information and they don't look at the real crisis in the state that being said the shenanigans between the ... campaign and and the trail of team\nIs is insanity at this point it's it's reached a level of insanity and she deserves to when I said that last Wednesday I said Joe ... got cabin odd\nRight let's go in the way back machine oh it's not as your book it's it's a scuffle and or an assault situation with a bunch of kids in the neighborhood he gets Kevin and Gina gets to point out we get Gina to point out we haven't made it into a promo didn't we\n... group wants your car anyway any model what by more than anything around because we're a survive vying center at will buy yours even if you do ... hours logged onto our car buyers are tough\nSolution we go to a movement\nA lovely friday afternoon news though yeah of course right before for ... and and the buses are burning in Providence Rhode [laughter]\nAll right so in case people listen people are busy late friday afternoon Joe did call into dance show\nUh he put out a statement today in regards to a couple of things that he's been saying because he's he's bogged down with the story now now it's become a thing it's become part of the governor's race we could laugh at it in the beginning possibly but now it gets a little more seriously\nTaken because of the police report so right the kids had to sign a statement they had to write it in their own words you can see their handwriting it's that of a of a young person\nAnd you can see it on our website was ripped the documents of their ...\nAnd I'm just gonna tell the folks that have not had time to really get into this this is Nick ... who happens to be the speaker of the house out we were at ... next door we were at ... next door neighbors meaning that's the house in question right where Joe said there was a girl screaming so he went over there to tell the kids to knock it off and it might have hit them\nUm and now there's no mention of the girl though in any of this right right okay we were making a little noise [noise] All right\nSo he's Thirteen so there's no there's not a spelling right not yet he's not as friendly chap just yet Mr Grillo came over he said to stop making noise when he left since he picks on everybody [laughter] this is a child again Nick ... I told\nSo and so it's locked out not to take it meaning don't take his golf right okay in a whisper\nAnd I can't seem to have a multitude you're gonna wish for oh I told him I take it in a west par with ... percent from got it okay he came back meaning Joe ... show and said to me you little punk\nSo I said to talk to my father and he said I'm sick of talking to your father and he hit me three times in the head and before that he threatened us and said I'll beat the blanking with the F word\nBlank out of you I think you can figure that out folks and after he said I'll get to blanking n words after you to crush your bones now that's pretty specific\nFor the kids are right that again this was in a kid's words but there are police sitting there saying here's a pad here's a pen write down what happened so I'm sure he's nervous ... or you know or he wants to get back at jokes are all\nThe fathers of you know he's his father's fighting with Joe troll it sounds like all the time right right it's a neighborhood you know cluster of personalities\nBut I I was out of the ... um all now I Can't read read this part all with the care\nAll with the care he tried to get my brother and blank well with the car oh car okay he's got some spelling issues and with the car he tried to get my brother and so and so another child and after with the car at the guy tried to scare me by coming close to me with the car and almost hit me this happens after he hit me over the head three times\nSo [laughter] All right so\nHere's what people have to decide this is a police report right right now gene was mentioning this morning it's not the ... the court documents right those are gone those are gone right there either expunged or they just don't exist because to write the grandson courts or whatever\nAre the folks that took care of it I'm sure they made room and they got rid of boxes or or what have you write 'em\nHow far to people want to go back is is what you have to ask yourself and does this is this the doing for Joe ... that's what I'm Wondering what the what are the other kid right\nThe other two ... says uh say the same thing ... who says um [noise] when we were born in ... we were reaching some noise and Mr ... drill comes out and says he's going to be the ... says he's going to be born in June to\nA a ... with some black people or so or ... or ... or three times on the head with a with a cork on it was like ... we're talking going [noise]\nUh when I was over ... we were making some noise ... quieted down so million blank quieted down\n[laughter]\nUm you know it's very similar to to ... to disclose that even even worse than writing and reading you know [noise] so um\nIt's it's it's it goes on to say the same thing but as mentioned black\nHe'll he'll get some black kids to compete is up or whatever that's what this was that's what that second voice said you know many yellow you use to supposedly what Joe ... now here and here we are we fast forward for forty something years Joe ... hello I find with together the ...\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's from your laundry dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit letter of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln emphysema and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator for Lincoln America has its own parallel Marjorie impeccable surface\nStoring the Joe ... said I had to get over there and save a young girls at the age of my daughter she was saying get the money or they're trying to get in my house right but I Do\nThink it's interesting and insurgents Smith's statement um they refer to [laughter] there seems to be no question there Mr trailer did actually strike young ... with a tube of cooking compound after he had been provoked into doing so by Mick [noise]\nThen imagine this in a police report today who was an ill mannered undisciplined little brat who has been a source of aggravation to other residents of the area as well as the school authorities over these facts and I wasn't ... assault on the board is justified as as justified as it may have been\nThey couldn't stand these kept right particularly Nick ... was a feisty kid if you want to say that what he said he was not knows brat right and against although it was so low but my grandmother would say you little snotty nosed brats [laughter] and and the cop\nEven says although does against my better judgment I felt I had no other choice but to charge was a trailer with one town of assault\nA modest or part is a concern to stay away from each other and you know make an attempt to keep peace in the neighborhood this case was closed blah blah blah\nAnd so here's here's where I stand as well everybody wants to you know go out this way he used the N. word that's according to a bunch of searching for a couple of Thirteen year old who was an ill men or the it's not no skin [laughter] doesn't brag little bread I did a source of aggravation so the kids back it up there\nRight as many Thirteen fourteen year olds that they've they were running around the neighborhood acting up the police knew it I Can't do anything about it really cause they're minors right so they probably saying I'm Glad you're troll whack them upside the head but you can't say that because it would it's considered an assault\nHere's the thing Joe blow himself when he first spoke to gene ballot Sunday said he pleaded no low in other words it's almost like pleading guilty right let me get this out of here just closed the case\nYou can pick up the police report and all over it it says N. G. meaning not guilty right\nAnd the only record we have from the court um says ah you know ... and this is from your July third Nineteen Seventy five did make an assault upon the body of blankets Thirteen Years\nAnd it says one three Seventy seven found not guilty after trial no gene had I'm Frank Williams on for the yes justice and he said that there might be some sort of confusion and\nIs in the lingo and gee versus ... said\nThis is a thirty second sorry yeah he kind of pooh poohed all of us right because he said this is ridiculous you know he and he's he's sitting there here in case after case after case rate for so many this is stupid right and if it was found not guilty that could very well I mean\nThey read the test you know the statements from the kids right and said oh come on he didn't run if what if a judge didn't believe the kids and the and he was found not guilty and we don't even know that but everybody's trying and trying and convicting Joe ... from Nineteen Seventy five when you don't really have an understanding of energy meaning royalty\nAnd you're the cop sing the blues and for all intents and purposes here though these the Mariel wasn't a credible witness who Thirteen 'cause he was a [noise] a source of aggravation and no troublemaker and\nSo I think he I think Joe ... has more problems with the two percent comment then he made them as Nineteen Seventy five case I think he I think more people are turned off and get a lot of people yeah I think more people turned off that he said to the journal I don't I don't care what happens I'll stay in this race even if I get to ... percent in order for mayor ... not win\nBut does that speak to his anger you know like a good weekend as as volatile temper and what you know well that yeah that is what the heck you know have against\nAt this point I don't care you know as long as it takes I go down and you know he says he's a he says we're now in front of the bad guy he says\nYou've got to back that up right so yeah I'd like to you know there's three weeks left you know such a bad guy and you have all the goods on him and you're Nineteen Seventy five get outta here you little punks or I'll kill you comes up right now would be the time right otherwise you know he got to kind of put up or shut up I think that's where we're at and\nI think people will put off by the you know well he killed a guy thing\nYeah that would yeah because that is a case that is a grant there was a grand jury they did not find a anything other than he fell asleep are right went unconscious for a minute we're talking about Alan funding for those who are listening at Nineteen years old had a fatal car accident on the other hand if\nWe're digging a forty year old police reports on a bigger both for the twenty five year old who is reporter thirty year old who is report\nWell there's a family of on there and it's much more devastating and get knocked on the head with something that even happen\nWell done well God of all ... investigative report the the Emmys on its way right we are going to do radio thank you\nHow would you like motor trench twenty gene truck of the year for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty anti Ford F. one fifty the best drug for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at what board and he's running short and there were against it\nNine six nine ...

to the journal that Joe ... and folks in the morning and we'll come back and it's ten twenty four on this Monday the governor's race is a\nIs off the rails back on the rails Alan from over the weekend is now\nFraming this as a two person race ... puts out a statement this morning saying I'm not going anywhere and what I meant to say to the journal was I'm all in and I'm not just doing this to hurt Ellen ... or to benefit Gina Raimondo I Am paraphrasing obviously I can read it to you I put it up on our Facebook page\nThe bottom line is he said to the journal after this police report came out from Nineteen Seventy five\nA he said I you know I'm not getting out I Will stay in this even if I get to ... percent two percent\nAs long as Alan phone doesn't become the governor of people said oh sees just doing it for that reason now he ... he took a walk back on that and I'll read the statement put out by his spokesperson but it's Joe ... words\nAnd he says I Want to be very clear and honest with the people of Rhode Island I'm running for governor to be the leader of our beautiful state that's why I began this campaign and why I'm working hard every day to make it a reality this is Joe troll\nThis campaign is not a personal vendetta against Alan ... it is about the future of Rhode Island a future that I can deliver as governor he added I spent last week defending myself from attacks from the ... campaign over an incident that happened forty three years ago\nMy opponents portrayal of this incident is a political hit job yes I Am a fighter and I stand up for what I Believe it was true forty three years ago when I rushed to help a Thirteen year old child it remains true today when I call up corruption incompetence and harmful policies\nThat hurt the little guy our jobs climate and are already crushing cost of living the attacks on my character went beyond the bounds but my response was excessive and simply not true I Am not in this campaign to be a spoiler\nAs with everything I have done in my life I Am in this race to win furlough concluded that's it\nAll right folks um we have three weeks and you've got to make a major decision I don't know if you're on the fence or all all the\nStories and reports from Nineteen Seventy five flipped you in this race I set it last\nWednesday because of all of this and by the way the funk campaign adamantly denies that they brought out this Nineteen Seventy five report they said it was given to them somehow but they didn't go looking for it ... ... believe whichever side you want but does it change your mind three weeks out\nI said last Wednesday Joe ... cabin on and we have gene a to point out she just sits back kicks back puts up the shoes and says let the boys role in the mud\nAnd I'm just going to put out these TV ads do my businesses the governor and I got another four years that's what I said last Wednesday and it's changed since\nThen I don't think that part has four three eight nine seven seven six Robin is called in from North Carolina's morning Robin\nGood morning how are you\n[noise] well I'm doing okay I'm calling you this morning about the remark that Joe ... made last week about my brother's death\nOh okay um\nYou are related to the family that was in the accident and ... and I I'm Sorry for your loss this was with Alan ... in his fatal accidents that correct\nYeah that's my brother\nOkay I'm very sorry so you have now moved to North Carolina\nYeah okay\nWhat did you want to say I was interviewed I was interviewed a about a month ago by Michelle Smith with the Associated Press yes um I the\nOn on a report I think it ... as a the eleventh that it appeared in Providence Journal bulletin mhm where she quoted me\nExactly in saying that and what I said a month ago was that I Hope that my brother's yeah was not going to be a political boy in this election campaign\nThen what do you know\nIt is he uses Mike rather yeah as a piece of mud just laying at another candidate\nSo your ... you are asking the ... campaign to stop using your brother's death\nHow would you like motorists twenty or gene trucks will be here for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty energy for the most histories of struggle to fish fries anywhere you one hundred Ninety nine dollars for a full year what board and when I joined the gym but\nI really would a public apology because it's just it's it's completely and consider it it's\nWrong if he doesn't have enough good things to say about and self without having to bring up nasty stuff like that then maybe he shouldn't be the governor\n[noise] well so if if he's he shouldn't have to to worry about on people bringing up his past why didn't he put it out there and the first place\n... well yeah I mean I I think I I Would I'm just going to answer when I think they're going to say and that would be you know so long ago he barely remember said but\nCertainly it involves a people that that we all know including the speaker of the house so I'll listen Robin I I understand what you're saying um there's a line that you need to um\nAcknowledge if not honor and I think you know bringing up someone who who we you lost a family member that you lost just to get a political jab at another person probably is a\nA new low so yeah you listen maybe he will hear you and maybe it'll turn this into a positive for himself as well by saying you know what I was wrong and I apologize to the family and I think that would be a good way to approach it right\nI think so yes well any race on it if you don't have any questions for me that's fine but no I just\nI I just wanted to call in and\nYou are you surprised as a ... and it's also surprised not surprising but you've obviously you follow a Rhode Island politics because what the Associated Press reporter reach out to you\n[noise] she reached out to me I don't follow Rhode Island pounds attack it this is just this is personal ... and ... again I don't I don't live in Rhode Island I haven't lived in Rhode Island for over Thirty years and I don't ... don't follow politics\nAnyway but I did take offense when people don't like it when people do that\nAnd this is really personal\nIt's wrong but that's what helped me to call you today\nOh I appreciate it I appreciate it and and you know what I I I think it's a lesson and it might open up some ice here that we're not talking about the issues and you're bringing up terrible situations that happened in the past this was an accident and um yeah it's just wrong it is wrong\n[noise] yeah I don't know how you this credit someone\nHaving had a fatal accident like this it's not like Alan ... song is driving down Ninety five and says hey there's a guy over they're changing a tire let me go ahead and kill him for ... them giggle\nYou know that that's not what happened it's a really unfortunate accident my parents did not pursue trying to press charges against him the grand jury was the case what else\nIs there to discover enough\nOkay Robin listen I appreciate it uh [noise] we'll see we'll see if the um ... she was any kind of an apology to you and I'm Sorry that this was brought up such terrible feelings\nWell thank you very much for your time and I appreciate you hearing me today\nYou bet thank you and best of luck to you and your family Robin was calling in from North Carolina\nShe's one of

sister who was killed\nUm she said enough enough and I and she wants an apology so this is takes us to a whole nother level if you will\nThis is what happens you know she's in North Carolina hearing about this and called in to say enough stop using my brother's name stop using his death\nIs not a good luck for Rhode Island politics today for three eight nine seven seven six okay Joe ... might want to apologize and and knock off with the uh with the fatal accident I don't know if you will there's a lot of\nBad bad feelings between the two campaigns but she said enough is enough to not use
