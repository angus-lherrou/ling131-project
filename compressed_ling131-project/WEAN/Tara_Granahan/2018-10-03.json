go bankrupt these people want to hear from ...\nOh I don't know about that I I mean I I hear what exactly where you're coming from Bobby but boy the state would have to absorb an awful lot Central Falls is one thing Providence no way oh this is a very interesting email Eric writes\nUm the bus strike is not a leadership issue when the government creates a monopoly on school transportation it puts all the power in the hands of the company in question thanks to that monopoly there's no viable alternative for parents and students this is a monopoly versus free market problem the government needs to get out of the transportation business and allow competitors\nTo enter the market giving people choices that way when drivers for one company go on strike parents will have other alternatives\nAll right sounds about right who's going to start to install that for a program this is what I'm saying I mean that that's a viable issue give us some alternatives don't make it a monopoly okay who's going to break that cycle of hell he gets this mayor\nI don't know five weeks and counting folks Providence should be paying real strict attention for three eight nine seven seven sixties in Central Falls on WPRI Steve\nHey how are you doing good how are you good\nSo all the attention on a profit on it had your role video Providence Jesus Christ and phone or like a dollar and all of them are all\nIn bad ... you could see that you will that will take on a lot to do it for a student at the city a problem with like a coral and say well\nYou and it had absolutely nothing to do that you're probably\nOkay you you tell me then Steve the two sides that are at the negotiating table or the Teamsters Union\nIn first and for students and so you're saying that that that ah first student has no say in anything\nI didn't say that well what are you saying all I'm\nSaying is you're you're paying ... can't manage another parent to correct it would be not fair that I did say that

that they they can't absorb more folks on it and and first union and saying oh we we will offer a four O. one K.\nBut not rolling you into a pension I don't know if anybody wants to to to weigh in on this um he may have been part of the teams from as in a different in a different situation I don't know if he's part of the the bus the striking bus from I'm not sure and then it went beep when we

that ... that are going on here in ... it's it's a private the ... century\nWhere does the ... the idea of a four O. one K. coming\nSo here's a here's the problem with the far one we've had a four O. one K. ... first through 'em and there's a couple of things I don't want to mention um you said that this was a part time job or not these drivers average about some of the sixty hours a week or the the school piece of their work\nAt first student is only one quarter there are private charter is that commit\nA hundred and fifty of them a day\nThree robbers or not or art I really mean so there is that part of it and then there's four one K. we've had in our contract\nThe company you're supposed to match the first three hundred and fifty dollar that my members put into four one K.\nDidn't we are in October we have not seen a dime from the Internet for one kid we had an amazing ear economically bounce it record I none of the none of the benefit of the company on that for one K. has affected my this is why we have an issue or there\nAre so is this is a private issue and are you the person sitting at the table next I Am the man at the table\nAnd the other person at the table is Frank McMahon\nNo frankly extensive PR guy that they hire you don't even work for a person\nWho who are the key people at the table\nSo after it's bordered by cell phone jumped out all our lives ...

play at the table\nNone I mean it's a it's a private company ... and we're you know I'm I'm like\nCan they walk away and say you know we'll find another company you guys are going to get your act together\nNow the city has a contract with for students to provide the sir\nWithin that contract you're allowed to strike correct we've been our contract labor contract yeah\nSo you're allowed to strike so the city's hands are tied is what you're saying and that you guys are going to play hardball with each other and lead the ... ...\nWell no not at all we want to do everything we can if we could get these kids back to school and these boxes rolling ball I continue this battle with a company I Would that would be ideal for me\nUm we got to find a way to do that though I mean we fight these battles all the time they've ever get this kind of ... was it a because usually you know there's not the innocent victims which are which are the kids\nAre which is really a portrait for students get it might take that away from them and we should seriously sit down at so far but they were hoping that you know why the kids go to school every once in a blame the bus drivers and the union\nUm whether it's really terrible we're asking for here is that literally it will cost for student upping the money is on the table they're trying to throw in wages are member\nNot our leadership
