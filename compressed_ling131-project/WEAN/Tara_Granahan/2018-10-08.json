I don't know if he received it\nThursday or friday but then when I got home lo and behold there were two of them in my mailbox and I'm so one one was addressed to me one of those address but my wife and whoever did it didn't sparing the expenses because I Know when you send out political campaign letters or\nAny mass mailings to empty house your deep duplicate the list\nThough you're not sending once everybody that's in that home but in my case they will be by\nThat I have five registered voters in my household right they wouldn't be spending the five votes so they didn't even do that so there are some homes that receive more than one but this wasn't a it was not inexpensive campaign by any out so I have no idea who's behind it but as I said\nI'm going to say that they signed off on it because it's their rhetoric and all that he will stop\nIt but they're not telling the truth is they come there because they love the town the first thing they want to do is change it it's just it's awful\nNow whose name what do you mean by that and when you sit down in the Caldwell\nRecalled well I mean they they're blaming needs then then they turn this around like me doing my God am I going to do myself that much for the service\nAs I said I'm not negative and I hate the fact that I even have to respond to this negativity because they did a really negative and I just don't like it\nWell you know I I was trying to you know obviously reach out to her and said you know ... where are you coming from do you want to distance yourself from this and she said my statement speaks for itself so I Will get her statement and she's distancing herself or through a a a letter if you will but at the same time in her in her statement and she asked you know for money\nOr saying you know ... you know please support me\nYou know in in ... and if she's being targeted so I I understand where you're coming from when I Want to say though is I feel it was important to talk about this he scratches one town in the state of Rhode Island east Greenwich west Greenwich but there is this whole you know pitting men against women women against men\nAnd the to me this is a total turn off I Would I Would want to hear from this woman who's running\nAnd the whole idea of men are a threat to our reproductive rights\nAnd its name you represented you Russo is just one of many men that want to hold down\nI mean this is this is going too far and beyond ridiculous now so I just wanted to make ... you know to make a statement that if she doesn't have the guts to come on the air and and defend whoever wrote you know would not defend who I've read it but defend herself against whoever rode in on her behalf\nI mean this this letter is talking about getting her support and donating to her and getting behind her so if she doesn't want it she should come forward and said\nWell because if she's on the radio towers by you know everything I ever hear about her is all scripted so like that ... that intro that you were doing that was a scripted thing that's on her Facebook that it's all scripted but maybe she just started ... is not good on her feet I don't know that you know\nYou can't run legislation by press releases a new releases and scripted things you sometimes you do have to stand up and just speak without a script and not maybe she's not comfortable doing that well maybe she has links to hide I have no idea\nWhat are your constituents a neighbor saying representative gene Russo I mean I don't see how this could ever ever work in her favor so someone is out there thinking they're doing or a fever and I think it's going to backfire but what are your you know the people surrounding you saying\nWell believe it or not the most upset among among my constituents are women yeah I'm a because you know they I mean first of all that letter attack every man and then every woman who values or permit whether it's her husband her on her father her brother and and then by the way\nHappy Columbus Day also insults everybody who happens to be Italian American because they are one little adjective changed everything if they had said Italian charm I Would have been it would have been really nice but you're throwing a notch the lake sleazy and it changes everything so they throw that in there by the way we also have some some people that live in nice weather\nLooking for a car spread it not

there's someone out there that I don't I Hope this isn't a group of people I Hope it's maybe one person that thinks they're doing testing Caldwell a fever and I I I certainly don't think they are I Would be with him and who are highly offended don't let me in with you ...\nYou don't mind my mother always said that you are who you hang out with that if you if you rented out what somebody who limped eventually you're going to limped users that dollar and a and that's a that was a metaphor for but you know choose your friends wisely\nUm and she is still out yourself by some people that like yesterday I actually wasn't I didn't reply to emails yes but it I didn't even look at them because they said you know what\nThis campaign mode without a month ago and I was out there campaigning speakers of the people of all of my district and I cover a good part of West private Chinese rather and and um and but then some people were taken screen shots of some tweets that were going out with some of our friends one of them was actually one that ran unsuccessfully for state Senate\nOr nearby audio Johnston or Lincoln wherever that district there's and the files stuff that came out of her mouth like I said aren't they supposed to screen these things from Twitter I mean growing F bombs like they were going out of style but then there's pictures of just being cold well and this woman\nSo you know eventually eventually the truth will come out as I said it may not be her up like those are her words and she started that whole attack ... back in January when\nWhen when one of those state reps ... me too and then all of a sudden they have to react in a you know to make it look like it was the right things or do politically to have a a sex or harassment training at the state house\nThat was three by any means so when she said well when he was offering yeah you know if you give me central favorites I'll get you bills passed since she didn't named the person who set it allegedly a and then yeah then you then you were all told to ah well let's have some sexual harassment classes is that what you're talking about\nYeah exactly so ... so what happened there is I I did that night because I said you know I'm a I'm a professional I have a I have my own business have lots of employees and most of them are women and I I'm very sensitive to that we've had training in my business and we have things posted all over the place that we've never had not even one\nIota of a problem with with management to stop stop this baffled vice versa and and I took offense that someone in leadership is is saying you pass your bills are new to this that the other and yet you don't mention who it is\nFirst of all I have a problem with that because there were a Fifteen year old girl was running around in that building and I want to know we have a good lawyer in that room I Want to know who it is and she never even mentioned whether it's ... a former rep or current up\nSo I had a major problem with that and then for them to put on this and I say it proudly and I know you can people can criticize me but it was a dog and pony show all for the optics of it and I said I'm kind of value women I'm going home and having dinner with my wife that's all I'm going to value women in my life\nAnd and then because she took that and by the way for the record I did say that I I skipped ... I didn't eat it I've had it in my in my personal and my business life right but she didn't take it that way so from that moment on that's what they hang that has a I Am a disgrace to women I didn't go to that\nBy the way there were eight team wrapped up and goes to that right but I'm the bad guy and and so that's where a rhetoric and everything that that she says is all about that reproductive rights by the way we've never had a bill come to the full house\nAbout anything to do with reproductive rights so you know I I don't even know where that is coming from I don't serve on that committee on the climate and on the corporations in\nThe middle east when I'm getting at today I feel that there are so many people that feel that our I'm just going about their day to day life right I got to go to work I've been to take care of the kids get to ... take him and the parents are and and then there are those that are looking for something to protest and hear you say we'd never even dealt with\nA challenging reproductive rights I'm you know at least we've got to stop these men we've got to stop all this why it's happening so I don't know where that this anxiety or ... or\nCall to arms

is that she is not the one that did the letter that it actually came from the other camp so they could\nPull this thing together basically do what they do it turn it into a bit versus woman war which

written not by somebody with a PHD\nDidn't she wrote it I just didn't say she wrote it but it certainly seems to be someone who's supporting her\nWell I Will tell you that I talked to numerous people who said\nAfter they got the letter they're going to vote for your Roosevelt and then you put it off on his Facebook within his Twitter within you know a day clearly this letter is galvanizing his
