B. R. O. E. F. theater in Lincoln five feet or you're on the air with Stephen\nHi Stephen two questions this question is we were in a house that we'll to it and it\nAnd it will do and didn't pay the rent and we had an existing lease with this show like\nThis question is what we call it so what's the procedure should we take to go after this for unpaid where it\nAll right good question Peter so let me tell you how Rhode Island courts work or if you are in Rhode Island I think you're in like yeah let me tell you how we're island courts work with tenants on residential property\nOrdinarily if a tenant reaches a lease and the property remains vacant for two months and then you're able to re rent it\nThe court will say that the tenant is responsible for those two months okay they put a even though they have twelve months remaining the courts generally will ask\nHow much ah how long was the property vacant for was there any damage to the property and and that's what they will award you\nUm unfortunately a lot of times as many of the judges if you go to court you say there's eight months left a if the court inquires ... the court can give you the full eight months but if they inquire most of the time they just award the damages that you\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape or just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine Vermont flood as every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\n...\nOkay well what\nI Need to uh ... what would the ... seat you'd be will be going to small claims court that'd be stuck with it\nI Would say small claims court is a great venue for folks who have claims or damages around twenty five hundred um you know even if it's twenty eight hundred you could still go to small claims court and that will you don't have to hire an attorney\nOr you get your day in court the judge will give you a judgment it has the same effect\nAs any other judgment which means that with the judgment you could ask to put a lean if they do buy a home put a lean on their home or or a garnish wages and just see you know when you obtain a judgment in the state of Rhode Island a judgment in in of itself is good for Twenty years\nSo when you get a judgment and you get an execution following a judgment you can hold that paper for Twenty years and if he ever buy real estate if they ever do anything like that you can go record in town hall and that would be an effective lean against their property\nOh very good that's what a lot of it that's that's the trick that debt collectors do unfortunately I have a lot of people come in and they say you know\nI I got this loan ten years ago and uh I just got sued today and that's because ... Rhode Island is a ten year statute of limitations on breach of contract so they wait ten years\nThen they sue you then they get a judgment and then they have Twenty years to collect on the judgment it's almost like you you you you have a a a lot of tools at your hand a lot of people just don't know it\nWell okay I just have one more quick question and I won't take up the name only a turn on a problem\nWe had some are calling work done this past summer on a initial with one of the bedrooms in a house we spent a thousand dollars which paid this poor motels in dollars and unbeknownst to was um there was no issue until last\nSunday my son went to put the heat on in the house and when he did um this is related to the ... we had any way to make a long story short um we had a really bad a water leakage from the whip that was done this summer\nAnd oh my God do I call\nI call it the plum of who did the work he came over and um he really didn't fix anything and he wanted to charge me a service charge it two hundred dollars which had refused to pay and he left\nAnd um since since then so again this was last Sunday so this past week we had another former come over and he verified that what the other guy did was a\nWas a unacceptable he he did though he didn't do a proper job so my question to you Steve is do we have any recourse to go after this plumber\nYou know I I think your records as long as he licensed and uh you know somebody else indicated that his work was less than\nWhat is acceptable you know for customary and reasonable and the state of Rhode Island you re costs may very well be to file a complaint with the contractors registration board it costs twenty five dollars to do that\nMale review the facts and circumstances and if they feel that the work was efficient they can order restitution which means they can order him to repay the thousand dollars or an amount that would be necessary to actually make the repairs\nOkay just to reiterate once again that contract is what was the name that bought\nThe Rhode Island contractors board if you Google it up or it'll it'll come up for you in and they have the forms you can print out and and it just takes you right through the process that we don't have to go into small claims court or anything like that and and you know they may come out in ... you know they're there to be an independent party\nSo they may very well come out and say well the work wasn't great but it was good enough to pass muster\nYou know in that in that situation you know they could come out and say the work wasn't great and we want him to pay you the thousand dollars back\nOr the cost to make the repairs\nBeautiful thank you very much I appreciate\nIt All right Tina hope I pointed in the right direction to that issue\n... thank you enjoy the rest of the week\nYou to all righty next up we're bobbing borrow ville Hi, Bob you're on the air with Steven\n... about ... good good how can I help you\nUp in the ... about two months ago myself and my wife got a reverse mortgage and we've got some of the ... or ...\nOr ... or ... and I noticed that in the paper or it addresses owning myself at the owner not my wife my wife\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator what Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled Marjorie impeccable surface\nThat or not\n\nWe're not sure what's going on All right without\nYup so ordinarily what'll happen is I'm assuming her name is still on the deed so sometimes sometimes with reverse mortgages they use the credit in the age\nOf one party so what will happen is the entire reverse mortgage will be processed in your name\nShe still on the deed she's just not on the note so the actual reverse mortgage paperwork will come in your name\nBut if you went down to city hall she would still be a co owner with you and so what they do is in order the process of reverse mortgage and and I just closed a reverse mortgage last week for a couple\nUm and it was a very similar situation the husband's information was used to qualify for the reverse mortgage she has she didn't have to sign anything her name did come off the deed so only his name is on all the paperwork\nBut the house is still owned by both of them it's\nA fairly common thing when you have one spouse that younger one spouse that's older or if one spouse has uh some real credit issues and the other spouse has really good credit you know those types of situations\nPoint are dangerous but not no character\nWould become between what I Hope not but yeah\nWell yes well right and the only obligation you should have under the note is that the note will under a traditionally under reverse mortgage essentially\nThe the note is a crew in interest but the interest is being applied to your principal so the only obligation you have as a reverse mortgage holder\nIs to pay your property taxes pay your insurance maintain the property\nMother and father get the four oh one K. money and decide not to give it to son in law so naturally the son in law was in to see me to talk about what his rights are real to this money the mother and father say that they are going to give it to his kids when they feel that they're ready and of course the kids are only six and eight\nAnd who knows if they're if they're holding that money and they pass\nAway then it'll go to their estate and most likely they're other children so a terrible circumstance and I'm sure this woman did not plant on happening\nSo vitally important check your beneficiary designations make sure things are up to date it just saves everybody a lot of grief and aggravation and in this situation\nUm you know he feels that he's never going to see the money and I'm based on his representations to me I feel that he may be right I I just it's an awful situation\nSo um that has to do with fake accounts now another question that I had received and I'm going to talk to this and we have Jack and Jamestown has got a question about zoning\nSo we'll get into some zoning topics in a minute\nI had another question about a um [noise] somebody came in and saw me and I think I Do I have two more minutes\nYou've got like one now okay alright what other more somebody came in and saw me and they had to do with um setting up a trust or putting their children's names on their real estate and a a life ... so they had gone and seen another attorney said oh just do a lay per se it's really cheap\nYou put your kids' names on the deed and if you die you're all set your all protected\nWell here's the problem in uh this is the problem that I deal with on a regular basis with folks who do that\nNumber one when you put your children's names on your deed to real estate the first issue that comes up is if they have a debt problems\nIf they get in a car accident if they have if they get sued for financial reasons your house is an asset of veers which can now be look to to satisfy those obligations\nAnd by the way you can't take their name off the deep without their signature\nIf you have a falling out with your in laws and uh you your spouse or your\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda Toyota and super all have in common they are all in for Steve free on tradition at what point and he's written a generic as if that's right over two hundred\nFree on cars all make all models and incredible prices for going to flood auto John job now\nI asked them to so when you're doing that you're giving up a significant portion of your life\nTo things that are out of your control and that's why you set up a trust and so uh trust is so important because you're going to shut this document up that says look\nI'm going to protect his ass it from long term care nursing home whatever and when I pass away you get it but before I pass away you have no control your creditors cannot touch me so really when you were state planning and you're setting up a trust and doing something instead of just doing a deed\nWhat you're doing is you're protecting yourself\nAnd you're protecting yourself from your children and their problems 'cause you just don't know one of the worst case situations that I had was a family\nAnd inherited a house in our against that have been inherited family house were very very long time worth maybe two to three million dollars\nUm you you wouldn't know looking at it but the land was just beautiful and the woman put her daughter's name on the deed after her husband passed away 'cause of doors that don't worry about it\nI'm going to give it to Johnny Susie and Bobby don't worry about it All right well sure enough mom passes away she says she goes is he's an attorney and he says she's the owner of the house and there's nothing they can do so naturally this ended up in protracted litigation where we ended up filing a lawsuit\nTo undo the transaction to make sure that the property was properly distributed to all four children and not just one and you know you say this can't happen my child would never do that and unfortunately it happens more often than you think so\nThis is attorney fees will make the number here was four oh one for three eight nine seven seven six away your three two one WC are oh let me come back we're jak and then we have

soldier on the patriots in Chicago to take on the bears and there'll be no dramatic entry\nFor Rob Gronkowski today as the patriots have ruled him out tea is out of this game today so he will\nNot be playing yesterday he was downgraded to doubtful and there was the thought that possibly he joined the team late in Chicago I did not travel yesterday with the team when they made their way to Chicago\nOr so there was the thought that maybe just possibly he could be a late arrival there that is not the case he will not play today Rob Gronkowski was dealing with ankle injury in recent weeks\nAh he has now had an issue with his back\nThat occurred apparently late this week in practice I Will talk more about that in Rapaport of NFL Network was reporting on this matter this morning here he is on this\n... with a back injury on friday and already been dealing with ankle now back in my understanding is his back locked up on him\nDuring friday's tragedy was viciously downgraded last night to ... as you mentioned did not take the team plane ... generally means the guy is not going to play unless he flies in the day of like Superman\nSo that's obviously not going to have their

could they have an Apple Google receivers they are more than ready to adjust to this\nOkay and as you heard reports say it's not thought to be something that will endure and beyond this week which\nI sort of have a hard time believing because it's a back injury and it's a chronic back then that ground you've dealt with his entire career so I Would still assume and I'm making a full assumption here\nThat just because you know it may not be a major back injury that is not going to be something that drunk as to manage throughout the rest of the season much like he's managing would ever ankle ailment that he's been dealing with for weeks now I don't know that it will keep them out beyond this week but I I think that to say that it's going to be fine he'll be back to a hundred percent a

I just pulled up to play to take a look at that\nI had to go back all those years and take a look at Brady going right buyer lack or\nIt really is one of the more memorable plays a brave whose career that one just stands out out of all the all the great things that he is done that play were Brady rabbi or lack or and then after the play up to him and passing them on the back [laughter] that's the one that if you were you know if you lived through this Tom Brady era and you remember watching that would have happened you\nYou just remember that for every one of those types of ...\nOh yeah definitely yeah I mean that was a huge playing that game and and for Brady to the Jew or lack or the way he did and that was their lack or at its peak you know that was a real lack are\nReally in his prime and the prime of his career and\nThat was a if I'm correct me if I'm wrong but that was two thousand and six so that that bears they wanted us going to the super bowl and they lost the Colts you know in in the super bowl so that was a really good year for the bears and yeah one of the more memorable plays the other memorable thing about that game is a junior sale broke his forearm\nThat's right so I wouldn't have remembered that was the same game yeah so that's just one of the little pieces of history and Ryan or lack or is now pretty much long retired at this point\nAll been around Chicago you see all the billboards now because he's done the hair restoration you know two blocks in Chicago I Know one of those weird it's weird that he has hair or or like they wanted to hear\nHe was like a good looking bald guy like he was he didn't need hair and he would be involved with sort of his thing wasn't it that was it like a brighter like are you don't ever expect pride or lack or to have hair sound like you're a member Bryant or lack\nOf what he had hair no one remembers that like a kid [laughter] uh All right sorry um we are [laughter] you obviously don't want to touch the topic it's OK six or seven seven Seventy nine zero Ninety five we get to open lines if you want to jump on board\nAnd grab onto your patriots preview\nUm we've got a lot to get you in the same when I Do want to follow up on that I kept saying we kinda got disjointed there at the end of that last segment working through a couple of technical issues this morning\nI'm so Gilmore freeze up the space and my next question is this if they are going to look to make a trade and I don't think there's any sort of major deal coming down for the patriots before this deadline\nI think that they want to have flexibility and if something comes available something you know there are approached with the deal that they think it helped them\n... you know make them better they'll have a few million dollars to maybe considered spending on I don't think they're going to go out and say we have five point three million to spend so let's see if we can get you know someone in that price range you could be a good player and a trade I don't think that's happening because I think as you said the reasoning is sort of two people with\nThe incentives that they are going to have to pay out by the end of the year and\nYou know they're just not the type to be tied up against they liked to have flexibility\nWhere you know those were made in my next part is where do you think they're going to look what are they going to look to improve between now and that deadline if they're looking at their team where do they where do you think they believe the biggest need is\nI mean if I were the patriots and I were looking at it I Would say we need a little more speed on defense and and I would look at that line backer spot with John Bentley in that injury and you know he's not expected to come back this year I Would look there and say we need a little more speed you look at a play from that Kansas City game last week where\nCalvin annoyed looked like he had cream Hans ... writes before first down and cream hot just sort of got out of it and ended up picking it up those are the types of plays that keep drives alive keep the defense on the field\nThose are the types of plays in space that I think this defense is susceptible to and you need somebody who was a little bit quicker and a little bit faster\nThat might be able to get over there and make that play and I think you need to get somebody that may be a sort of a non traditional\nPatriots linebacker when I look at the patriots linebackers for the most part like I think it's like an ... and land and Roberts right that guy built\nYou know like a like a mailbox you know easy stout he's he's physical at the point of attack you're not the greatest in space I think they could use somebody you know sort of like when they drafted upcoming ... Hill who was on fill it out\nBlood Lincoln is southern Rhode Island's from your laundry dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit letter of Lincoln M. K. C. Lincoln Lincoln M. K. C. and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator one linking of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable service\nThat they could sort of a find a way to get in there and chased down some of these\nPlays would help six one seven seven seven nine zero Ninety eight five I just watched it and I felt commercial in which Michel ... Mitch through a pack and I laughed because I'm telling ya\nGonna see that today he throws such a he could throw such a bad ball Chris such a bad fall [laughter] it came out like one of those floating docks that manning used to throw\nOut what's the advantage during the campaign Mary would say it but they cannot pay he can he has the\nCan of paint ball in his repertoire of throws okay so we're on the lookout for that today in Chicago we don't want to talk about some other things happening in the NFL I'm including a score update from London\nThe first game of the international series in the NFL is happening this morning and right now it's a ten six lead\nFor the San Diego chargers there are the two minute warning of the first half in that game uh how do you feel about these games you know playing in London during this whole international deal patriots dealt with this last year in Mexico city there's for these games\nI don't understand why it's not more a more regular thing\nThat's that's sort of my gripe with the ... that they are sporadic that there's only four of them part of my grand plan for the NFL is to have one of these games like every week starting at about week three if that makes sense and rotating teams playing the international games as opposed to having a team in London your thoughts\nYeah I think ultimately that's what the the league is working toward is having a team over there in London which I vote I vote jaguars well you know face with the choice between traveling to Jacksonville or buffalo and London I'll take the trip to London thank you very much\nThis isn't about that do you as a football team you're much rather go to buffalo\nOh yeah definitely yeah yeah it certainly the travel yeah but please since when does the NFL care about the players I mean Thursday night games okay the league doesn't but we do as fans or do you care about the players or care about what the travel is for the team well not really I don't think the average fan could care less of what but the travels like for the for the players\nThey just want to show you what can you believe it can impact the outcome on the field that I grew\nI think a lot of I I think it has any a lot of them are like hey you're getting paid millions to play a child's game I don't care how long your flight is\nYeah see I I think that you're wrong about this I think that's smart than say why does my team you have to travel to London to play a game they're not going to be at their best and typically have you seen any of these games where you think that the teams that played extremely well what tell me a memorable London ... tell me a memorable international game ever\nWell you know when or where they're trying to well I went over there twice with the patriots and and they you know they smoke the buccaneers and then battled the down\nThe rams so you know they played bad teams I think they've they've done a little better job in the last couple of years of of getting the matchups wasn't there a really good game there with like the lions a couple of years ago didn't alliance but again like it came down to a field goal at the end I think there was every game over\nThere like the ravens may have played a decent game over there too yeah ... oh God I Can't stand the idea of it make everybody go through this this is painful for every team to go through this process of going over there\nI never really like the super early start time I just kind of weird throws me off\nI think on the east coast is great but the problem is I forget it's happening like which weeks is that happening and I knew that this game was happening I spent time on both radio and television talking about this game on friday and then your Sunday and I wake up and say All right there's a game on this morning I completely forgot about it\nThat's the problem it's not regular enough that it's a part of your schedule the more regular it becomes I think the more\nThe more viewers it would have\n... ... they're they're trying to work up to that there's a lot that goes into it obviously which is will London support that will they support a team that's the big picture but also having you know you said every week after week three through having fourteen consecutive games there will they support that\nYeah I don't know but I think it would be a good test to find out if they actually want a team or not right now or twenty nine seconds ago and the chargers this had to pick of market scenario that's ten six\nChargers with the league I Want to get to a New York giants and their star wide receiver that is oh del back him junior have a listen to what he said late this week\nI've always ... feel like I'm working harder than I ever have so I really don't like what would have\nSome strong religious them what to do what you did this so much in this little mostly like trying to stay hydrated was you know sometimes I just got it in ... is this your critics in the river in both this is going to run and make because if you're ... something though so I'm trying to stay on top of it is the best of", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Tara Granahan", "city":
