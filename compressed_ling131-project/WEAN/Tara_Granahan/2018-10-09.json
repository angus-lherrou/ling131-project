impeccable records I mean not one accusation was made against so that's where I wanted to\nKnow I I understand I I think uh there was a part of me just thought well maybe the you know when to listen to it a couple of different times that maybe the president felt that he needed to smooth things over but it it it it never comes across as that although our last caller just said he didn't have the

said Brett Kavanaugh said himself listen\nIt was contentious and it was emotional but we got through it and without bitterness although I I I Wonder about the\nLack of bitterness I don't know how you

B. R. O. [noise]\n\n\n\nLooking back ten twenty three on this Tuesday unless some breaking news for you a Nikki Haley UN ambassador has resigned\nAnd she didn't have a meeting last week with a at the White House and so uh we've got a tweet\nFrom President Trump which says big announcement with my friend ambassador Nikki Haley in the oval office at ten thirty while CNN and all the other major outlets are saying\nShe has resigned um we will carry it live if there's some kind of a press conference or some kind of an announcement but that is what's coming\nWell do for a guard British break will isn't it time you would want to bring a generic version of the best financed region prices in cars with zero percent if you're somebody too much you can be driving on a fortune also models interest free log onto what job\nAnd what happens with Jeff Sessions I didn't think anybody was really looking at the UN ambassador position as being in limbo at all or being a ... you know having issues or if there were any but\nSo I think if this was a surprise to most ah that she's in Nikki Haley will resign as UN ambassador to the United nations US ambassador excuse me uh to the United nations us all of the um Sarah Sanders also tweeted\nPresident Trump and ambassador Nikki Haley will meet in the oval office at ten thirty this morning this event will be open to the pool so therefore ah we've got you know we've got that development it is I'm going to say it's an unexpected announcement\nAnd and so we'll see what happens and I don't know who's in contention for that but at the sea uh NBC a saying that she has resigned the latest departure from President Trump's national security circle\nI thought they were sick of seeds I thought they were type type type but you know we'll we'll get we'll get the ah the answer who knows if you're going to say she's going home to be with her family who knows she's the former South Carolina Governor serving since January of twenty Seventeen so not even\nNot the full two years and\nShe was there this morning at the White House and according to I'm reading from CNBC she walked right past the reporters in the White House and didn't say anything so she was there this morning and no one no one was on to this or else they probably would've mobbed her she will meet with Trump in the oval office at ten thirty according to White House\nPress secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders All right let's very little information\nAnd you know of course all the big national networks will be breaking down her past and her her history but the the sources are telling network news outlets and cable outlets that Nikki Haley has resigned as Trump's UN ambassador we have any sound on this yet\nFor three eight nine seven seven six I Know you know most people and say whoa nother shake up in the Trump Administration\nUh let's play a little reaction little update breaking news Nikki Haley resigning as UN ambassador\nI was just told by a senior State Department official that she told her staff this morning so that was the first thing that they were at least officially aware that now with the time that she was resigning\nAren't that this is today the she wants to use this pictures of her walking right through the ah [noise]\nThrough the White House sore the outside with the columns and she's a walking right past a reporter so they didn't see it coming [laughter] that's for sure uh Nikki Haley resigning as UN ambassador so we'll get a little bit more as as this develops so ten thirty is the target time\nAnd will pull up a little background on Nikki Haley here as well she uh obviously governor of\nSouth Carolina and first female governor she was of South Carolina\nI a second Indian American after Bobby Jindal to serve as governor I didn't even realize that she was a Indian American and she has been serving as the twenty ninth US ambassador to the United nations for a little over a year all year and a half a four three eight nine\nSeven seven six four three eight WPRI oh let's see uh barbers in North Smithfield on WPRI breaking news Nikki Haley resigning morning Barbara I I I'm\nTerra I Love your show believe me thank you and I I think the world view okay\nBut I hear a buzz coming [laughter] okay [laughter] blows\nMy mind that um\n[noise] you our um Trump thin and um\nThis business with Nikki Haley\nA resigning I'm I'm ... how can I say it I think you're taking the right to um\nAttitude about the whole thing\nWhy don't I Can't have an attitude I don't even know why she's leaving no no I don't mean one sentence or ... years they've asked her\nI didn't mean it that way I'm I'm a little nervous\nI Know that's okay it's called talk show in a while I was critical of Donald Trump this more than what I that's what I'm trying to say because I don't think he needed to throw in ... at half of the country because his guy go into the Supreme Court says well I I criticize when I think it's warranted and I'll give it out on the back when when I think that's warranted as well\nThat's what I like about you carry your fair and um I still can't\nI'm about put my mine together that uh people think the world of him and understand it and I'm like I said uh I think the world of you and I listen to you every every morning and I'm from morning I get a little discovered\nWhat today I was happy when you said that a vote [laughter] I ...\nHow would you like motor trends twenty Eighteen truck of the here for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty eight Ford F. one fifty so desperate for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only at point forward and he joined Narragansett\nAh also I just spoke with um judge Robert Flanders who is is\n... you know running a good race he's taking advantage of the situation in Washington as well with the last several weeks with the Kavanaugh case he has gotten a boost from that he mentioned and he is taking on Senator Sheldon Whitehouse\nUm we that race is um you know it's very very difficult to\nRun against the big names in our state that everybody knows and they go out to all the different\nYou know senior centers in events and they're very familiar faces and their familiar names are for delegates are our representatives in Washington a judge Robert Flanders has a shot only in the sense that I think so many people paid attention\nAnd got involved on one side or the other of this cabinet situation and people\nYou know for a good amount of reasons but very invested in it and whether it was healthy for them or not\nUh they certainly did so um\nWe uh we we spoke with him he's getting a lot of mileage out of the gas bag comment I imagine that the gas bag meaning I'm Senator Whitehouse is\nQuestioning a judge Kavanaugh during the hearings which took off I mean my goodness he made it a Saturday Night live and every other comedy channel skit type of the situation ah doesn't it's not a good look for us\nAsked him to come on the program a couple of times since all this and he's either said that he was too\nI'm too too busy couldn't fit it in the schedule they said so we'll see I'm All right so Nikki Haley resigned as UN ambassador will stand by say listen this could be up until eleven o'clock so let me I'm replay again what was said last night with the president as he is meeting a reportedly meeting with Nikki Haley\nTurning in her resignation it seems a bit last night all the talking all over social media\nPeople were either highly offended that President Trump apologize on behalf of the nation\nTo Brett Kavanaugh and his family or they said it was well deserved and that mandated an apology so here I Want to hear a little bit from Brett Kavanaugh which was the big story yesterday last night into this morning and also President Trump\n\nTo Senate confirmation process was contentious and emotional\nProcess was over my focus now is to be the best justice so I can be a take this office with gratitude no bitterness on the Supreme Court I Will cease to be a force for stability and unity\nOn behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to read in search over to a family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nOr there's President Trump and then also read cabinet so what a good good week if you will\nFor well good week it's only to say for President Trump he gets his person in to the Supreme Court and at the same time and not even twenty four hours later he gets a resignation it seems from US ambassador Nikki Haley\nFor three eight nine seven seven six four three eight WPRI so we'll continue to follow that also coming up\nI'm reading in the channel six my uh old stomping grounds the Providence Journal\nAnd uh it seems like when I went public radio they're saying that I Believe they have poll numbers\nComing out uh tonight on different races so we're looking forward to that ah they're saying that at five o'clock they have simple results on the state of the races of Rhode Island governor and US Senate so we're going to keep an eye on that um\nYou know I I don't I don't know how much they did also speaking of polls came out yesterday that Joe ... independent candidate for governor who he was a highlighted last week is making what he'd build as a big announcement big announcement represent a Patricia Morgan\nUh giving him the endorsement he said he has done some polls he told a couple of reporters he's done his own polling and he was up into double digits over twenty percent now when they asked you know most of us say All right how did you go about the polling we see channel twelve does it with a certain company Joe Fleming an associates\nUm channel six is doing at the Providence Journal you hire people you go out and get specifics\nAnd you get samples etcetera but you've got to know where you're going when they looked at his uh Joe ... it sounds like he is a spending reports his campaign finance reports there was no pulling company listed so the question comes up well how did you do the polling how do you come up with the numbers and\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again the borders over one of them are brand new border states we're just one forty nine Vermont that's like one twenty nine Vermont flood of every dollar every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nAmbassador us she uh being\nTouted as one of the closest advisors to President Trump so we'll keep an eye on that as well I'm going to take time now to um give you a quick update on a couple of things while they're meeting in the oval office here at home\nUh yesterday we talked about the skating federal report on the D. C. Y. F. and I did get he brief a\nResponse from gene are among those people and so I'm going to put together that up some reason my computer decided to shut down um and it's my Korea who I say he's the governor going to react to this really bad report if you will\nAbout the D. C. Y. F. and he did give me a quick response by the way to DC way I've said I'm thirty three of the thirty six areas that were reviewed our D.C Wyeth is a feeling\nAnd they said well you know my take us five or six years and we won't get another report until then five or six years so that was alarming to me and so I just want to make sure that I give you the uptake 'cause it came four minutes after I got off the air and maybe took it that I don't think so hold on one second\nI got it here I remember when does people are have to find it I'm Sorry about that I Apologize my my computer did something funky William in Newport on WPRI Oh hi William\n... things are not working Hi William their yards or so that was in ... from Rhode Island public radio that actually went through right or\nGrillo dot ... people that that he deserves credit for that yeah but um I think you know is it ... it is based\nA lot right now I was you know you you thought they're kind of thing that you've got this dream team with Ken blocking Arlene Violet a robot died but you know I I just got to walk 'em if you would still you know that that is offered at work\nOr governor what was the ... and he said absolutely not that I'm the same offers been made all candidates that I'm curious if you could at 'em\nAll those other quote unquote furloughed dream team members if there was the only\nOffering their services goats real because it seems like um his campaign is now kind of bonding do a lot of um you know\nQuestionable facts and and and um you know that's a dangerous place for Joe to be you know the more that things come out that that they're sort of truth\nI'm more all the work putting your campaign so far but I washed away in these final week\nWell I'll tell you that can can block has said from day one that he has offered to every candidate and past governors that he he has offered help including the current governor so that is not\nA really anything new he didn't say he was going to ... exclusively work with anyone he's offering his I helped to everyone so he's been he's been repeating that for quite some time uh and I in yes all credit goes to and honest a reporter who dug up the uh the people were to say okay well if we have a pool than have to pay for it and you know how'd you how'd you come about it so will\nYou know we're gonna watch watch that as well and I will ask him about that I had Arlene violent on first when she mentioned she would be a wanting to work with\nA Patricia Morgan and I just had her on again and she too has said that she would be willing to work with any of the uh\nPeople that get into the office because she thinks the inspector general's position is so very important\nUm Yeah John ... died of town I had him on first two and John moved out of town and he said he moved down to South Carolina to afford a better life and um he ... he too has said that he would come back and he's he's a little bit more out of the mix only because he's out of state so I mean it has been talked about\nYeah no I agree I just I'm saying it from the perspective of there's a looks like Microsoft Word documents to me that's floating around that joke thriller campaign they shared and others have shared beggars thriller\nI'm real team and actually the joke shrill oh I'm a governor has already been elected and that sort of the members of the dream team you know um and just like the infertile polling quote unquote that went on with your drill oh if he was more about this whole deal is supposed to be very on the surface matter of fact\nI'm and these two issues to me are are somewhat dumped it because\nYou know yeah they're not entirely false because you may have been volunteers I Hope you bought stop and shop but does the idea that he wrote an internal old that are able to and then also being old would be very critical of the Fleming old um you know it just doesn't that belt\nWas like in his southern Rhode Island's from your luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit letter of Lincoln Lincoln Lincoln MTV I mean all new twenty aging Lincoln Navigator for Lincoln if there were against it on ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Tara Granahan", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "09"}
