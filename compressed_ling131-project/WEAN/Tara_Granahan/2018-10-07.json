B. R. O. one eight hundred three two one WPRI\nThis is a dirty the ghosts of legal tips and we're back on the VCR oh\nSo I'm Talking about cases I have a some interesting\nCases and and and actually there was a pretty interesting case it happened in one socket\nI'm so these are this uh individual owned a piece of property and one socket and at the time when they own the property they had a single family home on a lot and they know the structure which they eventually converted into an additional living unit so then there was sort of to a living houses\nOn two separate lots but they were one parcels so to speak\nAnd um they had applied for a homestead exemption now many municipalities don't have the homestead exemption for example the city of Cranston doesn't have a homestead exemption but one sock it they still had a homestead exemption which means that if you lived in the home you got a thirty percent break on your taxes\nNow the difference is if you live in your home and it is a two family home which means that has two or more living units in it\nThen you only get a ten percent homestead exemption\nAnd so that's what happened they were assessed attempt percent homestead exemption so they appealed that decision and said well wait a minute we should be receiving the thirty percent homestead exemption and matter of fact the court came back and said yes so what is said yes you get the thirty percent so what does this really mean\nThis means when you get your tax assessment if you are not being assessed correctly the general laws have a very specific time frame\nTo either appeal that assessment or to argue it and if you fail to do anything than you are accepting their decision now in this case the court came back and said well wait a minute\nThere was a single family home in a single family home as it's defined by the one socket zoning code and therefore\nIt they should be entitled to their thirty percent exception because the ten percent only applies if there are two or more within one building\nAnd so that was an interesting thing so you know all the tax bills recently came out everybody got their tax bill in Rhode Island and Massachusetts they usually get issued around this time of year\nAnd most people have paid their first quarter taxes without thinking about are they getting the correct exemptions on their property\nAre they getting the adequate um assessment is the valuation correct\nYou know you have the right to ask for review of all of those things and if you don't then it's essentially wait so this is just kind of a cautionary tale put something to think about\nMaybe next year when you get your tax bill look at it make sure that it's correct in that you're receiving the proper exemptions for your municipality\nAlright another case now this case was in actually in Lynn field Massachusetts and this one had to do with uh the rise of the so called air BNB Sophia\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and super all have in common they are all in for Steve for your own condition at Fort Fort and he's written a generic as if that's right over two hundred free on cars all makes all models and incredible prices are going to flood autos on job now\nOn their town to have all of these homes be rented on a day to day basis and so for example and link field Massachusetts or they amended there are by law says zoning code so to speak to say that single family homes\nCan't do short term rentals um and without specific permission from the town and now so this homeowner said well wait a minute\nI should be grandfathered because I was already doing it\nAnd so you know a lot of people have this question they said well I I grandfathered aren't I grandfathered me I Know you've heard this before and the reality is that\nI'm a grandfather right is a um let me explain it this way or let's say the zoning code was enacted in Nineteen Ninety and in Nineteen eighty you had\nA house that obviously didn't conform to the new zoning code so they would say that that house is grandfathered which means that you they're not going to make it tear it down because they enacted a new law\nHowever in this particular case\nThere was no um provision in the zoning code for a single family home to actually\nUh do short term rentals and so they were not grandfathered and so the town zoning code was enforced now I Know a number of towns in Rhode Island have done this all so I think Narragansett in Wakefield have also enacted similar provisions regarding short term rentals and\nUm and so this is coming coming er into courts now in other words people are starting to make legal arguments to a contest the enactment of the certain zoning codes and and so in this case and Lynn feel Massachusetts it was a ... their appeal\nWas struck down or they were not grandfathered and I think that case will resonate\nThroughout mass and throughout Rhode Island to the extent that folks who have single family homes when the minister Paolo the men's their code to say you can't do short term rentals that\nOh you are not grandfathered have short term rentals and your property so just an interesting case again something that touches many different aspects\nOf our lives so in talking about that in and talking about neighbor issues um another case that came to light had to deal with a nuisance case\nRighty so when we're talking about nuisance and we're talking about issues with land and neighbors I'm a nuisance is a very specific area of the law\nAnd I'll explain that to you so if you're in by the way if you're listening and you need the number the number here is four oh one for three eight nine seven seven six oh one eight hundred three two one W. P. R. O. and of course if you're listening ambassador Rhode Island I Am licensed in ... Rhode Island in math\nAnd I'm here to help you if you have questions about anything I'm Talking about or anything in general like ... had a question about a car accident and another gentleman had a question about a trust so these are questions and things that come up on a regular basis\nSo this was another Massachusetts case and it had to deal with\nA person who started composting him recycling on their property and they have a sneaky suspicion that the neighbors began to complain to the municipality and the town said you have created a nuisance and so what is a nuisance and and how does it affect you in other words what what do I mean by that word\nI'm generally a nuisance is when for example your neighbor decides to start composting large sums of a waste so to speak and and obviously you feel it's an unreasonable use of their property\nAnd also it's causing you distress in other words it's interfering with your enjoyment of your property\nIn that situation you have the right to say hey my neighbor has created a nuisance now this could be ... in commercial contacts with\nWith a um a commercial property with a commercial owner or it could be residential\nAnd in this particular situation the town said hey you have created a nuisance\nSo what is the exception to that and the classic exception is for example you see a golf course and they're developing this Gulf War so they're selling lots on the golf course and you buy a lot of land to build\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month floods every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nAnswer that paperwork you have to respond otherwise you get the fault in you know I'm I'm In court all the time and I see this people sued\nBy these debt collection companies and they never respond they just never responded so they get all these wage garnishment and judgment leans in attachments against them personally and you know and that's\nThat just makes everything worst you have the right to defend yourself you have the right to speak up and you have the right to get your own attorney to do it for you and and and especially if you own real estate or us assets you never want to let those things go on checked\nIn especially in that case so you know ... you know this goes both ways so if you are in business and you're listening to me you certainly should make sure you review all of your contracts because businesses can get impacted significantly when they're doing interstate\nA contractual work All right so that was an interesting issue and I hope maybe that cleared up some things for folks who are going through that and going through that very similar issue now if you're dealing with something and you have a question the number here is four oh one for three eight nine seven seven six or one eight hundred\nThree two one W. P. R. O. and um [noise] how much time do we have before next break Mr producer you got about four minutes four minutes running it's hot all righty so it's time for KOSU yeah plenty of time for the call so\nI'm going to talk a little bit about probate for a couple of minutes and the reason why I'm Talking about this is a nice again these are issues so\nA lot of people have been calling me and asking me um you know so and so passed away why use probate necessary in other words [noise]\nAppropriate is like a a creature of real estate and uh so people kind of look at me when I say that and they say well what's that going to do with real estate well because when you pass away if you own real estate\nOr and you want to sell that in other words you're beneficiaries your survivors want to sell that real estate the only way they're able to convey good title\nIs if there is a pro big so what happens let's say I own a piece of property and I are inadvertently pass away now how does that property get out of my name into my children's names or into somebody else's name\nThe way that happens is my person who's going to be representing me or my probate would filed the necessary paperwork with probate court ... court would approve it and once it's approved\nThen that sale could take place and that creates a chain of title in other words so that the real estate closing attorney a oh a which I have done about almost forty seven hundred real estate closings four thousand seven hundred\n... will look for that paperwork to make sure that there is a clear chain of title so that they can ensure that the buyer is actually receiving what they think they're buying\nAnd that's the purpose of probate so you know hottest windows probate become a burden on your ears when does it become a burden on your family\nIn this particular circumstance I'm going to give you two are diverging patch of what could happen\nNumber one you pass away without it will number two you pass away with a will okay\nSo let's say you pass away without a will and you own real estate\nWhat's gonna happen is the ... tends to get a little bit complicated the reason why is in addition the filing the probate notifying the a division of taxation notifying all the parties that need to be notified in addition to that\nIf you want to sell real estate and you pass away without or will\nThere is a process in the pro big court in that process requires your attorney to file a petition with the probate court for permission to sell the real estate it requires you\nOr your executor to obtain a appraisal it requires a and also to go through this very specific process to sell the real estate now obviously that\nAdds a lot of cost to appropriate\nThe other process is if you die with the will if you die with a will most wills are written with what's called a power of sale and what that means is it means that your executive or or your administrator automatically has the right to sell the ...\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model what pays more than anything around because we're a certified buying center at will buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nYour family a lot of aggravation a lot of grief and a lot of money which obviously that's the whole idea of leaving something to somebody is not to leave them nothing is to leave them something and to make sure that they're able to manage it\nSo having a will is so imperative and so important because it will just help your family what ... what is already a terrible process [noise] um it just because you're dealing with the death of a family member but also help them through a process to own complicates things already\nSaid this is attorney Steve living ghost of legal ... let me come back

company crew would go on fantasy island that's a that's why we got going on here we have you know the the real estate insiders and um [noise]\nGod forgive me what's the name of your shows too [laughter]\n[laughter] where do you think it's a\nLegal chips legal tips I should note that Steve you know what you were talking about today I'm Sorry you called me how can I help you sir\nYes first of all I Want to say you know I'm I Know you've been doing this a lot longer than I Am in spite of great service all your listeners and so on everybody out there listening to make a pick up the phone and\nAll the well I Know you've got a good thing about them\nYou guys are too nice to me you know he's making me blush over last night\nBut I Do have a question for you all um I'll ask questions or maybe you can talk about it and I'll I'll get off on so my question is I thought I thought a lot of clients come in recently we're meeting with the age you\nWant to charge them up on mark\n... hundred thousand eight hundred dollars and I didn't know if this is a recent trend in\nThe real estate industry or am I missing something I don't remember that being a well and I don't know if you want to talk about that and I'll just put off or\nIf you could stick with me if you want but um you know it's something that you can in real estate you can charge any way you want as you know it's all the negotiation\nSo this has been available to agents for a long time I know there's one particular company in the area that tends to do this and the first reaction of agents and a\nConsumer's a lot of times are to say well that doesn't seem fair you know to have to have to pay this upfront fee but then I look at it\nIn ... in I think you know if I'm a consumer\nWould I rather paying upfront fee and maybe pay less in the long run well maybe I Would I Would enjoy that ... that um relationship it's no different than if somebody's coming to do some carpentry work on your house and they require a deposit or something like that I'm\nSure I think well what was walk problem well we're so we don't get me that\n... group wants your car any make any model what pays more than anything around because we're a certified buying center at will vie yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nAgencies and different agents are trying\nTrying out different things I Will say that um one thing that consumers need to know is if they hire an agent that doesn't have the money to do the things necessary to get them their house sold and for the for the best uh for the best amount of money in the best terms\nYou know they're in trouble you right so a lot of these newer agents they might not\nPay here here's a story for you Steve I spent\nA year of my life counseling these people on how to prepare their home for sale okay it was like a fight every step along the way it was a fight to get them to do the things that I thought they needed to do to get the money that they wanted for the ... so I met him I get them to do all this stuff\nI facilitate with contractors that I Know to get them things done at a discount and stuff I hire stage or I hire a photographer a floor plan designer\nAssigned company I get it all put together and then these people still were questioning how much I was going to make on the transaction and then they wanted to add\nA thirty thousand dollars for the price of the home that we we kind of\nWe're targeting before so I just said you know what I'd rather just walk away from this now I pulled my signed pulled my pulled off I staging pulled everything but guess what I'm Out all that money 'cause I don't charge in upfront fee I only charge I I only charge when I'm a\nHave made a successful sale so I can understand why people would want to charge that upfront fee 'cause I'm I'm I'm losing a thousand bucks plus Ross my time you know um\nSo I get it but\nThere are predatory agencies out there and a lot of them are trying to I won't say a lot of them I you know what I Apologize a very limited number of them are trying to get is much out of a client is they can get without necessarily providing value\nThey they provide a perceived value which they're very good at at illustrating but they're not providing actual value and so we see them ... tried to charging upfront fee\nUm if they don't get that that's fine but you know they just try they try it they'll report it maybe once if the if the client pushes back harder than they won't they won't go for that then they go next for the over market\nRate that you know there's\nCommissions aren't regulated but there's a general consensus what what the value of an aging is you know there's a high end and there's a low in and it depends who you get and what what value they're providing\nBut these agencies you know first they go for that upfront fee then they go for the high the high rate and they're just\nYou know they're trained they know you're going to say no here maybe they know that you're going to give them a second no but they feel like by the third time they've won you down and they're still going to get a more competitive the do you follow me so\nI yeah and and and so you know I Know\nI I think people here that when they retained a real estate agent to do the service that just seems to me is just a consumer that look on your mission with somebody and that the commission's here and be\nLike fifty percent but I Know that some people only care like one and a half percent or five percent for themselves and it but does it went back to ... somebody wanting to work with\nYou so you know Steve I Would rather get\nA smaller percentage but a higher fee so if I'm a cooperating agent on a on the other thing I don't care what the listing agents getting I kinda I'm more concerned with what they're paying me but the reality of today's real estate market is as buyers agents we should be negotiating\nWith the with our buyers and then try to work that into the sale like like you would a closing costs credit\n... you know for a more hours because you know and I don't know if you listen to me a few weeks ago like I have a big problem with the sellers said dictating the terms of condition I mean in terms of commission to the buyers agent because of buyers Egypt has signed\n... not only a fiduciary responsibility but ... a full responsibility for their client and\nSo they shouldn't be tempted or lead in another direction by somebody offering them a higher or lower fee than than than somebody else so\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai key a Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition at what point and he's written a generic Kansas that's right over two hundred free on cars all make all models and incredible prices are going to flood auto John John now\nAre real tours as well and if they're on and on the MLS system then they're required to be real tours\nNow you you go one step higher than a real chore or real estate agent and you are a broker and a broker is actually when when somebody from the public is engaging in a contract with a sales agent or a sales associate they're actually really\nFor signing a contract with the broker of the company so the broker um has a a higher level of experience\nAnd they've had to go through more class time and take a more difficult exam um and they oversee all the transactions of an office\nSo and I know I'm I keep going on here so trapped in the old days\nYou would the brokers name and I think this is still a law in the books but it it's being a\nIgnored by many people in our industry and the old days you had to have the brokers name larger than the sales associates name so everybody knew who the broker was and everybody knew who the person that they needed to talk to if there was an issue was\nNow you have a lot of these people I'm at ... there's a few companies that really\nTell the agents hey you run your individual business and go off and do your thing and we don't really care as long as you pay a monthly fee you know and I'm so those people kind of portray themselves as brokers they have their name up they're bigger than the name of the company bigger than their\nThe brokerage name and and but they're really not their their sales associates so\nUm that's it and I it's I\nThink well no [laughter] going critical for a lot of the market\nA little\nUm is and what the different responsibilities go under such they're all very important almost\nThank thank you you know it's it's a shame because we do have the board of realtors um that is out there to kind of\n[noise] well one thing that ... to police ourselves but it's also to promote us within the public and they do a lot of things to promote the realtor brand but they really don't do a lot of things to educate the public and they rely on the agents themselves\nTo educate the public but the truth of our industry is it's relatively ... you know there's people like me and my partner's Susan roles and many of the agents that I work with\nAt my office that we've been in you know you got into real estate in your state into real estate for ... through the good times and the bad times and then you have the people that are getting in like right now while they perceive it to be easy money even though that's changing but they perceive it to be easy money so they are jumping in and then they're going to be out again\nThey're not really God Bless them that they're going out and trying to make a living and and I appreciate all the new agents that I Wish them all all you know a great career um but they don't know it all you know they need somebody else needs to be\nLetting the consumers know what's going on you know what I mean I think as an industry that we should do that but in the case of William Stewart we work closely with our new agents and we try to keep them well educated and we try to work with them on their individual transactions so that\nThat the consumer is getting the experience of us but they're getting the hunger and the and the hustle of a new agent so anyway\n[laughter] value at Martin\nThank you I Try to just be totally legit I've been the sales for me are going to follow if I just am an honest with you guys I you know there's a certain number of you that are going to call me when you when it's time
