that people are trying to piece together or\nA you know figure out exactly\nWhat the intention was I'm getting this email over to\nTo DC a channel twelve that's what started this whole situation representative ... should be coming out she is an elected official she is running again and I'll tell you there are plenty of women up at the state house I can run them down and will even count down how many that no one's coming forward to talk about this\nMore allegations of sexual harassment at the state house and we're going halfway we're stepping halfway up one split on the stair\nOf the state house and we're not completing it so if there's more you know tens initial story said he spoke to at least a dozen people said well we know all about this so there's some big problem with slimy behavior up at the state house where are the women not coming forward\nWhat is happening up there and didn't Smithfield and we'll hear what the speaker had to say this morning with gene high end\nYeah I'm just I'm just curious why it takes so long form in the ... or\n... well ... okay this here's the problem that\nIf she didn't come forward and if nobody helped her out because there's a big power play up there and it's an old boy's club up there and everybody's protecting their guy that's a major problem\nHowever if it was to people who just couldn't get along in and he bought the hell out of her or he was condescending to her and she's a younger woman and she she said you know what speaker can you handle this because it's he's driving me nuts and they thought they handled it well she needs to say that you write\nYeah but but the problem here is to that it it could be blackmailed it should go blackmailing them why what is it OK before and not okay now\nWhat what's okay not none of it's OK well apparently\nWhat their Chevy junior ...
