in the city of Providence I saw\nIt's ... it's tough to intervene with a private negotiation a school bus company and the drivers and the union leaders um the mayor's trying I'm going to give him credit when it when it's deserved I'm going to give them credit he's trying so the ... a city council president David Salvatore also Nick human had come on the program\nHe's the chairman of the board of the provenance schools\nI've been in the meantime who's lost and the shovel are the kids and especially the children with special needs their parents are ripping their hair out this uh on what is is a Democrat once on the\nLine how many days as a van dam they can strike yeah\nYou know after a while you you now they're you know you're almost to the point where you're you're in it\nWhat is your Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve we own condition and what board and he's really Janeiro against white over two hundred dollars all makes all models had incredible prices log on to flood Otto John John now\nOf the other stuff that he talked about yesterday was searching for a new company he is saying basically he is offered some money from the city taxpayer dollars to um to throw into this deal to try to get a deal to and it would likely be adding money to the to the contract that the\nCompany has that would then somehow end up going to the bus drivers in some form or fashion and so what is the deadline is is\nYou don't get a deal done by tomorrow that offer is off the table so that doesn't that that's all that he's saying for a deadline and anyway\nOkay I got you there so we'll see what happens we'll see how that shakes out easier said than done I'm also you moderated was that your first debate the other night you\nKnow what it was the first one of the general election I did one I did one in the primary between ... and his two opponents\nBob to Rubio and Kobe Dennis and so this was the first time we had a a duty Whitman and and a ... kind of facing off a a with a good crowd about a hundred and fifty people a downtown that were in the room\nOr to have I have a small complaint yeah it didn't get enough coverage right now what the heck the mayor of prominence and dating I heard put up a good show and she had good salient points and I hear you did a fantastic job\nWell thank you very much uh I thought the ... you're right I I think in the journal covered it I Believe they had a story in the paper yesterday but um and I think\nI don't know that we've confirmed this but I Believe we are trying to having newsmakers debate between a ms Whitman in in ... but you're right yeah I think ideally women came out she was fiery she was she\nShe was ready to go she had you know her facts and figures lined up and was ready to really make a case that the mayor has not done a strong job and his four years and that the city deserves an alternative and the mayor was\nUm on his on his and was in a place of a you know trying to defend his record kind of trying to brush off the attacks from uh from ms Whitman but uh it was it was interesting it was an interesting experience to say the least\nAnd I would imagine damage from channel twelve I Would imagine I'm ... the school bus driver came up and what was there if they if you had to give us an opposite some their answers I think he's obviously in the second that so he's saying well we're trying to private situation what was her take did she have a some kind of a solution if there is one\nIt was a it was more of a I Would show leadership this wouldn't happen under my watch kind of thing um and and that's of course what what a you know a candidate who is not privy to every you know\nBit of details it's going to say because the truth is there's not a lot that the mayor can do I think the mayor tried to make that case um but you know and it's refreshing when you have a an opponent sitting there and saying you know what maybe you maybe you couldn't get it done but I could and but there wasn't exactly a plan in place and by any means\nI'm Kim Kim we also um he mentioned didn't mirror Lewis who said that he would he would abolish ice meaning the immigration department you know when they come in the sea well legally\nHe says so the question though what I did I tried to copy off of my uh my veteran colleagues to wait until they see and I gave them you know kind of the quake hit her questions yes or no ground speed round right and and one of the questions that I stole for exactly from the Senate debate was if Congress you know tried to abolish ice which is a you know a a there is\nI Would say a little bit of momentum building at least send the far left of the Democratic party for that uh idea\nSo I said would you would you support Congress attempting to abolish ice and ms Whitman and and the other independent candidate Jeffrey ... said no ... uh I was surprised actually said yes and I'll tell you I was surprised because I had already I'd been in the debate and the tapes debate of\nSheldon Whitehouse and Bob Flanders and they had both said no so uh the mayor is kind of stepping away a little bit from his own party in his own senator I'm In a lot of ways\nYeah I I I was surprised to read that as well um so he he may have to do a little follow up on that in order to explain his stance on Iraq and then also the city's finances you know the ... gets bounced around Murtha said he go bankrupt and that's the average person sitting there saying we don't want us to a point where you would support it in more ways than one if he goes bankrupt we did that come up as well\nIt did yeah as you know specifically it always comes up in the context of the pension problem and so we talked a lot about the province water system which is the mayor\nOr or or Mr ... Whitman both oppose in ... uh the mayor gave kind of what he he he's talking point that he always gives which is that's fine if you don't like it but show me a different option\nUm and and so they debated about that but you know none of the freaking\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model what pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center and we'll buy yours even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough\nWriting in going on camera\nCrying saying you know it's just so bad for my child ... they've got to get back into school if the parents of children with special needs and she said there's no problems going on now is no problem everyone's fine we talking about let's listen to that again\n\nBut we have about the kind of the students and we're having troubles with that and the rest of it is to cities responsibility to make sure that these kids are kept safe and brought to and from school\nRight now so we have no problems with is she talking to this is what I Can't I haven't talked about\nWe've been we've been so caught up with the ... you know the stooges are the the actions of stew jury of the state house and fights from the Nineteen seventies and we get all caught up in this nonsense in the meantime there are major issues happening the provenance school bus strike should have been handled days ago\nDays ago finally the mayor comes out and says All right we'll buy tomorrow if you can't get it together two sides you know we're gonna have to go around your will find a different solution there really isn't one so I don't know those words kind of ring hollow and then the governor says there's no problems listen I don't know about those those kids in Providence it's almost as if she could care less\nCould care less here the parents listen to the parents governor's office\nI Know you're there I I Know you've got some good people in there don't say there's no problem listened to these parents here listen\nMy mom can listen to me and she says to me mommy why is this is not coming to get me it's\nIt's very hard and um my my son in law school he has lots of friends everyone down to the janitor loves him and I just know more interruptions as when I'm asking for and I just think that the school system needs to do a better job than what they did\nOkay so they're crying they're they've got issues right there there have handicapped issues are they learning disabilities and to say we have no problems here day ten third weekend of this bus strike it says if they're hearing nothing\nYou can't ignore a problem you can't ignore for two years people standing outside in line for your benefits I just got an email I think a daycare for adults with handicaps or just just shut down\nAnother one a nursing facility if you will because they couldn't hold on any longer because of the payments from the state aren't coming in I don't I'm I'm trying to check it out fruit he'll daycare center did it shut down for people with dementia and other problems because they couldn't hang on any longer\nThis is this is the problem we're going into this election and we're talking about the stupidest things somebody slap somebody a back in the Nineteen seventies or someone poke someone in the eye\nOr somebody at a car accident when they were a kid a teenager and you and and the rest of the vulnerable people vulnerable excuse me people in the state of Rhode Island are hanging on by a thread and no one seems to give a flying you know what\nOh there's no problems 'cause if I Know they're not fight\nDaycare center ... uh assisted living centers no payments still coming in shutting down did the fruit he'll daycare center and it's not for children by the way for adult daycare or with dementia and so in other situations such as I Believe it was run by nuns\nDid that shut down again I'm already rather\nI mean what a shame I how does the governor get away with saying there's no problems here when parents and kids in rallies and all kinds of things are happening around the city of Providence I don't get it you can't say you don't know so it's either you don't care\nOr you're going to ignore it and let me please dear God keep Alan ...
