good morning everybody\nWalk them through intellectual medicine is Dr federally along with shining on a beautiful October day here in New England special show today Sharon and we've got some exciting things on top Dr David ... going to be a ...\nHe's a a good friend and colleague one of the states for most ... disease expert experts and he's going to give us his opinion\nAn important question too many of our patients out there should I should I not get the flu shot what are the risks and benefits\nAnd you know we may even tap into his expertise shed and for his knowledge about the should goals are immunization so is this worth getting or not and the whole concept of immunizations in general and immune function in general something that we can touch upon\nWell I had a um I was at a football game last night watching high school football one of my joys in life and\nSomebody asked me a question that I felt was compelling set of all the things you do and intellectual medicine of all the anti aging modalities what's the big breakthrough we talked about I Am one twenty this whole concept the aspiration the hope\nAnd building a life towards one hundred and twenty year lifespan know some have criticized for being so bold as to or from such a a objective goal\nAnd and I refute that criticism in this manner you\n... group wants your car any make any model flood pays more than any Taylor around because we're a certified buying center had will vie yours even if you don't buy hours logged onto our car buyers tough\nNow to intellectual medicine was done but it was only now once we want we want to wear\n... federally had intellectual medicine along with Shannon plus next we'll be Dr David low infectious disease specialist can hospitals for good friend and intellectual colleague a renaissance man\nHe's publish books spoke has spoken in a wide range of topics if you ever need Dr lows services David you know you know I Love you but this is a true statement\nIf you ever need Dr you've had a bad day [laughter] I had a bad week I'm not sure I trust what I say to say [laughter]\nYou know 'cause you're staring up at a hospital bed I could tell you when when I was doing hospital medicine or Dr lo was the doctors doctor he's the guy that would come in when the patients were getting more ill\nAnd the complexity escalated and I'm David thank you for your years of service and all the patients and doctors should help and thanks for being on my show\nBut um so so we got a dive right into this um a lot of my listeners Dave are a little bit skeptical about flu shots you know we've we've all been hurt we've all been talk that this is something that should be done\nBut there is a little bit of a well tell me about this year's flu shot right because isn't this our best guess we don't know if it's gonna work what's it look like this year\nI'm well I'm a vaccine uh it seems to cover the current prevalence strains of which means I'm\nWay back ah last January February march I started studying things over in Asia with flu vaccine\nWith flu starts right they they pick out a three ... three straight up to two strains that they think are gonna be common in one strain of they write this year they have two strains of eight which is a more serious form of flow which causes\nA mortality ... death right\nAnd a two strange to be in the in the in the corner villains\nWho just to summarize the study what's happening in Asia because what's happening now it's going to hear\nIt starts in Asia but they study all over the world right on and they are but what the usual thing is by by last march they've already made that made up their mind what they have to include in the vaccine because it takes a while to produce the vaccine\nSo by march of two thousand and Eighteen ... uh they've got to have this dial then because they have to make it in time to get it to market right and the challenges I understand it with the viruses is that um they can mutate and the prevailing strained can change\nAnd consequently it's certainly not a hundred percent um\nAh effective that would be absurd nothing is um but tell us a little bit about um about this concept of what's called herd immunity you know everybody's encouraged to get immunized\nSo that the society at large will be less likely to to spread the shot and spread the the flu around right now than ever been proven to be the case\nA herd immunity um\nApplies to all vaccines um\nBut you have to understand with flu it's a little bit different we vaccinate all the people in nursing homes right there's still enough because of their age their immunity isn't great on the other vaccine match isn't great people can get the flu I think the thing that I Want to emphasize more than anything else\nWhen you say oh last year's vaccine was only forty percent effective right if we have fifty sixty percent effective that's a good year and now that's across all ages\nRight older people will have a much lower effectiveness than younger people because their immune systems not as good you know when they say it's not affective it means you can still get the flu British prevent\nSo people ask me this question a lot you know should I get the flu shot or not\nYou know my my impressions of ... in my my guidance is that if something is is known not to cause you harm that is you can do it you've done it in the past it doesn't hurt you and there's a possibility of benefit well the the the\nHow would you like motor trends twenty eight gene trucks with the here for only one Ninety nine per month we'll say hello to forge twenty eight gene Ford F. one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars from us only a flood forward in eastern enjoying Narragansett\nHealth care providers are accountable to get a flu shot so they diminished the risk\nOf being a doctor that is transmitting it to the sick patients that the sea correct I'm if I'm John cue citizen and I'm thirty five years old I may not feel the need because I'm pretty resilient but folks if you're around old six people people their ability to mount a defense is really do is really diminished\nAnd it it may be more incumbent upon folks in that circumstance you've got an elderly parent living with your whom you visit\nTo go ahead and take one for the team but have you ... have you seen much negative effect from the flu shot do you get the opportunity to these patients and talk to them about their historical response to see many people saying I gives me a cold that gives me the flu\nRight there are three things one is\nEven when they say you had the vaccine is only forty percent effective it means of getting influenza right but you don't die of influence the real purpose of the flu vaccine to me is to prevent serious influenza\nThat can result in death right if you go to the CDC website and look at the ten most common causes of death you will see that a pneumonia and the influenza like illness will be will be up there\nRight so we know the flu or claims lives not only lives of the elderly Indian for him but tragically on occasion the young and healthy right now we ...\nWe lost two hundred kids last year\nTo children last year from now was that proven influenza was that just influenza like symptoms\nWell Dell you this there are different ways you're dive influence right\nYou get a primary influence or pneumonia and die of that right you can get influenza and then get bacterial pneumonia afterwards and die of that\nSo the venues the flu can we can your immune system and open the door for the bad things to happen\nRight now and and the young people and you see sometimes old people because that had strains of influenza from the past uh more immune than young people so it's not just a question of age right\nOld old people if they get the flu it worse but their immunity to certain strain says may be much more than younger people\nWrite ... or ... um viral logically naive when it comes to some of the strange so repetitive you exposure repetitive as long as you can build a ... not as many old people\nJust if you get a flu shot every year year after year is there any evidence that you're going to build up cumulative immunity and make you more resilient later life\nNo well it gets you some immunity but that flu shot immunity on only last for that season\nHow long does a flu shot last for\nIt varies from the individual ... I ... I Would ... anywhere from three months to a year\nSo up to three months on the short end up to Europe so long and she got the time the shot a little bit based on when the peak season's going to happen when I get my flu shot in August September October by November there can be waning David have you had your flu shot yet\nOh you bet and are you going to get a booster later in the year\nYou know that's that hasn't been from some of the doctors to give a booster and there's a new ah extra strength vaccine for older folks like myself\n[laughter] that's we've got a little while while I'm getting nervous about that and I don't know where the Denny's special happens now\nAt a reason why I don't give specific recommendations because a large studies haven't been out but I'll probably taken next year\nBut but I wanted to find old age for the moment ... ... what his old age for these boosters of the extra strong shot is or is there a line in the sand\nOr they generally say as you are over age or a sixty five or so\nI had I'm good I'm Still young I'm going to say on what about you I'm sure that people over fifty five now\nSo I got tired of behind the glass here day but he's a young healthy guy Tyler do you get a flu shot every year\nYeah I'm here I haven't got one yet but not every year\nAll right how 'bout Dave how about the uh the drugs for flute I'm very honored and press let me let me our caller our conversation with my opinion first that I'm very unimpressed by ... I think it's over hyped drug with very little merit I'm\nTrying to make it I've seen really good results from it you\nKnow if you take it late in the course of the disease or if you're a healthy person that's getting over the flu and you have a mild case\nUm\nAnd you take it after forty eight hours you won't see much of an effect but at the at the first sign if you know you have the influenza

drugs like that are worth the effort\nWorthy of it especially if they reduce they do redo illness\nNow look I got to tell you though the Cochrane review was not favorable they said that there's no evidence of decrease hospitalization or no evidence of decreased deaths\nAnd that the studies they criticized as being publication bias promoted by the company the only thing they affirmed was maybe you're going to get one day less of symptom but you got to take it within twenty four hours of getting symptom that takes you that long just to get through your doctor on the phone well\nBy the way he
