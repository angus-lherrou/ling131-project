slipping behind with that Diane centuries of tech expert over Johnson and Wales stony Diane morning you know this I pay a pro it's up to like two thousand dollars if you want the extra memory\nAnd a couple of the gadgets and there's a lot of money for an eye patch\nBut it's got some uh different aspects and it's got some difference conveniences and they've definitely uh improved on the design on so you know to to take a look at you got better battery life it's going to be faster and dinner and more storage\nNow home button face i._d. that teaches security chip integration so you you've got some unique\nUm connections to the iPhone ten um where a lot of the things that were happening in the tenor now converting into their other you know the computers\nYeah this was a facial recognition

work remember passwords\nExactly and you've got also the improvement on the edge to display which they did a earlier with the iPhone ten so you know you you got even though the size of the same you've got more um you know visual space in front of you can work with\nNow the Mac book which is they're going to stand by bread and butter computer they got around to the spicing not pick up a little bit correct\n[noise] they did it it has written a display um you've got again that the security check they focused also on how it's recyclable they really\nFocused on you know how uh the devices or become greener uh with the aluminum a connection but yeah you're going to see you know faster up probably thinner and more storage again just the improvement to the device or as a whole\nOn internally and

you can work with\nYou know for all of them in apple ... whenever they holding the vent it is an event because they have such an impact on tech we have yet to see a big big breakthrough device we haven't seen that in years it's a lot of retooling of what they had\nI mean other than the I watch which has been out now for a while I haven't seen something really really big view mind missing something\nNo but again there I mean I'm sure that the whole retooling and and respecting and so forth that takes a lot of time and effort you know they probably being very cautious on that\nUm but again you know they've let consumers know that yes they are invested in improving their computers and you know the eye patch so you know going forward they're going to focus on that as well as just the phones\nFor good science and tore over ... billion ... it's the next eight twenty seven or eight thirty five how speaking ... first broadcast interview since this a sex scandal broke up on the\nUp at the state house with regard to sexual harassment and one rep saying something about another rep and emails or text or let's find out what the speaker has to say about this what does he know what when did he know and what does he want to do about it that's all coming up and make forty minutes of Massachusetts politics and the one she wants a second term but says I don't know I don't think I

story for news and Clark and associates Sandra needed an agent those up front with her the others that you interviewed were sugar coating thing she thought\nShe heard a lot of good things about news

step of the way she said I loved working with Nathan's team best of all rude island homes sold for over asking price\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood

clerk\nFor one two three two Seventy six sixty one\nHolidays are on the way are you from there you have when one thousand dollars of foreign times each week day for Fox News talk Ninety nine seven and I am six thirty WPRI\nUnlimited now there's a lot easier to digest let me go let me go a little bit with you and you're saying these two were friends before you assume the speakership correct yes I Know when you say friends\nWould they flirtation with each other well they got back on once in a light let me finish what they're going back and forth and kind of joking manner that she was okay with something he said and it was going back to anything to that ... or not no no no no\nI'm not suggesting no asking like not what I Would say is they work with tonic friends but very very very close I mean they were ... you know just think of a good friend that you have in the thing you would say to work with ... they were good friend cannot think nothing ... nothing inappropriate they were good friend\nAnd then something happened\nThat cause that friendship then then I kinda know generally you know very very generally with no specificity\nTell me what are you know what can you share with us what what what what was said well\nWhat I've always done is respected representatives 'cause area and desire to maintain her privacy okay I don't believe she wanted these facts they get out there so I Am not going to be anybody that that reaches that that privacy what I can tell you is\nEvery time she's come to me a foreign accommodation\nWe've accommodated her to her complete satisfaction um and and and you know what what I Try to do\nThings come up every once in awhile representatives argue every once in a while like every human beings do and what I always try to do is to separate and you know if you can work it out and get people to talk again\n... inappropriate level that's beautiful if you can't separate and that's what they've done in this day so there has been no contact between them except incidental when the role for about three and a half years\nSo they have a falling out and they're not friends anymore why would she puts sexual harassment for years in that email to you and did you say to her what is this about\nWell what I can tell you is when she came in when when she when she said that yeah um I I did find the phrase odd um\nBut she came in and she her concern was the legislative process and a bill that she had to have hurt people that you were to share it committed drunk you ever request was actually spent bleak when you move\nThe bill and I said I a representative I I probably refer to her as a eighty I Can't do that because we we've got thousands the witnesses that are going to be coming in and I you know it's not fair to the public to have spouses but witnesses comment on this stuff for a day so\nWhat the ... I you know I I gave it a lot of the law and uh I Would you know I wanted to make her satisfied so like I said okay how about that\nAnd I said I'll ask\nRobert champion cable to step down from the Judiciary Committee or the time that you're going to testify and the the vice chair will take over the handling of the committee\nUm and I spent a a ... my policy director when our body down with or to make sure that the process was appropriate and figure out what your was she was thoroughly satisfied I'm very happy with the combination that would be\nSo we're not getting from you and we never talk about anything else\nBut I'm getting from you this wasn't sexual harassment tree and you don't know why she put that in the email and are there any ...\nI went back and forth did you see the text\nNo absolutely not\nDo you know about I was there anything sexual and attached\nI I don't know what I heard they were taxed actually you know I I Know I Know that well I Do know that they pack back there for him\nHow would you like motor drenched twenty gene trucks will be here for only one Ninety nine will say hello to forge twenty more than once you get the best ruffled on fish fries anywhere you one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only a flood forward and he joined the only thing\nThat let me see I just want to you know how to be very clear on this ... this is a friendship that occurred\nOutside of the legislative process outside of the building it ... you know you can't manage friendship particularly when\nThey're at the end up part you know they're at dinner or or outside of the building on private All right so I Would say that their friendship was mostly out of the building I've never seen anything inappropriate in the building I don't know of anyone that has the editor than or hurt anything inappropriate and the build\nAnd why did you take people out of his leadership commission on a ... a position on the Judiciary Committee\nWell I've always respected representative a representative because they're in the right to privacy and that so I just left the status quo but\nUh now that now that it's public that's a major major distraction and it you know it's it's it's a concern that should get ... and well you know we'll see we'll see if their their their ends up being any clarity on this I Believe\nBoth parties are entitled to get all the facts out there if they want the balls there and that's you know I respect representative 'cause they're in a wishes whatever they may be that should control oh I Know I haven't talked to was asleep\nAnd those are ... she's a public figure this is politics she chose this life I have to go find your now and say it was a sexual harassment you two guys had a friend why did you write that in the email I mean who is am I correct in a reporter to take that stance I gotta go ask her now the speaker says it was a sexual harassment why did you put that because you may\nThink ... I I Know I\nI did not say that what I said if I don't know what the facts were she wanted to or has always wanted to maintain privacy housing is she did complain and I can tell you she was not happy but she did not wanna\nShe didn't want a public airing of that she wanted to maintain her privacy and I didn't believe respected that I still respect that and I I'm not going to give any particular regarding my conversations with her\nUh because I respect her privacy in her right\nArm to to to do whatever she thinks is in her best interest though that she wants to do this but I when I got the email this year in my mind it automatically reverted back to\nThe the the uh the beginning of my speakership in that original complaint because I Know for a fact is no contact than than you I mean the two of them\nYou know so it wasn't word it's super good for years I mean that that that's not that can't be the case because there was no contact between them All right now um\nThis was aimed at you somebody ... hold on let me just this was somebody leak that email to drag you into this a week before election who did that to you\nI I don't know but this is clearly it ... it wasn't released by representative cause area and in fact that I ... my opinion and I'm a I'm certainly\nNot never gonna speak for her but in my opinion she was victimized than this then I feel very badly about that for her um this this was clearly a shot and an attack on me or you know what the subject that extremely sensitive but I think we'll all agree on that I Would say that this is absolutely\nBe a lot of progress is behind this than there is people that are\nJust people that want to take over the legislative process so that the bacon run the state and uh I I I don't know exactly who it is but\nI've got a ... it it you know this is the reins election like looking I've got progress is down here supporting my Republican opponent I thought they would ... um ah they people\nJust want to take over the legislative process and the states that are in the progressive group\nI Am run I I'm I'm running out of time to speak when I Wish appreciate your coming on my final question just wrapping up in thirty seconds I understand you respect her privacy but this is the people's business\nWhenever she said it's out are you going to urge her to hold a news conference to make this perfectly clear so that we could wrap this up would like less than a week could be up to go to the election I think that's that's fair on the voters part she's got to come forward and tell us what is this\nNow I I I Would never do that if I respect her privacy and I respect that she does what\nWhat is your Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they're all in for Steve we own condition and blood for Denise religion Narragansett that's right over two hundred free on cars all makes all models and incredible prices logged on to flood Otto John John now\nA private friendship that had nothing to do with the legislative process nothing to do a legislative as they're not in eat or take ... occurred during the legislative process so I I think it it's a private\nFriendship that were bad in whatever way it did and I think she's in title for her privacy and moving forward however eating appropriate\nLast question and I I'm going to sneak one and I miss the speaker are there\nAny other shenanigans going on that you are aware of that are going to drip out do you want to get everything is there anything else that we should know about before is there any other people making obligations writing emails anything else\nNo absolutely not I and I I bet it is from one yesterday we we had a kind of a an interesting a\nStatement that are somewhat I was sexually harassed and um my me and my staff or Raleigh Raleigh encourage her to ... to ... the fact and um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "WPRO Morning News", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "31"}
