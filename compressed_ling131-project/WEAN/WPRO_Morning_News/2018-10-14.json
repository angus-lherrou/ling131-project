R. E. E. offer I said free offered today from purity products no strings attached\nThis is a free offer from a reputable company that's been in business for years just you need the phone number as soon as we tell you more about ha\nNow you see there's a youth molecule and the human body and then it holds the key the visible signs of age you know you've written about this you've traveled to Japan to do the research so so tell me about what is what exactly is this molecule you're talking about\nIt's amazing that most people don't know this word ... acid and of course it made its all over our body it's in our skin it's an all natural molecule we can get it\nHow would you like ... twenty eight gene trucks will be here for only one Ninety nine per month we'll say hello to forge twenty four fifty best run for the best friends anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars per month only one board and he joined us\nWhen we're babies we have what we call baby fat it's really baby H. A. it it makes a well as babies fall down and get cuts and scrapes you notice they never really get\nAny lifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board highly ironic gas it and to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate\nThat women have smoothing skin and thicker hair and so on all of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls have more limber flexible joints they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into that\nThey certainly have all of those advantages and it's because the estrogen sends a signal to make more ha now women have more ha to lose the men do\nAnd you see the skin shoveling up the joints and so on as women age but there is a way to get it back and of course purity products for years now has been talking about ha and they have a new formula just for the joints\nH A joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints took people are looking for alternatives we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray\nAll he's doing is measuring the space between the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an inch space without that cushioning\nYou've got bone rubbing on bone\nThat's what age eight is it's the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones we lose it either due to wear and tear or age\nAnd so we start getting problems the more that we find pain relief the more pain relievers we use\nThe more we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed this people who chronically use pain relievers are going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint\nAnd that's what ha does that's what ha is that doctors call it ... fluids they actually inject this into joints orthopedist do\nDermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so it's nothing foreign to modern medicine but it may be new to you as a listener there\nAnd you have never heard about ha before well\nYou need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplement\nPurity products was the first to introduce it now it's a great big long molecule path that six million Dalton's and molecular weight think of six million paper clips put together its big you can absorb it and purity found a way to knock it down so that it's only about Fifteen hundred to three thousand that means\nThat you can absorb this orally we actually proved that in studies conducted at the laboratory right there in Florida and we're going to tell you more about that but we proved that it's orally absorbed most doctors are told that oral ha cannot be absorbed that's true if it's the regular ha it's got to be knocked down\nIn molecular weight and more important it needs some other antioxidants to be added with that we're going to talk about one here in just a moment but purity products\nIs introducing this all new joint formula for people that are searching for alternatives for their joint health and of course this isn't a drug it's a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as as we think of\nYou just do we're talking with Bill ... acid or each you know bill you said there recently the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why ... such a breakthrough in what exactly can you do for people\nThink the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between\nAnd the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself vitamin C. makes college but within that college and there's a moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time\nAnd that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule ha the body is Seventy two percent water\nAnd as we lose this the connective tissue that connects all of our cells that connect all of everything that we have\nWhat is your Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve real condition and what more than ... religion or against the wind over two hundred three on cars all make all models incredible love onto what auto John John now\nSure all wonderful but they're not dealing with the origin of the problem the origin of the problem is the loss of cushioning and the joy and

author researcher an expert [noise]\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda Toyota and should we all have in common they're all in for Steve we own tradition at Fort Hood and religion are against it that's right over two hundred dollars all make all models at incredible prices on just what auto jobs now\nLeading me at the moment but even when I didn't get what I wanted God really was leading me and in fact leading me to apply several more times for the very same job\nEach time there was no\nAnd while it was disappointing each know compelled me to appreciate the good that was at hand and to learn to develop the opportunities that word before me\nI learned that actually that I can bloom anywhere I can bloom anywhere that God plants me and that was really a good and healthy lesson to learn\nNow the last time I applied I remember clearly asking God if I didn't even bother should I even try again\nAnd the intuition came to me than in following God's leading I should apply but that it was also safe to trust that God was leading others those whose job it is to decide if I get to do it or not\nAnd you know I never thought of that my focus has always been so narrow just on God guiding me and my really wanting to do it but that wasn't my decision God was leading me to apply and that was enough\nI felt the love and my heart I felt God's love for everyone in the decision making process I trusted them because I trust God to be guiding them so I applied and that time I was taken\nBut you know what I now know I actually would have been fine even if the answer had been no because I could see God was taking the lead and every single point\nIn hindsight I can see how different my circumstances where\nHow much better prepared I was somehow I wouldn't have had the same rich experience in that work\nHad I been taking any of those other times that I asked\nGod's dimes is such a precious thing to seek it's an invaluable thing actually to find divine good really is our best advocate a loving parent\nTo his children God demands the best for us and the best of us and I think that letting God take the lead is key to living a life of blessing and a life being blessed well Michele\nThanks so much for being with us today and for sharing your incite\nIt was a privilege\nI've been speaking with Michelle news a Christian Science practitioner and teacher based in Paris, France\n[noise]\nHello I'm Margaret ... a Christian Science practitioner for them to New Jersey [noise] I'd like to share an experience I had where I saw the importance\nOf listening to God's guidance and letting them take the lead\nAbout Thirty years ago my husband and I went from Boston to Cleveland for the weekend we drove over a two day period stopping overnight in Williamsport, Pennsylvania\nBefore we left the car had been acting up on occasion and it came to me it just it just to my husband that we rent a car for the trip\nBut he said no he was handed with cars and was able to repair it if necessary so it was not concerned I did not pursuit of matter further as I relied on his good judgment after all he was in the driver's seat\nJust this week to Cleveland the car began to show signs of trouble then when we left there we had not gone very far when it really began to ACT UP we had to stop every half hour and an oil and water\nSo we sort of left alone it was not an easy ride and I'm sure I had to turn to God and many times\nDuring the day I began to feel on well and when we stopped for the night in Pennsylvania I realized I was hemorrhaging\nIrish frightened and wished very much that I was home instead of miles away in a motel as a Christian Scientist it is my customers are trying to God and prayer in all situations and this was certainly needed now\nI don't recall specific thoughts that came to me but the basis of my prayer would have been the God is the only cause and creator and that man made Engle is his image in like this holy spiritual and good\nBasically I recall that I'd just lay still during a long night\nDid you go to our British break we'll talk with one of the nation where did you know reducing our best region horrors would you presented your where somebody too much you can be driving one aboard also models interest free mortgage you know\nAnd I knew that he was praying to there was never any suggestion that we should seek medical help\nIn the morning we began the last leg of the trip the physical condition hadn't I yield it but it was an ad for here as it had been the night before we still have to stop the car and replenish the oil and water about every thirty minutes\nBefore we left that morning he had stocked up on oil and water so that all we had to do was stop along the road as we got closer to Boston there were a number of places where there was no place that you could pull off the road and stuff but I was grateful to every time we needed a place\nAnd so we made at home\nAs we were riding along and I was listening for God's angel messages one came from science and health cue to the scriptures by Mary Baker eddy ended completely met the situation if mind is the only actor how can mechanism the automatic\nStage three Ninety nine\nThat completely wiped away the thought of any power apart from God\nNo power apart from God they've nothing beyond God's control not car and not the body I knew that was the healing and was we made it home and there was no further problem with the body\nWhat I learned from that experience was true absolutely trust the angel messages that come from God and to recognize that\nThey are angel messages and not human will my husband apologized for not taking my suggestion to rent a car but\nIt came to me that I couldn't blame him because I had not really recognized it as an angel message from God\nAnd so I had just sort of suggested it to him some\nYears later he told me that he had learned that whenever I said to him it has come to me that he always recognized that it was the result of prayer\nNot feeling well I think we both learned to really listen to God and to alert God the in the driver's seat\nThat was Margaret Wiley Christian Science friday\nFrom East Hampton New Jersey [noise]\nAnd with me now to talk about letting God take the lead it's Alina Simpson thanks for joining us today thank you well Lena I Know that you have come to expect God to care for you and direct your life\nYes and you know through my study of Christian Science and in prayer I found that we all can feel God's guidance at any stage and our experience\nAnd share or we can pray to feel God's guidance for the bigger things or the more major life decisions\nBut we also can feel God's guidance and the smaller day to day activities too and listening for God's guidance doesn't require human sense of maturity it doesn't matter what age you are older or younger\nI've learned that you know as we turn to him in prayer we find that it's only natural to listen for God's guidance interaction all throughout our experience\nWould you have some examples that you can share where you really not only listen for God's guidance but got a really great answer to\nIn my younger years I remember feeling impressed with the false adjusts than that I couldn't steal God's guidance because I felt I didn't completely no God and I began to pray daily to no God better I really urine to steal God's guidance and there was a\nTime in my experience where I was really praying to know where to go to college I had applied to sixteen different schools\nNot by choice but because I really didn't feel led to go to any of them so I just kind of wanted to put my options out and see\nWhere I felt led to go and I was sitting in my car and I just got this angel message it was so clear that they need to go visit this friend that was in another state it was very very clear\nAnd I didn't know why and I was thinking about it and I realized well I have relatives that live there and I had a family friend there that was a Christian Science practitioner and\nThat there should be junior ... urban almost ...

Murphy founded it feeding about forty to fifty men\nToday they serve over Fifteen thousand Rhode islanders under Eileen Hayes is leadership it's grown into a comprehensive social service agencies that includes Thirteen buildings a hundred and forty three residential beds\nCommentary and arts carpentry training programs a literacy program a financial opportunity center and three social enterprises while Eileen and what do you do in your spare time thank you for joining us and for having me about the mission of and the work of Amos house\nSo even as as you know did start as a soup kitchen but over the years we've really grown into social service agency whose mission is really to help move people from homelessness to house and from unemployed you employed and from instability stability both for individuals and families\nUm you've seen so much transformation during her tenure as CEO of Amos house what inspires you the most\n[noise] oh my goodness every single day I tell people that there is a tragedy but there's also a miracle and him and south and we get to celebrate the miracles of somebody who had absolutely nothing who now\nFeels like they have their life back they have their dignity back they may have the house they have a job you're taking care of their families and now they're giving back\nI don't know if you know this but more than half of our eighty five staff members were former homeless asked or graduates of our training programs so so our community is really at the love of community for people that um have\nRole models everywhere they look at they too can make their lives different and we're second chances\nIt also must make them feel well good as well because when people come to Amos house they see somebody either that looks like them yeah ... what can empathize with them and have been there and that also gives the person coming into in his house so yeah now I'm how did you expand from just being a soup kitchen at why\nWell because just feeding people or just providing night tonight shelter just isn't enough and we expanded really organically based on what people were asking for so I've been there for almost Eighteen years which is hard to imagine and when I got there [noise]\nUm we were in night tonight shelter and uh we quickly transitioned into a more intensive Ninety day treatment program that's recovery based a homeless folks can go to shelter but there's not a lot of places where they can get\n... group wants your car any more than anything else because we're a certified following center at will yours even if you don't buy ours are horrible your daughter\nDay reality but when you get to the salvation army you help your neighbors and need when the battle to cry\nWant to join this fight for good please visit Salvation Army dot listen and gifts dot org to make a donation that Salvation Army dot listening give dot org [noise]\nIf you're just joining us I'm even man Cousteau filling in for Deborah Gere oh I guess this morning is I mean have the president and CEO of Amos house\nNow Eileen um you've been there for a long time in teen years I'm doing amazing work and how has the client changed over the years\nWhen I first got there most of them men and women and families that we were serving food to were homeless and over the years we have seen in a major increase in the number of folks that are just not making ends meet so we have\nMany people who are working poor and they're eating with us to supplement their income\nWe've seen um lots of different immigrant come group comes through um different a large part a percentage of\nA Latino men and women and families and also some people that have been using us for their meals for the last Eighteen years and I see some of the faces others so when we first got there the thing about our soup kitchen is that it's not based on economics it's based on\nUm hunger and you can walk in that door and not you know in a business suit and eat or you can have nothing and eat and we don't ask for for income warehouse of hospitality we were founded by the sisters of mercy\n[laughter] that believed in so much like\nThe Catholic Worker model that we have to offer dignity and respect to people who were hungry\nThat was a that was my next question is um how do you get to eat at ... Amos house you just walk and yet\nWe serve breakfast Monday through friday from seven to eight and lunch from eleven to twelve thirty and uh we have a full breakfast in a full lunch or six days a week a game of the house and the church doesn't service on Sundays and serves an afternoon meals so there's meals seven days a week last year we served a hundred and fifty one thousand meals out of our soup kitchen\nAll my goodness wow and I thought I did a lot with how big Italian family that a lot of panic [laughter]\nYou also partnering with other social service agency I'm here so much about overlap and people doing the same thing and therefore cutting knowing down\nAbsolutely we compliment we work closely with crossroads we actually run a a literacy program in conjunction with crossroads\nUh we work with open doors and the Institute for the study and practice of non violence we have a partner with organizations around reentry work as well as around training unemployment\nAh we work closely with uh the coalition for the homeless were a member of the nation and we work with the um river wedding cat center in some of the other organizations that are working to house chronically homeless men and women the nice thing about the way we work together is that we do complement each other\nA those are some of those organizations are focusing on chronically homeless and providing a housing first model that says get people's house and then make sure that they get the services to stay house\nWe actually are recovery base which allows people who really want recovery to live in a community where they're safe because they're not involved with people who are maybe still actively using\nAnd I believe that we need to have all options available there's not one size fits all shore oaks so I think we've learned how to support each other and to work collaboratively and not compete because there's you know I Believe in ... in theory if there's enough support to go around if you're doing good work and there's enough um [noise]\nUm there's enough need for all of us to to figure out what part we'd do well and stick in our wheel house well\nI'm going to go out on a limb but because of the show is amazing women getting you know I'm thinking of some of the organizations that you mentioned and boy they happen to have women CEO\nLaid off so I'm sure the collaboration you don't even have to answer back I'm just as the host today I'm going to just step out there and say boy women collaborating together isn't that a great idea\nUm so what keeps you up at night what do you worry about\nBesides my children my grandchildren and [laughter] um\nWell there are definitely times when ah money keeps me up not having enough not being able to be sure that I'm going to be able to continue programs that they care about when I Know that somebody has relapsed and I get a call that they're out on the street I literally never turn my phone off I just turned it off of this\nThere should be junior ... Toyota and I've been there all in for Steve free old tradition of any religion that's right over to repeal drawers incredible versus do for a job at all\nFor in a different here I mean I'm a say and I'm very impressed\nBy I'm not even going to go there [laughter]\nOkay so you exercise a lot I Do and so we have on other\nI pray [laughter] yeah I got that idea you know\nWhen I'm In my seat it's just want to have to get out on the treadmill\n[laughter] and you know I also\nThink that um I really truly believe in a strength based model that we absolutely incorporate ... that really believe in people's inherent capacity to do the best they can when they're given the resources\nSo it's not about me and it's not about my staff everybody has the opportunity if given the chance and so I don't own people's mistakes and I don't own their um victories I just kind of share the the the journey with them and I think that has allowed us all to\nContinue to take care of each other and this work\nAnd I think that's probably from your social work training because I Know when I talked to I have two daughters at a social workers and when I talk to them about it they are much better at being able to do that than I Am I'm Still always going to be the Italian grandmother I guess to legal training I don't know what I Know it close to kids when\nCertain children come in is just something that hits you that um is just\nSo debilitating yeah because you look at them and you look at their eyes brightened wide and ... and some of them are just looking for some attention and try and others on you can tell it's just this is just one smiling day for them and\nYou want to be everything to them so I commend you for that because you can't be successful on behalf of an organization like this unless you take care of your own mental health and I know um I found that myself just working for a short period of time in this field yeah I'm see lawyers it's easy we get to yell and scream and get it out that way I Know but it's it's\nVery ... last a lot ... at the end of the day will say we could not make this stuff up [laughter] and then we laugh [laughter] isn't that great isn't that great I

featuring Lincoln's explicit light up of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator for Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nOr that other opportunities that we have fallen tears we're always looking for child care folks at another child program since the moms can go to the evening in a in a meeting so if anybody's interested and volunteering to help out with the children we have lots of babies and young children and my other child program\nProbably within the next couple of weeks to get\nA to get some of this this base a\nConcrete worked on the ... put in and concrete work done so that it can settled throughout the winter and then in the spring we can go along with all the the flat work it's it's mostly a big landscaping project if you can\nOther than the purchase of the monument itself that you know the bronze pieces and the building of the the the missionary work to build walls\nAnd to kept them with the blue stone but it's it's a big landscaping project with the you know in in failing or you know a papers and and concrete and damp concrete\nAnd a lot of flat flat areas and some steps so there's a it\nCan be done relatively quickly ... sounds like something everybody can be quite product when it's I think you know and it's very very proud of it you have a similar thing\nYou're listening to the gym in his community I'm Bill ... you're listening to the voice of a again the or the executive director of the road on association of fire chiefs chief Richard ... you were retired from the Cumberland\nOr Cumberland I did ... ... ... hill fire department I served my whole career there I started\nWhen I was sixteen or Nineteen Seventy three went on as a career firefighter in Seventy eight ... became chief of I guess it was two thousand January two thousand one\nRight so you didn't go through Exeter obviously but now the firefighters do they play that this is very important facility now for the fire\nSurfaces academic and ... and that just before you know before we get too far off the subject of the ... I was just I just want to mention our website okay absolutely F R I fire chiefs dot com okay it's pretty much that simple are I fire chief dot com\nAnd there's a lot of information about the memorial and if anybody any of your listeners find it interesting and that that they want to learn more about it or even make a donation we've got to go on the page and we've got a lot of different ways that people can donate or buy papers to to\nMemorialize the someone in the fire service that they want to remember if he remembered at this memorial\nThere's a lot of different ways it can be done but the information\nIs I'm sure if we make sure to give that out again as we head into the uh the the second I think a lot of people really proud of proud of their fire service people you don't volunteers and everything\nIt's it really is where we're trying to say absolutely our state is a is a kind of a a good mix of of volunteer combination and career firefighters\nAnd every one of them does a fantastic job they they get the job done for this state in the area where the where it needs to get done in the way it needs to get done ... or so were you know I think everybody has a lot of tradition and the fire service and feels proud of being a part of it in the seat\nAgain this is a again the voice you're listening to the executive director of the road on a fire chiefs association she but she says she is with us You're listening to the cumulus community on these radio stations are going to\nTake a break and we'll continue the conversation talked a little bit bell about what's

major new\nInitiative that is a can take place is going to rise hopefully I set a fire academy which is down in Exeter this is gonna be the first ever firefighters memorial here this is a nation if there was announced a couple of weeks ago down in ... and uh the executive director of the road on an association of fire chiefs\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood born in east Greenwich and they were against it at the best financed right that I think it will prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log on to what I Do not know\nThere is an estate fire fighter memorials that's a I mean and then she would have thought it was something that was there so so this is this is the big story a couple of weeks ago what what's going on what was the thought behind it uh I I think the hard work now continues to actually yeah it's kind of pay for it so it actually goes actually\nWhat what we're in the in the face of doing right now is to raise raise the money to do it and we're doing pretty well but but we've got all that we've got a long way to go up but just to bring up your point about how many\n... why we don't have a memorial or only one of about four states in the country that don't have a dedicated firefighters statewide memorial mhm so we recognize that fact quite a few years ago and it and then these are these past probably Twenty years that we've been fighting to get that fire academy\nWhere it is a ... school property in in eggs that are\nFinally get that achieved and these past maybe eight years and completed\nAnd we look at the front entrance and realized that is a perfect spot for state statewide firefighter memorial so we we tried to work with the state of Rhode Island to allow us to do that there and basically that's that's our plan is to is to raise funds build it we we had the groundbreaking a couple of weeks ago\nAnd what we want to do at the end is turn it back over to the state as a gift and it will be a statewide firefighter memorial for all firefighters in this state will they be volunteer career\nCombination of where they can wear the fire academy can have graduation ceremonies and show the the new cadets or you know just what the the history is of the fire service and and what it means to be a fireman\nWhat my important to have a memorial and why do you think it took so long for it to happen with just one of those things well I think they do our own thing in Rhode Island right [laughter] yeah I I don't\nThink there's any one reason is probably why the same reason we didn't have our own fire academy until you know we pushed and pushed and and we got it you know a location for it and got it built\nA I don't think there was any one reason why it wasn't there but we certainly were we think the right organization to take it pushes forward [noise] um but I think there's a lot of history and tradition and the fire service\nAnd uh we we want it to see that there was a place to be able to bring our younger firefighters to see what the history is where who we should be memorializing who we should be thinking about that came before us in the fire service\nAnd there was actually one interesting thing about this memorial that we're doing just with this with this placement we actually had to tweak the placement on the on the site and it was a it was a good idea by actually our president judge she Frank brown of the Hopkins fill in central Coventry fire districts and in a incumbent tree\nThat we underneath the main part of the monument there's gonna be a compass\nAnd we wanted that compass and and it will be that way we wanted that compass to show true north going right through the fire academy which it will [noise] when you stand on the podium once that memorial is built you'll be able to look\nAt true north going right through the fire academy and that's going to be a good point to make for for the debts that are that are wanting to be going fully understand why it's true north important what is what we just we just feel like that they should know the direction if they're going in the fire service and that and that training and and learning the tradition of the fire service\nGoing through that building that they uh you know especially if their cadets going through the fire academy how important that is to start off their career\n... absolutely I you know the fight the fire service you breathe a type of individual what what is the old line that people run away from troubles and the firefighters that they they run to the trouble right most of us when the fire breaks out we get out that if the fireman they run in five women ... they run and it\nSeems like it's inherent in those that they get into this [laughter] there's a ... in certain jobs and that's one of them with with the first responders into fire service I literally\nRight what what is it maybe can describe a little bit of what the memorial it's it's going to look like a again they there's going to be a kind of a of a circular design here it is yeah and it's I think for for for reference to the economy is down off of a south county trail general area of the veteran cemetery on the side of it was so familiar with less\nA direct it's a couple of miles then from going in next to the the veteran's cemetery is where the old lad school property wasn't made a huge piece of property there's a lot of buildings back there\nA lot of banks have been taken down and say it's an open space but that's where the fire academy was built a and and that\nIs the perfect spot for it right at the front entrance they they have a nice uh on on the public's eye we want to it's important that the public be able to go to this memorial and not be fenced in behind where where all the uh the training gets done so this is on the public side at the main entrance of the of the actual fire cats\nRhode Island's number one Ford dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne as over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's

and and the right treatment plant\nAnd the numbers back this up jak there was a recent study by the Mayo Clinic or reports as many as eighty eight percent of patients who come to the clinic to confirm a diagnosis or get that second opinion\nThey go home get us with a new or refine diagnosis that changes their care it changes their care plan and potentially their lives only ... percent received a confirmation that that original diagnosis they received was complete an absolutely correct that\nAnd a credible number to be a credible\nEnded underscores the importance of this I could have been\nGot to get it you mean your health is important and I think most people listening and say well that's a no brainer I of course I Would get a second opinion on may help\nJeff you talk about second opinions quite a bit on our show and you mentioned how important to getting that financial second opinion is and I want to talk to you about that in fact you brought with you a very simple seven item checklist and you're going to share this with me because\nSecond opinions correct me if I'm wrong they can really proved to be valuable not just medically but also when it comes to handling our finances leading up to and during retirement right\nAbsolutely you know in talking personally about medical issues of second opinions years ago I had injured my hip not once but twice\nAnd the second time really just did me yeah and I went to the doctor and say well you need a different place and I'm like no I'm way too young to to even consider a hip replacement so I just put it up put it off to another opinion\nStill felt that I was too young so I got yet another opinion in the you know the finally the doctor said look\nHis words is to look tough guy I watched you walk in here he said I Know how much pain you are and he put my uh ex right on the white box or the light box and you said your bones on bone he said well you have no choice you need to replace and I went okay let's do it because by then I was in so much pain it was\nAwful are you glad you did it\nOr you know the funny part he said to me to look after the surgery you're going to have one question I thought okay what's up he said why did I wait so long\nAnd he was absolutely right because of course right after the surgery you are on so much pain meds the near la la land and that's a whole nother story we can talk about law which is kind of funny but it it really just admitted such a dramatic difference and now if I ever need another hit\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again fought board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right and one twenty nine Vermont flood of every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nHas to do with the lens through which a financial professional looks at their work\nWith retirement approaching you need to gain the shore and say your financial professional is looking at the entire retirement puzzle not just one piece of it\nI firmly believe that at at least in most cases pre retirees and retirees too for that matter need someone with the knowledge and experience to understand how all the various pieces of your financial life it together\nAnd to actually put together a coordinated comprehensive financial strategy that incorporates all of those different puzzle pieces\nNow that's something not all financial professionals are qualified or prepare to do\nKnow some have a narrow focus maybe they're sweet spot is more insurance but they don't look at the investment side of things or maybe their focus on just investments but can't really offer much help with the insurance side of things\nYou want to avoid situations where you're getting advice about a certain aspect of retirement\nFrom a professional who maybe it's an experience in that aspect of retirement you also want to avoid situations where the advice or getting may not be on target because of financial professionals who is providing that advice isn't seeing the entire picture I have a simple analogy for this\nYou know if you just do insurance based products or if you just do investments it's like hopping into a boxing ring with one arm tied behind your back and you can only swing with one hand\nWhile you're at a disadvantage so if you're working with somebody that is singularly license either insurance or just investments\nYou may not be getting somebody that's looking at your entire puzzle so it's important we are of course insurance license and we're a license for investments as well\nSo we can offer you what we feel are the best attributes from both sides\nSo we do think it's important to keep money invested in the market but we also have a biased towards preserving some of your assets to avoid that next big potential downturn in the stock market so that's how we look at if we feel as a result of our dual licensing\nWe can offer a better outcome to our clients\nJak I think when I hear you saying here is that a financial professional who is not inclined to look at the big picture they might be overlooking something in a really key area of our financial life\nJust inclined but also perhaps not appropriate lived a license to look in those other areas so you have to look at that too so it is certainly possible there are all these different parts to preparing for retirement that need to come together into a coherent\nOrchestrated strategy so when I say big picture what I'm Talking about with can dig into the weeds a little bit your current financial picture will that includes your income you know not just the amount of income but where's that coming from is it a inflation adjusted is a guaranteed or not\nYou know those types of things then we look at your expenses\nBut again what are expenses well you've got the necessary and then you have the fun stuff you know [laughter] that's that's more important in my opinion we we always want to handle the necessary but we also want to account for the fun expenses the travel the gifting helping your kids are grandkids et cetera\nAnd then of course cash reserves your net worth your debt load\nAnd then from there what are your goals both near term and long term your protection it do you have insurance where you should\nRecently met with somebody that had an enormous number of an investment properties yet they had no umbrella policy at all to help give them another level of coverage now that's for a couple of hundred dollars a year I mean it's very inexpensive to get that\nSo if you have rental property and you don't have an umbrella policy\nPlease talk to your insurance agent and talk to them about adding that to your plane\nOr and then continue with insurance get health insurance disability insurance your home your car et cetera so long term care insurance and then there's investments in retirement versus financial independence you know this could be two levels one could squeak by and when you can feel very comfortable with with your plan\nAnd it's always important to look the taxi fish and sea of the assets that you're working with and then later on or depending on what your age is a when you start working with us we look at will preservation\nAnd wealth transfer in the most tax efficient manner possible when you're ready to transition what you've worked their whole lives for to pass on to your heirs\nSo if that sounds interesting to you if you're a mouse in associates thank you know we offer a complementary process where we come in weeks\nFlood Lincoln is southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit lighter of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator

zero one three three three eight thousand divvy given that plan for your retirement with ... you can check out his website as well simply go to Massey on money dot com Massey spelled N. A. S. S. E. Y.\nI Want to continue with your check list that you recommend we should run through jak to help determine if we are indeed receding good financial advice for our transitioned retirement what next\nWell this next one has to do with how the financial professional goes about their business\nYou should determine if their focus on an overall process you know a strategy in addressing your individual needs or do they see more intent on making product recommendations are giving advice before really understand the your goals and objectives\nNote I recall a case a few years back where a large company was offering 'em an early retirement package\nAnd this lady came in and she'd worked with that from for like thirty plus years\nAnd she came in and we talked about as well look we need to go through a process and determine if you should take that lump sum offer or if you should take their pension and then we'll come back\nAnd we'll we'll give you the math we'll let you know if it would work or not I said but on the face of it I don't think it's going to be in your best interests to take the lump sum but\nWe want to do the math look at it look at all the options will come back and report that to your next so she came back to the next appointment and she she said you know why I came back\nI said well I guess she wanted the outcome she said no because you told me right right up front you weren't sure if I should take a lump sum or take the pension that they were offering\nThe other person I've met with before knowing anything about me told me that I said absolutely take the lump sum payment well who was who was that person looking out for the potential client or themselves themselves and it's unfortunate because in that case\nWith the lump sum offer we would have had to generate twelve percent per year to match the pension\nHow we got him as anybody gonna do that in today's world now that was like three years ago but still they you know even products or even less effective three years ago to the interest rates were lower\nAnd that's the unfortunate part out there that there are too many people that will look at look at a situation and in his case he said oh take the lump sum why because then he gets to work with all that money\nBut it was unfortunate and I'm grateful that she came in and then she referred her sister in and then they referred somebody else and because when you do the right thing for people you know word gets around and we're grateful for that because we are produced shares and we take that to heart\nJet I Wonder if you could offer as any red flags things we should be looking out for when we're finding a financial professional to work with especially for retirement planning\nSure you know it's always important to follow your gut instinct you know if it doesn't feel right or you don't feel comfortable with the person if you feel like they're not explaining things in a method that you like or they might be using a lot of industry jargon and things like that if you're comfortable with it well you might not be a good fit\nAnd you need to have a good fit there because you're going to get married to the visor so to speak for potentially the next couple of decades they could be helping you out through your retirement years so you want you want to have somebody that you're comfortable with and that can explain complex issues in a civil manner you know beyond that\nCredentials I Believe are very important for instance if you're looking for just just tax advice\nYou know seek out a certified public account because they're at the top of the game now there are many other tax advisors\nBut they don't have the the training that a CPA does and they have proved their their expertise through testing as well they go through a ten hour exam and it's friday afternoon Saturday morning Saturday afternoon\nIt's a lot of work kind of like a certified financial planner professional when I was again my certification back in two thousand three\nIt was four hours friday afternoon three hours Saturday morning three hours Saturday afternoon and it was a comprehensive after all the college level classes I have to take to get there it was a comprehensive exam so it's important to know what the credentials are\nSo if you're checking somebody out go to sin raw dot org debts emphasis in Frank I and our ... financial industry\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood was born in eastern a generic ended up the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on the boards also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nAre amassing associates I being up front so you know exactly what we're recommending and how we're recommending it it's about us being transparent and leaving no mystery about how we're being compensated because we lay that all out for our listeners when they come in\nBecause it's important for you to know that\nAnd it's about us being ethical and having integrity in every aspect of our dealings with your listeners\nAnd it's also about being readily accessible to you know I Do have a lot of daily meetings so we have a team here so if I Can't get back to one of our team members might get back to you and we we try to get back with everybody in the same day\nI I Will say we don't always get to do that because we are very busy\nBut we are looking at trying to make sure that we return those calls as quickly as we can with the right information that you're looking to hear back\nYet glad you mentioned what you did there I Want to just clarify a little bit more they'll how exactly in the financial professional someone like you how you compensated\nSo some professionals such as investment advisor representatives are compensated by clients sued the fees that they charge so we are investment advisor represented so when we handle assets there is an advisory the the charge what we hear from our from our listeners when they come in to be with us\nIs they're amazed that we can bring so much to the table\nFor the level of fees that were charging\nSo that's I Love hearing that because we know that we are absolutely providing a huge amount of value most advisors are going to charge you like one percent for investment consulting and that's it\nNo wealth management is not just investment consulting but its advanced planning and its relationship management as well and it's the advanced planning where we feel we bring huge value to the table\nSo we look at wealth enhancement and what is that well that's helping you with income helping you with Social Security strategies helped me with tax mitigation issues\nA regular investment advisor isn't going to handle those mostly because they don't have the have the credentials or the background or the firm won't allow them to talk about those topics they only want them to sell investments\nSo we take it much further than that and then this will transfer and we help bart our listeners\nWith the state planning now estate planning sounds like you need to have tons of money to do is say plenty but it doesn't matter any assets that you have that you want to transition to somebody else that since they planned it could be simple you might only have bank money well as long as you put beneficiary designations at a bank which they call\nTable and death designations\nThen you have an estate planning because you've decided in advance who's going to receive that asset that's all it is so it doesn't have to be big and fancy now for those folks that come in they do have larger estates well we can get as complex as we need to be\nBut that's just the will transfer report now part of that is should you should you not have a trust and then Dr legal documents now none and attorney but we work with attorneys\nAnd they tend to suggest financial powers of attorney health care power of attorney living wills last will and testament set coordinate with a trust if you have any trust centers they plan so that's just something that will transfer report\nAnd then wealth protection I mentioned earlier in the program a simple thing like an umbrella policy that you should have on your on your home especially if you have rental property because of higher probability that you can get sued so that's a simple part\nAnd then there are so many other aspects of that and then lastly for about a third of our clients is what charitable giving and we help people that are charitable reminded as well as to how they can leave some of their hard earned assets to a charity that they really care about whether that's their alma mater\nOr I had a client that wanted to make a large donation to a hospital that helped his wife with her cancer treatments\nSo we have all these different things that we can do and their relationship management side just us you know us and the client it's working with attorneys if we need them working with risk managers if we need them working with attorneys if we need them we bring that all to the table\nFor less than what most advisors charge just for investment consulting\nSo if that sounds like
