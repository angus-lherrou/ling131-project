feel better if you want to feel stronger this is some very important information we're going to cover today\nYou know this is an exciting topic to talk to me about this important message today what molecule are we talking about and how it's impacting the lives of people who follow the science\nRight right right well we're talking about her new supplement it's cold every strong and it features and exciting molecule called Korea Team now pat a lot of our listeners may have heard of ... and I know you've used Korea teen right but for those that don't know about Korea Tina it's mainly use\nIn the Olympic circles professional athletes body builders college high school athletes because it does something extraordinary and what I'm about to tell you is proven by hundreds and hundreds of human studies so here's where Korea Team does for us\nIt helps us to get stronger more powerful helps put muscle mass on the body and it helped protect us from losing muscle tissue\nAs we get older we know that's a big part of aging not only that pat great for the brain great from memory and it helps promote bone strength as well so an amazing molecule that everybody needs to know about\nThat amazing stories can you share some of the science and tell us why you're calling Korea teen one of the best kept secrets to healthy aging\nOffshore pat what we need to understand with Korea Team is that it's a natural molecule to the body it's in every single cell tissue Oregon in your system\nAnd its job in the body is to generate and maintain strength and power that's a reason for being to maintain strength and power it's an every single so on the body Ninety five percent of it however is in your muscle tissue because that's where we tend to use it the most the powers of the muscles it's good for strong muscle contraction\nAnd it's important help maintain strength and muscle contractions when you're using them over and over again for instance if you're working at the gym if you're playing sports golf tennis anything like that it keeps your muscles\nPowered up in their higher energy state\nSo they're strong and ready for action packed here's the key is is so important for those of us\nSay in our fifties sixties seventies you see we had lots and lots of Korea Team when we were young we had ... of the stuff that was coming out of areas we had lots of creating our bodies made a lot of it but as we get older like everything else we don't do that is well we have less Korea Team in our muscles you know the good news is that\nHundreds and hundreds of human studies show that we need to supplement with Korea Team\nIt goes to work or go straight to your muscles it's absorbed easily it pumps up at the Korea thing in your muscle tissue and you get stronger you get more powerful not only that it helps support memory and brain health and it helps support the strength of your bones\nYou know we were talking before the show and you were talking about how it looks like athletes have been using Korea Team for years to enhance their strength and performance tell me more\nWell this ... is the premier sports nutrition supplement there's no question about that pat you've used it body builders know about it athletes know about Korea Team is the premier sports nutrient so you know back twenty twenty five years ago\nBlood like in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln him linking him Casey and the only twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator one Lincoln of Narragansett unparalleled luxury impassable since\nWas supposed to be there but there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid it might be considered cheating let it might be considered too much of an edge but back in Nineteen eighty eight the international Olympic Committee\nThey came out the officially confirmed that I'm quoting here Korea Team can be used by athletes to enhance their performance and now ... it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing\nThat for adults for people in their fifties sixties seventies this stuff it was amazing and purity has this incredible new formulation\nWe call it ever strong because that's exactly what it does it helps you get stronger in states stronger with hundreds of human studies to help you and it's the purest form of ... money can buy the stuff from Europe this stuff is fantastic\nAnd we should point out that naturally occurring in red meat problem is in order to get the amounts that are going to benefit you you'd have to eat large amounts of red meat and like four pounds of red meat a day most people are going to do that right and what about vegetarian they can be creating deficient\nExactly when I have a vegetarian that comes in here and their energy efficient they don't feel the way we don't want to feel\nAnd I put 'em on every strong they noticed the benefits almost right away because they've been so low on a you know if you're a person out there that staying away from red meat if you're staying away from meat in general and you have more of a vegan styled are if this is for you you definitely want to add that are very strong\nSide so obviously this works with athletes but you say Korea teen is going mainstream there's a lot of studies are showing the folks in their fifties sixties seventies and beyond that Korea teen can be a cornerstone compound to help people stay strong stay healthy stay sharp Steve vital right\nOh exactly I mean this is the ideal muscle enhancing strengthening muscle protecting nutrient for folks as we get older fifty plus there's like you and me pat and Pat's let's go to a couple of studies on seniors just to show this we'll do one on the guys and one on the gals when I\nFirst on the gods love the title of this one Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance in older men study done it several American universities\nOr group of men get this ... at age fifty nine to Seventy two hey you know we can do that's not when people are known for getting stronger right right so this was just a one week study people need to understand that that's how effective and rapidly this stuff works with just a one week study get this the guys aren't Korea Team\nThey put on four pounds of lean mass that's muscle tissue for those that don't know that it shows they built the muscles and they hydrated the muscles nicely they increase the strength of their bench press that's a chest press for people that don't know by seven percent\nThey increased the strength of the leg exercises they were doing by Fifteen Percent pat\nThey could get in and out of a chair more times faster without using their arms on top of that it could generate more power on a stationery bike pack this happened in one week when I think about that yeah it's really quite incredible\nAlright but what about the women out there did they get those kinds of benefits to as well below that actually help women in their fifties sixties and seventies get stronger to\nArabs are loosely let's go straight to another study loved the title on this one is well Korea teen supplementation and proves muscular performance in older women published in the European Journal of applied physiology\nBut even if you're not an athlete you notice the difference let's go to another study one more review study this out of the journal current aging science December two thousand thirty and I thought this was very cool\nCause the researchers looked at the body of research out there on creating and seniors without exercise they want to see what happens when seniors take Korea teen and they don't\nExercise so I'm quoting here ... supplementation without associated resistance training seems to enhance muscular strength power and endurance increase lean body mass for those that don't know what that is they're talking about muscle and improve the functional capacity of the elderly\nThey go on to talk about how it supports bone health as well and then they finish with this creating supplementation without training in the elderly\nCould potentially delay atrophy of muscle and unproven difference and strength so here again we see bottom line ... is very very effective it's gonna help you to feel stronger whether you exercise or not it supports your strength and power your brain health and on top of that it supports your bone health I mean ... when you think\nRhode Island's number one born dealer is setting the standard again and again flood vote and has over one hundred brand new voters games or just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine Vermont's blood has every color every option and everything you're looking

on and for those who don't know talked about how these work so well together there is a a synergy and it's also a great value to I Know we have a free bottled today but if you wanted to buy all of these things separately it would cost a small fortune wouldn't it\nOh absolutely I mean if you went out and bought the Korea pure cruelty and that's a curious to find this pre teen from Europe if you brought that and then you went out and bought a separate antioxidant formula and separate joined formula and the vitamin D\nAnd it's going to cost you eighty Ninety a hundred bucks a month but you're not going to spend that today and that was purely products and your name we're going to spend a half that you're not spending forty five fifty because today it's for your job is to be one of the first

stuff I mean the tablets are super convenient they're small they're coated they're easy to swallowed it's wonderful stuff\nNow I Know you're shopping at the bit to tell us a little more about this study the purity did on the ever strong powder they tested golfers already found out that not only with these golfers getting stronger and more explosive but they were driving the golf ball get this\nFor teen yards further that's amazing\nI have such a big smile on my face right now I'm remembering when the researchers came back and gave us information I mean we were bouncing off the walls

so\nDouble blind placebo control study thirty golfers took the ... powder for one month no exercise nothing different just took our ever strong power for one month in one month they were banging the golf ball\nFor teen yards further pat not only that six percent more power on the bench press more explosive they could lift the weights faster\nThey get older guys spend hundreds of dollars on new clubs to drive the offer\nSo job where you had five hundred dollars on a driver yeah five yards right this is for teen\nYards had people shouldn't just how how about this or your about this this is amazing because let's face it this was a golf study but more explosive than is more speed more power this should help all sports so if you're a tennis player if you're a jogger if you're any kind of

when you I'm sort of started hearing about this as as a child can you remember any specific experiences where\nYou felt the comfort of the past or ready felt that this pasta was communicating to you\nOh boy there's been just so\nWhat is your Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and super you all have in common they're all in for Steve tradition I was born in East Village in Kansas I tried over two hundred three on cars all make all models incredible prices on just what John job now\nA I was ... my twin brother and I we were playing little league baseball and um I was playing shortstop on this list the biggest fastest guy was hitting the ball and he smacked the ball and hit the ground and took a bad hop and hit me right I'm all and so I'm San during around and listen to\nFigure eats you know a around the field as they're scoring runs on everybody else afterwards kept us oh you're going to have this black I made a lot of pain and stuff like that and when I got home and I I just my parents just kind of\nLove me and cared for me and just open up the Bible and started just reading just comforting passages\nAnd the next morning there was no black guy there was nothing it was just immediately dismissed\nAnd so it was just over and over again\nWhether it was I'm overcoming chicken pox just in a matter of twenty four hours or\nI'm just all sorts of things that kids get into when they're playing in the woods in Texas [laughter] in the main thing was feeling on afraid that's to me that's what the pastor has brought me a feeling a sense that I'm not a victim I'm unafraid that I have dominion over my thought\nAnd therefore I can control my body\nMm well that's an extraordinary thing for people to have isn't it I think everyone listening will think that that's that's what I have well how does the pasta helped us to find that that demeaning that sense if you like both or is he over every aspect of our lives\nOkay the book and Matthew in the Bible I Love it I read it a lot and then it starts out saying when he was coming down from the mountain it's talking about Jesus when he was coming down from the mountain great multitudes followed him and behold there came a leper and worshipped him saying lord if if that will now can't make me clean\nAnd cheeses put forth his hand and touched him saying I Will be though clean and immediately his leprosy was clans than\nTo over the years when I'm looking at that you know I I think about the mountain and that was that physical elevation or was that a spiritual one this was gone and that and that's what the Bible and science ... teaches me is how to pray\nTo gain that one is with my God has an infinite mind or life\nWith those with capital spelling that there and sending them some names for God in in that sense it um if that will ... make me clean and he says I Will that sense of well\nI'm going to try wasn't there um any sense of fear trepidation but it was just that that dominion right there I'd gone given dominion that Jesus espresso fully in what\nWe learn in science and health that's called to Christ and power um call that dominion over situations and then in science and health\nI I like where she says take possession of your body and governance feeling inaction arise and the strength of spirit to resist all that is unlike good gone has made man capable of this and nothing can ... the ability and power divinely bestowed on man\nAs he was saying that case I was thinking of another race or the Mary Baker eddy uses a high or an ... a consciousness um and and so it's that consciousness of a a a one this with God the rate is is always the underlying truth isn't it for all of us\nAnd it's a lovely hit I mean it's who we are and what were made to do and to be we're we're here to express into glorifying God and that God is majestic love powerful so ever present spirit\nAnd these wonderful ideas of God and this dominion that comes out to the consciousness about one this with God that's definitely not confined to people who are members of a Christian Science judge is it\nNot at all it doesn't matter what we humanly appear to be\nBecause of the human sense I'm discovering through my work with a pastor in the sense is that the human it's just a limited sense just kind of like the upside down backwards of what is really going on because we are spiritual ideas of a divine spirit\nWere beautiful expressions of a divine infinite soul\nAnd and the more we kind of embrace that then we can put that in practice by dismissing the thoughts that we have to be a victim of some kind\nAnd we find that as we're learning these ideas and\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood void as over one hundred brand new voters games for just one twenty nine Vermont

share that that just shows how that that really was some practice\nOh boy I've got so many\nOr talking about what the pastor and how it guides I ... I was thinking about face so I was looking at different things I looked in the Bible where it talks about to know a building as arc uh then I looked in in a statement he bruised and it was talking about that as well and so as I was kind of ... my thought\nAbout that are married bakery writes face if it'd be mere belief is as a pendulum swinging between nothing and something having no fix city face advanced a spiritual understanding the evidence came from spirit which review sin of every time an establishes the claims of God\nAnd the sooner referred to in this statement is a sin and believing that you know I'm just not completely governing our lives so you know as I was pondering the importance of faith thing I received a\nCall from a man and he had been driving out of state to compete in the ... annual steer roping event than if you've ever seen the stair roping events they are quite something takes a lot of physical\nActivity and all of a sudden he was not feeling well at all and um his wife wasn't aware of this and then all of a sudden they\nThey arrive at the event and ... tells her well I'm I don't think I can do this and she goes wines with while I've been feeling\nWeak and nauseous all day and the feeling fame for the last couple of days she says well maybe this is a wonderful time to maybe call the Christian Science practitioner\nAnd um he was he was not a Christian Scientists himself but he'd seen feelings that\nHas happened to her and so he said sure and so\nShe kinda dialed the phone and she left and then so I started speaking to him and I just said a few words because I knew he had needed get in to do the event and that was about the end of it but he sent me an email I can read it too if you'd like kind of he says\nAt that point and reason that I had no other choice if I wanted to compete in the event I decided to give it a shot and so he he did call me\nHe said the practitioners first words or something like well we just got to get it right on this and he continued with the moment the practitioners started to talk at all became a blur I felt as though there was this great goodness flowing through my whole body and if if a weight was being lift off my shoulders and went immediately from feeling ill to my normal self\nI realized that I was hailed and then took another couple of minutes for me to realize that the healing wasn't just temporary but blasting\nI I moved on with my day and didn't give another thought to even the possibility of feeling ill\nI was able to compete and it turned out to be one of my best competitive days I Want a silver buckle and he continues he says that evening after putting up my horse and equipment I call the practitioner and thanked him he told me to know that God loves me that sounded pretty convincing to me is I had just had this wonderful healing\nAnd I felt guns enough and then the wife who's real tender wife's wrote and said\nI didn't know he was feeling on well until we arrived at the arena I still my thought and listen for an angel message I felt led to say this is a perfect time to call a practitioner would you like to and I remember thinking to myself that he was so ready for good and left them on the phone\nAnd sat in the bleachers\nEverytime I thought of him I knew he was always in God's care\nAnd when my husband and I talk during the day he didn't say anything about his morning talk with a practitioner but he was very animated unhappy about his day as we were leaving the arena he asked if it would be okay to tell me what had happened I almost cried to hear how he clearly wanted to honor and cherish this special day\nHe told me that he had been instantly healed and we rejoice together and then enjoy the rest of our time at the competition\nSo I had been thinking about face\nIn the face of the wife just her just absolute trust him garden for the welfare of her husband combined with the man's just wonderful receptive and he helped bring about this precious healing and in my own faceless and spending time with the pastor enabled me to kind of a witness the feeling to see God in action\nAnd though it's close to lead me to get vaccinated and

Island and the guest host for Deborah zero\nMy guess is Lucy real the director of prevention and communications for the Rhode Island coalition against domestic violence she's been in the movement to end domestic violence for more than Fifteen Years and currently oversees the coalition's public awareness efforts\nManagers grant and provides training and technical assistance today we're going to talk about the coalition do public awareness campaign for domestic violence awareness month and a state wide survey they conducted to learn more about community attitudes towards domestic violence thanks Lucy for joining me\nGood morning thank you so much for having me I'm really excited to be here this morning\nSo what compelled the Rhode Island coalition against domestic violence to conduct this survey so\nOur coalition has historically invested in being strategic about its communications where it gets a core part of what we do in order to educate the public on the dynamics of domestic violence\nBut also to shift community attitudes that um put barriers to folks that are experiencing violence on some victim blaming attitudes and so for us\nWe thought it was really important as a communications team two years ago or we made the decision to invest in working with a consultant called M. A. M. A. I. consulting and um\n[noise] partnered with them to get a better sense of what ... is currently no\nUm as a result of all of the education that we've been doing and our strategic communications where have we made a dent what do people know about this issue um and so we decided to partner with them to put the survey together and I'm really excited about what ... what we've been able to learn\nCan you tell us a little bit about how the survey was conducted and how did you determine who should be surveyed sure so\nWe really ... um were intentional about wanting to reach\nRhode islanders that not only that were connected with the coalition but beyond that right so we didn't want to just reach our supporters and our allies but we really wanted to reach all segments of Rhode Island um and so what we did was we are put out an online survey we took out ads in the newspaper\nI'm offered incentives for Amazon gift cards um once a month\nTo get people excited amid motivated to participate in the survey\nWhen we started a we had about we were we were noticing a pattern that we were reaching I'm mostly women mostly white women um and mostly I'm well educated women and um and so we decided that we were going to take a second approach to not just the online survey\nHow would you like motorists twenty or gene truck over here for only one minute I Will say hello to forge twenty four more surgery so fraught for the first wife anywhere one hundred and Ninety nine dollars for a full year what board for that or there was a kid\nWe went to the um the H. S. offices in Providence and we were there with a five dollar gift cards for Dunkin' Donuts say we were talking to folks\nIt do they say and long lasting made from a blend of herbal ingredients tiger Obama's trust the pain relief for everyone so whatever your age or lifestyle roar back with tiger bone\nWorked where it hurts\nAt the doors everywhere [noise]\n\nAll right where your battery goes that everything can come to a stop\nTo it which I was on ... why are we auto parts and get your battery tested recharge if you're if you're a battery does need to be replaced or widely auto parts can help you find the executive resort batteries that fits your car or truck out there on the low price O'Reilly auto parts better ... better prices it reverse\n[noise] All right\nSo far [noise]\nWelcome back to amazing woman I'm Deborah Perry sitting in for Deborah zero my guess is Lucy Rios the director of prevention and communications for the Rhode Island coalition against domestic violence she currently oversees the coalition's public awareness effort managers grant and provides technical\nTraining and assistant\nSo we've been talking about your new public awareness campaign which is based on the recommendations from the survey\nHow would this campaign implement these recommendations [noise] um\nWell we are really excited to launch this year's campaign um again like I said that survey uh gave us a clear direction about this six areas that we could work on and we decided as a coalition that\nUm and with our member agencies a that was changing people's um knowledge about what constitutes abuse with the area that we wanted to focus for the next few years\nAnd so we took we partnered with um segments which is an advertising agency in the state of Rhode Island and we shared with them um some of the things that some of the findings have been sharing with all the view where folks um\nThe community doesn't really\nUnderstand you know that telling a partner what to do all the time or pressuring a partner\nTo stop doing certain activities are hobbies I think that they liked or isolating them from from their family and friends that that\nIs a form of abuse those are really red flags they are and so what we want it to do is create a campaign that did exactly that that made it so that if folks were uh people in the community where over sharing something that it would make them pause and stop and think that maybe there's something more going on here\nAnd so we decided with the campaign\nOr that we were going to come up with a a several different a tagline to have the community think about ... ... I hear that all the time conditions could something more be happening here sure sure and so one of the ... campaign tagline\nThat we're going to be using that you'll be seeing across the state will is um where are you now\nAnd the subjects in that hitting meanings really focusing on hitting meetings um so you'll also see a shadow on that says well I control where you go so even though the Claritin is saying where are you now a really what they meet what they mean is I get to control\nWhere you're going I deserve to know where you are at all times and if I don't there's a problem I can really visualize that that's that's a great message\nYeah so we're really excited to um get feedback from the community about that and hopefully it will resonate um with with the ...\nCan you described some wore red flags I Know you were talking about it a little bit but something people should really pay attention to if they're not currently doing so and how you're campaigns going to further that\nMessage sure I'm so\nSome of the things again that should be red flags for folks is just a partner that's always demanding to know\nWhere someone is all the time or controlling who they talk to or where they go someone a partner who's constantly putting someone down I'm calling them names uh you you can jokes at their expense um and just saying oh I was just kidding or oh I didn't really mean it but but the hitting again focusing on the campaign message around\nAbuses and always that obvious um that some times simple statement has a hidden meaning we know when sometimes folks say\nI was just joking they really mean I meant to hurt\n... and it's sort of Rhode Island for a mere ... featuring Lincoln's explicit water of Lincoln Lincoln I'm sure you're going to bring the I mean older twenty or do we can never do it for a very ...\nPut there'll be more happening in this relationship and then the next step being what can I Do about it\nRight and what what can you do about it to help someone that you see in a situation like this\nYeah so if someone if you suspect that someone is being abused um or as experiencing violence in their relationship what are the most important things to do is expressing concern directly to that person and let them know look I'm not trying to\nBe in your business I'm I'm concerned because I Love you and hear the things that I'm noticing that make me\nFeel concerned about you I'm not just saying you are abusive relationship but just expressing like here's what I'm noticing I'm noticing that you're not going to the things that you normally do you see different um are you happy in your relationship how are things going on and express a concern that\nThat those things are not normal right that it's not healthy um and then be there as a support for that person to help them get information more information about ways in which um\n[noise] the the ... when the person is ready to be able to access to services that they need or just to even get more information about is this really happening to me is this what's going on\nIt sounds like a effective way to reach people listening responding I'm stating your observations and then being there for them yeah\nAnd expressing concern I think is just such an important piece because so many times\nUm we ... you may notice something I'm In for ... for lots of reasons or we might feel like oh I should just knocking involved or it's I don't want to offend my friends or it's really not my business\nUm and so what we're trying to do is change some of that we want people to like follow their intuition and say okay something doesn't feel right about this let me do let me take an action and that could mean so much to somebody who's in the situation that somebody cared enough to say look\nI'm concerned about you and I want to be able to help\nIf I can if there's any way I can\nWrite instead of just witnessing something in silence talkative person about it so important\nYeah 'cause then it becomes normal right then it's like oh I witnessed I overheard this awkward situation of this country possibly controlling I'm a humiliating situation and I just let it go as if nothing happened and so that normalize is that this is okay\nAnd so what we want to do is say no this isn't okay and do we as a community we were going to step in if we see it happening\nGreat advice Lucy if you're just joining in on Deborah Perry on guest hosts for Deborah zero who's running for state rep Jamestown Middletown\nMy guess is Lucy Rios from the Rhode Island coalition against domestic violence and we're discussing the coalition's new public awareness campaign for domestic violence awareness month and a state wide survey they conducted to learn more about our community's attitude towards domestic violence\nSo how can the general public get involved and help\nYeah well I did want to take the time to talk about October because this is the months that we've launched or a public awareness campaign and there's so many ways in which we're just can get involved in um preventing domestic violence in addition to supporting all of our member agencies of events uh there are tons of\n'em community events that are happening at a training so our coalition is putting on one on October sixteenth about bystander intervention that I Am facilitating so I welcome everyone was to come and participate in that\nBut we're also I'm going to be leading the state house this year purple\nUm the week of October sixteenth and uh we haven't done that in a really long time um but we decided to do that this year because we wanted to have a statewide visual I'm for that for that island hurts and really bring people together um as a way to\nPromote healing in our community um\nAnd really to get people motivated inspired to to take action I'm Around some of the the messages that were putting out with our campaign this year\nWhat's the significance of the color purple you said you're going to leave the state house in purple\nYes so traditions are color the domestic violence color is purple although we have um been using a ... the coalition's color is she'll and we've been using a more he'll color 'em through the no more campaign um which is a national campaigns that unifies both domestic violence and sexual violence\nAnd put this year again because we are focusing on what constitutes abuse what constitutes domestic violence we thought it was time to bring back\nUm the purple and um that is going to be a the the prominent color and theme of um of the month and hopefully of the year\nYou also talked about in October you're going to have\nWorldly can his southern Rhode Island from your dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit wider of Lincoln Lincoln Lincoln him during the um the older twenty or do we could never do it for only get a ...\nI'm sure as so again it's not a long shot but it's like we were trying to respond to the communities need 'em so they have told us we want to learn more ways that we can get involved in more ways where we can intervene that safe\nAnd that supports the victims of abuse so that Cheney will be very interactive I plan to do very little talking and hopefully getting folks of in the room just have to to brainstorm to role play about ways in which they would intervene given different scenarios um that I'll be sharing with folks and um and\nUm so yeah it's really about giving each other tips to intervene in a way that's safe um and support victims\nWe're having a you know a decade from now we may not be able to have lobsters in Rhode Island waters because the water will simply be too warm for them there'll be up further north\nThat's just one small aspect of what ocean warming means and ocean acidification as carbon dioxide is produced a lot of that as absorbed by the ocean that's a good thing in the sense that it's not in the atmosphere adding to global climate change\nBut it's in the ocean carbon dioxide in the ocean makes the ocean more acidic that's bad for a lot of marine life we need to understand all of that in great detail in order to know how we can deal with it\nAnd an study is as you put it is also very important to our economy as well a lot of people come here to study it a lot of people work there right what what are the some of the in the general sense how many people have studying down there and how many people\nWill have for instance we'll have a we have about a hundred graduate students are working at the University of Rhode Island in the graduate school of oceanography at any one time and in some of the other programs that are down there with hundreds of undergraduates make use of those facilities uh throughout the year\nAh we have a research staff of of of sixty or so scientists faculty members and research scientist who are there\nAre working in all of the laboratories onshore and then frequently uh at the uh in not just the endeavor but in many of the ships owned and operated by the United states of America whether they're at other institutions or here in Rhode Island\nWhat tradition traditionally voters have been uh been very generous in terms of the ballot initiatives most of them most of them make it through and I can certainly the university has benefited from the\nWe have benefited enormously from the faith and trust that the people of Rhode Island have in the work that the University of Rhode Island just doing on their behalf and we're very very grateful for it we do believe that the people of Rhode Island get a great return on their investment I think the University of Rhode Island contributes immeasurably to the Rhode Island economy\nPractically every major company a that exist in Rhode Island in fact every major company that exist in Rhode Island uses your eyes a talent pipeline whether it's business students engineering science technology computer programmers all of those who produced at the University of Rhode Island\nEven journalists you know I was gonna say even in this building is about the University of Rhode Island rather hard at work and the business community really understands that they are really tied into us through the business engagement center\nOr where they engage with the university for everything and we're increasingly unimportant partner to the state government helping them and doing research that they need a running programs for them doing analyses for them we work closely with the Commerce Department with GM and and health and many others\nSo we've become and and have been for a while a major asset for the people of Rhode Island and the facilities that the people of Rhode Island have provided the University of Rhode Island over the last decade have enabled us to be globally competitive amongst the world's leader in so many different fields that are important to the state of the nation\nThat I think the people of Rhode Island are getting a great return on their investment\nWould be remiss if we didn't ask you a question to how things are going in a thinks it's already passed a you know it's already we're already into mid October here it goes\nIt goes faster every year that goes quick to say if they say the same age would just get over it I mean the other students look younger than me every year I saw like I say I joke a lot about the fact that you know I left to go to college in Nineteen Seventy I'm an old guy and\nI've spent my entire career college [laughter] I never left so I'm Still at college and I love it and I love the students at the University of Rhode Island they're fantastic young men and women they work extremely hard we're glad to have 'em on the campus every September I'm always glad to see him come back [laughter]\nRhode Island's number one

of Rhode Island more honors eligible than ever before we're more diverse than ever before we increasingly reflect the state\nOf the nation and even the world and the makeup of our student body and our faculty and that's critically important to us that we have that kind of diverse community at the University of Rhode Island so that we can pair can prepare our young people when they graduate to work in a global economy in a global society\nSo again one less time for a vote on yes question too is going to mean at the university\nWrote a vote on yes on question to me forty five million dollars to

just a few weeks ago and he's just a super guy and you know I was able to have a photo taken with him because we do plan on working\nHis seminars workshop program in January and February for women only and we think that's very important because way too many ladies out there\nRely on their spouse to handle the finances and a lot of cases and then there's a larger and larger segment it seems like growing segment where they might get divorced later in life and now they have to take on all these responsibilities on their own and they're looking for guidance so we will be doing\nA women's only a event in January and and potentially in February as well so you know just sat down on your calendar ladies and it is a lady's only event guys so husbands sorry but you're not invited this this this is

fewer and fewer people have a pension but we we look for that first and if you have one of those checks going to add up to what you were originally thought um you know and that's just part of the process swim retirement we need to put together a room quote unquote paychecks so to speak\nWe need to have an income plan and that is primarily what we do we focus on an income plant and back it up with Asset Management\nTo do that we had it for your assets all your potential income sources especially your account to retirement you not retirement accounts\nIdeally we have a variety of accounts at our disposal what are they mean by that you know like tax deferred accounts for one case traditional Irish or retirement plan at work and then there are tax exempt mainly it's Roth IRAs or raw four oh one case and then there are other taxable assets\nSuch as the dollars you were in each year from your CDs\nThe distributions you take from\nA non IRA mutual funds that evidence um or capital gains that you've earned from your stock six cetera so we look at all of the various sources of income that you may have\nAnd some people may have an inheritance that they they expect will be coming in sometimes they have a good idea what that dollar amount would be many times are clients don't but\nThat's okay if there is a a retirement in the future than we know we'll we can work that into the future planning\nJak having a variety of packs profiles that sounds really fancy but what really let us do\nWhen you're putting together your own paycheck as I mentioned earlier in your retirement years you want the flexibility to kind of mix and match where you're taking withdrawals from so that you can be as taxi fishing as possible given whatever the current tax environment is as you move forward\nSo having your assets in a mix of account types that carry different tax obligations gives you that mix and match flexibility so for instance withdrawing from an IRA or retirement plan\nThose are fully taxable pre tax dollars when in\nNow you may have a a a an investment account that you invested over the past decades well if you sell some assets there to use for income you may only have to be a capital gains tax and your capital gains tax is always the less than your ordinary income tax so that's an advantage it helps\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again fought board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right and one twenty nine Vermont flood of every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nSo that we attempt to limit the taxation on the income that you're going to need for retirement\nSo basically you want to give yourself options the ability to draw from those different sources during their retirement as market conditions and other factors dictate and what do I mean by market conditions 'cause she she was an example of let's say we're taking four percent from your various accounts\nOne of which is a stock market investment a cat\nAnd then all of a sudden the market gets hit and it gets hit badly ten Fifteen twenty per say\nWell if we have different types of accounts to pull from\nWe might say All right let's not take the income we normally do from that account because it's down let's shift and take a little bit more from our other accounts that might have been in more protected positions that did not go down in value because with the stock market\nAnd take a little bit more from those until the stock market account recovers and then we can go back to taking income from there and maybe with the recovery year we might be able to take more from that account\nTo kind of leave the protected account alone for a year to let that recovers so to speak so it just gives you options and obviously no matter what you're doing when you have options it's generally better for you so if that simple way of looking at your assets makes sense to you\nOur number here at mass and associates his four oh one three three three a thousand if you save two hundred thousand or more for your retirement we look forward to your call because we'd like to sit down and visit with you\nAnd first see what your goals are then we'll look at in general what your assets are if it looks like we can provide some value will collect your statement do a

look like if we have another major stock market decline or what might the the impact be if interest rates continue to grow up\nSo this is good information for you to have and then we can put together a plan geared specifically for you based on your goals and the level of assets that you currently have\nAgain the number here for a one three three three eight thousand we're waiting for that call\nForget jets number if you'd like to set a visit desktop for their out one three three three eight thousand that's four zero one three three three eight thousand or check the website Go to U. mass e and money dot com\nAnd yet I decided the premise is that if we can save money on tax as we get to keep more of our money wander and that's going to affect our retirement date right\nOh absolutely and along those lines new within an investment portfolio we also like a variety of asset types as we mentioned earlier what we're talking about is a mix of different places where you can invest your money that's appropriate\nAnd comfortable for your level of risk tolerance you know all your time horizon or when you'll need the money what the rest of your portfolio looks like and so on\nYou have socks for growth in combat inflation a potentially bonds I mean historically it's bonds but right now you know there was a report put out by a professor at Yale in January twenty Eighteen that clearly shows with their Ninety years of study that\nBonds right now in moving forward uh probably not the better place for you to put the less risky part of your money we so we use bond alternatives now in the last Thirty years\nInterest rates have been declining so when you look at that period of time of declining interest rates very few advisors including me I mean I barely Thirty years I bet not since it barely but then in the market for Thirty years but\nWe were we were always dealing with interest rates that were coming down over time well now that's flipped and now it's going up so the way that it has been discussed and talked about and thought about is that you always put sixty percent of your money in the market for investments\nForty percent in bonds will if you do that today you're setting yourself up for sub par performance now\nWe use some bonds but it's part of a a particular portfolio that were choosing as opposed to an individual bond itself\nAnd we use very short duration which means maturity times so in our in our primary portfolios we you\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood was born in eastern a generic ended up the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a Ford's also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nAverage now that will allow our investment team to reposition the money each month as bonds mature over time so they can keep up with the rising interest rates and get higher performing bombs every year and a quarter or so and they've got that all structured so flattered\nNow that's a simple thing but that is something that had to be done differently than twenty Thirty years ago because then you wanted a bond any one of the long term bond because you want it to keep that interest rate\nThe ten year treasuries could eventually get to four percent in the next Eighteen months and all of a sudden we have rates again that retirees will be able to look at it and go wow you know what that's pretty good I can I can live off of those those income checks and so I think it is\nFor retirees it can actually be a very positive thing\nWe're speaking today with nine time New York times best selling author David Box well known financial educator about the recent market drop I Know people listening who are in are nearing retirement David they want to know is is the beginning of the market correction\n[noise] so I should pull my crystal ball right now [laughter] right it's funny 'cause because here's nobody knows right ... ... what I what I what I Know and and we've been talking about this and maybe you know I've done other interviews\nOn um I Know that we're we've we've just had the greatest full market of our lifetime\nI I Know that have you been in the markets even after the recession hadn't even after the markets pulled down and she just stayed the course today you have more wealth than you've ever had and at the same standpoint the last day two months I've been telling people don't get greedy [laughter] right like don't now's not the time to get greedy now is not the time to get complacent\nSo it's very important if you are about to retire or you're already retired it's very important that you're not taking too much risk with your money because if you're in your fifties in the markets pull back you can't afford\nTo take the time to let the markets recover but if you're retired your\n... your comfort level with seeing your money drops significantly is going to be lower so it's really important I I just can't stress enough that\nWhen you're approaching retirement order or you're already retired that you talked with a financial adviser that you work with a financial wise or if that if you have a financial wise right now that you\nPick up the phone and paying attention to the news which I don't recommend you do call your financial advisor go back into their office\nSit down with them have them walk you through what you're invested a lot of people who are retired that might be fearful of the stock market today actually have a very well we call very low exposure to the stock market like all meet people who are retired and they're worried about the stock market and\nHalf of their money isn't an annuity payment a guaranteed rate and half of their money is in bonds and they've got a small percentage of the stock market under so uh but they read the news and they're very fearful so don't be fearful find out find out how much money do you actually have in the market\nHow much risk are you taking and again I work with your financial advisor I just a big believer that a\nA working with a professional ... area which is what we recommend people work with a registered investment advisor when you work with a financial wise or the the most important part is that they do a financial plans were you that they they get to understand what your comfort level with risk is and then they help you build an investment portfolio based\nOn your goals and your comfort level with the risk of you have a very low comfort level with it take any risk well then you should have less money in the market um but the key right now to notice when markets are pulling back the most important you can do\nCan link is just call your visor don't panic sits still don't do anything\nEvery market pullback ultimately has had I Can't promise it will always out but I can tell you it's always had a recovery right every single major market pull back\n... is how to recover and so I'm just a big long term believer that you wanted diversified portfolio high quality investments build off of financial plan working with a financial wise that you can trust that's there to hold your hand when it gets like this right now which is this is a rocky parts\nDavid fantastic insight on this market drop one silver lining here and all of this\n[noise] well I think the silver
