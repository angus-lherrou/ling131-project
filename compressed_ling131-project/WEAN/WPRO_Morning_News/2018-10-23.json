University political science professor Wendy Schiller to talk politics with us so she does every week\nTo morning Monday morning the election Wendy is drawing near and we're starting to hear or at least it feels like we're starting to hear a lot more from the candidates in terms of policy proposals we heard yesterday for mayor ... talking about why some changes you'd like to make a DMV we're hearing from\nGovernor Raimondo and we're also hearing from the independent Joe Grillo more should talk to me about candidates strategy is we're now approaching the election\nWell I mean I think a lot of the press in the last couple of weeks has been about sort of infighting and the Republican Party and outside the Republican Party out of the ... you know because you're more in the form of Kennedy the primary announced song and Joe ... and now that seeping into the Democratic side where I'm Nick matiella that the speaker\nIs a running you know an ad now which we haven't seen that many of him from him before and you know getting a little pushback from aggressive in the party that it'll infighting there there seems to be ... now that I'm Jorge Lourdes on their Providence might run into much different competition from Dee Dee Whitman than anybody thought\nAnd that there is a lot of signs in territory that used to be is like the east side of profit for example that it now for her\nSo it looks like things are getting more competitive across the board and people think and when that happens I think\nYou can either go negative negative uh really uh you know double down on the negative or you can start telling people what you'll do if you get elected and it looks like everyone's trying to get ... rushed to the side of telling us what they're going to do when they get elected and kind of leave some of the really big negativity behind will say that holes in the next two weeks\nYou know there's a couple of close races to watch one of them being the uh racing Cranston house district Fifteen\nA speaker met a yellow faced stiff competition last time around from Steve fry is he's being challenged again by Steve Price over the weekend speaker matiella when the doors for the Providence Journal editorial boards are so many in your opinion how much of a factor does that play in this election\nWell I mean I think Alan song is strong and Cranston a slight you know governor and those ads against him and Cranston I think it's pretty strong and Cranston and I think he's Republican obviously I Know he's Republicans running a developing nominee so\nYou know price may benefit from people deciding they want to change that they want to make a statement about the legislature and they were Republicans want to get out the door in that district and say you know uh we want some change we don't want not yell at the helm\nBut you know speaking of brings a lot of benefits to particular individual districts that have Matty all can make the case the next couple of weeks that he really brings home a lot of good things for his constituents that may Trump party in this case with Alan from running I think it's a much better chance\nA than he might have otherwise in this particular election year\nTo being stronger than one is the basic premise there\nYeah yeah I mean people just sort of tie in and you know they started down song runs and Cranston I think uh people have to think okay right I'm voting for our song and then I'm voting for ... everyone does ... but there is still this elements of wanting change that's what you know threatened every incumbent in an election people want change they're not satisfied\nThings are pretty good in Rhode Island but I think there's a lot of work can be done improving it and I think in particular you know oh lord of the himself and promises not run it certainly can't strong campaign hasn't run much of a campaign at all\nSo I think in that sense voters may say hey wait a minute you have to come ask us for our votes because assume we're going to go for you and it's other person seems like I'll do as good a job and it change maybe they vote the other direction and that's always a risk and election day for

taken for granted\nThey what well her and will hurt Raimondo if people don't get out the door and the mayor's race because they think it's a foregone conclusion and that we're going for a lower than it did they stay home or their votes that are likely going to go to remind that like the governor's level so I think it has ripple effects that or is it not really out there campaigning\nSo a lot of

land in Providence Jason is on the line this morning to discuss last night's meeting and where we go next morning Jason hello thanks for taking the time to speak with us this morning I guess the question is Jason where do we go next from last night's meeting\nAs I understand that the city council will have a media when they vote on the proposal I think it's late in November and I presume that they will pass it because it's good for Providence\nNow you had a lot of support last night at the meeting Jason from organized labor in Rhode Island who feel that they'll benefit from the jobs that will come to Providence if\nOn this project goes forward if you're allowed to develop on the waterfront\nUh they spoke out in support there has been some opposition some people at the meeting last night in favor you faced resistance are all along the way in terms of trying to get this project or to come to fruition talk to me about the just the opposition that you faced in your determination to keep going forward with the project\nOr most of the opposition will increase short street in Fox point apparently a group of friends who got together and decided to a good hobby to propose what we're

a change in Providence and the last I think it's almost a decade er\nAnd we were in the area where the world is changing ever more rapidly\nAnd ordinances and other things have to keep up\nDo you feel that the city has been supportive of you Jason in terms of bringing this project to Providence and helping you get this off the ground or do you feel like you've ... you've faced resistance from the
