talking to you always of the factors you um pointed out that there is going to be a speak out coming to speak up and speak out next weekend as he first Unitarian church in Providence on reproductive health rights in ... probably nobody more associated with a women's reproductive health than you\nSo former director of a Planned Parenthood or the yellow Planned Parenthood southern New England so tell us about this upcoming forum\nWill see this forum is an outgrowth of an outgrowth or actually the second\nPhase of the ads that we had in the paper last a son on thirty is the September ... eleven hundred fifty some odd Rhode islanders signed\nIn which they said that they support reproductive freedom they support the reproductive health CARE Act that the legislature has Barry ... all of last year and that they're only going to support\nPoliticians in the next elections who are standing with women and so\nWe know from experience that the most powerful argument\nFor having people pay attention to why reproductive uh laws ... laws that have to do with reproductive health care and let's be clear we're talking about abortion rights here I mean everyone dances around the name and then what we're talking about and um it's it's there is no more\nPowerful argument for a considering how necessary these laws are than\nActual stories of women and what they went through when abortion isn't legally available and wasn't legally available so the point of to speak out\nIs to now really flesh out the arguments and the advertisements and the\nAnd just have you hear the stories of what it would be like if we had to go back to pre roe situations\nYou and others feel that these are rights that are imperiled by the changes in the Supreme Court and the leadership in Washington\nYes they are and so many states have already um codify wrote into their state law Massachusetts for example has done that so that if\nThat were to happen that roe were struck down um people women in Massachusetts would be able to access to abortion services in Rhode Island we haven't even talked about it because uh Medi yellow is afraid that the conversation about abortion and she says quote takes up\nToo much oxygen in the room and quote [laughter] so um I pointed out that he didn't seem to worry about how much oxygen he spent ... whole stadium discussion but what does that tell us it tells us that car full of men with a truck full of beer or might have to drive poor things all the way to ... year instead of\nBut talk to drink it is a great a concern to the speaker than women who might have to go to another state or another country for reproductive healthcare services\nHe's now on the bottom line do you use Rhode Island as conservative as reflected by the speaker and older leaders state house or or do you think of them were so\nUh it's much less conservative than the speaker thank God and I think that\nUh we have pool Planned Parenthood has already done polls that show us but I think the Providence Journal and make telling you something about that in the next couple of days because they've been doing these calls and and maybe that's one of the question that they've asked I don't know but I knew that they may have so um so\nI think that you will see we were we are already two to one you know that we know that from the constitutional convention that goes back to the eighties\nWhen uh we had a vote on an amendment amendment fourteen in Nineteen eighty six and they tried to make abortion illegal in Rhode Island Rhode Island and went to the pole and some of the polling places were actually\nIn Catholic churches in the basement where they had to walk into the church and go vote and say they wanted abortion right\nSo we we came out of debt winning that two to one defeating that uh\nAmendments you and that was way back in the eighties and since then I think things\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve we own condition at what for Denise religion or against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices are going to flood auto John job now\nAbortion if they did and actually going to be two women from Ireland and uh we're very excited about that because um first of all you know that\nIn Rhode Island we claim to have a fifty percent used to be more like sixty five percent but now that fifty percent of it I'm just going to be Roman Catholic and you know Ireland certainly as a Catholic country and those women and men in Ireland battle for years antique abortion ban laws\nAnd no one thought really that they'd ever get it done because the opposition from the church and they it not those laws and this past spring and the main thing achievement and so we thought that no one could teach just better\nSo these two women are going to be I guess than we're really happy and we want Rhode Island is to show up\nAt the first ... theory in church next Sunday the twenty first of October at two o'clock to welcome that because it would be awful if they came and we weren't all there to say how happy we were to hit\nWill you have a dozen interesting speakers in it or looks as though it's an interesting afternoon so\nThank you very much for joining me and talking about it or the or speak up speak out as you point out at the first Unitarian church on benevolent street in Providence on\nOn a week from tomorrow actually next Sunday the twenty first and um it it may not be precisely on the ballot this year but ah but in terms of how some of the

either women in their life\nUm you know I my books had no graphic sex no graphic violence know inappropriate language\nThey just have deception and deceit manipulation and mind games and this is a psychological thriller Harlan coven told me wants to write the kind of book you love to read so this is sort of like this is one troubled\nMom one obsessed journalist in a high stakes manipulative cat

description of it I\nI was riveted myself and I'm as I Am with many of your books but like I said this one's very different whereas the other your your pin bowling for ... seem to another this one it's fairly interior you know well that's\nInteresting and that's that's exactly the key of a of a psychological thriller it is interior and the key is to keep the reader wondering what's going to happen next you know it's interesting I've\nWired myself with hidden cameras and confronted corrupt politicians and chase down criminals gone undercover and disguise in my real life um but\nI got the idea for this book at the kitchen table which is so crazy my husband is a criminal defense attorney and he was practicing one Sunday Morning at our kitchen table he was practicing his closing argument\nI'm In a notorious murder case and he was riveting he was brilliant he was convincing and I said to him sweetheart you know this is the best use of the evidence I've ever heard to create um\nYour client is innocent I said sweetheart this is a slam dunk acquittal and then I wondered about ah the prosecutors wife\nSitting him at her kitchen table across town and her husband was practicing his closing argument and using exactly the same evidence\nAnd exactly the same story to create a compelling argument that the person was guilty and I wondered did she said to him\nOh sweetheart you know you're so compelling and you're so convincing and this is so terrific and such a good use of the evidence this is a slam dunk guilty just as a slam dunk conviction and I sort of gassed up with that because\nI realized that there was what my husband was saying and that was what the prosecutor would say and then there was probably\nAnother side to that story about what really happened and I thought there are three sides to every story\nYeah yours mine and the truth truth and I really got\nGoose bumps because I thought I could write a book with that you\nKnow murder mystery these are thrillers these are airplane book um but a murder mystery where I used the exactly the same evidence to create two completely\nOpposite versions of exactly the same situation and it showed the reader um how would you ask the reader how do we know what to believe my main character Mercer Hennessy is\nIs in Greece as the story begins she's lost her family or a husband and her daughter and a terrible accident and as the story opens\nShe's writing in the condensation and the steam of her bathroom mirror for for to\nThe number of days since she's been alone at one point she gets this this

of what our colleagues in orthodox medicine do\nIvy infusion of vitamins and minerals not FDA approved it does not have orthodox validation of proof of benefit\nWe look at how things work\nAnd this is

which are even pharmaceutical agents know folks this is a big deal something upwards of eight hundred supplements on an FDA review were found traces of contaminants not accidental purposely put there\nTo make for supplement work better but at risk to the patients because they don't know what's in it\nNow there were three categories of self ... especially cautious about\nAnything that enhances directions anything that helps sexual function and then leaving and helps grow muscle\nSo if you're taking supplements and one of those three categories please be cautious um our advocacy it

bring it back supplements\nAbsolutely will will go through um we don't know all the company that folks will be coming in with siblings on that and when do we know one of the things I always tell

really what they're saying is I don't know anything about that it threatens my intellectual integrity to admit that I don't know anything about that and I'm starting to talk about it so it gets hot here kind of kind of a summary but here it is cold and flu season\nWe're talking all fair about this study one from the journal of um medical research international medical research that showed zinc plus vitamin C.\nReduce the duration and severity of upper respiratory infection symptoms greater than placebo another study from the Canadian Medical Association journal it was a meta analysis where they look at a whole host of different studies\nAnd they found that zinc inhibits rhinovirus replication and that it it diminishes duration symptoms so tell me your thoughts about sink vitamin C. and using that in the face of viral illness\nA highly support those for immune function and if someone is taking supplement lies or even I think about like the highest source pumpkins he's a great starts just freezing so just including pumpkin seeds in your diet is a great way to get regular ... is our winter season\nSo if I get a cold I can just crack open a pumpkin love good to go\n[laughter]

[laughter] they like you keep me healthy\nThat we we talk about a little off air is also when you're getting it from the the how is your ... so that's going to write keeping and we always think about that\nRight so one of the things that we have a capacity to do it intellectual medicine doctor problem it's talking about got absorption it's a cornerstone of systemic health\nApps and unfortunately many Americans have mocked up there got so I got to tell the story is a pimple that led to a colonoscopy\nOr we'll all get to that in a second I got stuck I it's a it's a fable but it's a true story anyhow zinc um so so I'm getting the good studies have shown that you start using your vitamin C.\nThe sooner the better within twenty four hours of symptom I advocate you should have this on your shelf ready to go you know there was another study they said that patients like antibiotics so we just talked to a moment ago about what propels medicine on its path sometimes to patient detriment a study from ... American Medical association\nDoctors to prescribe antibiotics for the flu or the cold but folks remember antibiotics do not help the flu and they do not help a cold okay\nThe flu is a virus and antibiotics for bacteria\nCorrupt and they can do harm in the face of that well doctors prescribe antibiotics at a Seventy two percent five star rating doctors I'm Sorry who did not prescribe antibiotics Seventy two percent five star rating those who did Ninety percent\nWell guess what those ratings are tracked by the doctors employer\nSo you're the dock your feeling time pressure when I told my patients is if you're like minded if you're an intellectually minded patient you tell your doctor listen I'm just here to make sure I'm not going to die from this you're not give me an antibiotic please unless it is vital and critical to my health\nYou will have oriented that doctor and the direction they really want to go it anyhow but they're they're operating under a presumption that you want and need the help\nBut your doctor in general is lows recommend vitamins or supplements for fear of for fear of consequence ... ... if you're looking at a vitamin supplement am I right about the shared an orthodox medical world the doctor runs the risk of reprimand and having that encounter disallowed buy insurance\nBecause if they're recommending something that's not standard of care\nThe insurance company can make them reimbursing insurance companies would encounter it's absurd but let's go back our patients are independent minded um I'm starting to get a cold a head cold how much should I take what do you think what's the range\nUm I\nI if I said you only forty one of the ... I'm On board so the the the rangers I've read are up to Seventy five milligrams for short term use\nThat the higher doses maybe Mary tore us and that coupled with vitamin C. the range I read and and what we use in our practice two thousand up to eight thousand per day in the short term face of an upper respiratory infection right in the provide him and say yes\nYeah I ... I Do it like that too and it would be just be talking about tolerance because the main side effect as you'll get is still so he just flat lean back from that is yeah and it's very beneficial for

don't know if all the time to get into the whole radiation thing but we're going to be talking about X rays and this is the fact that has promised people the ... and this is the true story\nFrom the annals of intellectual medicine so I saw a patient recently and the patient seeing me for consultations support 'em in many arenas many realms of medicine including hormone support which we'll talk about so here's how it goes way to the emergency room\nBecause he had a a a pimple burgeoning on his face was uncomfortable when to walk him right about the temple docs as well let's put you on an antibiotic goes on the antibiotic develops profound diarrhea for the next month\nThe direct won't go away so he goes to see his family doctor\nWho then refers to gastroenterologist\nThe gas or an allergy surprise does it cost us can be why not write the incentives lined up on it protects against medical legal consequences that you miss something it's sort of miss something coughing you hear that she didn't want to miss something and the reimbursement for calling us can be far exceeds\nThe reimbursement to sit and think about something I have a colleague of mine just gastroenterologist brilliant man um I don't want to reveal his name but I'm very thoughtful takes a lotta time does a lot of conversation with his patients he's constantly hassled by insurance companies\nFor up coating that is building too much for the encounter because he spent so much time see this is perverted because the reward for thoughtful doctors who spend more time with their patients is less money and more hassle anyhow back to the ... and that's one of the reasons why driving procedures right going off to be happy to see non specific inflammation\nAnd they recommend another Cohen asked me in six months to check it again in ... risk of complications because the guy had a pimple\nSo go back to that antibiotic was it necessary maybe not probably not maybe they think kind of goes away for the more we know when you go on an antibiotic it disturbs the bacterial balance in your gut for months\nAnd a thoughtful intervention may have been to implement a a a probiotic a high dose to restore bacterial balanced the colon\nTo use ... nutritionally to heal that Colin so that information goes away the diarrhea goes away and you spare all of the high tech intervention the pimple that became a colonoscopy\nIt's a tale of our times in a rush to try to get people to the office there's a tendency to move quickly more quickly than maybe is ideal for patient health\nAnother rushed Shannon we all all allude to the cavalier ubiquitous exposure to patients to either ... radiation that is known to be cancer causing\nX rays they'll look there are times where they are critical and essential but more often I'd say perhaps fifty percent of the time based on some studies there unnecessary their offices where you can't get to see the doctor before the radiate you\nThis people makes no sense okay if you just got a car smash maybe but if you have joint pain if you have a cough if your elbows hurting in the absence of trauma you go to walking center and frequently get diverted X ray first\nBecause there is a reimbursement benefit is a medical liability cover ... your ... benefit\nAnd there's and expediency of getting it through how many times as this happen to people you know dark I had a CAT scan and my brain five years ago I kept by the result though really will just order another CAT scan\nTheir studies now correlating exposure to idolizing radiation that's cat scans in use to three times increased risk of brain tumors in leukemia later in life\nNow fortunately our colleagues that has brought from what I understand that my patients are much more conservative in implementing radio graphic imaging\nBut you as an advocate you need to slow the train down some times when they want to ... you know my son ... years ago had a skiing accident he had the nominal paid

now and increase lifetime risk\nOf developing leukemia because of that one study that didn't need to happen but I felt the intervening to prevent because I did not because I wasn't listening to my show and I didn't have I didn't have the assertiveness to say hey guys stop or can we not do this\nIf he's still hurts tomorrow can I bring him back\nDelay is your ally you know I have stomach pay me ... as well maybe it is a CAT scan won't make you better you can treat it based on symptom not bad come back later you can always do the study later in the absence of a life threatening catastrophe in the moment\nSo when we come back\nWe need to talk about your bones your brain why you should be on hormones at some point in your life\nOr you'll suffer the consequences yeah in the study on well
