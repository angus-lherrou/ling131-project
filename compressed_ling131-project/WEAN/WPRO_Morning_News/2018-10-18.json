your welcome to Rhode Island you've checked out that facility right the old armory and what do you like about it\nWell first of all I failed in Rhode Island for many years including three Americas cups so I Know the city of\nNewport very well and I know Rhode Island the building on themes three which is called the armory nominal it dates back to the late Eighteen hundred it's a big space of eleven thousand square feet and ... and it's on the water and there'll be a perfect place to showcase the sport of sailing\nYeah I've been in there and it may be used against an antique mall so once they clear it out you've got upstairs downstairs it's pretty nice to space what are you going to put in there for your call us far apart from trophies other already boats like what does that have drawn the let me go see the hall of fame\nWell I think an analogy might be the rock and Roll Hall of fame and\nA Cleveland, Ohio with small kiosks and little theaters and nasty displays and memorabilia and honoring people that are actually been sucked into the hall of fame mhm becomes an interactive facility that showcases the sport is failing and the heroes that have been part of it\nIn Newport which of course had the America's Cup between Nineteen thirty in Nineteen eighty three\nAnd many of us in this world is failing sure hope that the America's Cup return to Rhode Island sound or certainly in my lifetime and that might happen it's the perfect place and I think the synergy with fail Newport\nInternational yacht restoration school which is also an same street and the tennis hall of fame I mean I I Hope we many people stale and play tennis and I hope people to come visit the failing hall of fame will also want to go up and see\nThat's a nominal facility that tennis hall of fame right\nIt's a it's a perfect fit the sailing history it's terrific let me ask you this you know an apple this has got beautiful waters to sail and you were there or did Annapolis and the city or the state and I've come across it what you needed and we made you a better deal what's the impetus for leaving\nWell first of all just for the record I actually live in Annapolis, Maryland town and if you're into sailing Annapolis Newport Marblehead, Massachusetts or great failing town so there's no problem with the city of Annapolis them or to stay on\nThe problem here is that the small piece of property on the city front in Annapolis or does not have a a building and it would take so much work and money\nTo uh build something it's been a floodplain good and the hall of fame has it been able to raise the necessary funds\nSo the difference is the Newport actually has the building that big enough that built\nAnd when you factor in the ocean state and the long legacy of sailing\nIn Rhode Island it makes for a perfect fit so\nAnnapolis his point it's a good feeling play but the fact that there is a really good building that's all well and the strong support a very hairy Winthrop who was actually the visionary of putting all this together is a makes it a no brainer\nAlright well listen you're going to be welcome you gonna drop people I think it's a perfect fit what are we giving
