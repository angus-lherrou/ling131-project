I. dot Gov backslash flew\nAt though you for calling us an English or Spanish for zero one\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one

nine zero in English or Spanish\nAnd if you're somebody like me who gets shot every year has been lucky enough to get a shot from you in years past yes indeed um it's it's fairly painless and um you don't ordinarily have any lasting effects\nAbsolutely it's something that we should get every year the minimal discomfort in the flu vaccine is well worth it for knowing that you can protect yourself it's the best way\nUm and you can protect your loved one especially younger children or the elderly that are more susceptible to the effects of the flu it absolutely worth it\nAll right well here's hoping we have a mild flu season Dr Nicole Alexander Scott thanks so much and continued good luck I think is the last\nYear I got the shot and I still got the ... and I think a lot of people had that situation last year I was a very very ill and year but as far as the flu went\nAnd I think that they didn't quite get the formula right so ah they tried to adjusted every year I didn't know the part about the southern hemisphere northern hemisphere that it's you know\nThey take the keys from the uh Australia and what goes on down there because of the seasonal uh aspect and the the say well we need to lower the bar vaccines with this you know to fight this\nParticular bugs or this aspect of the buyer of the flu virus so I'm a was the interesting a situation there\nSo but I'm Still waiting

it the um we had an interesting conversation ... months ago when we were talking about a whole nother subject that you talked about the uh thought of some countries having had in a positive experience with decriminalization of drugs is a means to\nTry to get over stigma and tried to make it um last\nI don't know unless forbidden and maybe I'm more I'm more available but I'm less of a burden on society tells us about that\n[noise] well Steve we have a terrible opioid crisis than we've we've all been impacted by friends or neighbors are family members who we've had this disease and and many of them have died more than\nFifteen hundred in the last few years in Rhode Island alone and and this is part of the nation and we've we've struggled to address it trying to get the appropriate treatment the medication is out there\nUm and get people in on those medications but those efforts are really\nPale in comparison to what we as a nation are doing\nTo address addiction and have been doing\nWe put all our almost all of our eggs in one basket which is a big criminal justice system we have outlawed the drugs and we have spent a lot of resources are arresting people and and putting them behind bars and frankly that just doesn't work to address this problem\nNow Portugal about Eighteen years ago that the ah that that something that seems a little odd and and I would say at the time to go have a among the worst or\nA drug problem in in all of Europe they had the highest rates of overdoses highest rate of HIV related to objects drug is a high rates of incarceration a lot of crime related to drug use and so they said well we have to do something different so they took the they they got rid of criminal penalties for possession\nOf drugs and personal and you still illegal to deal drug mhm um but Eighteen years later\nThey have gone from the worst to just about the best on all of those measures of low rates of incarceration low rates of overdose or low rates of um injection drug use related HIV and\nAt the same time their overall drug use has decreased\nOr in the general population so uh it's kind of clear from that data that we are on the wrong path dressing this problem um now\nWe're we're ... we're practically not even talking about this are we ... you were in the U.S\nKnow when we really need to we need a different approach because clearly what we're doing is not working as a nation now we're we're doing great work in Rhode Island we're leading the nation the governor's showed fantastic leadership that with the governors task force them\nAnd are in our corrections system getting people treated in saving lives but you know the challenge we have is is reaching the people in getting that come into treatment and people are running away from treatment in for an outreach because the drugs are illegal and so they're they don't want to get arrested they don't want to get caught so they hide\n'em in Europe in in Portugal it's different they get people to come in for treatment so they're they're not wasting a lot of money locking people up um and they're putting money into treatment so really what we're talking about as a waiter and treatment [noise]\nJust as soon as an aside I just happen to come back from a week in the ... last week and uh they told us is very low crime rate there and this is in part due to the decriminalization that they went through\nAnd I don't know if there's if this is something that can happen on a state basis or would have to be done on a national basis or have you thought about that\nWell you know we are the with the great experiment that we have a fifty different states we can do a lot on the state level now the federal uh laws would be a challenge to change and and I don't think people are going to try and change the laws and it\nIt it you know you can think of this this week give direction to police\nWho go and enforce the laws and go and take people who are using drugs or possessing drugs and put them behind bars now where they go out and arrest people and take them to court and then the court system sentenced them when they go to\nHow would you like motor

highly effective if people take them\nJust this week said just this week yesterday I was at a session where the state police unveiled a program to enlist local police in to change their approach toward um [noise]\nA helping people and not just locking people up who are in addiction or who are uh having difficulty with drugs and the message from the superintendent state police and others was we're not going to arrest our way out of this problem\nThat's exactly right that you're the criminal justice system is not going to be effective but but what is partnership through public health coverage\nAnd I could really more of that and and ... that we were ahead of the nation in many ways um and you know I mean I I give a lot of credit or the governor because\nWe had previous superintendents as they please could not a garden that there are very very ... you know law enforcement ... might have anything in spite of the fact that it doesn't work\nSo we got to get you back we

function\nAnd in many cases we have found that intellectual medicine that these kind of auto immune process these respond to a global life intervention including we look at the food inflammation the foods you eat let food beat I medicine set up ... and it's true\nAnd we look at supplements that can be used to neutralize free radicals who supplements ooh they're not proven ooh that's not a drug it's not FDA approved oh my God she's talking about supplements quick quick get the handcuffs oh come on come down everybody these supplements\nAre not universal Tennessee is but it would be reckless to ignore the body's power to heal itself\nThat is one of the core elements of intellectual medicine you know I had a woman in this week Shannon and she got a plasma injection into her knee\nWe do on plasma rich fiber in matrix where we take your blood spit it into concentrated plasma with concentrated platelets well what good does that do platelets have growth factors and then\nIf you cut yourself it heals in part because of the stimulating growth factors and platelets I don't care if you're ten or a hundred and ten when you cut yourself your body's going to heal that which tells us so long as we breed and live our bodies endeavor to heal itself\nNow patients said to me well I have no cartilage left what good could this possibly do\nFirst if you're walking you have some cartilage you you can't be completely devoid of it for the more we believe that given the right to environmental circumstances within your body we can help to ignite its self healing dynamic\nLost the growth factors have a powerful potential to improve that knee I don't care how diseased it may be\nWhen you put metal in place of organic substance things degrade more quickly so let's turn out that that equation back you go to your doctor there already ten minutes behind you've got a complex problem that may respond a lifestyle interventions that the document even know about all this but doesn't have

cancer rate weakening immune system\nThis drug is not to use lightly this drug should only be used when every other means of treatment have failed including all lifestyle interventions most of which your doctors are obliterated in their ability to deliver\nDoes it mean who marriage should never be used as it mean if you're on it now you should check it out the window please don't please talk to your doctor consider alternatives we invite you in for a conversation\nYou don't know who's doing a great job in this field our colleagues in natural pathway medicine and many of our like minded primary care colleagues many of whom have abandoned insurance reimbursement model because they need more time to talk about these things that's awful so let's look elsewhere\nHere's a study this is a a breakthrough Shannon it's a breakthrough whenever you read a drug whenever you hear the word drug in breakthrough in the same sentence he got applause right we ever said break through a manner that we don't have nothing no okay so this is from New England Journal of medicine the drug cylinder a night\nHas been found to reduce fracture rates\nAnd this drug was declared a break through the study is a breakthrough because we now I'm something in intravenous drug given once per month\nBut as a potential to help reduce fractures isn't this a great breakthrough this is from a Dr Ethel Cyrus who is um was quoted in the article talking about the breakthrough research published in the New England Journal of medicine one of the most prestigious journals and all of medicine\nThe drug also known as ... been around for a while\nOh bullets pause for a moment really really we're going to use this drug so your bones don't shrank white paws freeze frame\nWhy the bones shrank chin and why the bones shrink\nI mean they shouldn't do that right the bones should be regenerating they should never shrank what makes bones shrink the absence of your hormones\nThere is a natural physiologic biologically plausible approach to keeping your bones forever and you know what it is people it's giving your body what it needs what it wants and what it's always had which is a full complement of all your hormones testosterone projects drone estrogen\nIn a ... identical matter this is one of the core elements\nOf anti aging medicine life extension and youth preservation how many people say I don't mind getting old I Want to shrink three inches along the bones to Windsor so the breakthrough Shannon is they found they did a big studied what they found out if your Bones Are than\nThere was a fracture goes up\nWhat that's remarkable study are remarkable study\nWe're going to do a study shed and we're going to determine if you lay it on your head from six inches versus three feet versus one story high which one is going to hurt more really can can we apply some commonsense please send bones break more easily than sick bones let's move on from that\nShows a woman the doctor who who called it a breakthrough well she's on the board of trustees of the national osteoporosis foundation\nThe nationalist approaches foundation have a nice advocating patient advocate sounding name they receive money from drug companies that make drugs to produce treatments for osteoporosis this is not a patient advocacy organization people\nPlease wake up re classes a drug I'd never prescribed I Can't ever imagine prescribing it it is a very small niche of benefit to a very small cohort of patients but it is not an agent to protect your bones in the face of what else can be done [noise] give you your hormones back please I had a woman Shen\nShe went to see her obituary doctor on occasion our patients are reticent to share what they're doing with us with their doctors because afraid they'll get yelled at right so she's on ... hormones she feels great energy is great sex drive is a magnificent brain is\nOnly actually you know she's just upside down that's upside down we need to fix that but for those of you battling addiction do not shy away from the Suboxone treatment option\nAnd intellectual medicine we've created what we call the executives box on pathway many of you are suffering with addiction are in positions where\nIt's very sensitive policemen firefighters doctors professionals who are concerned rightly so about privacy\nAbout that well we have a program designed to give you the highest level of confidentiality and care and you know we like to blend it right into the whole anti aging platform one of the things that happens with drug addicts is it it it interferes with brain function in every level including\n... pituitary go now to function they'll tend to be deficient in hormonal benefit so we can address that globally but we need it to the back I so here a couple of Web sites that I like to follow folks one of them is the alliance for natural health another one is called examine dot com\nThese two websites helped to inform us about supplements are examined dot com is quite excellent they did a recent um exploratory research into Korea Team committed view of heard about Korea Team it's a supplement that helps mitochondrial function and it helps to grow muscle\nAnd the question becomes is it harmful to your kidneys\nThey looked at a study a broad range of studies dose up to ten grams per day no adverse effect on kidney function\nNo this is an important detail if you're interested in supplements in growing muscle and after all who is it right I'm not just talking so I sometimes last shutdown my weight loss groups you know who among us bodybuilding no hands go up and I'll say not true we all are everybody listening to the show is bodybuilding every day\nThe only question is what kind of body are you building why should you not pursue greater muscle density muscle corresponds to bone strength and density\nBone strength correlates with protection to your brain there are studies correlating osteoporosis with dementia will it make sense when the bones break down their release toxic heavy metals that they have stored potentially hazardous to the brain\nWhen the bone breaks down it's a sign of general weakening of the whole system at large so er Korea teen three to five grams of day shown to be extraordinarily save up to ten grams or day safe\nIf you do blood tests there's something called the ... I mean\nThat your doctor may look out the ... is considered a rough marker of kidney function if you have large muscle mass you're creating will be more elevated it doesn't mean you have a problem with your kidney if you're on Korea Team it will filter through the kidney and will show up in this blood test\nYour ... any level will be elevated it does not mean you have a problem with your kidney so this is an extraordinarily safe supplement for those of you interested in preserving muscle mass and I think we all should be right they found for instance in men with low testosterone the doubles the fracture risk\nFor their bones we have found in our treatment of patients with cancer that uh they almost uniformly\nAre low and testosterone men and women and when you think about people fighting cancer one of the chief complaints is often fatigue lost power low energy then you have to ask the question why not put that home I'm back in when we do that our patients revitalize\nSo we talk about these things all the time because it's hard to get information otherwise you go to the doctor 'cause you have arthritis\nPhysical ... meaning can rights and actually work well folks they did a study in the annals of ruin a logic disease it was published\nComparing glucose I mean can drink to excess could write to him at eight hundred milligrams a day\nWith celebrate celebrate this is a widely prescribed non steroid all anti inflammatory drug\nThe study found after three months no difference between the two the the supplement worked as well as celebrates now that's that's breakthrough right what's called a breakthrough Shannon you know why 'cause celebrates will increase your risk of heart disease\nGastric bleeding and celebrates can be toxic to the liver and kidneys could writes in none of the above\nSo in my opinion anybody battling last year arthritic conditions should strongly consider adding can writes in this part of your regimen as well as more I'm On a replacement now what

treated with drugs plus Cohen's on cue cheddar co Q. ten widely used supplement that helps to support mitochondrial function\nHelps to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation you know what they found the people on the co Q. ten did significantly better regarding their bipolar symptoms because bipolar is felt in part\nTo be the mitochondrial dysfunction amplified by inflammation and oxidative stress\nThat folks is breakthrough that is breathtaking but you're not going to read about in your doctor will talk about it because there's no drug company backing to suck the a dose used by the way was two hundred milligrams per day now what I think made the study most compelling\nIs this drugs is not a drug discipline was given to people regardless of blood levels they didn't test their level first who just gave it to them that we can extrapolate if you don't put helped the bipolar people if it can help with that neural cognitive condition\nIt's a proof of effect\nOn a human
