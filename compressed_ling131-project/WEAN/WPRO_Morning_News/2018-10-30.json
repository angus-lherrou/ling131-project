I understand you're saying it was for them to keep people's identity in this age where people want to steal your but your critics are saying that makes it difficult to keep an eye and the integrity of the voter rolls and you didn't tell us you are doing now you lose the politicians you put up put on a press release you fix the crack in the snow or how we didn't find out about it\nNo no we actually we actually did a sent a letter to the city and town all thirty nine cities and towns were formed a Mr block I Know at that time it a lot of noise about it but um no it was not done at all ... it was done as a part of a of a governor governmental process\nSo now in my next term I absolutely believe that we need to take a look at not just this piece of the law but also um all of the elections law and in and check to see what needs to be changed both preserve\nOpenness in government at the same time as we are preserving people's uh privacy and their identity I don't think I Want to be very clear headed by the way this information is still available if you had a question about a particular voter yeah you could still go into the city or town hall\nAnd request that full date of birth\nWell yeah but that's an extra step and you know people complaining about that but here's the thing if you have two people at the same name and you don't tell me the year I don't know if that's my I Know if that's the father of the sun and the nuts my what I'm interested in chicken you can't do that no\nNo no no no that that gene what I'm saying is we do provide the year we provide the year\nIn the download we don't provide the month to month and the day yeah\nOkay yeah I think in the family I I don't think that the the pro Joe article um\nReported accurately it made it hard to understand what exactly we had done\nBut what we've done is\nIs you can absolutely\nTo determine who is a father and who's the sun you just can't then take that information and match it the other stuff and then say I'm going to create a false identity based on his ... okay\nI was I think we all agree or not what you do that we need a complete overhaul of maybe having maybe or I don't know if you have a lot of convention or whatever it is let's figure but let's figure it out one way or another once and for all\nI agree but let me let me tell you that uh you know it's a really it's a really important issue and we absolutely have to have open government but we have to do it in a way that we protect Rhode islanders privacy\nAnd make sure that they're not victims of identity theft\nFine but you understand that people said you know the politicians they put a person will be solved for everything how come you didn't put it out for this one that's the only thing that's got to be a little bit on it\nYeah maybe a but I think we did make it public through the process\nThat um that we we went through I mean we we did notify cities and towns and certainly anybody who who asked us we we we made sure that we detailed exactly what they were getting and why so I I I have to push back a little bit on the notion but\nYou know live and learn and and we're going to be a bully vetting this whole issue I think oh as part of a really looking at elections law over the next few years\nNow you know what the fake news or do they go and cut your your they might miss that may be kind of right there and I'm not going to do that to you\nBoth saying and I appreciate that no one really gene I really appreciate the opportunity to explain what happened because I think that that the that the way they were released came out uh in the news it made it very hard to really determine what we've done we absolutely are still providing year of birth\nThe entire date of birth is available at your city or town all um
