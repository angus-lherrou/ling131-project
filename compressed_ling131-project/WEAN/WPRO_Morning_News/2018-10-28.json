turn up our heart muscles in lake muscles make bones stronger keep our arteries clear impact our mood and emotional state support metabolism and essentially serve as a master switch\nFor two thousand genes in your body believe it or not we're talking about vitamin D\nWell our guest today is Dr John canal a practicing medical doctor in a sorority and vitamin D he's the founder of the widely respected vitamin D council author of numerous scientific papers that outlined the tragedy\nOf this vitamin D deficiency epidemic an author of an upcoming book on the topic he's the man the media increasingly turns due for answers when a new vitamin D study is published in his Thirty years in medicine\nDoctor canal has never indoors to supplement for any company but that's all changing\nYou not only endorsed is charities advanced vitamin D formula he's put his name on it and joining us live from California doctor can now welcome back to the program thanks now doctors now I Know that you're plump you're extremely excited about the absolute barrage of information that's emerged in the past\nYear or two on vitamin D you're seeing the vitamin D revolution the vitamin D error is officially started in the impact it's going to be unprecedented what's really going on here\nWell let me tell you it's just a little bit about how I got into this 'cause I think it'll give some information about how this evolved\nAbout eight years ago I realized that vitamin D was going to revolutionize medical care the reason I came to that conclusion is because I realized that virtually all Americans are vitamin D deficient when we follow doctor's advice and our government's advice and we started putting on the phone blocking staying out of the fun it had\nTremendous effect on the vitamin D levels in our blood\nSo I started a nonprofit the vitamin D counsel on there you can read more information and you can possibly remember\nAll about vitamin D and I also realize that the amount of vitamin D Americans were taking whether it be in their multi vitamins are trying to drink milk was pretty much irrelevant the amount is so low it had no effect on vitamin D blood levels\nAnd when I realized that it literally changed my life and then within the last year so I realized that to work fully to optimally work vitamin D needs a number of coke factors\nIt needs vitamin K to a vitamin K one but the more expensive vitamin K to\nNeeds for on it needs magnesium it neat thing and we'll talk about all these secondly I realized there's a difference between having vitamin D on the shelf and people can buy it for getting people information on the radio so people who are not taking it\nOr taking the wrong preparation can learn about it and that's a big difference so I approached a number of companies and purity agreed to make the vitamin D formula that I insisted upon and secondly I said by the way I Want people to take this with fish oil\nSo what we're gonna talk about today is purity offer about up complete vitamin D formula one that's unlike anything else on the market you can't buy it in the store you can't put it on on the Internet it this is the only such formula that exist\nTogether with the ultra pure molecularly distilled fish or\nYou know let me ask you a question here because I'm a skeptic at heart and I like to play the devil's advocate on the radio and how is it possible that one vitamin in this case might have been the can be involved in everything from cardiovascular health to immunity to body weight even dental cavities I mean I've heard stuff like this before you know about vitamin C. what's what is different with vitamin D\nYeah that's a good question let me just do one thing that people understand exactly what sort of things have been discovered and one of the best ways to do that is to go back and look at Google News now here's some headlines from major publications in the last couple of years about vitamin D I'm just going to read off\nA list of headlines when you think about it is truly amazing and they these sorts of headlines have never been seen before for any other vitamin Newsweek\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again blood borne has over one hundred brand new borders games or just one twenty nine from us that's like one twenty nine Vermont blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ...\nPI lack of vitamin D can effect thirty six Oregon Washington Post vitamin D deficiency called major health risk am a news that's American Medical association or listen to this that bite them indeed deficiency maybe the root\nOf numerous health problem that's the American Medical Association the you know it's just truly amazing\nThe reason that it's involved in prostate health breast health bone health cognition blood pressure health immune health all these different things as because vitamin D pat it's not a vitamin\nIt is truly the one vitamin you cannot get from a good diet because it's not a vitamin ... it's made in the skin upon exposure to sunlight and what's eventually made is a steroid hormone no steroid hormones activated vitamin D is a steroid ... and the way they work that is the key\nThere are key to your genetic code\nAnd some steroid hormones are key to only a few genes but vitamin D is the key to two thousand gene that is it\nUnlocks two thousand gene\nIs the key that two thousand one tenth of your genome by the one one tenth of your genome is waiting for the key to unlock it\nAnd the only thing that can unlock it is vitamin D that's why it's involved in so many different health conditions your body knows what it needs it just needs the key one lock the right gene\nNot doctor you say we need five thousand I use pretty now here's here's the problem I went through the the health food store the other day and I'm looking at most multi vitamins and I'm even looking at my ... D sold separately\nYou know as a supplement itself is most of them have two hundred four hundred I use I saw a couple of brand they had a thousand nobody even comes close to what purity is offering you I Want you to talk about why we need five thousand per day and there's really only three ways to get it I could either go out and the the new time sun\nWhich really isn't practical for a lot of us and there's you know the the skin concerns you talked about before I go to a tanning bed again not an optimal choice where I can supplement the right way was purity products why the importance of this five thousand number why is that the magic bullet\nYeah because of a single fact and this that changed my life for seven years ago when I was researching vitamin D I came across a number of studies that showed that if you put on your bathing suit and go outside in the summertime\nAnd Sunday for about twenty minutes ten minutes on each side you make between ten thousand and twenty thousand units of vitamin D in twenty minutes now\nThat's incredible I thought about that and I thought about that why would nature devise a system that they that much vitamin D that quickly and if you look at levels that people like lifeguards or roofers or gardeners or something they're levels or fifty or sixty or Seventy\nSo that's a natural level and studies very clearly show if you want your level to be ideal your blood levels to be fifty or sixty you have to take five thousand units a day two thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up till maybe thirty two but five thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up to fifty and if you take less than that\nThis is like an insurance policy ... you're not not to take this and it's free [laughter] yeah and\nAnd the other thing I Want to say is you're listening in five years I don't want you to say I didn't know about this and I was never told I mean five years from now I don't want you to turn around and say I didn't know about I Wish I would've known\nBecause you've been polled at right now you're being told you know you can't say you never you never knew about it 'cause I'm telling you right now it's involved for example in a number of places in the country if you walk into emergency room with anything that might be your heart you know what they do\nGive you a hundred thousand units right off the bat first thing ... thousand years of vitamin D day and then they keep giving\nThem into a failure to question speaking of the cardiovascular system I Know you could probably talk for about thirty minutes on this but some of the information you're sitting here just fascinating what vitamin D does talk about its role in maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system yeah and\nSame clues we know that heart health is better the closer you lifted the equator we know heart health is better in the summer than the winter but just recently there have been a slew of studies out of the best universities in the world\nAll connecting your lights\nHow would you like ... twenty eight gene trust that the only one Ninety nine will say hello to forge twenty more than one of the best friends with our best friends anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars Vermont only a board and he joined the Oregon\nEach he and his conclusion was pretty stark here it is quote low levels of vitamin D or associated with higher risk integrated man\nEven after controlling for known risk factors that is even after they control for smoking high blood pressure high triglycerides diabetes all the things known to contribute even after they control for that\nThere was a ... wrong effect of vitamin D day\nAnd it was integrated manner that is if you're really deficient than your risk is much higher if you're a little deficient than your risk is a little higher and we don't have enough studies yet to say that you know if you have heart disease you should take vitamin D although many cardiologist prescribing it just on the basis of why not it\nIs safe you know five thousand units a day it cannot make anybody toxic five thousand units a day is ten minutes of summer show even five minutes of summer gun shy so the way these doctors are thinking is\nLook what's the risk versus what the benefits it looks like from the studies there's a tremendous risk associated with vitamin D deficiency we don't have all the studies we need and we're doing those studies now but it would be unethical to let people remain vitamin D deficient\nWhile we're conducting all the studies we need to about heart health or bone health or breast held or prostate health their immune system\nIt would be unethical to let them white vitamin D deficient the problem is that many doctors use antiquated reference ranges and so if you're levels thirty five they'll tell you that's okay it's not okay level needs to be fifty or higher and to get that adults need five thousand units a day\nAgainst those just tuned in I mentioned earlier you know I go through the health food store looking multi vitamins most the best have four hundred I use I mean when you're looking at the the vitamin D that you can buy by itself is a standalone vitamin most or four hundred I use I saw a couple that were a thousand I you've jobless but again that falls far short\nOf that five thousand number and that's what you get with purity or why is that so important\nThere's recently been a study by professor Hany at Creighton University that shows that when you get your level to fifty\nYour body has enough for all the things that needs to do and it begins to store a little bit of the vitamin D just like your ancestors used to store it\nSo if you're a level is less than fifty your body is basically using up all the vitamin D as fast as you take it for all the things that need to think of vitamin D as a mountain spring\nWith a pool at the top right the pool we've always known about its calcium and bone and we've taken enough item and data halfway fill up that calcium and bone pool\nBut all the other pools below with the breast pool the coal and pull the immune system pull all the other polls that are blow it had been basically dry since we've been out of the sun right if you take five thousand units of vitamin D\nThe upper pull over flows and starts filling in all the pools at the bottom the teeth and gum the mood to cognition the pancreas out all these pools\nAnd there's enough left over to store\nA little bit for a rainy day and a little bit of a surplus yeah\nBut you don't do that unless you're levels around fifty if you're levels less than around fifty you used up\nAll of it immediately and that's called chronic substrate starvation wow and that's not a good thing\nBy the way down to ... vitamin D super formula is not available in stores only directly through purity products you get it in conjunction with their omega three ... three bottles fish oil both of these are thirty days supplies\nAnd all you pay for shipping four Ninety five you can't beat it the phone number one eight hundred six five zero six feet to zero and that's one eight hundred six five zero six eight\nTo zero now doctors now talk to me about the link between vitamin D and ... what's the research showing\nWell at this maybe fifty studies out there that show real simple association the lower your vitamin D the more you weigh the higher your vitamin D ... but that doesn't\nProve that it's a cause and effect but there were clues of fame clues that we know what about mood that is\nPeople who live closer to the equator way less than people who live far away from the equator people who live at higher altitude closer to the sun way less than people who live at lower altitudes most people experience has people way less than the summer\nThan they do in the winter so those were closed but we don't need those clothes anymore because the explanation of why your vitamin D level is so what we call inversely associated with your weight that is the higher your vitamin D levels ... that's become clear just recently for example there's a paper in the British Journal of nutrition August\nLooking for a car credit not played well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you could be driving on a force also models interest free log on to what Tom\nThan the women really had the lower vitamin D and take yes\nAnd then just a couple of months ago a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial that's the highest standard of proof we have and that is and this was thirty six thousand people\nAnd they just gave them a tiny doses of vitamin D so we don't have any idea what the full effect is but the women who were taking even this tiny doses of vitamin D were less likely to gain weight than the women who were not\nTake ... to Monday so that's another reason plus the\nPurity is giving away a month's supply of the formula vitamin D formula plus the fish will ... you know of course that there's research that shows the fish or in a self help with weight control so there's reasons to believe that two things together will help now it's not a diet till it's not dramatic you won't just stop eating\nPart of that that is you just feel better you're more active you are under doing something\n[noise] now don't you know we're sort of run out of time here but I I Want to give you a few minutes tell people why you believe is so vitally important did they give this formula try\n[noise] well you know we've had time to talk about the heart body weight mood but you know we haven't had time really to talk about brain health coal and he'll rest 'til\nProstate health pancreatic hill bone health the immune system I could go on and on the main reason that people will continue to take this if you just give it a try for a month is how you feel you're get up and go

the I I say I've discovered this really does take discipline you know I found to get off the rollercoaster\nThis rollercoaster that you're talking about I think is something that we all have to deal with at some point and um\nI found that the roller coaster actually comes from focusing on the world you know thinking like a worldly woman or man in a world of lacking competition and comparisons and pride\nYou know striving for self worth looking to others for validation and so forth\nAnd that keeps us on a rollercoaster with you know some days we have highs and some days we have loews\nBlood

if we want to contribute more to the good of the world a piece of the world you know and help others\nI Know for me early on in my\nSpiritual growth in study in the in the scriptures and so forth I I was definitely on a roller coaster and\nUh I I discovered it and and ah what I what I discovered was that I Would study the Bible I Would pray and I would get to feeling really good and really hot and\nThen once I started feeling really good I saw it on the left my studies and my prayer behind ... is like almost like and I didn't need God so much because things were going so well but inevitably I'd always start you know heading back down\nThe roller coaster and I I ... I went back to my books and my prayer and I get back up and things would be going good and\nAnd then I'd drop it again and I found myself going up and down that way and\nFinally I thought you know mark why don't you just stay with it you know even in the good times even when you're feeling really inspired ... day with your study stay with your prayer\nKeep God in your life and by doing that I found that I've been able to maintain a very steady life and happiness and satisfaction\nAnd also if you'd like to know I mean there's some things I Do specifically each day to keep myself inspired I I pray the Lord's Prayer every day for one thing and I don't I don't just say the words but I really think about it uh it's amazing how I can continue to be inspired by that\nEvery day I go over some other things that you know like a Mary Baker eddy wrote a scientific statement of being in it just a really wonderful paragraph that just\nGets your thought on the right track of you know that we're spiritual and not material that were gods expression his image it reminds us of that\nUm and and key to it for me has been the Bible lesson a weekly Bible lesson that the Christian Science church puts out it's just phenomenal\nIt's a citations from the Bible and then passages from science and health with key to the scriptures that throw light on the spiritual meaning of the Bible verses\nUm and it's on a particular subject and can be subject of about God or about a life different subjects\nAnd you study that all week and it helps me pray\nIt gives me ideas to take into my day with whenever I'm doing and that has been a phenomenal as far as as a constant practice and I'll I'll just say one other thing you could read Jesus sermon on the mound again in chapters five to seven in the book of Matthew in the Bible [laughter]\nThat are really help and that'll also give you a lifetime of things to do to stay\nSatisfied to stay happy ... and then I'll just share if\nOne quick experience that I had um in high school of how much this actually works in my high school what we did on the weekends was always went to a party so we're just parties every weekend and all my friends were like they would drink in and take drugs at the party so they could have fun [laughter]\nAnd I didn't do that because I I had already decided even middle school that you know I could find a high I could find enjoyment just through lending God's goodness and love be expressed through me\nAnd so I asked myself one time will but how can I prepared to go to these parties because they weren't always that much fun for me\nAnd I thought well you know they prepare by drinking and taking drugs and stuff well it came to me as I pray to God told me you know read science and health again which helps explain the scriptures\nAnd so I decided to do that so every time before I went to a party I Would just take the book\nAnd it ran them open it and just read until I felt a shift in thought and it would usually only just be a couple of pages but it I realized how it was changing my side just in the just in that little bit of time of reading it always reminded me who I was that I was God's child\nAnd that I was his expression now the first chapter genesis tells us were made an image and like so God\nSo if God is love which the\n... group wants your car any make any model what pays more than any dealer around because survive buying center Advil by yours even if you don't buy our ... our car buyers\nTo who's going to be at the party you know what am I going to be able to do what am I going to be able to get\nAs I read science on health I remembered wait a minute I'm an expression of love I'm going to go to the party to give I'm going to go to share I'm going to go to help and support people that's where I'm going to go\nAnd I did that and I had so much fun I mean it made my life so happy in fact kids would come up to me in high school and they were like\nWow would ever drug you're you're taking could you share it with me and [laughter] but that's how they they saw they say wow you're just always so up and so happy and and that was I mean that's a real real experience but arrogant just brain got into my life\nI Love them now this next question has NO NAME but it doesn't have a location and Washington DC and it really goes in a different direction and the questionnaire rights\nI think the question is selfish I spend more time asking how can I really make a difference I wouldn't be happy if all my own needs are met and others around me were suffering\nI think this really gets to the heart of the matter actually I think the question looked at a certain way can sound selfish\nHow can I experience a satisfying life [laughter] does down very selfish but the dichotomy here is that we end up experiencing satisfaction by doing just what you are talking about giving to others serving others lifting up other seen others around us\nWho need help and helping them that is our satisfaction and [laughter] you know and what what did Jesus do I mean\nHe washed his disciples feet\nYou know and he said that example for us uh in the world's way of thinking they should have washed his feet since he was a master and he said who's whoever of you will be the cheapest Shelby servant\nOf all and so that's why we don't follow with the world teaches we have to have\nSpiritual teaching if we want to be satisfied\nIt might be interesting to think about the fact that Jesus had to make a decision himself about what kind of life he was going to live he was tempted to use his knowledge and power and have great worldly game for himself\nYou know he he could have been quite a leader with riches and all the things that the world in the Bible it tells you know the the devil tempted him and took him up on a high mountain and showed him all the bridges and glory and said you know just\nWorship me and I'll give you all this stuff and of course he chose not to do that he said it's written in the Bible to worship the lord your God and him only you shall serve which is what he did he he chose that\nAnd he knew that that was the only thing he can be satisfied with you didn't have a house that we know of or a wife or children or he didn't take vacations um didn't have a yacht\nYou know he went around doing good\nFreeing people from the destruction of sin disease and poverty and even death and he ultimately laid down his life or others\nYou know in one of the most gruesome ways the crucifixion but his reward was resurrection from death ascension from above all material conditions\nHe was working out his relationship with God and taught us to do the same he said in fact that he came that we would have life\nMore abundantly in John ten ten he says I'm come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly\nAnd then one new commandment he left with us was not only to love one another but to love one another as he loved us\nHe laid down his life or his friends in fact in John Fifteen he says if you keep my commandments each shell abide and my love even a I have kept my father's commandments and abide and his love these things have I spoken to you that my joy might remain in you\nTo learn more about challenge to eliminate cervical cancer campaign please visit women in government dot org that women and government dot org [noise]\nHi this is

general let me ask you a question on about our government to we put um requirements on people to get housing that they can't sustain for instance you know you read a lot of what's happening nationally now talking about things like well you have\nTo be clean and sober sober first before you can get housing I'm speak to that a little bit\nSo crossroads is a housing first\nOrganization our philosophy and our service delivery model is based on housing first which means\nThere are no barriers and and hug who fund some of our programs approves this this model the national alliance for ending homelessness considers housing first and low barrier shelter best practice so what we're saying is\nUm were first going to how you\nBecause to work on issues like addiction and and ... mental health or physical health issues or alcoholism you're not going to be successful in addressing those issues until you have the safety instability of your own home\nSo we get people house first despite all of

I'm even ... filling in for Deborah Gerald and in the studio with me this morning as president and CEO of crossroads Rhode Island ...\nKaren a policy initiatives and crossroads involved on issues besides housing we've talking about the wraparound services [noise] what else does cross roads will provide [noise]\nSo given our mission and our housing first philosophy and program Morrow a focus really is on housing but also coordinated entry initiative that will ensure that our limited resources statewide are used\nIn the most appropriate manner by those who need it the most um so we we offer a whole range of wraparound services from crisis intervention and emergency shelter to assistance for rent and utilities and transportation\nI'm and I'm from all the way to permanent supportive housing and\nEducation and employment supports but it all starts with housing\nSure and I can tell you at close to kids Rhode Island on when I get a call from somebody and they say their addresses one sixty broadstreet they get an appointment within a day or two we have certain slots that we keep there because we know\nPeople in crisis especially in a domestic violence situation or they've lost their home or they've had to flee a situation they have just the clothes on the back\nAnd those children need to be able to go to school and feel good about themselves so I only tell you that listeners know that um there's a lot of agencies out there that are trying to support 'em your mission in a very defined way\nThat's you know it's that's really what it's going to take as us coordinating our efforts together because we know we can't solve the issue alone and we don't want to do it alone and so partnering with good organizations like yours and\nAmos house in river would were able to coordinate all our efforts and do what we all do best to help those who need it the most as Oh thank you for what you do a\nClose second You're welcome it's um I started as you know while with volunteering across roads so you're you're trained me well Karen I'm what I'm\nWhat can people do if they want to donate their listening today they're excited I'm they hear about it how can they how can they help\nThank you um they could go directly to our website W. W. W. dot crossroads R. I. dot org to learn more about what we do and who we are in and make a donation they can call our offices for a one to seven seven for three three zero if they want to make a donation\nOr talk to someone come in for a tour see\nI'm the insides of what happens at some of our different programs sites\nWell the insides I can tell you I was involved with um with helping out across the U.S for ten years before I took the tour and when I did\nUm I Know why it took me ten years to get there it's just life altering when you see people good people working a sitting down and groups trying to figure out what they're doing for the day and and moving on especially the women's shelter it's really um a place\nThat is a happy place which you know was was a surprise to me on the other thing I Want to tell people as well as if you have a certain projects that you want to do to help crossroads contact a pack camp alone and cross roads and\nAnd see what you can do to try to help out on they take lots of advice and they take lots of on of help from the public so I think that that's a good thing for everyone listening that they can do\nAnd of course the best way is to go on and write a check and it doesn't matter how small it is or how big it is right well we like the big ones but [laughter] but it it's just getting involved\nRhode Island's number one Ford dealer is setting the standard again and again for borders over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one forty nine Vermont one twenty nine Vermont flood of every color every option and everything you're looking for like four dollars on a\nIt differs from individual an individual to two households and it may include job supports or education or employment services um and you know I'm I feel like I'm sounding like a broken record but it really does start first with a stable place to live\nUm we no firm evidence and research and our experience that once someone has house the they're more likely to keep their doctors appointments stay on their medication\nUm be able to have the confidence they need to take a shower and get dressed and go to that job interview or show up for work every day\nAnd those are the things that will help the quality of their life be better and in some cases they may still be below the poverty line but their house and they have a stable life and then can work on\nTaking that next step and improving so for example we have a a training program for certified nursing assistants and we've graduated a hundred and twenty five different classes of men and women that are going on to take the state exam to be a CNA\nIt's almost a hundred percent unemployment after they received their license and it's it's um flexible employment for single parents it's better than minimum wage earning and it's a stepping stone into the medical field\nThat's always hiring so providing people with that education and those tools nobody can ever take that away from them right\nRight but if we look at it and say housing is first and just stay with me for a minute if we took all of the resources that we're putting into the other activities like the wraparound services and just put it into housing would that work [noise]\nNo it it really wouldn't and and there are there is a segment of the homeless population about thirty to forty percent in Rhode Island\nThat really need those supportive services\nForever I'm for whatever reason whether it's mental physical disability that\nThey simply need those wraparound supports to help them stay house that's a huge percentage thirty people on uh yeah well it's higher in Rhode Island I'm In other states we're we're seeing it's lower percentage nationally the averages about twenty percent of the homeless population uses the majority of resources the chronic homeless\nUm [noise]\nThe challenge for Rhode Island is we don't have a lot of permanent supportive housing units and so those folks tend to stay in shelter longer or go through the system multiple times um but there are and then there are the vast majority that\nJust require a little bit of support and rental assistance some for twelve months Eighteen months and then they're\nThey're independent and um don't need the supports anymore and and we'll never see them again so\nUm but those supports after their house are very important\nNow why the negative stigma towards um chronic homelessness a when we know it's really a lot of that is the mental health or disability and why that\nWell I think you and I know that but I'm not sure others do and it I think it it makes people feel uncomfortable they don't know what to do um they see someone I'm Carrying all of their belongings or sleeping in a doorway or\nYou know I'm looking on clean and\nAnd it makes you uncomfortable you don't know how to help that person or what to do [noise] um and and sometimes it's a judgment it's just get a job or um you know go back to school and\nSo I think what happens is people just it's easier for them to kind of push it aside because they don't want to see it and and can sort of say well it's their fault rather than saying gee our system has failed these people and we need to figure out a better way to help them\nIntegrate back into society in a way that works for them\nYou hear people talk about how um when you see panhandle is on the street oh they must make so much money or they do that for a living I mean\nYou go into the classrooms I chaired the board of education for three and a half years I never saw any kids than what I Want to do in life is to collect money at a stop sign 'em and and [laughter] you know go on from there so you know I think you're right I think a lot of people feel uncomfortable and I think a lot of people to err on the verge of\nOf trying to make things me especially you know we see a lot of the um young families trying to to put it on together and then paying that kind of a amount of money just for housing itself it's scary\nHow would you like motor treads twenty or gene trucks will be here for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty four to one fifty so that's the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars for a full year what board and he's running joined there were ...\nThey will\nStay with family or they'll couch surf or and then they put their belongings into um\nStorage and then they can't pay the storage bell and so over you know it's not like they they go from being housed one minute and at crosswords the next minute it ... it's sort of a process that they just are really struggling to\nSurvive and then you're right they don't say you know my goal is to raise a family and be homeless or stay in a shelter I mean there\nWhen they come to cross roads and they are in crisis\nThe Hudson River swelled over Spanx it engulf the wastewater treatment plant right up the homeowners and businesses work had sewage backing up into their homes because of it and it was a real catastrophic event but work responded\n'em by I'm pulling together the funding I think some federal funding actually build a big issue here and flip from around the entire facility or well every wastewater treatment plant in Rhode Island all the the Eighteen other ones are are faced with similar challenges Simpson and um they don't you know this is\nMoney they probably had planned on spending ten years ago right but uh now here we are and I you know east Providence has been flooded out there they're they're all at risk and I'm so some infusion of funds as needed to help them actually secure and fortified them those ... or treatment\nPlant don't think about it till it's a problem and I think that's the way a lot of roads and bridges and other things going about it and go back into the way back machine you know when that happens\nThe flood there I mean that that I Ninety five from that little trickle of water I mean you'll see a drive in that I Ninety five of the airport connector could have been up to the medium there I was unprecedented it remarkable that all these flights as you say are along the water they all need to function they cannot not function other unless it's a real problem\nAnd some of them um may overtime need to actually be relocated because they're too much in harm's way and I'm that'll cost a lot of that will cost more money than building of arm around for sure\nThat is not going to be cheap or we'll see this order fire and and we've seen this now for many years those rivers that we move all those years ago right the\nUh seven million dollars to dredge the ah the ah Providence a river very important project right for for everything that goes on down there trying to get ... it's very very tough for marine traffic and only the smallest boats accountable and you can get down there because the water gets so shallow down\nThere you know people have been around the state for some decades remember when when all those rivers are covered up by the Crawford Street Bridge is right and other things and it was a real visionary bold step into the city and the federal government took to actually uncover those ... down to the waterfront and then the result has been things like water fire as a great great\nUm regular event when the river but yes a workplace parking the rivers that feed it or something in rapidly um the river does need to be dredged and the base and there needs to be dredged I Will say\nA that's a short term fix one of the things that needs to happen is that the cities and towns who's a land drains into those rivers in the workplace they have to control the sentiment that his washed into the catch basins right whenever it rains so just piling up and piling up the\nAmish ethic of Alaska tuck it coming in from what North dominance and it's very uncertain and everything\nAnd think about how do you think about the highway systems the state's ... roads that are all\nYou know what the right idea and in the water oil gripped Greece or a litter plastics everything is pie is just being dumped into these rivers into the base and so that does need to be cleaned up and also hopefully we can use this opportunity if the state in the cities and towns to take more like preventative measures\nRight absolutely insist that we don't get rich so quickly right and it's expensive but again to choose for for at least a little traffic on the water to make them pass because there's almost no water there especially I guess the tide comes up a certain level of we've seen that the base and flood a little bit when the when the when the water from\nSay the the foot of water if I actually held a um symbolic Tea Party out on one of the flaps\nThey did as exposed [laughter] well you're very low tide it's not it's\nIt's it's right there certainly is just a couple of inches of water right there so you're you're listening to talk to the voice for him but he's director of advocacy it saved the day he is speaking with this

the age he can help you math out your plans for retirement when you called today here's the phone number four zero one\nThree three three eight thousand now you're the kind of person who welcomes a little chaos and your financial life maybe you have are those Mannix the wings are one extreme to the other and you don't mind that occasional roller coaster ride with your assets well you're probably really enjoyed\nA certain two week period back in February and\nEarlier this month here in October that's when volatility came back with a stomach turning vengeance in the stock market\nAnd a lot of people were anxious about that especially if they neared retirement and with this increased volatility there does come this sense of financial vulnerability sometimes especially if you are getting close to that retirement finish line\nBut today Jeff we're going to provide our listeners with an antidote to this feeling of anxiety and vulnerability and we're going to talk about the wild market swings and what we can do to gain some more confidence we're going to turn to some fundamental than you're going to give us Jeff perspective\nOn the recent market volatility\nOr short you know when you're talking about stock market volatility you know little context is important first let's define volatility\nIt's basically rapid unpredictable and significant movements in the value of an equity such as a particular share a company stock or if it's the entire equity market you know the stock market as people refer to it\nYou know in technical terms for the mathematicians I might be listening it's a measure called standard deviation now that in simple terms mean how much is going to move up or down for what you expected to be that's a tried to make things as simple as you\nKnow again I forgot to in some of the stuff not easy to make simple let's face it\nUm for contacts let's look back at twenty Seventy one of the strongest performing years for the market in recent history you know we saw steady sometimes spectacular bull market we also so one of the least about two years on record so the stock market according to key index measurements\nOf twenty Seventeen was the first year since Nineteen Ninety five without a three percent decline in the U.S and the five hundred\nLike about that since Nineteen Ninety five you know and that is some tea tends to move a lot more than that\nThe highest was two point eight percent in in change now historically there have been three or four pulled back in the pull back is to find is five percent a corrections ten and bear market is twenty percent\nSo when you look at it there's generally been three or four pull back so five percent or more every single year as typically as well as one ten percent or more correction so you know when you look at it we went through a long period of time\nBought a group wants your car any make any model what pays more than anything or around because we're a certified buying center had well by yours even if you don't buy hours logged onto our car buyers are tough\nAgain for zero one three three three eight thousand\nToday with the F word talking financial fundamental back and help those of us who are nearing retirement or already retired get off the roller coaster and worry less about wild fluctuations and the value of our assets now the first fundamental is asset diversification suggest what's your next recommendation\nWell this next one and actually also related to asset allocation in diversification heading into retirement it's important not only to maintain a strong cash reserve\nBut to be prepared to use it when the situation words no flexibility is key in managing your assets in your income sources for your retirement years a cash reserve\nProvides options is how and when you draw your retirement income you know let's say the value of the investment portfolio from what you're drawing all of a sudden drop substantially\nWell that's a time when instead of drawing from that depleted value account\nPerhaps you can draw from the bank and said\nThere's just one of those options so rather than selling off stock or some other assets to generate that income\nYou know it's just like All right let me leave that alone for now and let's go into our more protected places that didn't lose out and withdraw from them\nWhich again goes back to our philosophy of splitting assets typically in a fifty fifty mode so that we have fifty percent in what we refer to as protected positions and the fifty percent being invested directly into the stock market\nSo that gives us a balance and we can show that it absolutely reduces your level of risk on the entirety of your portfolio and we use a specialized software that gauges risking your current portfolio that will analyze for you when you call in but\nWe also use that when we prepare to build a new portfolio for you if that's appropriate for us to do for you\nTo talk to the size of the cash reserve what do you recommend that we should have in this reserve and where do we keep the money\nYou know that number can really be all over the place I'm at a recent summer I shared where I've met with some people that had a boatload of money in the ... almost a half a million dollars and they only had five thousand dollars in the bank\nFor for emergencies and I'm like well you know why is that so did you just recently spend a lot of nice to know that we figure that's enough for us as well what if you have an emergency that you really need a a chunk of money well we'll take it from a four O. one K.\nAnd I'm like shaking my head going wow that is not a good plan\nIt is important to have emergency money to me it's that kind of part of your foundation so that you have a certain amount that you know is absolutely there for you or another term than I use this as one of my other high highly technical terms that I think you'll like Meghan it's called pillow money\n[laughter] about money do I didn't my pillows\nNo it's just that when you're a head hits the pillow at night you're comfortable and confident because you have X dollars\nSet aside like technical [laughter]\nYou know and I I've been calling it that literally for decades you know and everybody's pillows sizes different ... somebody recently sold the business they had over a million in the bank\nThat's way too much so I talked about the pillow money and I said so what would be your pillow number and they said well probably half a million I said okay I think that's a little high but if that's what it takes you to sleep well at night that you know you've got a half a million in the bank\nFine just understand that you will probably be losing money on that half a million because the lower rates of return\nAnd it's taxable and you have inflation and when you factor all that together even though you might be making two and a half percent after taxes and inflation at best you're even\nSo you've got zero growth going on there so it might be a little much but that's their number and if that's their numbers and we work with the balance of the portfolio and structured as we feel is appropriate and then we kind of walk them through this is what we're going to do with your portfolio and this is why this is why we put some protests\nFlood Lincoln is southern Rhode Island for a mere luxury dealer featuring Lincoln's explicit letter of Lincoln and Casey Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the all new twenty Eighteen Lincoln Navigator for Lincoln if there are against it unparalleled luxury impeccable surface\nShe their vision in their goals for their future in their retirement years\nSo it's that commonsense approach to your emergency money and your investments and retirement income sounds appealing to you\nIf you save two hundred thousand or more of your retirement the number here in Madison associate thing is for one three three three eight thousand remember we are a local farm\nStarted the company right here born and raised in Rhode Island and my mom still lives in the house I was born in which is pretty awesome that doesn't happen all that often so you're not dialing a one eight hundred who knows where you calling somebody from out of state\nYou dealing with local advisors right here they kinda know Rhode Island no kind of our mindset 'cause we might think a little differently than others and that number again is for one three three three eight thousand we look forward to your call\nI've had that terrific website for you to check out if you want to head over to nasty and money dot com you'll learn more about Jeff and his team Massey has battled N. A. S. S. E. Y. diversifying our assets jak told us about that keeping a cash reserves cue great fundamentals\nYou help us whether the volatility storm and now that we had those\nFundamental they go hand in hand you have anything else we can learn\nWhile the songs but you know we are limited to an hour [laughter] shut everybody [laughter] you know and yeah the next fundamental has to do a psychology and our mindset\nYou know maintaining focus on the long term investment goals in the big picture\nIs important because that will help keep your market behavior whether that's a positive or negative in perspective and hopefully help you resist the urge to make those knee jerk reactions about your assets that don't support your long term goals\nNow stock market volatility can drive some to make shall we say panic driven you know knee jerk decisions that's not a good idea\nReminding yourself of your long term retirement strategy and goals and the fact\nThat retirement could last Fifteen twenty twenty five or more years you know helps you remain clear headed in the face of volatility now recently the Providence Journal had an article where they were recognizing a woman in Rhode Island that was a hundred and ten years old we are living longer there's no doubt about that\nIn the city of east granted it's just recognize one of their residents in town who is a hundred and one\nYou know so we are absolutely living longer so you need to keep the long term perspective in place so that you're not scared when when this volatility and the other part of that if you are that\nTouchy with the volatility of the market that would lend me to say that you may be to expose and perhaps you have too much of your money in the market\nSo that's a real good reason why use your goal three three three thousand have us analyze your current portfolio for you we do it on a complementary basis so it's not going to cost you anything and you will get an absolute mind full of information about your current holdings as well as your level of risk\nAs measured by a particular software called risk alive so I don't know but here again for a one three three three eight thousand if you save two hundred thousand or more we'd be happy to meet with you and take you through a process\nThat's four zero one three three three eight thousand if you'd like more information to start working with Jack on your retirement your chair yet let me ask you what types of panic driven ... typically the when volatility is high in the stock market\nWell I think it kind of stems from the the mindset that some people have that they have to check their balances in the stock market every day every week you know and they get consumed with what's going on in the market and that tends to raise your level of anxiety\nSo I think that's that's not a good thing and if you're there checking your your stuff every day you know it's almost like [laughter]\nYou know you know people that have it any type of an addiction and and I don't mean to make light of this we have an addiction it's like you can't stop yourself\nWell there are some folks that are addicted to checking their their market account every day and I think that's counterproductive and for most people that is not a healthy thing to do because the market you have to understand will go up and down\nAnd they could do both every day so why kind of wrap yourself into that every day kind of thinking when you\nCan hire a professional that's going to handle that for you and then you can just enjoy your retirement years because that's what we try to do for our listeners we set up their their program there\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it taught you financed with blood was born in East Berlin a generic ended up the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on the boards also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nIt does and then we have some that is invested in the market that does go up or down based on what's going on in the market however were not investing that part of it\nOr in a very aggressive manner we tend to skew on the conservative or conservative moderate scale but when we take that any contacts with the other position that you can't lose we lower the overall risk of your portfolio to a very low number and we'll show you that\nSo if you save two hundred thousand or more fuel retirement aren't local number of years for one three three three eight thousand one of our advisors will sit with you get a sense of what your vision is for your retirement legos you want to achieve and then we'll look at the uh current holdings that you have\nWe believe that fix the new these can fit in that space and there are two different general categories\nThere are some that are really built just for um the protective side if you will where they can't go down at the stock market goes down\nUm and they're good for accumulation and then you can just withdraw as you feel you need to\nAnd then within certain restrictions on my dad because with the fixing it would just one of the downsides\nIs that you generally are only allowed a percentage that you can withdraw each year now most of the plans\nAre ten percent that you can take out each year\nSome of them are at seven percent of very small number restricted to five percent withdrawal\nNow in the context of a of an overall plan none of those are problematic because the other half of your portfolio is fully liquid and you have access to that money pretty much anytime you want it and just say three or four days for us to sell things input and get the money put into your account\nSo it's very simple but a fix the newly or can be a very good way either for accumulation or the other category is for guaranteed retirement income and we do a fair amount of that type of planning\nBecause many of her clients and it seems more so our our lady listeners are concerned about making sure that they get that income for the rest of their life and what what I hear most is I I don't want to become a bag lady when I get older [laughter] and\nYou know I kind of laugh but it's a very serious thought that they have they're very they're that concerned about ensuring that they have an income that they can rely on for the rest of their life\nSo that's a type of planning you would like to take advantage of our number here messing associates is for all won three three three eight thousand if you save two hundred thousand or more of your retirement we'll look forward to your call\nNature you check out cats website dedicated ... and money dot com for more information now the south and A. S. S. E. Y. as a non volatile source of guaranteed income for retirement we do know\nThat ... can be a viable option for some of that's just the type of annuity is going to allow us to avoid volatility\nWell if avoiding volatility and guaranteeing income other goals then we're talking about the effects than it would eases my preference I'm not a big fan of variable annuities because they tend to be a little on the expensive side\nNow the fix the new to come in different varieties you know there's the immediate annuities you know you pay single premium they stop paying you the next month and they'll pay you for whatever term or you have chosen whether it's five years ten years the rest of your life et cetera\nOther types of annuities begin payments at some point in the future and those who just called deferred incoming annuities so one of my favorite times\nIs an income annuity that is structured so that we do a single transfer into the ... in it accumulates and the preset\nPercentage now this is by contract as an example um there are many different companies out there so let me just pick a number so let's say it's six and a half percent and that's your roll up number\nAnd that's just a number I'm just picking for an example it's not any particular product because actually our products are better than that but let's just she was six and a half\nEvery year that you defer the six and a half percent will be added to your income account value\nNow you will still be tracking the market and if the market goes down you earn zero but at the market goes up you share and some of that growth now what's important to understand what those particular types of programs they're not geared for you to make a lot of money\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine Vermont flood of every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nBust example at six and a half percent every year so if you have a ten year period that you can differ well it'll go up six and a half percent compounding for ten years\nNo if you need it in two or three years you can also take it in two or three years you'll only get six and a half percent for two or three years and then you turn on your income from that account\nThere are really a wonderful type program and the base product that they're on there was a report out by a professor from Gail Roger Rabbit some that clearly says these fixed index based annuities should be seriously considered\nAs you look to where you should put your money compared to putting your money into bonds as we move forward and the basic premise of that is because when a rising interest rate environment and as a as\nInterest rates continue to rise bond holdings are going to have more downward pressure on their pricing so you're you're likely going to earn more with the fixing the state's annuity then you are in the bond moving forward because of this rising interest rate environment\nNow that's not my opinion that was if it's in summary if you will based on researching the market for Ninety year period\nAnd that's what they came up with in their report that came out in January twenty eighty\nSo if what we have been speaking about today
