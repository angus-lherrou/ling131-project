I'm Sorry yes like\nAnd I'm Lisa Murkowski is they can hear them and you're looking at the wrong thing\nThe conservative woman it's going to be a little tougher for them to go after the way they are going up to Capitol\nWell yeah I mean first of all I think uh they'll do it slightly better job of vetting even though Kavanaugh the appeals court justice so that means that he's in\nA district court justice and he's an appeals court so this should have come out a long time ago and whatever vetting process the Senate and the White House does uh so it's it is surprising that it would take this long to surface in the same court nomination process\nBut it's just about you know what the conservatives want from the same court and it doesn't really matter for them if it's cabin or any calmer bad or whomever so when you're looking at them it's a partisan loyalty\nYou have to say to yourself you know the long game is if I vote against this guy and I told her nomination and I'm Still here I mean I get anything for me I mean I get any for Alaska and I think that they both got reelected recently Murkowski in college so I just don't see any defections and the ride around\nAnd flake of maybe wants to run for president and he's got to you know he's got a lot of Republicans in Arizona who you know are gonna be mad at him if he doesn't vote in the full Senate vote for confirmation\nExcept here's

I just think the world's going to be a different place so he's got to decide\nAnd it's really about now for Kavanaugh the temperament like yet right you know he he gave a very strong performance in some people's minds\nOn Thursday and other people's minds he looked like a guy who couldn't really say control to the question is do you want to put this person on the court for the next Thirty years and he stays healthy and that's a that's a question I think that's plaguing flaking Murkowski and Collins but in the end of the day\nI don't think McConnell it's getting all the vote if he really didn't think he had to vote\nYup production or Kevin ... passes this all blows over and uh\nWhen the Supreme Court justices picked we started yet\nWe do start again but we'll have to see what happens
