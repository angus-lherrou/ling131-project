B. R. oh\nWe are back sucked federally this is intellectual medicine enjoying a beautiful Saturday morning so people are complaining about the red Sox having the place so late you know this is our little head into the world series yes you'll get my predictions\nSo I had a um you know my uh my cousin Dave ... who had a good take on that chat and he said really people\nYou're going to the world series and you're complaining that you have to stay awake late I get it you know it's not ideal but do you think the people in Oakland or St Louis would be liking to have this problem ... they could have been nice and early you know why because their teams are terrible [laughter] they're out of the playoffs\nAre so so the red Sox are historically great team that are going to crush their National League opponents\nIt'll be it'll be like four games to one it's going to be quick\nAnd painless for the opposition I don't see either one Los Angeles who Milwaukee having a shot I Am reading from Milwaukee though you know I Tyler you don't want that because they're Milwaukee Parma but what's it going for it LA LA loses this a playoff series everybody in Los Angeles will just go to the next thing\nWhat are they going to do in Milwaukee what do you do in Milwaukee on a cold November night I I don't know I mean hopefully\nThey don't get shot by somebody in a van with testosterone or estrogen\nNo that's good we that's the van and we want so we want to go to Milwaukee now he was at the end of a worldwide it's a worldwide we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna make it compulsory you know looking at me like why do you do that well because we've got to get back to what we said we would which is so that's a good idea though Tyler I think\nWe should make a hormones mandatory that is we should go to the senior centers and you know everybody at age fifty you must you are required to think about what they do it with immunizations\nThey know what's good for your health or so they say well why don't you know free hormones are but if so why not why everybody needs to be on hormones look you have two choices in life\nWhen it comes to hormones you will either go on hormone therapy or you will suffer the consequences of their absence now the consequences are absent is commonly perceived as normal aging\nNormal by who's standard who's the fighting health for you or you defining it for yourself okay so here's part of my definition the absence of shrinking I like not shrinking\nPreservation of muscle mass I like not having my muscles disappear preservation of bone you take away hormones bones shrink muscles shrink the brain atrophy Z genitals shrink mental clarity shrinks mood decreases irritability increases\nThese are all known consequences\nOf what is known as the ... was the window of time during which a woman ceases to be reproductive can often start as early as mid thirties and even earlier than that\nWith the loss of testosterone and an adverse effect from that demand it's sometimes referred to as the Android pause tends to ... to a ... a little bit later but they also perceived that effect of decreasing testosterone right\nIncreasing percent body fat typical scenario you go to the doctor and feeling tired I've lost my sex drive my strength and power are diminishing I'm finding myself to be irritable short tempered you know I've read about Dr\nHormone replacement in low testosterone syndrome and I'm Wondering if I have that\nEnters the ... the most doctors do the blood just tell you\nHow would you like motor trench twenty I can trust that the only one Ninety nine will say hello to forge twenty eight Ford F. one fifty a best friend for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars for not only at flood forward in eastern enjoy I guess it\nIs normal aging no we'd beg to differ and were supported in large measure by a growing consensus amongst anti aging and hormones specialist people like me people like shed and people like Dr Michael ... that make it their business to study this in ...\nSo the consequences by the way of introducing new knowledge into the field of medicine is instant negative feedback on the part of most of your colleagues\nThere's this there's a standard of care that exist out there that goes something like this\nIf I haven't heard about it it must not be any good and therefore it must be bad so I'm going to reject it before I even consider it some of your experiences phenomenon if you go to your doctor you've done some research and say gee document been reading about testosterone right away some doctors not all some doctors are very engaged open minded\nDare I say they have the spirit of intellectual medicine running through their veins and they engage you on your research\nAnd you can do this research has got to Google it very cool anybody now as a medical library in the computer\nSo the hormone therapy the big knock on it has been the women's health initiative that correlated with an increase breast cancer risk is was from the Nineteen nineties\nFurther study and reflection now has revealed that estrogen just not caused breast cancer there was a trend toward decreasing cancer\nWith non oral route to the ministry should so we start to analyze this data further and we're seeing the type of estrogen the type of hormone replacement matters\nYou don't want to put artificial hormones in your body if it can be avoided you want things that have ... an identical molecular structure to what your body has all we're always had\nAnd you don't want to just use estrogen you do want by white down Ikle testosterone\nEspecially if you're a woman so I had a woman who was honored testosterone therapy Shannon feeling great energies great powers great everything's great she goes to a doctor who just as horrified and told you must stop that instantly you're going to grow a beard your voice will get deep and it's going to give you a cancer\nWrong wrong wrong properly dose there's no masculine is Asian from testosterone it preserves your feminine attributes\nThen properly dose there's zero evidence of an increase cancer risk of any sort there is some evidence that there may be a cancer protective merit that's an unproven theory both the clinical evidence points in that direction\nAs does the research based outcomes\nSo for women please lay down your fear factor and look at this the rational I\nI guess that other question how long should I be on my hormone in the answer until they closed the lid on your casket there's no reason nor benefit from stopping woman therapy at any point in time in my opinion and research will support that\nTheir um current standard of care in the orthodox medical world which by the way we do not concur with is that you only use estrogen for a brief period of time to get you through your menopause your hot flashes then you stop it\nWhy why would you deprive women have this benefit why so they can become aged so they can with her so I heard someone say the other day and you know I heard this cliche men age like wine women age like milk that's unfair categorization\nThat is a consequence of apps and hormones you look at the difference now and we see them every day the difference between people practicing active anti aging therapies and those who are not it is your choice it doesn't make someone better because they define health\nAs preservation of youthful attributes\nBut in today's culture in today's medical environment at least in the moment you still have that choice\nWhy do you have that choice because some courageous doctors and we count ourselves among them along with Dr ... along with you there is some courageous health care providers that are willing to give this to you despite the risks to their professional status\nBecause when you do things that are not part of the orthodoxy they're not part of the mainstream you risk repercussion negative repercussions it's called consensus medicine and what does consensus medicine mean rural doing things the same if we're all doing it the same than we must all be correct\nAnd if somebody is doing things differently think intellectual medicine the consent\nLooking for a car credit not great well isn't it time you financed with blood was born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent if your for Seventy two months you can be driving on a force also models interest free log onto what auto dot com\nAnd their theories in philosophy\nThen the consensus must be flawed\nAnd we feel the consensus in many cases is flawed and deserves criticism it needs to be scrutinized and you do your listeners need to have those options and you're not going to get them by going to the usual sources\nHealth care is not dispensed at hospitals it's not dispensed at most clinics it is not a commodity in bestowed upon you by your insurance company\nFor your child gender well you're on TALK about confusing like these kids come [laughter] why there is some parents that are raising their children undeclared they are going to let them grow up to me what they want to be wow that's going to tell them when they had a peanut fat [laughter]\nGamble ... some of my daughter when the kids with tiny young of\nCourse and you know ... my daughter has is one girl amongst for boys\nAnd at one point I was giving her bachelors to meet your dad 'cause what am I gonna grow peanuts was a child perspective so maybe something so you mean that you mean to say that if I were in the way back machine and I was starting over again\nThat I Would have the prerogative of choosing either gender bad about it\nI I got to show that's not good I Would be one ugly woman chef I cannot were anyhow we got to talk about these ten years that's what I was at so for for\nIt's twelve limited fourteen five things don't use tobacco\nDon't abuse alcohol exercise on a regular basis\nEat fought fully and the fifth one is maintain a healthy body weight now are those four things\nWe know intellectual medicine that for a large percentage of patients maintaining a healthy body weight is not under your control completely because for many people diet and exercise totally sales\nAnd for the majority of folks fighting their weight it is a medical disorder\nIt does require physician guided care in many cases to support the type of nutritional change required that often benefits from prescription drug therapy\nIn use of neutral pseudo goals that's the tri lateral approach that we use with such overwhelming success you know they put that cabinet individual cases may very well individual failures are rare when we pursue the intellectual medicine pathway\nThan duct issues that has a skill set and we are trying hard to spread the message people we along with the AMA and the American Medical Association which in two thousand and Thirteen declared obesity to be a medical disorder\nDr George pray one of the leaders in weight loss study described as well and I'll paraphrase him obesity is a metabolic neurotransmitter medical disorder that his discriminated against by society and by doctors themselves\nIf you ever see a health care provider and they tell you to diet and exercise to lose weight you need another opinion\nIf you referred to a nutritionist to lose weight you need another referral these pathways have been worn out over the last ... years decades and have been shown to be ineffective and it leads to this perception that's the only thing we can do is caught\nIn surge arise let's tightest together so those are the big five right so let's check the ... day for what love the next five um it was in the article was in circulation man they they did a a meta analysis\nLooking at different lifestyle factors and they were surprised that the profound impact of these five things I Know it seems like common sense right\nBy the slick buckle your seatbelt you'll likely to go through the windshield but you know it's it's nice to have some of these things kind of validated\nBut a study this was from the journal the American Medical Association and what they did is they looked at a hundred and twenty two thousand people just from the Cleveland Clinic over more than a decade people that had cardiac stress testing so they measured their fitness level and then they looked at their longevity\nAnd they found that people who are out of shape had three times increased risk of adverse outcome than cigarette smokers simply put they\nLooking for a car credit not played well isn't it taught you financed with blood born in east Greenwich and they were against that have the best financed raising prices in cars with zero percent

measured and it doesn't mean people that you can smoke abused drugs and go for jogging you'll be okay you write what it means is that the fitness thing seems to really matter\nThat in this study anyhow they didn't find 'em an increased risk with increasing intensity of exercise\nNow we of course of a different philosophy we do feel that there's a diminished return as you push the envelope of intensity that more it's not necessarily better now what they measured was cardiovascular fitness you know ability to run stamina\nI'm interested in seeing this study's correlating and they're out there looking at power strengthen muscle preservation because those also correlate so if you like us value vitality and strength you will make part of your life a regular routine of fitness\nBecause that's been a powerful correlate of life extension right ten plus years now we maintain yet hormones to that mix and ... you got power you got power in your hands\nNow what should you avoid well you should have you got to be careful with medicine people can I tell you a hospital's a dangerous doctors well we do a lot of harm now when we come back I'm going to share with you some key things to avoid\nWhen it comes to protecting yourself from the negative consequences of western medicine\nThe application of drug therapy the reliance upon surgical remedies for things that are better treated
