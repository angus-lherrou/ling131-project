Saudis at this point more or less have confirmed that an unsuspecting Jamal Chris Yogi walked into a Saturday a consulate and that's the amount turkey it's them both turkey to be tortured and killed over a seven minute period\nNow that's bad not good but\nThose things happen in that part of the world all the time if you steal something you chop off your hands\nAnd women are hand or use source chopped their heads off on a regular basis a woman who commits adultery stoned to death in the public square nasty violence is happening all the time and that part of the world according to CNN especially we're not supposed to get twisted into knots\nAnd drop our support the president and want to blow up America's relationship with Saudi Arabia which could cost us a half a trillion dollars and now Saudi Arabia has a relationship with Israel as a counterbalance against Iran ... drop all of that because the Saudi Arabian was killed in Turkey\nI don't get it I don't understand and the other thing\nThe moral outrage felt by CNN is not\nHow would you like motor trench twenty or keep track of the year for only one I mean I Will say hello to foot boards twenty eighty four to one fifty up front for the best price anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars from us only at point forward and he joined the Oregon but\nAn Ellis who was killed in May of ah twenty uh Thirteen about five years ago his killer is not apprehended CNN did not even a report is death\nThis year in America about one hundred cops are going to be killed the great majority of the perpetrators will be located but on the other hand some what I'll be located\nYou mean to tell me that the death of ... ... has more impacted my life and then the death of a police officer or the death of a truck driver or the murder of a college student in Iowa\nOr a school teacher or a child\nInnocent kids or kidnapped and raped in America all the time young black men about seven hundred will be gone down in the south side of Chicago women are raped and brutalized tortured on a regular basis\nHappens are inside of America much less in other parts of the world so why is the media focusing on a murder and turkey\nBecause if it's a journalist excuse me ... show was not a journalist there was a part time contributor to the Washington Post but even if he was quote a journalist\nDoes that have more value to me that a police officer or someone to someone I American soldier killed absolutely not\nYou know I I'm waiting for the outrage from CNN about forty Mexican journalist\nMurdered in the past two years in Mexico by drug cartels have you heard about any of their you know who they are\nTo me the show the narrative as a hustle it's fake news it's a ploy used to attack Donald J Trump to undermine his Middle East policy which is works so well they're exploring his death and weaponize is death\nAs a cudgel against the Trump stir that's what's going on\nBut I guarantee you he his wife is no more value than a truck drivers lie for cops life a soldier's life or waitresses why for coal miners life a taxi drivers life all the might be murdered brutally tortured happens all the time\nIn American elsewhere so why is the death of a Saudi Arabian in Turkey big news\nBecause the media wants to use that as a club against the president and his Middle East policy and I think there is those at CNN and mainstream media that do not do not like the fact that Israel now has a friend in Saudi Arabia\nThey don't like that\nAnd I thought the half million Syrians killed by Iran and by Russia by barrel bombs any of those lives have meaning to CNN no because they cannot be used as a weapon against this president they want to act as if when Trump says bad things about journalist so Maui indirectly cause the death of Jamal could show gay\nIn Turkey who now believes this crap it's unbelievable but let's continue\nBlonde becomes available which are never does one eight six six six or seven seven three three seven the thing is\nTonight if we can focus on illegal migrants swelling to ten thousand found to reach the U.S supported by the Democratic party incentivize rather mainstream media and the fact that Jamal could show gate if he was my father if he was my brother\nI'd be outrage at is deaths that we should not have died\nSaudi Arabians do this all the time Syrians Iranians Iraqis inside of America there are several hundred black guys killed every year in Chicago and one hundred dead cops can you name one cop killed in America this year give me the name and your mind ... give me the name of one cup right now\nAnd then I hear about ... as if Trump indirectly killed the guy that is what CNN is getting too and why why is his wife more valuable than a cubs life\nMPR ... which is subsidized by the taxpayers is the same I end up look at the head of the past set up a respect us they under the oil as political opponents right both\nBush and Obama and Secretary Clinton looked at the other way at that guy because we needed to face the supply Afghanistan\nPlus there and says African Business conference that Obama held fifty African leaders and I think the daily mail newspaper looked at it and it was the ... gallery of human rights violators and corrupt officials but you know\nLuckily in his southern Rhode Island's premier luxury dealer during Lincoln's explicit land of Lincoln MTC Lincoln Lincoln MTV and the only twenty ... Lincoln Navigator one Lincoln of never again on parallel Marjorie impeccable\nLooking at the human rights background of the best part fortress African leaders so the whole thing is sick\nOr not and and you want to quickly but use backers than had a leader\nWho would boil alive is political opponents and while that was going on Obama and Hillary replace your footing around with this guy and the media that that was no big deal right there boil alive your political opponents that's okay because Obama\nHad the relationship and Hillary had their relationship and use baggage than the media didn't tell me that at all did they\nKnow and you know it's funny there are people on NPR that work to our to our to our show every week and and they make three hundred thousand dollars\nPlus a year now see that's fine except\nI don't want to subsidize them you know ... you know why should we pay rent the ... PBS but you know like Facebook and Google and Microsoft Starbucks than Amazon let them pay for it or people that like it in San Francisco or Boston but why is the average horrible taxpayer have subsidized in the yard that\nThe clowns they have on that\nStation on a regular basis with their little bias propaganda\nAnd then there's hundreds hundreds of rent their ears and thousand radios nations there's five hundred television stations but we taxpayer subsidized PBS and NPR for what reason what what's the purpose is because they're left wing liberal Democrats and the Republican Party has no ... that's why it's done\nRight well I'm not for killing people but I mean hell no words you know like it's not a nice after\nUtopian world it's like ... and the costs of walk human life is very cheap around the world and you know but people who pick and troops there are ... dust spots or should be kept them and and that's the media thank you\nAnd your great thank you for your call let's go to Jim in Chicago the belly of the beast gym in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Jim go ahead\nThings are just to let you know I uh I have a home in San Pedro Sula Honduras and I'm also a resident of the country and I am totally opposed to what's going up going on\nAnd tell me since you you spent time in Honduras talk about the circumstances and violent the economy well you know it is it's\nIt's kinda like it because if you live in Chicago I live in Chicago it all you hear about from people that love other place they ... they're talking about Al Capone about violence but it's like any section you know there's a lot of wonderful places there sure there's a lot of stability in that area is however\nPart of the problem is the government there doesn't do things well they think like Obama they just want to raise taxes\nFor example if you go to a restaurant order food it's Fifteen Percent sales tax on food and if you order like a like a drink it's Eighteen percent tax for a drink at a restaurant you know and plus the value of the ... has been sliding to the dollar is up to twenty four limbs per dollar used to be just fears that goes like twenty\nJune ... is the government democratically elected one isn't\nWell this last election there was a big uh uh the same as his initials or a jail age\nBecause he used to be before Honduras just had one term for four years [laughter]\nAnd then when the bomb was president he somehow was able to get their legislature\nTo make a two terms and people didn't like that and there was a lot of writing in the streets in fact they closed 'em [noise] uh they're they're called the ... they're called welders\nWhat they did is they close on all the highways and stuff so people couldn't get to the airport and actually suspended flights in San Pedro a couple of times because of that\nAnd and what they did this last time he'll have these these like toll booth leaving the city there's three ... three major toll booths and they they just burn them out there just destroyed the buildings and the toll booths are no longer collecting tolls\nAnd that's a that's a major hit you know and and that's that's just it's amazing when I was down there the one time I couldn't actually get home I had to wait for two days\nYou could hear the gunfire in the background 'cause San Pedro was like a huge valley surrounded by mountains\nAre generally you what's the life for the average Honduran huh what's it like\nWell if you have money you do well if you're poor or you don't want to be there because there is no public

keep\nRaising the price of energy [laughter] you know my water bill's gone up you know the fifty percent of the last four or five years\nSo it's a broken society nothing's working and it's getting worse than\nThat nothing but it could be a better manage just put it that way\nWell who's doing the managing it is in a military democratically elected it doesn't matter and Honduras\nWell the president was actually reelected the second time but a lot of people thought he stole the election that's why there's a lot of writing the streets and that's why they had these strikes you know\nBut that's all kind of died down now but the problem is you know they keep raising the prices of everything [noise] so if you're if you're stuck down there and you're not you don't have a job where you

from sympathetic Mexicans offering food water and clothing the coverage of our media indicates that uh they're joining it up against the Trump stir our media believes that somehow that this event with tens of thousands\nOf individuals coming from those violent countries on earth is a net negative for the president I Do not believe that\nI think the main reason that Trump won the president said twenty sixteen and that Republicans will keep the house and when the keep the house and the Senate in about two weeks will be the fact\nUm the rules are based on laws that were passed years ago sometimes generations ago and they are in perverted by the administrative agency to give them the authorities issue all these new rules\nAnd the court can look at that legislation again and say wait a minute\nYou've gone too far that Congress did not give you the authority to make this rule and there are a number of examples in the book where um you can see that the ... that the agency has gotten well beyond what Congress actually authorize so\nIf the court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude as necessary that's why the book is called forward it to they have to have the strength\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations of um of administrative agencies then we can actually began to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington\nPeter Wallison let's go back in time does not hot summer in Philadelphia in Seventeen Ninety seven article one they said the founding fathers said and we believe that the Congress the house in the Senate or the most powerful instrument talents or government because of the best reflects the will of the people\nIn reality at least for the past two years it\nWas perceived Congress is number one it\nWas received the president's number two and they and the court system is number three in reality number one is not the Congress one might say it's the presidency is the most powerful number two is the current number three is the Congress and Congress\nIs feckless foolish any relevant and and so when the founding fathers saying if they were transported from Seventeen eighty seven to twenty Eighteen and October twenty Eighteen and\nThey looked at the situation today when the Congress is foolish in fact one is\nI think it would be amazed amazed but when they studied it for a while I think they would understand why this happened and I think the reason is that the courts have given administrative agencies not the president actually it's administered evasion which even the president doesn't control and they'd given administrative agencies\nSo much authority by passing laws that are very very general that are sort of goals oriented laws and that gives the agency's tremendous authority to make the major decisions that they should not be making Congress should make the major decisions the agencies should only be filling in\nThe details and owned unfortunately overtime because Congress has because the courts have not stepped in to stop this\nCongress has been encouraged to pass these very general laws then they go home to their constituents and they say you see I solve this problem for you and when the constituent complains about some new regulation that's come out the congressman says oh well I didn't vote for that\nThat's the administrative agency and what the what the constituent unfortunately doesn't recognize is that the congressman has to take responsibility has to be accountable for that because the Congress men did not vote for legislation that restricted\nThe independent agency in what it was able or what it was able to produce the laws with just two general and what will happen now if the court\nAccess I Hope they will ask you is that they will begin to look carefully at the underlying statutes and say this you did not have this authority no you are not given this authority by Congress so you cannot make this rule that goes beyond what Congress intended\nOf course one of the things came up during the um during the hearings in the confirmation Brent Kavanaugh a couple of weeks ago was the fact that uh the United States Congress is exceedingly weak and not really because they're so weak the liberals the progressive\nWonder Chevy GMC Honda and Toyota and Subaru all have in common there are all in for Steve free own condition and what board and he's really Janeiro or against the wind over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices log on to flood Otto John John now\nWhether it's gay marriage or abortion or whether it's immigration whatever it is there are certain things that are so unpopular in America and the Congress or foolish in fact close therefore they look toward the court system to be a second legislature and that was never intended by anybody in fact one might argue to go back to your original point\nThe administrative state is more powerful than the United States Congress\nAnd might be more powerful the most powerful branch of government is ... is the administrator state\nSomething called the deep state not have been in existence for years if not decades and what they want to do is simply outlast as president and outlast the court and continue to exist so is the administrator state right now more powerful than the Congress\nYeah I think undoubtedly it is it is making the rules that uh we live under and Congress was supposed to do that\nAnd there is a way to address that as I say and I think it's the courts where to step in on a read the statute as they were written by Congress they would be able to say to administrative agencies you have gone too far to the extent that they do that\nWe have some control over the administrative agencies and the effect that will be\nTo force Congress to begin to act because if what the administrative agency has done is something that the American people would like and the courts have said no you weren't given that authority by Congress the American people will then go to Congress and say we want\nLegislation that does this um if it's something they didn't like then Congress won't be pressured and the agencies\nWill will not be able to make the rule anyway but the point is we're a democracy and in a democracy the people's views should prevail and that's not what's happening in the under the current law system\nAnd give me an example of the four or five years ago Obama was saying look I'm the president I'm not the grand potent tantamount the dictator I cannot give dreamers certain rights to be in this country because the laws against that\nBy by the time a president or run away president in my view Obama was a runaway president when he came to legal immigration and it just created new laws out of a ... that had nothing to do with the Congress and bought a time that gets up to the United States Supreme court and takes one to three years even get there\nAnd in the meantime the dreamers have done with the dreamers are going to do and you may like or dislike what Obama is doing but at the president is set that through the eyes or ins\nThe president can do anything you want why why can't the next president doing anything he wants in other words it isn't a substance it it's the rule making ability of the administrators state that ... that have been they've usurped the power that Congress\nYeah well you're you're correct as long as the courts and I'm here speaking principally of the Supreme Court does not act once this Supreme Court lays down the rule that says\nThis is the we are going to be reading statutes as they were written\nA then it gives all kinds of people who are who would like to challenge administrative rules or even presidential decisions an opportunity to go right into the district court and get a ruling and what we've seen in the last year\nMany times is district courts have been making rulings against the Trump Administration and the reason they are able to do that is that the Supreme Court has not has not\nPlaced any kinds of strict limitations on what the court kitten do in fact what the what the Supreme Court has done in this so called Chevron case centrally said\nTo the to the court you should defer to what the administrative agency\nAnd interpreting their own law yeah\nAnd that of course has given them license to do whatever they want\nYou know it has to stop I took home your book last night to read a ... page Ninety four I Know you have a chart beginning in Nineteen Ninety three which was not a long time ago on may twenty five years Clinton was in the White House doing what Clinton do the White House\nBut uh Nineteen Ninety three there were four thousand three hundred and sixty nine a rule forty three hundred rules which you know now is a lot well in in twenty Seventeen the cumulative final rules publishing the federal register\nAs a hundred and one thousand three hundred and eighty so we go forty three hundred under Clinton one hundred and one thousand three hundred and eighty and it's like ... at the rate at three to four thousand new rules every year and bought a time another ten years go by it'll be two hundred thousand\nRhode Island's number one board dealer is setting the standard again and again flood board has over one hundred brand new Ford Escape for just one twenty nine from us that's right one twenty nine per month blood has every color every option and everything you're looking for like ... dot com\nCumulative number since right since Nineteen Ninety three right um but it yes it will continue to go on three thousand four thousand rules in any year\nBecause there is no discipline on the agencies right because of this Chevron decision will Nineteen eighty four and because there isn't any a ruling from the Supreme Court that says\nCongress cannot pass to the agencies its own legislative power that's a violation of the separation out of power in our car\nI Want to share of the American people people on on the thought on page Ninety five you say one recent study found that the cumulative cost of regulation between Nineteen eighty and twenty twelve which is why they uh thirty two year period reduced the American economic growth by over twenty five percent\nWhich amounts to annually Thirteen thousand per person in America annually and so this this gigantic it's huge it's growing\nAnd the only entity that can really stop it and the president can't stop it that Congress could stop it but there are photos and feckless individuals the only entity in the world that can stop it is not a state Supreme Court", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year": "2018", "city": "Wakefield-Peacedale", "day": "22"}
