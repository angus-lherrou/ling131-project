Melissa\nLook and we spoke to our kids when they were down by the end zone dumped they could just like his the movement get them away and then just throw 'em on the court said that it also just before they go to ... I Love ever doing this afternoon show because I get a little a bit of price impression that there is a\nGame tonight was it about the rise I'm quoting you eat you talk to their first at our post game press conference third Bert it gets more embarrassing by the day for that guy kudos to the red Sox and went into my but boy he's thinks\nHe wasn't terrible and you know like the ... yeah that's that's the high watermark for now not terrible but you give us like five and a third MBA champions better the terrible yeah I mean not that it wasn't what typically it was better than gave to against New York you know wrong there\nTo marriage brings the baby that we don't know the the first first when it was during the ... [laughter]\nMight might be the prices are horrible no it's only going to do without my government the broad minded with good either on Josh\nGordon so yeah you know he really did he look he's way all in the end zone at all because he ended up with nine targeting well played that he got hurt on but they weren't in the red zone yeah but he got hurt on was in the end zone but bring these obviously making a point to get him involved so nine targeting look at this that's holding at Bronx ate together\nSo I don't know like I like that but he's trying to get them involved but not run on the right Roach and he there's miscommunication there that can be detrimental like an adult forced the times than I like I like Gordon I like like he didn't know he was doing in time yeah when I don't like any sort of said that\nIn his three question post game that he now does every game ... and I'm paraphrasing he said we're going to get it sorted out so he acknowledged that you know there's still work that needs to be done in his mark disorder to know\nEvery nuance of what they're doing because they were not insane they know that was early examining early right out of the gate especially on the sideline\nAh let's go to\nBut we have another call on here it looks like that person hung up\nWhat their Chevy GMC Honda and Hyundai key a Toyota and Subaru all have in common they are all in for Steve free own condition at what board and he's really Janeiro or against it that's right over two hundred three on cars all makes all models and incredible prices love onto flood auto John job now\nRoyal style or Waldorf climate the dropping bombs on Las Vegas was\nLike oh mine bits of\nWorking out with your friend to make sure you get some laughs yeah yes workshop and a little bit yeah uh yeah how about this patriots that allowed forty plus points four times since twenty Thirteen\nYear the teams that have done the chiefs in twenty four team the chiefs in twenty Seventeen the eagles in twenty Seventeen and the chief again tonight those are three Andy Reid teams and an anti Reid\nDecided yeah yeah and so\nA little bit of a concern next week now too because that's also an aide to read the Bible and the new head coach of the Chicago Bears I Know Mr Brzezinski isn't ... homes but look they put up what was it they got over thirty points it gets Miami Today it's the lost that game in overtime is that what it was no\nI think that twenty eight twenty or twenty eight was the final double check that but I think that was the school you know thirty one twenty uh twenty eight against Miami but that Matt\n... you know in some of the world with about ... when they were the first Monday Night game or the funding that game or whatever was against Green Bay I remember at times is like what the hell was this I haven't seen this the bears they're usually the ground and ... it looks like well they actually found it often it's oh you know why because it's in Andy Reid\nDisciple yeah they had a great day they got a decent defence but I don't know how the hell they gave up thirty one to ... today in Miami yeah well it's ... I mean one [laughter] [laughter] yeah I don't know how they did that I mean they got some good players there they obviously made a big acquisition ... this year\nBut um we'll see you next week for the patriots\nI'm not buying it on I'm not buying an egg e Maggie\nAnd his quarterback you're basically because those guys seem to fall apart and the second half yeah like the first after great it come out of the gate to get all their play scripted I Know exactly what they want to do when the situation gets tight they fall apart and they fell apart but with somebody\nBut with Reed and Peterson I mean what's been the method of attack it's you know pick on that third corner utilize the running back in the passing game and the speed speed\nSpeed successor you're supposed to do it's just like Mark you know like it's unbelievable that that is what it takes to just be a decent deem just do that what you're smart like oh okay we won't try and throwing your first corner or your second quarter but oh look\nThat guy sucks yeah pick on him all that slow linebacker good teams do that's what this team does match up\nKareem Hunt on their slow linebacker was really not that good and coverage right now I'm at home just missed ...\nOr by the way ... Patrick ... he's patch a there is no one is saying use knowledge in\n... yeah I Know is that what the yeah that's right it said that on the\nCall sort of thing you know we were saying that he was not a gym or short changing oh oh no I think that gets that I've been\nVolition on him since we won this first who wrote the first two games that he started we're on the road and it was in LA against the charges and then it was a in Pittsburgh and shredded them or keep the real deal\nI Would agree or let's go to Rocco who's the saga is I Love this guy that ... what's up buddy [laughter]\nYeah you guys are so low as a martyr I agree with you like the second how we would just slab now ... like\nGone that do ... what is that they that the intensity scored some points on those and we could have done anything we want it to the kids that have decent you know what I mean like ... like a little Brady economist ... throw the end that's gotten that oh the one to almost gotten set that\nIt'd be just you know let them a little below that live in such a let this will Gordon and I just want to talk about a secondary the safety coach and those spell checks a kid it's telling you you know let me get this kid out of here and there will be honest with you as\nThe as I said look like crap and how old are you guys get a ... was it was his name in Arizona Peterson Pattison whatever the Peterson yeah exactly do you think of getting them in the ... and they tried to align\nThe available there was a I saw some between about this today the\nThere apparently making them available for a trade or there's been rumblings about the Arizona Cardinals would would move him\nBut at the asking price is going to be stupid yeah that's why probably\nWon't be worth it yeah that and ah what were those Carl Joseph with safety and I'm Ari Cooper the wide receiver and then a with Oakland Raiders there they're apparently on the trading off as well\nAs the Wilkes came out and said the Patrick Peterson trade rumors are ludicrous which means Ludo I've either [laughter] probably real the stronger the denial\nThe stronger I think the report or true it is yeah that's how it usually works what will it take to get Larry Fitzgerald ... Wilmington on tonight's game Hi Zach\nWhat auto group wants your car any make any model blood pays more than ... around because we're sort of by buying center and we'll buy yours and even if you don't buy ours log onto our car buyers are tough you\nGot a short a script ... what else that then you have\nA great falls which is crazy and then at the end of the game they're kicking the ball and watch or the other end of the bed and the ... to get them back and they given given him a chance they should have been at your school\n\nYeah you know another thing about it until you've seen uncharacteristic sloppy in this in these last two games you know remember if people want to just remembering Indianapolis was mostly blow on and it was but they kind of let them at back into that game for a stretch there\nBecause of bone headed plays and Brady tonight with ... I Can't remember a play that dumb from him maybe there was a Sunday night game against Indianapolis was looks first or second year he just chalked up an absolute prayer it was like my caught you're better than what the hell you're doing math and I\nLike that help them get back into this game for most part of the callers right I mean they're settling for a field goals there early in the third or the get sloppy and all of a sudden bang Kansas city's right in your back in this thing and you can't do that would seem like this that has this high powered oven often\nUm yeah but to go back to the other point about touch back in the fourth quarter he was kicking them for touch backs\nWhen he's talking about no\nWhy would kick them out I mean that's what I mean that's been a good thing I still want to know what the hell happened on that there is no explanation around the same would kick going it's even got scouts you talk to both the w._b.
