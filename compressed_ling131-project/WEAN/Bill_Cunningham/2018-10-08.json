of us from Cincinnati and from Los Angeles has some minimal impact\nIn the lives of those who might want to listen and change in in Los Angeles is now overrun with illegal aliens which hurts black folks can you tell us in Los Angeles I see a little bit in Cincinnati but in Los Angeles Chicago Memphis New York what is the status of African Americans in relationship to illegal aliens from Mexico\nIt's devastating if the world really knew how destructive is over there are in South central LA east LA cops in watts\nThere it will be cares they would demand that the the the police officer the government do something illegal alien gang members are coming and they have come in\nFirst number one they're taking away day labor day job some blacks who can't get rid of their job because they're not educated don't know how to go out there do or the violence and drugs and the crime that has crossed the borders into south central LA is beyond\nA word is devastate a lot of blacks and leave it faster I later moved back to the south they move into a a Oregon and average donor and places like that they're looking for a safe haven\nBecause Maxine Waters and a black leadership over there would not do it if they are about it\nAnd media and others are given a false impression that blacks or Hispanics are getting all alone they are not they hate one another\nThey hate the fact that these people coming in and taken over their schools and neighborhoods and jobs it's so bad that at one point but the trip to the law has joined forces to fight against illegal gay members because they they are supported by drug laws from Mexico\nAnd the other thing and the Los Angeles school system is a hundred of Nineteen different languages and dialects one cannot function in an environment where every student\nWho is speaking a different language or dialect is entitled to under federal law that if a person that they're said to translate everything happening in class one can imagine the chaos\nWhen you're in a classroom at thirty to forty students making maybe twenty or thirty different languages which no one is understood in behavior in norms are not followed and mom and dad don't exist at the home front to back up the teacher yeah that's the one that's the reason black folks are being decimated Los Angeles\nAnd and I you know I work with a lot of black kids from those areas and a lot of them and just dropping out of school because they say that the teachers are put into focus on one of the cat the events they put it into focus more focused on an illegal alien then they are the citizens and so and the parents are not paying attention because most of the kids\nAre coming from single parent homes ... black women who were born in America those who were born in this country Seventy seven percent of their children are bored out of wedlock\nSo they don't have parents who are paying attention and the kids are feeling I Lived in ... at home and asked who they're just dropping out and hardly a day goes by where there's not a fight between illegal aliens\nAnd the and the black kids there so it's a real it's devastating to build that cat fight or just random\nUrine educated men maybe a lot of self taught like I Am but I can imagine being a black kid in Los Angeles or Chicago or Memphis or Denver Cincinnati or New York here sixteen years old\nYou have no functional family you know you're a functionally illiterate you can't go to high school because you're kicked out or don't learn a damn thing nothing's being taught\nYou have no job future you have no capability of forming a permanent relationship with a woman and getting married having a family and having your own property that as devastating and that is the light\nAnd that is the life and a lot of literally tens of millions of black and brown and poor white kids in America today and I don't see do you see anything changing\nA short of a miracle from God I don't see it you know a non profit organization bond\nThe Brotherhood organization over new ... for the last twenty eight years now we have been rebuilt it in a family by rebuilding their mass so we were able to help some of those boys from those areas but it's overwhelming at this point and especially since the government the ACLU and\nThey had a CPA and others are covered it up because ages our power well it just seemed like a
