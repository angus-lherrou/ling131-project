for the last days\nTo see first if they might be able to beat him some other way and then this is going to be their last chance Hail Mary to try to destroy and let's just go ahead and ... and they're using the same deal they use against Clarence Thomas told the the exact same playbook it's the same playbook they used against judge Roy Moore I mean I don't know anything about Roy Moore bill I really don't\nAnd I thought his answers were kind of strange\nAnd invasive and I wasn't quite sure whether I should support him but in the end I came down in the idea that this was forty years ago and a bunch of women were making up stories none of which could be prove none of which had evidence and none of which had witnesses\nYou cannot allow a man to be defeated based on that\nAnd they decided that worked with judge Roy Moore let's use it with with Brett Kavanaugh it's very clear that that's what this is if it was real fights that would have brought it up and one on one meetings with the man show can you imagine if I'm up for a major job and someone gets a letter that says oh Wayne rooted tempted to rape me sit across me and you say\nNothing but then two months later you bring it up well that means the whole thing was a farce in the beginning\nSo look ... hairs on my column basically said\nI Am Brett Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh as me Brett Kavanaugh as you and if they could do it to him they could do it to anyone I grew up in an all Catholic neighborhood mostly Italian part Irish\nI was number one in my class like Brett Kavanaugh I was a sports star like Brett Kavanaugh I went to Columbia He went to an Ivy League school Yale we both got out that she great success in life and now they're trying to destroy him and I can tell you one thing\nGuys like that don't raped women there's no way does happen find me a case in America where a guy who's number one in his class at ... educated or with the sports started a great kid has tons of women friends and tons of childhood friends who stand up for him and becomes a well regarded judge and suddenly you\nFind out he was a rapist or attempted rape historic gang rape is it's the stupidest area of ever heard I grew up with nothing but Catholic school boys\nAnd let me tell you we all like women but we're all nice guys were like the date when we don't like to raped women I've never heard anything so outrageous and so stupid in my entire life show me a witness okay no problem there are none nobody saw it happen it didn't happen\nIn the name she provided indicate that she's not telling the truth their primaries

there's no ... there's no evidence there is no facts but Fox News's declaring an incredible how is it possible that record your judgment call a ton of recruits wallet or ... ... that's credible\nCredible what the hell we've been credible I Want to hear incredible\nCredible because they didn't break or because no one tried to break or known as the single decent question I mean here's the deal if if I was a criminal awaiting trial I Would be for that woman\nThat I mentioned will come after me the most incompetent burst into my life at least a hundred maybe dined fine dining harder yeah and that's some\nSay she worked for the Democratic party as far as I'm concerned the only good thing she did she said after the fact that there's no possible way I Would bring charges against him in a real courtroom well OK big deal could argue that find me a lawyer who would say after everything we know which is there's no way this there's no evidence that it happened thirty six years ago find me a single lawyer or a prosecutor\nIn the world that would actually say I would bring charges and I'll find someone that ought to be in jail you put that person in jail because God Forbid they come against my son or my daughter you know these are horrible people they'd be willing to say something like that they don't even know what they're doing they don't even understand the law for God's sakes anybody can charge anything\nOf anybody without a shred of evidence you cannot move forward with the word of one person no backup that's impossible for thirty six years ago and possible so she didn't even get a lot you know she wouldn't great deal with that either no words no break person if right thinking mind would ever prosecute Brett Kavanaugh\nHere's a man who Lindsey Graham by the way
