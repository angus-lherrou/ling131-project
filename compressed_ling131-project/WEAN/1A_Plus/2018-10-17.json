I did it too and they gave me a permission but I'm at work all day and he said I can I give the office permission to hand over my box of info too you know I went and picked it up for him and went through it about the spending at the commerce corporation I mean this is how crazy it's been\nSo to say oh we run on transparency and we you know everything is on line it isn't you can't navigate those transparency portals\nIt's you you need for more degrees to get it done who has the time so I I find that to be very interesting and I wonder if anyone else was going to pick up on that that I
