are doing they're barely fighting fires there ... running around the town's picking up folks that are owed ... are you kidding me\nAnd they drive like they have nothing to do\nNow it's interesting I've gotten several emails or just in the last twenty minutes or so and you're telling me and some of you may be involved in the city may be involved in these companies I don't know that um there's only one company that pleased to Ben and that would be for students\nSo that's an issue and that goes back to the original email that I read you about having a monopoly and having a city in a

climbing and you're not ... or ... you know for what you know the amount of time and energy put into it and I think the patient when the\n... is that right now as far as when these people retire from their work at a bus driver what kind of life are they going to um you don't have the same time though I don't know if you thought stem cells week this weekend but he suggested that the city should\nBe able to compel the bus company to do whatever the drivers want\nSo I grew up in a union household but you know I'm somewhere in the middle on this because the same time you have to step aside drivers are putting all this time and energy into a job that no not a ... passion project for them or anything but at the same time you know you get compel a private company to um\nKnow if they're just they're still we're stuck that's why we're stuck you know issue a finding that middle ground and no one wants to do that they you know that's really what it comes down to\nYou there is a piece missing here that's what it feels like isn't it William\nAnd if that's what it is just if if the if the simple as kind of both sides want to say one side wants his name was a ... dollar I pay\nA and put it in a pension fund at no cost to the employer then the other side says we can't even ah you know the Teamsters pension or is going down the tubes something's missing here there's a giant gap of explanation because we're so stuck on two sides\nAnd that's where I think that somebody in the middle I don't know if it's the mayor I don't know if it's this mayor or needs to dig in there a little bit more ends and figure out why this can't be worked out it doesn't seem it I mean they are honest incredibly far apart but it doesn't seem like it's that big on the gap does it well money on the table\nI don't know I've been in in the negotiating room obviously we don't know exactly how far apart they are but I don't think it's even the political battle you just need someone who could present a couple of solutions or how the drivers can achieve economic freedom that they want especially when they retire\nAnd the bus company can does not go broke it and you to operate as ... you know that somebody starts to put somebody on the table that that buys focus like eureka it's all that up and\nWe're going to have this enormous problems in the city Providence\n... they've done a lot they've got a problem with the teacher contracts and now they've got the school bus drivers strike they've got a issues with the buildings and they can't find the money to their hiring all kinds of people to try to uh coordinate the middle school programs and they they have a they have a mess on their hands and promise William thank you\nFor three eight nine seven seven six shows intimidate Hi Joe\nMourning mourning let's let's first one we would describe the difference between a four O. one K. and the defined benefit plan which is what they're looking for the employer makes a contribution to the four one K. boy into they retire\nSo the company is not paying that employee anything after they leave the four one K. is their pension with a defined benefit which is what they're asking for big give it to the retiree and if he dies it goes to the spouse and any siblings that are under Eighteen\nWhen they're paying for a while after they're gone they leave the dress\nAnd this or that bankrupted American Airlines they're looking for nine billion dollars bailouts Ford Motor company had to bail on four billion dollars where you can get out of their defined benefits you keep the

you will and we've got a company and\nHow would you like motor trench twenty gene truck to be here for only one I mean I Will say hello to forge twenty four to one fifty so desperate for the best rice anywhere just one hundred and Ninety nine dollars for only a board and he went into ...\n... ... I Know well hey I'm Glad you're watching your mom [laughter] was it\nA couple of things what just let me make to the first point is that\nThe the boss the bus company has more for your boat than just Rhode Island because they surface all the companies are the states and if they are signatories to that contract and the change\nIt'll probably be they'll probably be signatory everywhere so little cost them that much more and this isn't just a matter of baking one dollar in put in one place instead of a love of the time period that dollar is extended is astronomical\nAnd distorted things first of all if the boss company doesn't move the movie ...\nClaiming a constructive changing the contract and how the contract is being word it\nYou don't it doesn't say that the U.S company is not in good faith one or the other is going to win well yeah\nYeah how long words the well they got to be forced to call it will also should be sitting down with them they claiming that another what I did a lot of contracts with the U.S government okay so\nWhat they have to say is that this is a constructive change the contract it's not a change and money it's them and asking them to put that money somewhere routes\nAnd that the constructive drainage and then the the the bus company has to say that that to them and then the union has to say if they want to push this thing\nYou're not dealing in good shape because you're not sitting down with us and that's a change that have gone to try you have to deal with it but they on a on a contract dispute\nWell obviously someone in the administration I you know I'm sure they have city solicitors et cetera for the city of prominent they've got to get in there and take them take the reins listen\nUh laws is dropping them all on this because what he should be doing is forcing them to the table and saying if not I'm taking both of you to call it get you to the table you don't do that rod Robin trade is to get work this out\nBut it's not gonna work don't wear any one person gets everything they want\nOh never does I mean that's that's reality\nAnd dimes does let me say something unions blowing up the boats people the ... this\nIs a very very strong union\nYou know and the the point of them not being totally funded I don't believe that so they got to watch that saying that I think that what they have to do is say look if we get died up with it banking on it's gonna take every one of our contract\nAnd Joe ... because\nThe people we said that they should and have benefits long after they're gone from the government it\nYes and some of the ... yes al thank you somebody who was involved in that explained that um that it goes to you know you can pass away in that pension continues onto your immediate ... uh you know an either your your children are your your spouse\nA four O. one K. is a four O. one K. I'll be careful what you wish for\nThe ah another early early on in the morning another caller called in and said he had a pension\nThat uh when he retired he jumped out because they own the pension the Teamsters they jumped out to him and then he could tax on it you roll over your four one K. you don't get taxed on that\nThere's a lot of ins and outs of this and you know if you've had you see when I did not that many people this day and age but years ago maybe it's your your parent's generation where they had one job right and I needed the company for forty years\nNot happening really maybe four or five turnovers right in your lifetime now probably even more for the millennials coming up uh so you know the the ... the folks coming up the younger generation and I'm going to have an option of a pension in many instances it's not that it's not the trend it's it's old school mole isn't Mandeville still their mom\nI Am here thank you Michael how thanks for being there go ahead I have two suggestions okay evidently the pension seems to be the big dance bill yes the union\nOr the people who will operate an are responsible for the pension and for the payments into the future to those who retire and through there you're not the city of property rights\nFilling and the bed won't participate\nThat's not just that really is not\nWhat it was just saying that oh they're doing company I wasn't saying you're ...\nSo my suggestion number one would be that the union members ... son I mean if they have a strict new troops to reach a majority they present the members signatures to the city of Providence saying we want you to take one dollar\nAn hour hourly pay and handed over to the union instead of handing it over to our that's our which\nSymbol that takes the studio Providence off do you speak or or or also art is not the city or problem\nAnd it's also not an increase to the studio problems that money is already on the table in their hourly wage and if the driver stopped working then also is one dollar an hour that's being contributed\nSo that takes care of that issue I I I Would see the drivers want it and it was such that this was what we want it's my money already old style now I Want you to take one dollar that X dollars an hour or want you to give it to the you know\nThat's my business as my money you have nothing to say about\nWhat the company doesn't want to play that way that we're saying first session is the company and they're saying no we don't want to deal with the Teamsters pension it's not it's not going to be sustainable right am I wrong and that's what I'm hearing you are you you were well\nUh so so then they should present those beaches the student\nFirst during this ending the money over in the city of Providence whoever's paying ... right in that sense should get those signatures the drivers say hey that's what I Want I don't care what your opinion is is the weather this playing succeeds or fails and whether I in my ears get money in the future or not\nThat's the business between me and my ...\nIt's my money you offered the X dollars an hour like one dollar my money and give it to the union or they get enough signatures\nThat that should be the end of that story\nWell listen you sound like are you sound like a good negotiator a solid\nA solid option right there I think you know since being money you can do a lot with one thousand dollars to make sure you're listening every day here you can win four thousand dollars a thousand dollars a day we call it for ... a day you could win at nine noon three six\nListen for the national key word that you're in for chances every weekday for you to win a thousand bucks total for K. day on news talk Ninety nine seven FM and am six thirty WPRI Ralph's in Providence good morning Ralph\nGo on to our power you have the toughest job in the world listen to all of Rhode Island is that know everything\nAbout everything we do I just want to say that that's the\nOne who drivers' union is Seventy percent [noise] uh you know he has worked is certainly who are UPS to tell you about your money and your pension\nAnd where did you how do you know that how do you know you have any further than that way hold on hold on hold on how do you know Seventy percent of that particular union is UPS\nSo they used to work for UPS they have the highest union membership the UPS tells that union with or do\nWell I I I have ...
