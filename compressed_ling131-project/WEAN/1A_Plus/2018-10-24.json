Joe a former mayor and ah\nI respectfully has passed a buddy fancy talk to him often when we were on the show together and it seems ... reporting and I'm Steve clamping as there are covering Allen songs press conference about pension reform and what Gina Raimondo did with the pension investments\nUm I've had him on the program and he has said some crazy numbers are such as you know she blew five hundred million dollars when she was a general treasurer who apparently now he had said who writes for Forbes and investigates pensions he's describes himself as the pension detective\nHe's standing beside Alan ... today\nAnd wasn't just a couple of days ago didn't Joe ... say he would bring intense I don't\n[laughter]\nSo does this play into Joe drillers argument that Alan fungus taking all my things he's taking all my toys\nHe's just getting wacky Ted's Dell has he has\nA ... in in and rightfully so I guess I'm\nGina Raimondo was a general treasurer there's a lot of money involved and pension reform she became the poster child of pension reform nationwide that's how she got on the map she quote fixed the Rhode Island pension system but don't ask don't tell that to the engineers\nNow since I came on the scene when he's fancy talked to him often I was working with buddy then I talked to had\nMany many times he's come on the program he was one major monetary awards for breaking pension\nNews and finding out a hedge fund risky hedge fund investments and things like that and he has always said Gina Raimondo cost the state about a half a million dollars that she lost it up with risky investments with the pension system\nUm he apparently is with Alan ... today so I don't know who will pull that one out of their sleeve but it's interesting maybe we'll have Ted\nCome on I had this one woman who writes me constantly heads I Dallas in town you've got to get them on the show I've had him on the show a dozen times probably since but he's been gone times on a

doesn't believe it will just put the bomb squad again demonstration that go seriously there\nAnd we understand the gym and properties that this device or the structure of the time Warner center was actually discovered in the mail room at the time Warner center it was not discovered offsite have all the all the shops all the businesses Time Warner center also a bit of accurate [noise]\nHuge into oh no [laughter]\n[noise] now\nIf you work here every day as we do a you know how careful they are in the building and it ... you try to drive your car all in the parking lot at the time or energy in enacted your paycheck under each vehicle with mirrors a check in the trunk of every vehicle before it goes in there are a\nScreening machines x-ray machines for back or you walk in the lobby every day there are precautions in the mail room a show every precaution is always taken but somehow it is a leap from ... ... ... if if I was able to make it any side of the mail room\nAnd I would have ... or ... into this for a second is it the suspicion right now she mode based on\nYour conversations were law enforcement back these various uh these various suspicious packages are in fact turn back to the Soros packaged the Clinton package be Obama packaged the White House package and Time Warner center package\nCertainly will police right now in New York the NYPD the FBI there are treating it like it's all related they're not taking any chances are as we said moments ago because of what's inside this package and how it appears a some metal construction perhaps piping\nOr some wires some other things in this box is concerning law enforcement and they believe at least at this\nPoint that this could all be connected to the other packages that they've intercepted so while they don't know definitively yet because I don't get the sense that they've been able to get inside with in this package you know our mail room in New York X rays it the NYPD bomb squad X rays it\nI think the hope here is that\nThey will remove this and then detonate it and then look inside and see what they fine fine\nBut certainly every indication here will is that they are treating it as if it's related they are treating it as if it's the real deal meaning that it's an explosive device for the one good thing here is that the NYPD the bomb squad which is probably one of the best in the world all they believe that they have this under control\nAnd that this this package what's inside of it isn't going to explode a but they obviously still are taking all sorts of precautions which is why you're seeing a both poppy and Jim being moved back streets around our building in New York on fifty eighth street having clothes but they've close streets north and south\nOf our building in New York or the fire department is they're they have ambulances there all as a precaution just in case if somebody wants to go wrong they can immediately respond to that and treat people um the bomb squad you know interestingly here they go in a very good at this and you can bet you I bet a wolf\nOne hundred percent that this morning the NYPD bomb squad the intelligence division there was being brief are probably in real time on these other suspicious packages these other devices that the secret service intercepted and probably as they were being briefed about this\nThis call came in so they know what they're looking for they know what the other devices how they were constructed what they were compromised of and so that way they know what they're dealing with ... in this situation it's perhaps related or the law enforcement officials in New York are treating it as such\nThey often taken other precautions around New York all your locations tied to George Soros other locations tied to both bill and Hillary Clinton and the Obamas around the country are going to see increased security or certainly in their mail ruined says certainly at the offices at the homes are and the FBI\nRhode

device was sent to obviously you just heard they've been a interrupting suspicious packages sent to the Clintons the Obamas\nThe White House George Soros and now this morning a device was sent to Time Warner center\nA CNN is reporting so they are they are there New York offices are there and they've been evacuated that it was constructed with a pipe and wires according to their NYPD source\nAnd seeing and also goes on to say law enforcement authorities are treating the device as a real explosive was discovered in the mail room of Time Warner center in New York now our newsroom as out covering local politics\nAre local political events and I believe the Clinton caught up with a candidate for governor Alan falling and asked him about this before this before the time Warner center situation developed he was talking about the packages being sent to the Clintons the\nObamas and the White House and he got some reaction from gubernatorial candidate\n... what do you make of this word the the suspicious devices directed toward political figures\nYou know absolutely disturbing and you know scary times that we're living in right now there's no place for any of that in our society a and you know our hope that the FBI conductor for investigation and finds these perpetrators and hold them accountable [noise]\nCome shopping newsman absolutely shocking there is no place you
