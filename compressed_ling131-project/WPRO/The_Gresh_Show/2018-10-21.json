N. F. treaty\nThe agreement barred the U.S and Russia from making owning or testing ground launched cruise missiles with a range of three hundred and thirty four hundred miles what President Trump says Moscow is not living up to the agreement so he's pulling out and the president says the U.S may start making those missiles\nTo develop those weapons are less Russia China so us and they all got to do is they say let's really get smart let's none of us develop those weapons at Russia's doing it and if China's doing it where it hearing the agreement that don't except to have a\nCampaign rally in Elkhart of at a Trump accused Democrats of supporting the caravan of Central American migrants heading into Mexico who hope to find sanctuary there or in the United states the migrants are on a bridge that connects Guatemala with Mexico\nRight so it's really what it comes down to its third grade in mathematics and what this shows and I'll get into it or what this shows is if there was a coordinated effort at the height and to stop it getting basically what happens is every department\nAnd the budget they have a line item which is for sick time the amount of time that was used in that department so when we had a couple of years back when they had two point eight million dollars of overtime due to take time\nWell I Know a number of the budget for sick leave and the war fighter problem was eleven thousand dollars\nSo I question you got two point eight million dollars in overtime to cover sick time of eleven thousand dollars how is that possible so neither the mayor all the finance director all the fire chief could answer the question so I kept persisting and then they said to me well [noise] that line item of sick leave\nTakes into consideration the secretary said non uniformed personnel\nSo I asked them to point to the line item of sick time that recognizes the uniform firefighter sick time and how to count that fall under stand in accounting procedures and they couldn't do that and finally the mayor says\nOh we just roll all that into the line item of salaries will you can't do that violates your accounting principles\nSo seeing that every other department did it correctly the city council went and they filed an ordinance that the fire department now had to break out they're sick time\nIn a separate line item eyes is dictated by the city charter invite ordinance and they they unanimously voted in favor of doing that so they could get a clearer picture on the budgetary issues in how the money is being\nComing in and out the door mayor avid Asian vetoed it\nDidn't want to hear\nWhat the city council overturned the veto and that was supposed to start happening on July first of two thousand Seventeen but\nThey didn't do it they kept pope or postponing and postponing and postponing that just until just before ... left so what happens is this [noise] um the contracts allow the firefighters to get twenty six days per year\nAnd that allocation is given to the monthly they in other words they accrue one point six six six days that goes in the bank per year once they reach of capital from a multi mean right\nFrom uh promote yet which one point six six times twelve months he goes the twenty days\nOnce they reach a hundred and forty days in the bank\nNow they still get to twenty days per year ... out of that twenty whatever amount of sick days they don't use\nThey get to cash out Seventy five percent of that for in other words if you use to five six days you have Fifteen days left in the bank and by contract you can monetize Seventy five percent of that Fifteen which would be eleven point two five days and historically\nUnder the contract that and you will benefit would be paid\nAnnually at the last day on march right because the sick pay counter is not like the fiscal calendar all the calendar year the sick pay county goes from February to January so having said that when I started to look at\nWas when I got the ... page report I had at the time to documents I had the attendance records which they call the accountability sheets would choose who's on who's ... who's on vacation who's on military leave whatever so I got the ... report and I got the attendance records and I started seeing\nAll these names of men who had ... they got the maximum amount of sick time that was due to them which was at the time\nTwelve point for eight days then it moved to Fifteen days so let's say for example the all good Fifteen day's pay\nAnd I'm looking they all got the exact same amount of money but when I looked at your attendance record they had missed sixty five day seven days eight days one guy Mr ten days but they were all paid\nAs if they had perfect attendance so I started to do access to public records and I was met with a brick wall on every single request they refused to give me records I had to file complaints with the G and this went on and on and on so it took two and a half years to get the documents\nOnce I had the documents in hand it was two hours the fifth grade math\nTo come up with the numbers now this scheme began and two thousand and twelve\nUp until two thousand and two well the annual benefit and the contract language indicated that was to be paid annually as does every other fire department that has an unused sick pay benefits it's an annual benefit that is paid once a year well in two thousand and twelve\nAll of the union decided that we're not going to take a pay increase but the fire department balked at it so what they did was they developed this scheme that took place behind closed doors\nWith the mayor involved and then they would change the last word in the contract to not get paid annually to be monetize the monthly\nSo what would happen was you can see guys attendance records where they're being paid monthly every month right and then the last couple of months they take enormous amounts of sick time so they basically takes place instead of getting paid Seventy five percent for the on you sick time\nWe have individuals that got paid a hundred and twenty seven percent of their sick time\nThe fire chief got paid a hundred and Thirteen percent of the sick time so we calculated out every single men based upon the city documents right\nEye then received the official sick leave sheets and\nI requested to see a couple of other documents to visually inspect it when I did the fire department is the assistant fire chief came in and gave me these three big three ring binders and when I looked at him it was like\nMy God this is Christmas they have hand written record of six times every guy has a page and the secretary actually writes it all in pencil\n[laughter] and they all cruel how much time they have in the bank by pencil and paper and hundreds of eraser mocks the white photographs\nAll those came home and competed all four official city documents\nAnd I found numerous mathematical areas not tend not hundreds thousands of mathematical areas where numbers were altered in numbers were change and people were getting paid when they should have got paid for example a guy will take a sick day\nSo you're in the month of January but you'll also be paid that month for not taking a sick day when that happens the man is paid just regular salary of one day he's paid one point two five for on you sick day and then a man comes in and called the summit time and a half\nSo each time that happens we pay out three point seven five\n... how did they get to the point where they do one point two five Seventy five percent Seventy Seventy Seventy five percent is\nSeventy five so here's here's your math okay this is why I don't want to confuse people that it's simple you get one point six\nSix days per month when they started to monetize this monthly you get Seventy five percent of one point six six which is one point two five days pay [laughter]\nYou get more than I Do yeah yeah and you called out sick so you've got two and two two and a quarter day's pay\nWho was with us Rob who makes the scheme up okay here's what has usually average criminal stuff this is a genius\nOh it's brilliant and they never thought anybody would figure it out until I started banging on the door and they didn't realize that you know are not everybody went to the school systems where they still\nCan't grade math [laughter] so and this is what\nNo let me tell you something and ... and here's where it becomes a conspiracy\nWhen they went from the fifty percent pay out two Seventy five percent pay out at the two thousand sixteen budget hearing when they had the new contract a ratification I questioned\nEarly ... who is the finance director vigorously because the line on them and two thousand Fifteen they paid four hundred and forty three thousand dollars in unused sick pay\nThat benefit now is being increased by fifty percent ... in my opinion author\nBogus fiscal note because the fiscal note he gave to the city council which I have in my profession right now indicated that during the course of the three year new contract that increase this payout by\nFifty percent that it would have an input\nCease gave Christmas

the reason why I'm Talking about the you know it's one city in the state of Rhode Island the entire region but I Wonder how many other places that this is going on right ah Rob of you and I know that you teamed up with a can block on this and use some of his data mining technology to kind of get some of these numbers right is that how that worked\nWell after I did all the Matt Bai and they went to Ken and I said look can you help me with this and he said yeah let's digitize it all ties and can roll programs to extract data to basically check my analysis and checked my math speaking you're checking Matt I just want to clarify something for the record\nJust before you went to a break I gave you the example of that she took twenty four but I gave you the wrong dollar amount so he took twenty four sick days which means he was out there going to any any thick type on your six times a day when he was a three point seven five eight on you sick time\nPlus he went another foreign the whole right so he technically he was over paid seven point seven five eight mile two thousand nine hundred and sixty six dollars and eighty six that's\nSo this is a stark example where the contracts that you can be paid Seventy five percent for your own use well at arrow unused but\nHe was still pay right\nOr because he he your months where he was he did have one used\nRight so he actually because it says he or she shall at the end of the epidemic not exceed Seventy five he was paid a hundred and Thirteen point seven five percent so simple math\nRight so let me ask you this question so this seems to me that that this is if it's ambiguous language in the contract okay than big which brings in the contract you say you're precedent in contract law says you're supposed to go to the original intent was when it's when it's conflicting\nUh they didn't do that they went to this other way so the day when it's when the article says the spokesperson for the white firefighters union says that there was a sign an agreement with the previous administration was married but ... what is he talking about what the side of humans just to go and do you decide the month\nSo so evidently\nYou what you have to understand we have a city solicitor who oversees the contract negotiations Peter Gerald Wright Pete image arrow oversold these contract negotiations she's supposed to be an attorney and and you have a contract that has such loose language in it\nThat they manipulated it so what the union president has said well we had a side deal with the mayor in other words he had them the mayor said that we could monetize a hundred percent of it we had a verbal the city charter specifically prohibits any type of verbal contract and\nUnder section to dash Eighteen it specifically says that any contract negotiations any benefits that are given out and contract must be ratified by the city council and all those contracts have to go before a public hearing so the contracts says one thing right mhm\nBut Scott avid Asians said yeah but you know what guys I'm going to turn my back\nOn it and you guys can manipulate it to get what we call the for compensation maybe you're going to get this benefit no one's ever going to find out about it so it leads me begs the question did the finance director know about it well if he didn't then he's pretty dumb because he couldn't see\nThem what's the constant hearing my mom's looking at this stuff inside agreements hoses legal I mean how do you know it's not it's not rounded when you get\nWhen you get\nPeople that represent the tax payers coffers the municipal dollars that is being taken from the taxpayer and you enter into a site agreement where you have your attorney the mayor the fire chief the fire union president you know the city finance director the chief of staff and you say OK guys\nYou're going to do all this stuff that's okay we're going to present it in the contract as this way with this language but we're going to allow you have this ambiguous language so you can actually get more than what the contract actually isn't tending to benefit from right that's called conspiracy\nTheft I mean she needs to be that\nIt's fraud it's conspiracy and they need to have an investigation and these people need to be brought in on the road and Scott ... she needs to be sworn in on the road and he needs to answer for this because this is hundreds of thousands of dollars\nFive dollars on each Medicare part D prescription Walgreens is your first pharmacy Walgreen trusted since Nineteen oh one

a call from Bob socio Scotts all I I Will say this\nOn one of the replays after it happened there was a reverse angle that shows is less away at the very least I'm looking for a positive your gym which is obviously not a good injury carted off to the locker room got a bad knee to begin with\nYou didn't fully plant is left\nHis left what was planted and before you got one he's sort of pick up the back end of his and was able to see it on his toes right at the front part of a sport in the ground so what do I get a leg and they got hit you know in the area\nWas twisting to the ground which may you know maybe something other than the news they said it was an injury going so maybe maybe it's just a week of any bad to be given eat but maybe it's an ankle see that's what I mean I feel that it's a high alert you happen to your the way that he respond but the hell do I know\nThe best case scenario is what you're saying he's not planning to maybe his reaction is more of a\nPsychological obviously he was hurt but more of a psychological thing because of his injury history with the with the legs so you know that's best case scenario all at the very least\nYou know you've got to be out here handball weeks they don't have a lot of that position feels like stuff is going to have to be done we mentioned earlier maybe like you know as he comes back now all of the street maybe they'd bring back Ralph Web ... from the practice squad something like that but in terms of depth yeah they have to do something very much\nA you know soon after was stopped but it just sucks for them because the way he's been going here last year we got to be a yeah oh I look at it but I just don't think we should hear the worst yeah\nYeah you know I mean let's let's give it a few days before your wind up by tomorrow you know let me know which reporter skills to shutter um but\nSnake with this draft God have they ever have they ever since the last guy when you do an injury and it was left me right but now there are two first routers when Michelle well yeah we don't really know but it just looked it did look bad and always looks bad though right it looks bad when you're being carted off and you have something that you know keeps you from walking normally\nBut let's let's give it a couple of days let's find out it may not be season ending yeah could be something that you know there is hope for him to make a return well I'll tell ya jump to conclusions as my is my uh well he aren't right\nNow here's a case of boy how Chris Hogan earlier in this game where he's down on the ground he gets ... helmet the back of his left knee and that look bad and he goes into the blue tent and it's like oh God to reenact who came back and had a hell of a games mostly in the second half\nYeah so we'll see right well let's see if we hear anything about the status of Sony Michel heading forward\nOptimism as opposed to made him here let's let's not assume the worst I think there are a lot of people that are assuming that he's done for the yeah\nYou don't always ready to write about right now he's done he's done to end tomorrow I Need to to six when I'm older and older I get mad mad as

for these calls that are going against us that are clearly agree just ... this call with the Edelman catch\nWe didn't see the replay on television nothing just proceed it just go on and we need to be advocating for these calls because everyone assumes the patriots get all the calls that is not true\nWe need to fight so that calls the late ... all we need to go for it falls\nOn a roll Patterson needs to go ahead we don't need to stop him he made a mistake today on that on that play one who is running into the zone any slowed up that's fine ... he was a play maker and let's keep on going nuts oh those are my comments\nAll right you know what can we got a couple of good points there at the first one being the Edelman thing\nNo replay on TV and Edelman gets up and he's looking for a replay in the stadium you're on the road you're not going to get it right which brings us back to TV no reply on TV is becoming an issue of mine Jim become an issue of mine in sports broadcasting in general not enough replace\nWent on television especially with this uh the ale cs the red Sox and the asteroid\nThat one there is he a yes we're very sensitive right now I say Boston sports fan the lack of ... has been a PS yep and today we got that on CBS I just can't stand yeah cannot stand\nAnd but ... could have challenged the call I wasn't the things that may be upset about in terms of calls with the rest today it was things that were they they just let go at the end of the game Julian Edelman gets into a spat with I forget what the defense of a quarterback was\nAny lately the quarterback illegally grabs elements face mask in front of the ref no flag their leader in ... in in a scholar couple of times uh when they were down towards the end zone like towards the end of the third quarter ... call their rest right in front of them and then on one of the returns other the bears head\nIt looked like it was going to be a it was one of their last drives or maybe as mid early fourth quarter I forget but either way kick return for the bears looks like it's a whole and it ends up being a fifty in your face mask politically or their hands in the face for ... when there was a hold on it and they're like they they definitely got screwed in a few calls like that that it's that we're right in front of the ramps and it's like\n... did you close your eyes is this just home cooking what's going on here that was frustrating\nYeah ah so to get to the other point that he's talking about which is the patriots are dealing with court arrow Paterson taking one out of the end zone I don't know if you've got that early in the first quarter met him in the second or first African\nOr even here there are some people here at CBS scene there were complaining and and what I told them at the time I said listen you're going to have some place where he brings it out and you're saying what the hell is he doing\nThe patriots field and they should I feel they are totally right to feel this way\nThey're going to be times where yeah maybe he gets stopped at the Seventeen yard line and you're thinking why not just taking in the end zone but for him and his talent you the best kick return or in the NFL\nThe risk of being you know losing seven or eight yards versus the kickoff is worth it for the times that he breaks on like you saw later in this game I can live with that I can too because he's so good at it yeah so it's the one thing he's good [laughter]\nThat's why he's here yeah okay that's why the guys here so that's why I think you just got a sort of live with that I don't know that it's necessarily something that they want to change yeah that they want to you know say hey cleaned that up\nToday core narrow Patterson return is six career kicked off or a touchdown he's been in the leagues and twenty Thirteen he's got four more kick returns for touchdowns then the next closest guy\nHe's the best for them and we know far and its yards per return fabulous\nThat's kinda that'll ... thing you know there's an explosive play waiting to happen but there's going to be a handful of plays that he loses a handful yards and like what do you do and do like stop dancing around but bang ribs one off it over the horse\nOff season it's going to be it's going to be help not ... yeah absolutely yeah but the replay thing drives me crazy and you know what I don't blame Nobel jak for not reviewing it it's not worth it\nTraditionally person to basically triple coverage in the end zone it's like he's not even reading the bill correctly and again the either young quarterback ... this is your second year do you should be\nBetter than that then what do you eat the weight like today yeah I I don't think he is better than that though I knew they knew\nHow I played better game yes of course\nBut I just can't say afraid to ... what is what what is going on with this guy in this team so I don't know man uh what did you make of the third a couple of things you're right before halftime in terms of why the other team might be stupid\nThere was a third and three they write their own forty three yard line and they attended that Deep Throat uh going down the sideline took the shot yeah did you like that oh no I\nMean the safely they're just trying to pick up the first down um and it didn't make any sense considering how he had been missing guys all day so no I mean but that's you know many years a guy from Andy Reid trees and they're going to be aggressive with rose like that just know what you have in terms of\nPersonnel and your quarterback can't make those play yeah I didn't love it\nAs soon as I saw it in love and I'd like to go back and get another look at it which I Will do between now and tomorrow but\nJust on the surface I didn't like to play their zoning seem to mind it on the broadcasters okay I get it I Know why they're going to take a shot here you know you're under two minutes to go now you know take a shot see what you have there they thought it was there certainly was there was that and then the decision at the end of the half\nInstead of attempting to fifty nine yard field goal what do they do they run that play with one second land right right right to Coney picked up twenty yards and you know got down to the patriots twenty yard line but I I don't get that at all that would drive me crazy\nOh ... okay so as long as it's fifty four so what has both associate Joe pointed out in the broadcast the other when they're back\nYou're shot otherwise you'd just wasting everybody does it help you have a kicker on your roster for that and you risk ... guy like corn on the way like that to take the show they kick biggest shy rookie ... rookie head coach so now some some stupidity at the top two it's not just the player the quarterback\nTry and try and get some points there what's your what's your coach six one seven seven seven nine zero Ninety eight by my kids in sterling on that particular celebration by quarter hour all Patterson on his get returned Hey Mike\nHey what's going on I got a you tell me if I'm overreacting or not but\nWas that the only one screaming at the television when he started walking and high fiving his teammate from the twenty yard line\nAfter Al Bell all I I mean if he doesn't get yelled at from this special teams coach this week I I don't understand I I've never been more bad watching their special teams be so bad for the past few weeks and then him do that that's all yeah\nMike I I don't think you're alone on that I think the I think the yelling starts with Joe judging the bill Belichick will push him out of the way and then he'll do the you know I think\nI think they're going to get it from that coach on that issue I think you're going to get it from Joe Judge\nI mean when you're upset Bob so [laughter] right well okay what city earlier that's not the Patriot guard the Patriot why [laughter] I mean even where you can get so animated pretty quickly Patterson is not being\nProbably yeah [laughter] where do you think you know make an ad against negative commentary images you know you really screwed oh just come and you don't hear so so you get down a lot of guys pretty positive about the guy\nOh no no no he got out of this but he crossed the line on that on that research that we have that maybe we can play that for Jim Martin\nAnd Mike the caller is right to be mad and so it was Bob it 'cause I did the same reaction it went from Tacoma what they\nCall and tell you a oh what do you write\nI mean like is that what it that's what it is what clown celebration that was yet in the end zone and\nSee if you want to celebrate the touchdown Mike yes before you do it after you score right we're joined cross\nThe goal line oh it was ... it was absolutely absurd wherever another team playing the patriots crush them even more here it is here's a call\nNow make up for a hung on earlier but much down there all games man [noise]\nYou're not going to get a guy just run\nNinety five yards you know five five yard line Jackson I'm not sure don't like that that play and yeah and the [noise] with a much needed boost by Patterson half her hands gaffe earlier the class here that\nSo it's like a ... I think we ... we got off the bat smart like a sassy mom for tomorrow we'll have the whole thing\n\nThat that is not the perjury and that's how he finished it right after you dropped that ... [laughter] it's not the way yeah not doing\nSomething like that is like the Leon Lett play waiting to happen All right that's what dumb things happen someone could come up behind you let the body and and all of a sudden it's ... ... you know you think you've got six on the board and now it's a it's a bubble just get in the end zone\nWe're going to hear from Greg regarded the Boston sports journal patriots beat writer will talk to him coming up next on the safety insurance Ninety eight by sports patriots radio network\nFor the most authentic would slow barbecue around you know how to get to ... barbeque Cumberland with ... drugs and do restaurant locations gothic you fold the barbecues base in Rhode Island just named ...\nBest barbeque boost trucked in America by mobile busy magazine second year there savory west coast style try to be some master people served with onions and horseradish and then finish it off with some authentic North Carolina pecan pie you'll be glad you did not accused motels and barbecue on line and got a cute dog a\nSevere when your comfort invites you to join their comfort club joined disappear your comfort slump now and get twenty dollars off\nWhy joins you'll receive yearly system maintenance discounted rate priority service savings on your energy bills properly working heating and they see systems prevent mostly breakdowns and you will extend the life of your comfort systems\nNot having yearly maintenance on your heating system can result in poor air quality and cost you money saved now and joined the comfort club called free nine six Ninety One Seventy one for info\nCredit products are made by Web bank rate in terms very based on credit history Amazon is not a sponsor of this promotion other restrictions apply the website for details\nHow did I get into credit card debt a trip to the emergency room\nMoving expenses there's a million ways to get into credit card debt but one sure way to start getting out of von ... von ... access to online and secure loans from two thousand dollars for thirty five thousand dollars a competitive race and no extra charges were being back early\nOver five hundred thousand customers have experienced the convenience of alone through a bonding no wonder a bond has an a plus rating from the better Business Bureau the application takes managed to live for ...\nFor thirty pm central time Monday through friday funds are deposited as soon as the next business day and now a vice but also give you a fifty dollar Amazon dot\nCom gift card after your first thing that has made on time to check your loan options and to get this special radio offered to go to Yvonne dot com today and enter ... thirty one thirty one when applying backs Avi A.

economy was was losing monument believe ACC facility services and I said how bad hospital Mass General gases and some of them lose training you know we\nOn to the advice on like three hundred dollars for the safety and\nFind those things where you're\nEvil in zero degrees outside to heat a building in a zero degree New England when winter\nBut you always had either decide that you were going to be an eating mode or cooled him out the whole system had to be heating and cooling right well this what were you introduce you for the first time in a residential application we've been able to do with ... before is a thing called heat recovery\nAnd he recovery is different has a BIG Magic box outside\nAnd it has three refrigerate lines that go inside to the building to these distribution boxes and then once we're inside we can have up to twelve different air handlers or different delivery methods to building but the key\nIs that we can simultaneously heat and cool a building for the first time ever well that's the first time ever in residential while so I was always in commercial you could always right so now\nThat means a son to be coming in the south side of a full day and you need to cool that top floor sunny side\nBedroom well when you do that you're going to gather some of that son's he's\nInto the refrigerant and then normal you should send that down to outside it to be wasted on the what we can do here is we can say no we can we we can use the energy to good effect and we can hate the north side rooms well the final piece of this makes this thing such a breakthrough in my opinion\nIs we get one additional heated change off of this system right\nAnd that ... has refrigerant into it and we can use that waste heat that heat that we would've dumped outside to also heat the water for faucets [laughter] so this is now while all in on what everybody's Trump there every is joked about this for a long time so we're we're incredibly excited we love being on the front end\nDo you got to be fairly watching this project yeah wow yeah see I don't see how it also rules out um before I let you go and ask you one more thing now obviously this building has to be very tight and you use the techniques are I think it's called aero stealing\nTo got us for infiltration that sounds really fascinating about that Dr ... so ... was the stuff that I think steals the duct worked right same company came up with the next generation of single arrow barrier and this is a way\nThat are in a house on the construction or an existing house has incredible infiltration\nTen she'll itself up to a level that you could you could never drink before [noise] so what they do is they put the building under a little negative pressure they push her out in a row yeah so they're pulling putting fans to push push year out to the building against the the walls and then they put these little\nAdam ... stations all around and what happens is that this find missed that is in the air if it finds a crack anywhere at the pointed goes near the crack\nThe velocity increases when that those aerosol buried here so ... beads bright go through an coagulating and will deal it's like it was like event or a of an arms race unbelievable and so\nWe saw this thing that this was already tight building relatively tight but we saw this thing go down I think by ... percent less so um [noise] and what what I like is that their houses that were done on low bid there were how's the ... bury their houses that you are would be desperate and with this you can actually do it in a retrofit you'd have to\nYou'd have to cover horizontal surfaces you know because you know your couches and the floors with plastic but you could literally retro for the house and they have this computer games do you watch and it shows you what the infiltration is\nYou know three hundred see fmri who say that you're gonna watch it just literally watching seal write up for your eyes crazy fantasy I think that's going to be a major breakthrough for for building the building trades\nWell great work as usual really exciting jak thanks so much being a part of the money that and thanks I mean graduations on the forty nine of
