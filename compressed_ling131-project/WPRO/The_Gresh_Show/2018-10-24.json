stashed away in your brain is way different than mine\nI just know that weighed Miley pitched about fourteen times and that's that's pretty much the extent of my\nWay are already in pitching knowledge and the right and I know that is because I just was repeatedly stoned every time I looked it up and outweighed by taking the bumped and I know\nWhat I really wonder I mean does it feel like now that everybody does the same thing like I Know what you're obviously trying to hit the ball score runs right but we had an aunt\nPresident ... year of strike outs and major league baseball and it doesn't feel like we're getting that now in the post season at least to me anyway you know and part of the reason why I say OK was just because you're four innings in five hits in three runs is not what you expect\nThey show out after Seventy nine pitches last night well that's kinda my point tale of Ninety One I mean if you want to\nTell me that uh he threw a hundred and ten bitches and couldn't get out of the fence or a hundred and Fifteen pitches and couldn't get out of the fifth that's where I look at it as from a pitch count standpoint it's not the number of Indians you know maybe you'll get batted around may be in trouble finding his own that can climb your pitch count\nBut the fact that both of them now again under similar circumstances right they came out for the feds got some guys on and then were lifted so I understand the sense of urgency to both managers had but ah\nYeah I'm not ready to say anyone had an okay start when you're supposedly an eighth of a staff and you didn't make it out of a or you didn't make it too I should say one hundred pitches forget the ...\nYeah I I I think that uh everybody is so aware now of all my God I Can't give up the beginning I'd rather pull out my best pitcher who is loaded the bases with one out in the fifth\nInstead of riding it out with that guy it's oh my God I've got to find a way to try to\nStem the tide here and managers or maybe not overreacting\nOr but they're highly sensitive any first bit of trouble boom geyser coming out of there you know we don't know about Chris Sale is one of the world is that guy pitching through I really wanted a Fox to sort of zone in\nAnd show me his elbow after the stand gross fell picture in the global that I saw on Twitter the other day\nAnd they never really got in there\nYou know encourage Shaw he started and then\nRelieved in ... I don't know it just feels like wait 'til tonight by the way a it's David Price against a ... um I ... I Wonder if each from gift eighty pitch 'cause I'm Sorry I don't have David I Do not have faith and David Price tonight\nOr be proven wrong but he had a great song last time out I give him full credit for that\nWe discussed that ad nauseam here on the ground showing WPRI oh\nBut I Can't trust this guy I was in a meeting today\nAnd David Price came up in a board room full of people who stopped and said oh do you mean a fingers take on it or I did not but I Wish I did however I don't know if they would've gotten that know complete they wouldn't know but uh you could still ruled it out but I ah\nI said to our big boss Holly who was there with me and and I said here's let me tell you about David Price missile postseason thing\nIt's like shuffling you're way across the ice nine times and falling and under ten time you didn't fall that doesn't mean on the eleventh time everything is cured and you're not going to fall on that ice that to me is David Price\nIs tonight and he's gonna fall right back on the ice again and I'm sure the Dodgers are going to have a a hell of a game plan and I think it's the same for that guy to just your rank get get pitched totals up\nGet him to eighty five pitches after three innings and\nAh our school did arrest they'll get David Price out of there\nBut there really\nWasn't I don't I don't know if there is any huge take away your big discussion point from game on the starters war what they were the bullpen war what they were and it was really one big hit\nOff the bat of any New Years coming in and the pinch hitting situation also would ... I mean it wasn't a terrible pitch you kind of Gulf the thing and have a line drive or over the monster that pretty much put a dent in one of those light towers there\nI mean I don't\nThat's the takeaway is yeah I grew up with our current can do no wrong whether he got in that situation that right there is\nA microcosm of that because even Alex Cora would tell you I mean\nThe series of events that went into that you know the pitching change and they had to do where Robert felty had to take out by a right even though by as has incredible splits he gets out those writings and left the I don't know what he's doing pulling that guy out well but also that goes back to my editor and writes crash in in the moment\nI was thinking as well or to myself and I'll be the first one to admit I didn't know biases splits off the top of my head in the moment\nBut I was thinking to myself this this guy's checking heat and he seems to have everything under control unless he just can't get left handed hitters you know unless you can't get this guy out take it a lefty out\nOr it has terrible numbers against ... you'd think you'd leave him in there but it goes back to my thing for us all the time and you were just talking about being a results oriented with your with your slipping on the oh it's just because it happened well doesn't mean all of a sudden everything turned around\nThey Roberts was doing what got him there and what got that down there and I know I've been hearing all over the place they a lot of people quibbling in terms of uh you know day a day Roberts was playing the numbers that he should have played by his feel and he went to left by as in there and all this wouldn't have happened\nAnd it's like you know what Alex Koran was doing the exact same thing he\nWas my and the numbers he was laying the odds he reacted the only difference was he was able to be the last one to act\nAnd his action paid off in New York City in the home run but it's not like the Roberts did something crazy and Alex ... is John right they they both made decisions that they normally make in those situations and because he's got that might have stopped right now it worked out for our court and I think that's the takeaway is that\nNot that he's getting lucky although I defined luck as you have to put yourself in the position to get lucky anyway and that usually skilled put yourself in that position\nBut it just seems like out of all the coin slips out of all the sixty four Seventy five twenty five situations that the red Sox have found themselves and not only this postseason but really all season long Alex ... seem to come out on the winning end and that was a that was the same thing that happened last night\nYou know the great Yogi diamond Dallas pages described a lock is one skill meets opportunity or was that a lot to do it for ... hours right there I'm sure I'm sure you'll Clemens never heard of that ah I've got a job Kelly looked really driven by the ball ... slipping on the ice yup just throw in straight gas\nIn the course Ryan Braves you're the balloon popped a little bit on\nHim well that's another thing so it's like you want to talk about\nCars making all the right decisions and Roberts is making Rob wrong decisions\nWhat was going to do and leaving Braves are out there to face a mini Machado I mean he just got lucky it right there there was a ... he didn't hit a three run Homer exactly and and razor ... didn't look good when he was out there he's been great but he didn't look good last night and you would think that was one of those situations\nWe talked about earlier say oh they're the quick hook with sale but yet he leaves Braves you're out there and he he managed to get away with it so you know what credit to Alex Cora\nHe's going with the decisions he thinks their best and God Bless them they're working out\nAnd the managers are going to be on the hook because as we're finding out and it was this way last year to\nYear it was more about your often send your bullpen getting you know a World Series and it was whomever you're starting pitcher was and if it's going to be about hitting bullpen\nThen it's also about your manager and I think the managers have an idea of the script they are going to follow it was just a matter whether those guys are going to execute or not so gain two is tonight\nAnd David Price is on the mound but we will hear from Red Sox manager our score coming up I Want to hear from year one eight hundred three two one W.

an hour early\nThe slider had quite a few swings and Mrs ... it was much sharper than its last outing um you know I just I think he looked like I had ... and Dave didn't necessarily have a lot of sharp is\nIt got into a ton of count and like you said earlier Los Angeles was able to work in um you know drive up the pitch come Ninety One by the time he reached spending a and he wasn't going to be long for that yeah\nBut uh I just think based on raw stuff it probably as good as you look in a while it's certainly\nNot the vintage Kris sale that we saw in the mid season in in June or July uh I Wonder if he has to make another starting game five will there be a little more sharpness there will that be may be married to the stuff that we saw last night uh it will be better in in the warm

bill Koch twenty five what was it like in the press box with smart baseball people who have access to the numbers\nWhen Eduardo Munoz pinch hit for Rafi Denver's\nThe scary thing crashes that before the game when we met without Cora in his office he told us that there could be a spotlight the game where nearly as could come up against the left handed reliever could be Alex what it is going to have a critical at that\nAnd just the type of thing where you want to look at the guy and say could could you draw your Powerball numbers tonight [laughter] and you make me a billionaire [laughter] um\nBecause he makes these decisions and the players make it looked like a genius by coming through obviously in that spot here in New and yet gets a breaking ball down in in in the Gulf that up into the monster seats in terms of five for game into an eight for game um I just think though that crash he he has a game plan\nGoing into these games he has an idea of hitters he\nWants to face pitchers and pictures he wants to face hitters and he's able to get those match ups in the late innings in particular um and he's most importantly he's able to communicate that to these guys beforehand ah you know pneumonia is\nVeteran guy who's played against left handed pitching most of the year you know he could have been a little disappointed that he wasn't starting in one of the world series and and that route field divers find third base but instead he stayed ready you get hurt his name called in the seventh inning and he took advantage of his opportunity\nDid Alex Cora give you any similar kind of nugget before tonight's game\nOr just that it's probably going to be something similar to last night the lineup is is pretty much the same uh except behind the plate you've got Christian Vasquez catching David Price you Jackie Bradley junior bad and gave\nUp but the Pentagon how the Dodgers years they've all and laid on a I think you certainly expect to see Mitch Berlin come off the bench ... bench you know maybe brought cult come off the bench as well uh you know ... has in mind\nWhat he would like do against the Dodgers staff but it's just a matter of getting them into position in the sixth seventh eighth inning where he's able to let those guys off the bench loose and and get up to the plate\nI got both catchers defensively last night were ... on the whole pretty doggone good and I know the Dodgers catcher was bombarded there when Madsen came into the game and really had to make some great defensive plays but\nBill I wouldn't have been a million dollars even with great odds that seemingly own would have got to hits last night\nNo or you know he he really struggle obviously likely spoke about yesterday ... regular season five or Seventy nine and and really it wasn't even hitting balls hard it it wasn't like he was making loud out at any point uh you know they would strike outs or ... or pop ups or\nYou know so to see him get two hits in the game or one of them are ... ... ah you know like you said you what about the mortgage against it um you know but\nThat's just the bonus uh you know when a guy like Sandy we own or or Jackie Bradley in the previous series when those guys at the bottom of the order able to get on it just creates opportunity for\nHitters like move the bat and Andrew Bennett Andy and JD Martinez and and those are the guys who are really getting bribed Iraq\nNo concept of Providence Journal here on the ground showing WPRI getting ready for game two of the world series bill is at Fenway you'll be able to read all these great work in the Providence Journal of course give them a follow on Twitter at bill ... twenty five\nBut do you expect the running game for the red Sox still be as big a factor tonight as it was last night is that a permanent part of the game plan here against the Dodgers\nI think it's something that they've done all year crash a you know scar his place great emphasis on being aggressive whether that be hitting a pitching playing defense or on the base um\nYou know it's something that they do a lot of study with a you know they take a long look at opposing pitchers in particular starters\nTo see how they hold on runners um you know to see if they could steal an expert base or two here or there or you know you're able to move the guy up the second with throughout the score on a single\nIf you can move a guy up the third with one out of the score on a sacrifice fly in and I think you know those are maybe sort of the areas of the game that Cora as a career utility guy\nA guy wasn't necessarily a starter home run hitter\nHe had to pay a little more attention around the larger um yeah that was the sort of area where he was going to be able to contribute and and make his impact if something like hitting a ground ball the right side with runner at second base and nobody out that was his job you know when he was playing with the mirrors and David Ortiz\nIt was their job to come up and hit the ball over the fence but he was providing something a little different and I think\nYou know a Red Sox theme with with great talent and obviously some really good hitters in the line I think you sort of tried to provide you know maybe a different skill sets it that they can employ from time to time\nBill last thing for you huh what is your vibe on David Price heading into tonight and what can you tell us about ... gene view who may be a lot of people either don't know all the haven't heard of or like me can't pronounce his damn name\nSure uh in terms of review or he has reversed split seconds left handed hitters which is why you see Deborah's on the line up a writing only have a career six sixty two O. P. S. against him left these are much more successful at seven Seventy three um you know you're you're more likely to see endeavors in the lineup which he is\nA you felt like that would be the case coming in um you know it's sort of a you know control guys got to change up he's got a breaking ball that's probably is key pitches the curve ball or whether or not he's able to grip it located in the cold will see a in terms of David Price\nI I'll be honest I have no idea what to expect from this guy or you know we've seen\nBoth extremes in the playoffs he faced ten ... in the first start again the Yankees only got five of them out\nAnd his last out and he looked like one of the best postseason pitchers I've ever seen a against a really really good line up and use that [noise] um so I think the red Sox in this case would take something in the middle from price whether it's five or six innings\nTwo or three runs something that keeps them in the game and something that keeps his confident basically need make another starting this year\nAbdel ... twenty five on Twitter read his work tomorrow morning in the Providence Journal and at ... dot com Bill thanks for the time and the preview we
