Ian Rapaport\nOf NFL Network rolling out there that are Josh Gordon apparently a part of the story was right like even um even a guy mark Daniel said oh I heard that he was weights and da da da\nDa da ding punish him and I I I look\nBill loves to mess with the media as much as anybody but I don't think to the point to where it who served sitting behind closed doors in disciplining is football\nTeam or know what this guy come in here and do whatever he wants and the media is going to be baffled by it I don't care what let them run roughshod over this whole\nThing white that's my ... my hunch is that maybe there was something maybe there was an explanation in who knows maybe got like a flat tire or whatever\nBut whatever she's me whatever went down neither ... nor Gordon would tip their hand in the post game press conference which does automatically make me start to think that maybe just maybe but there's less to this story then more to\nThe store I think you just sort of hit the nail on the head rush in terms of I bet he was white but I bet he called and said he was going to\nBe late or it was a situation where he was with someone else and they called or whatever I met he was light but it was an excuse to party if you will you got a note from his doctor or\nA similarly uh appropriate person and he came in and so he was late so those hardworking beat writers crash they saw him arrived late to the facility and because they're doing their jobs they made note of that and so they weren't wrong to be asking those questions\nBut ah you know bill just stonewall dumb and did what he does and and Gordon acted more confused really than anything else which again sort of led me to believe\nThat he wasn't under the impression that he had done anything wrong and the only way I think that can be the case is if he'd been told he hadn't done anything wrong because I don't think this is a situation where\nYou know on the whole will deal with this after the game Joshua no you discipline them on the spot and if it just wasn't going to come after the game\nThen you tell them but at least then he'd be aware of what he was being disciplined for\nAnd possibly be able to offer some sort of a you know half hearted apology but no I I think you just hit the nail on the head in terms of I bet he was the late which is why those rumors or that news got spread around yup but the fact that he started and played full complement of snaps and everything leads me to believe that\nIf he was late it was an excuse to party and even if it wasn't nobody cares\n[noise] yeah I'm I'm\nWhich I doubt that second part which is I just sort of threw that in there I mean I doubt nobody cares I'm fairly confident people care which is why I found out in force to lean towards the fact that uh you know he was late but it wasn't on the various reason I mean we're talking about the guy who benched a wide receiver all wide receiver right as he made foot references China's conference\nAfter bill it said don't do it and then he went and did it right exactly like don't be late right and then if you're a way you would think the ballot check would come down on yes I I just at the end of the day\nYou know boarding will always have the microscope on him so any little thing that could happen might happen does happen there's going to be a lot of reaction and I understand that because he's a polarizing choir\nBut let me just really is is Marius Thomas was traded a centrally forty fourth round pick next year\nIt's been a win win patriots stop the Josh Gordon was in the main problem and the situation had to be rectified so that the season didn't go down the drain or the bill would check wasn't put in a spot tour is going to look like a hypocrite in front of other people\nThen they would have traded a fourth round pick or a third round pick because you know what they're going to get\nA bunch of third round picks as compensatory selections because of losing people like Malcolm Butler last year\nAnd they probably just wouldn't know I mean if you're the reports are to be believed they probably just wouldn't have asked for the money the Denver was asking for 'cause that's apparently was holed up so it's like right if they were so hell bent on getting rid of Josh Gordon or replacing John scored they could have easily done it at the trade deadline at least that's what you hear\nYup no question about it now the rest of the trades went down today were pretty interesting but not so much in terms of you know the teams acquiring players but some of the players that were moved so we mentioned to marry Thomas they've\nDone fantasy football implications and these trades why I think they've been getting so much news right I mean if a bunch of offensive lineman who are extremely important or traded it would probably be on the bottom line but when golden said\nOh yeah you know golden tape goes from Detroit to the eagles for a third round pick in two thousand Nineteen uh the Packers running back wide receiver their core narrow Patterson time a gum Rene traded to the ravens forty seventh round\nPick in two thousand and twenty now do you do you have the time and gum or anything\nThat we got time on that we have the reason why time Montgomery was trained let's play [noise]\n\n\n\n\nThat's up to you know yes well you can you were just\nTalking about the whole Gordon thing without with bell jak and you know he'd been laid before so they warned him about it the the best slash worst part about that and there's a million best worst part about that play which is probably do is that they explicitly told to Montgomery on the sideline before the kick off\nIf the ball is kicked the end of the end zone you drop to your need we want to get the ball to Aaron freaking Rogers because we're only down three or whatever it was and we are going to have a chance to win with\nTo dance in the lab but I mean one time out they had the two minute warning and they had Aaron freaking Rogers and time Montgomery because he had male poor boy this is at least what an unnamed Packers player was saying in the locker room\nA title of his backs it up yeah right exactly time on governor he was trying to make up for a mistake he had made earlier in the game and according to the Packers player quote he was doing him so it's like\nListen the team told time Montgomery to the getting me I'm going to take me and he said yeah and I'm gonna watch this and I'm the bean and not only did it get him traded to the ravens\nBut as we talked about grass on on friday Green Bay I had a great chance to win the freaking fatality all government he owes us money yup\nI'm with you on that ought Dante Fowler defense to men from Jacksonville was sent to the rams

Kuti is somebody that was a point up if he can get back on the field I Know is that a hamstring injury\nIn for went down he stood to benefit the most but uh\nYou know now with the with Thomas he really just kind of slots it at that for spot I don't he doesn't have the famous the upside of four\nI think Tom is you know remains kind of a you know around between twenty five and a third among fantasy receivers most week I think the big winner here as Cortland Sutton the rookie receiver for the Broncos because now he's going to be the number two guy and going back to what we're talking about with golden tape thing kind of thing with Kenny Golladay\nArab points up on him I think he can be a top ... fantasy wide out from here to the end of the season so it's really those guys who kind of step up for me and the teams third receiver to the second receiver so I Do consider Emanuel standards to be the number one even when Thomas but still they're\nStarting to become the two in Denver dollar they become clear cut\nTo you know I'm actually gonna call one eight and want to be with Marvin Jones I I think actually I'd rather have golladay over Jones does more of a big play guy but to me those are the ones that really win whereas\nTate and Thomas or playing a similar role with their new teams that played for the old team I don't think there's going to be a lot a lot of difference there in terms of fantasy\nHow about Green Bay trading away time Montgomery I mean is it just now Jones the running back who's going to benefit and this time of gum or you have any value in Baltimore and were clearly feels like a white trade\nYeah I agree with you I Can't see a Montgomery having that much value I mean in ... he might have a a week or two where you know he's going to give you a catches up the ravens are playing from behind but you're not going to be able to pick out\nOne that's going to be a buck an hour and if anybody was rolling buck hour an hour I think you can safely drop him in all fantasy leagues because that's the rule I think Montgomery is going to play in Green Bay airline Jones to me is by far the best of the the three backs\nThat the Packers have had a you know Williams is is really just a guy and\nJones to me I now has upside because you know it remains to be seen which one was going to play on third downs but it seems as if Jones has more of the third downs skill set\nSo we could be looking at you know even though it's time to be a time share I could see Jones are really getting maybe twenty percent more wraps and he's gotten to this point in the season now that Montgomery is no longer there\nOkay now it's a trade deadline has come and passed lady on bell is still not in camp with Pittsburgh we know for him to get the occurred seizing he's got to show up at some point so if you're a James Caan or owner and you've been watching that situation closely what\nKind of advice you have for the lady on bell owner and the James Carter owner because you know the God's gonna walk back into that facility at some point\nYeah I think if you can sell high on Connor to somebody to believe that the that was not going to come back then you go ahead and do it or if you're an owner of both battle in town or obviously you just hang on to them\nOr I Would go out and you know it's so hard to say what's going to happen with bell from here to the end of the season but if you're in a good spot right you're sitting there and fantasy and uh yeah maybe you only have a two losses on the season and you'll looking toward weeks fourteen Fifteen and sixteen\nThat's where I think a guy like heavy on belt could really start to pay dividends I'm not sure he's going to step in there and immediately be getting the kind of work load that we've been used to in years past but when you look at his ... his fantasy playoff schedule\nHe's got Oakland a week for team the patriots me Fifteen the same week sixteen those are all defenses that can be run on they can be passed on\nAnd I think that a bell I Would expect him to come out of the gate very slowly but by December as the Steelers are working toward the playoffs I could see his workload increasing and he couldn't up being a difference maker in fantasy come playoff time\nSat rambling a fantasy football draft guide here on the ground show on WNPR oh follow him on Twitter at\nScott Brown wing and of course he is sponsored by receivables heating and air conditioning bringing you rambling fantasy one not every week and now it's getting into the Cleveland Browns who not only fired her head coach who was an offering some guy they fire the officer coordinator in Todd Haley as well\nThey completely overturn the apple cart there\nSo if you are the owner of Brown's players like David and joke through oral wide receiver or Nick ... Baker may feel\nUm what are you ... what do you do now that\nI mean can anybody predict what the hell is going to happen with that team often simply these remaining eight weeks\nStill guys are going to roll out there there's still going to run off offensive plays and there's still going to put up numbers this isn't a team that's going to look like the bills off is I I really don't think that's going to be the case here I think that uh you know they're going to struggle are going to turn the ball over the probably not going to win football games\nBut I think there are going to be weeks in the right match up where Baker Mayfield is worthy of consideration I'm if you've got your starting quarterback on a by I think in joke to me is somebody who\nI I just don't know what's going on and if that kind of a lead to the dismissal of hell he wasn't even targeted this past week and that's one of the main weapons\nAnd you know the Steelers had been giving up a decent amount of a fantasy pointed yards to opposing tightened so I kind of feel like you just have to stay the course with those guys and if there's owners in your league that are looking to uh\nYou know not dumb but the you know how to giving up on them a bit I I Would seriously consider pulling the trigger\nIn joke who was the one that I liked the best buy low by very low candidate\nOr if you're stuck with guys like shady McCoy on bad teams I mean now the trade deadline is gone does that alter the strategy mid some fantasy owners may have hoping that maybe a guy was going to end up in a different place\nYou're the Sean Jackson owner or like I said you know I'm I've been sitting on shady McCoy for a while these guys didn't get moved at the deadline shore you're stuck\nWith them do you cut bait what do you do some of these do\nYeah it's a it it's tough really the the McCoy wanted to tough it because you thought that maybe he could get out of that purgatory of buffalo yeah go to a place where you could start putting up numbers I mean you know if they're going to be playing from behind and McCoys did you know caught six passes for eighty two yards against the path\nUm he's just he's such a high to trust it just because that off this is so pathetic and I'm not quite sure you know\nGoing forward I feel like if you have McCoy is one of the two running backs\nIn your starting lineup or you're playing from a high I just don't think that he is somebody that you really want to be rolling out there I don't think he's the top twenty five and if you're running back at this point I'm not even sure he's a he's top thirty to be honest with you crash\nAll right so we have a big ask if you next week I Am going to send you\nA the credentials so the next Tuesday you can check out the ... show
