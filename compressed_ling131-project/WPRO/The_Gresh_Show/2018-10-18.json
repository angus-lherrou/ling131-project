so\nHe might like fall day when he would never like he will topple over in the chair for God's\nSake what you'd have to worry about with Zoe he comes off as like a grabbers ... shoulders and just start shaking headset comes fly at all nope\nPoor little Bob is just beside themselves arms in the air tried to make the call or the missing would be all Harrington in a situation like that but you know what though is an excitable man much like Joe ... and you know what that passion brush can come in handy when it comes to play all sporting event\nYeah very much so and a look in terms of last night's game a recall with Mickey bats I I don't I think they got the call right and then I'll get the boy credit\nAnd I mean I don't want to do that believe you me I Want to be here and tell you that Joe West is a moron and the ... you got it wrong but it also doesn't matter what we say crash because we're Red Sox ... of course we think that was a home run\nOff or wasn't a home run rather proud to say and that that's made the right play but ah yeah I thought you know what Joe West made the call\nSeemingly in ways that he was asked out there that was the big thing rich right right yeah exactly he was he was Johnny on the spot that a cowboy Joe West he wasn't just a sitting there you like he didn't just turn around from first base finishing a sandwich on his phone an Angry Birds [laughter] trying to\nBribe the guy who's running the video board to play some cowboy music\nOh my goodness you'll get a a a little bit of our score coming up here on the grass show on WNPR on fat you will hear from the red Sox manager in just a little over five minutes from now but\nI I had a bill Hammond asked me this earlier today from the WPRI news department a woods Ben intend these catch the greatest catch in Red Sox history ... yeah that's a tough one for me I I don't know\nI Can't definitively say I will say this I think in terms of its Koch miss if that's a word but it's the most clutch catch in Red Sox history\nOn the ... meter it would it would rate very high on the ... the big Papi need\nI Would agree with that and I would agree with you and big Papi on that and I now\nThe thing is is that made me better than tend to just made it look easy but\nI garden variety is disrespectful so I'm not saying that but I think relative to the skill level of Andrew bend in Tempe that was not\nYou know way jump up reach over the wall pull it back in time to catch or if it goes under the glove and it goes to the wall the game is probably over so from that respect you have to add that into the equation but he made it look so easy that I'm trying to prove pulling it a little bit or\n... tend to just made a great catch and there wasn't really that difficult for someone that his youth and skill level but the bottom line is the red Sox game away from the world series\nThat is amazing when you think about it and I didn't think they'd win this series I bought the pitching would let them down I thought they'd have big problems who knew the native already with pictures tail off once again and now the red Sox or in the perfect scenario last night\nWe were thinking oh my God what if the series is to to David Price on the mound and yes I Want them to close it out and I want them to win the damn series but with David Price on the mound\nAh I'm not going to get my hopes up if they win it it's great\nBut luckily I can breathe a sigh of relief\nThat even doesn't go right tonight\nThen in two days it will now that means for sales on the mound however\nIt means a crew sales on the mound but everybody had a day off to hit the reset button and the full complement of arms will be available that's what really complicates things tonight is that David Price he gets he is the issues in the third inning\nGoing to get them out of there now they are going to turn to daddy Rodriguez and hopefully there's no place at first base because any Rodriguez has been no great shakes too he's been dealing with injury\nLuckily for the socks to the the Astros bullpen is pretty shot that could James for like fifty pitches last night that another reliever throw up words uh thirty pitchers so Red Sox aren't alone in that but yeah the both of them will rear its head yet again unlikely\nEnergy yes and it's going to rear its ugly head because David prices to ensure that that's going to be the case\nAnd maybe just maybe roots maybe the blind scoring will find a nut complete gave no head out and well let's not go that far but if I if it's five innings in the red Sox have the lead a I Would be as static with David Price\nFor him to roll that out tonight you will hear from Alex core coming up one eight hundred three two one W.
