I mean anyone can foremost I cite agree you could have a a fight the\nUh forming a side agreement with a a union to resolve a particular issue or to create a benefit at that essentially collective bargaining however\nMerely because you form the agreement doesn't necessarily make it a valid one if the side agreement it struck it then has to go through\nThe process of a a ratification\nMore famous to me that's not done that seems to me the ... the fact that it's a site agreement makes it are automatically invalid because if it wasn't a side agreement would just be an addendum to the contract\n[noise] wow maybe different decided means that we have an agreement over here that nobody knows about now we're kind of just working out between ourselves those can happen\nSite agreements can be negotiated but they have to come to this or that they have to be presented oftentimes ah issues arise during the life of the it for a year collective bargaining agreement and the party need to collectively bargain a a side agreement or a memorandum of agreement\nOr a memorandum of understanding orange some cases they stipulate to an arbitration award which is a form of an agreement mhm consent agreement if you will an arbitration the point is\nThose agreements still to be valid must be vetted by the city or town council or the ratifying body and if they're not than they are not valid collective bargaining agreements because remember even though they may be single subject matter\nBy agreement they still are in the nature of collective bargaining agreements they struck between a union and the ... and as such they have to be ratified if\nNot their invalid void and unenforceable\nAnd if they then take a step further if they are acted upon as if they are enforceable unreal what happens then\n[noise] well that's an interesting question because unions often grieve violations of side agreement and then when a revelation has made that side agreement was never ratified\nThen diminish the power the has the ability to raise as an affirmative defense a void ability or in validity and on and force ability of though the so called site equipment so\nI'm again merely because people go through the motions of preparing the side agreement on cases signing it in some cases acting upon it\nDoesn't make it necessarily a valid collective bargaining agreement if it's not ratified now\nYou have to look to agreements procedure too because in a main collective bargaining agreement your grievance procedure to find what a grievances and normally\nIt's defined as a violation of the collective bargaining agreement already missed application already misinterpretation of the collective bargaining agreement\nAnd when you have a side agreement that it is the subject matter that is not in the collective bug and and that's not been ratified\nThan one can argue that the grievance is not even substantively opera trickle in other words you cannot sue a grievance oversight agreement that's never been ratified in the first\nYou know it doesn't exist and this is Robert ... hold on one second preview in regards to those leader attorney in Rhode Island is going to advocate for the

acting mayor when the prior Mehra was on vacation or when he left office permanently on may fifteenth of this year I I was sworn in on may sixteenth by a ... a member of the judiciary and I became the mayor of the city of Warwick so\nMy whole no long I'm no longer acting [laughter] I I Am the mayor yes\nAnd hopefully a the voters will re elect me in November to serve an additional two years\nMy apologies that was just trying to uh to delineate between you know a temper I get on a separate one a shortened tenure rather than a full term\n... and I understand that puts so often uh uh you know I just wanted to clarify\nNo I've been going accuracy it into your accuracy is important my apologies for that so mayor full blown mayor board um [laughter] I heard that you that you've visited can block yesterday I Know I did this morning I was always a similar from Asia Matt you didn't [laughter] I visited him this morning It's MORNING I'm Sorry yes\nYeah that that was only after I met with the uh the fire chief in my office first thing this morning\nSo you hear about this for me 'cause I Know we talk to you had not heard about it or not\nI didn't I didn't hear about it from you [laughter] um I when I Walk this morning I have my cup of coffee pick up the\nPaper read the newspaper and I saw the article in the front page of today's Providence Journal and what was your reaction to it\nAh it sparked my curiosity that I Want to come in earlier than normal and try to gather as much facts are actual ah background to this as possible and address what I think is a very important issue that has to be addressed\nSo ... do you look at this and the same way can thought it was that this was some kind of a um an issue of intimidation or attempted to imitation\n[noise] ah no I don't take that point of view I I Know that the point of view that Mr block talk but uh I Am gathering all the factual information that I'm able to gather at this time and I will continue to get that information\nAre and how did that information was speaking to the chief of my fire to ... of of the city of walks fire department a relative to the information he may have\nAnd uh from there I went\nTo directly to the property location as you know there are for businesses that that\nProperty so I I wanted to get a better understanding as to what actually did occur there\nThe first business I went to that there was someone occupying was ah this the blocks business that ring the doorbell or he invited me in a he showed me around his business and a proceeded to tell me the factual scenario encountered\nA upon a a visit to establishment\nAnd I again I indicated them is to block that I Will be\nTaking the information he provided to me the information that will be forthcoming from my fire chief and if it requires further investigation by any outside authorities and the information that people will be provided by them and a\nCorrect or take the appropriate at that appropriate action necessary to address this issue not because it's can block that if it was transmitted or anyone else or I Want to make sure that uh we are treating everyone equally enforcement equally\nAnd done that there are no ulterior motives to any actions taken by any personnel on the city\nOr the phone calls they're recorded\nEvery adult balls at my office\nI Know no no no I'm Talking about you the truth is I don't know where the call came in for the for the anonymous tip for the inspection\nI I I think if if fire does at the same way as police\nIf it comes in a as an emergency or a state it as a non emergency I don't know if you call it the individual directly um if those calls are recorded or not recorded I Know within our um system and I haven't\nMet one of the reason why I mean I Am I asked department yet but there may be some sort of record I I don't know I mean I've just been\nI've been performing to shop for six months in every day is an education and you're a learning experience and an issue that arises that we uh attempt to a address and do what's best for the taxpayers of the city\nSo you'd be looking into this doing some kind of an investigation to see if somebody inappropriately a cold this in in a in an effort to kinda send a message to can block and when the new oil there as well\nI I I Am looking if there was a wrong committed I'm looking to address that wrong ... upon receiving all the facts and examination\nAnd I objectively sought those facts and I and we're both visiting the taxpayer business and dealing with the department head or why I in turn I haven't\nGotten that information yeah you're waiting on that from\nThe ... well uh yes I Am waiting for that information from the cheap I gave him a list of items that are I Would like to see and the upon examination of those items or it may require you know nothing or it may be quiet further examination\n... from a different authority like you get that in front of me and I cannot um definitively tell you what's going to have a you know what the verdict is sort of\nYeah yeah I appreciate that so I you know good for you for doing that I think it's important issue since a terrible message if it's ... it's in fact what it looks like such a terrible message to the business owners in Oregon it's a it's it's like you can have that kind of thing can have a I Can't have fire service and fire protection weaponized against business owner so\nWell as you know ... I'm I'm I'm pro economic development I uh actively seek businesses to come into our community and I would it would be counter to my ideals as to where I Want to see the direction of this community co and making ... uninviting\nA to locate a business or expand the business within our community\n... he taught me about the about the ... time with the firefighters where are we with this and and this this whole story came out in the journal on on Tuesday I Believe it was the issue there are we as a city of war still paying this out to people we don't know what are we doing with ... what is what is being paid to fire ...\nAnd so there is there a benefits that they know\nThe the the press the um [noise] the formula that was in place when I took office um had a has been a a canceled\n... um and that was because ah upon examination by the fire chief and uh as to how this\nCame to be a a document resurrected a executed by parties are back in two thousand Thirteen on that possibly may not\nBe um a a legally and\nForce forcible type of document I don't know I'm waiting to see what the APA trade has come back at but once we found out that that document it existed\nChief a discontinued that policy that was going on a a grievance was filed by\nThe uh the the union firefighters union or the chief\nDenied the grievance and that was appealed to my office and at that point it's up to me to uphold that the denial or reverse that denial I upheld that than I ... and I stood behind the chief finding that the document was not proper\nThey're still getting their their sick time bone is it's just not calculated\nWithout based on this um this site agreement that appeared now based on\nLet's talk about when we talk about that side agreement for a second I mean is it or is it beyond a is there any any sort of a definition or any sort of a type of site agreement that you could ever possibly see being legal in the city of war for any ... chief executive to make with any sort of union outside of the council purview\nAs well as the eye and the uh originator of ratification by the city council of any agreements entered into of this nature I can tell you that if there's going to be any amendment to an agreement\nOr if there's going to be agreement at all and requires the ratification of the legislative branch of government which is the city council to making it\nRight in agreement and that's what happened uh and then if it's ratified it uh it uh you know\nIt becomes implement that sure I'm\nSo there's no sense in other words there's no such thing as side deals with mayors of any\nKind of it is well I I don't know if there's any such thing as side deals but let's just not legal thing is\nUh other agencies not not the city council but uh that's it I can tell you that if you're coming before the council and you know\nThe your uh had these side agreements\nAnd we voted on in other collective bargaining agreement in two thousand sixteen this one was an amendment to a collective bargaining agreement that was voted on a two thousand twelve right how you can come before the council and not have a\nA come before us and told us that there was this I'd agreement that significantly impacted or what we believed was the compensation package is unconscious\nWho presented it to the fire chief\nOr the fire chief ... and ...\nIt seems to me yeah now\nNow I read in the paper the mayor I had no knowledge of this yet the administration paid out the the the money that goes along with the amendment\nRight what does that tell you so I don't know that occurs it seems to me and\nYou know we're we're a part time legislative body when people come before us and gives it give us fiscal notes and tell us the impact on our budget we assume that telling us the truth mhm\n\nAnd somebody lied year\nWell it wasn't a you know you can call it a lie certainly wasn't the truth\nThe intent is the issue right I talked to the dry out a little you know I've talked to a guy about it though I Can't\nAsk I Can't oh sue what the intent was what I can tell you [laughter]\nEverybody damn well knows what they're supposed to do when they because when they come before the city council and the collective bargaining ugly and I expect people to tell us the truth\nWell that's the issue and I talked to move in regards to yesterday said well some people are ignorant to this I have a I have a zero ability to believe that all that that I don't know why your legs\nAre into it if they paid out\n... right I'm I'm Talking about ... ignorance of the fact that this stuff has to be um that has to be ratified um there's no way anybody in the seventies you know the rehab\nSo will you know and it was witnessed by the um the city solicitor for the city award who reports directly to the mayor\nMarried ... yeah yeah\nDo you is there any ability for you and desire for you at the council to call for an investigative body to come in and look at this as a result well\nObviously we have and now uh you know when you say investigative body we've hired an accounting firm and every day it seems like ... or more accurately every week uh the the task\nThat CPA for changes\nAs their investigation goes deeper and deeper and more and more as uncovered\nWhat about law enforcement ... every time we start an investigation to look at something that you know Mr Cody missed the block brought us those documents are a few months back we provided those the CPA firms were not waters\nOr they went in a in and started looking at it and as they requested records are more and more information started to come out um and uh it was very upsetting\nSteven Rosen city council president ... so what about law enforcement here at this point the attorney general's office state police\nIs there some are going to be some kind of ah you know recognition yeah I ...\nI'm not going to jeopardize any investigations but he's talking about what ... what may or may not be going on that's not my role my role is to approve things\nUh and there are other agencies are that look at this and make determinations\nAs to impact and\nUh I don't think it's in the best interest of the citizens of war word that I turn around and said that there is an investigation or there is an investigation of we're assuming that someone did something wrong or that's not my task as an elected official like\nWell how am I saying what do you mean by that others will hold on a second that's why that doesn't make any sense it is a city council president and his represented the people it sure is within your purview to say listen uh we see some sneaky stuff your last going on here so it's called the sleep at least Letterman and I\nThought it looked like we have an ... I I've already made statements active investigations happening and I'm not going to talk about potential litigation matters because I don't believe it's the best interest of the city as to what could or could not happen\nWell hold on hold on to say when you see investigations you talked about in order that's being done is law enforcement involved in looking in this\nI Can't answer any questions regarding any pending investigation that's that's up to the agency\nHas the city council officially gone off to any law enforcement agencies and presented this and say maybe I should you should have should come take a look at this\n... very good question [noise] uh and you know it's a yes or no I\nI Know that this issue just came up with regard to the to this contract I'm sure that people are working and I'm not\nGoing to jeopardize investigations by saying that they are are they are not um you know this is a very fine line here between a\nPending investigations and making statements and I'm sure You're welcome very well aware of it uh as to whether what my beliefs are compared to what the facts are and I have a fiduciary obligation to the citizens that I can assure them that I'm that I'm following my fiduciary I'll\nHold on one second costs mineral I get a quick break and come back to the ... the city council president we come back and when I just want to ah just going to explain what he just said a little bit more and ask them a couple more questions will do that we come back next city council President Morsi role is on the line with me come from I just wanted to clarify something for me\nI'm sure in your ... you don't have to talk to me about any potential investigation but you know you can tell me what you've done have you and your capacity of city council president or anybody in the council contacted law enforcement to look into this\nI can tell you that wall any investigations ... that people have contacted\nMe on or requested information from war any a a investigations in the future I have and will continue to cooperate with and I don't I Can't I I Know you're trying to get me to say was or crime there was like\nOh no no I'm trying to get by I don't know that that's a threat to the agency I get you from a civil\nPerspective you know what we've done is an extensive amount of research which continues to to yield these unprecedented results as far as I'm concerned of where we're finding out the good agreements were rats\nMight might I'm not asking you to tell me about that I'm asking you about whether or not there was a crime I'm asking you whether or not somebody ... you think somebody should look into it to see if there was a crime\nOh yeah that that's what we're doing okay yeah I mean I mean it was that what you're doing obviously should try this is what you've seen it it it\nWas what you see and say you know it's time to officially in publicly asked the state police to come and look at this order after the U.S attorney to come and look at this\n... I'm Sorry could you repeat that oh\nFrom what you've seen and what you know about your with your what you've seen so far is do you now think that there's time to publicly calls as a city council president for federal law enforcement or state law enforcement to come in and look and see for crime has been committed\nWell I I just said that as far as investigations that on cooperating with any investigation or\nHave you been contacted by adding out and that's as far as I'm willing to go have you been\nDoing this is talk of AMC W.

hearing the same thing I did my colleague standing wanted I we don't put bills on the floor just a vote them down I I Would not think that was good for the paw socks off for the process so we kept collaborating in and I thought that it probably was not going to go anywhere\nThe reason the process occurred at the\nThe news I thought we weren't going to do anything and then I learned of the special revenue bond option and I started\nLooking into that pursuing that at the end now at that point you have to talk to Pataki you have to talk to the fore shocks and those conversations were going on at the staff level or so it took us to the end of the process but it was at the end for a chance only because\nWe learned of that option within the last month of\nSessions or for a final

us on non mayor Allen ...\nA minus and I think should let your taxing partner know that Governor governor fall\nUnder the job Mr price Rhode Island lawmakers are considering a bill called the reproductive health CARE Act which would kind of fire abortion rights in state law do you support or oppose that bill it does more than that and I oppose it out I'm Sorry what was it the reproductive health health care act do support or oppose\nI'm pro life but I understand there's a big concern so will you know will certainly have discussions and uh you have to respect large segments of the population\nWhat let me just ask you use the specific team was dramatic hello you're under a lot of pressure to bring that bill up for vote or from women in your contests will you let that happen next year\nWe're going to have a discussion about it I you know I I've got a lot of colleagues and and share folks and we'll we'll talk with them but I Do recognize that there's a big segment of the population that has interest and then and you you certainly tried to respect the people that you represent\nOkay thank Mr price on Mr ... running heavily on his record on the economy and the policies he's a foot forward or had approved while he's been speaker and it it's true that quite a number of tax cuts happen passed since he became speaker and twenty fourteen some conservatives argue that if you defeat Mr Mann yellow it'll actually move state policy to the left\nBecause the more progressive a lawmaker could very well replacing the speaker voted by the Democrats are you willing to give up the potential for more conservative policies or if you defeat in secret Mary Ellen become a rank and file Republican\nA very simple start out with this answer or taxes have been cut and other taxes have been expanded are gone up under speaker Matty yellow as majority leader and as speaker number one number two\nIf we defeat the speaker will not get a progressive speaker where we would get is a more ethical speaker a speaker who doesn't run campaigns that engage illegal activities a speaker may support government reforms like a line item veto I think we can have in this state\nA lower taxes and government reforms and we don't have to be dependent on a speaker who we are like Mr Matty yellow and\nYou know I don't understand the argument we're going to get a progressive speaker if the progress has had a power to take over the house they do right now they don't so let's get somebody in their new let's end the culture of corruption and let's bring change to her and I\n... I that's the same question to governor ... close together the most recent official forecast is over the next five years ramble ranked forty second out of fifty for income growth forty fourth out of fifty for economic growth and forty fifth out of fifty for job growth how can you be satisfied with still being in the bottom ten and those crucial measure she says\nWe're moving moving up and when we were getting better or the Tax Foundation in Washington DC just gave myself and the governor and an award\nA it's a conservative ah preeminent organization and our tax burden on out on us citizens has gone from being the forty seventh most oppressive to the thirty seventh we've\nPassed a head of ten states and just for four and a half years of my way to ship so well miss the friday this carrot mischaracterized this from Iraq and third party validation says we're doing better than ten other states I'm under my leadership cutting the corporate tax the minimum corporate tax\nA sales tax on energy costs for business Rhode Island income tax on Social Security income for\nPeople that can't afford to pay more\nThat's my actual record and it's validated capital you had a letter to the editor yesterday he\nSaid and he's an account that works with these numbers no broad base tax increases under my leadership we've been cutting it's recognized by everybody in the business community the networks with numbers by Mr Freeh is mischaracterized as my record your lead to have a very solid rocket\nFor the economy and we're doing a lot better than we were\nAll right okay so let's go through this quick forty seven thirty seven okay so that's basically we've gone from an F minus two at the miners in my household that's not satisfactory we got to be meeting Massachusetts we can't be saying hey we're just this far behind from Massachusetts and our neighboring states second in regards to these taxes\nWe've expanded the sales tax on the Internet we have not yes we have we have now I'm paying the tax on the Internet I don't know if you are you always had over on the Internet on hand are now over counter drugs expanded pet services sales tax to services though no I had a cat side okay now I'm now you got me off message\nNow when it comes to this and also other things such as\nA DMV these gas tax so we are paying more in taxes under you you can talk in the car tax why we pay the cartoons has how did you did because you ended up you you wrote back to phase out in twenty times now you're trying to make up for it and so everything is even raise taxes so\nAll I can tell you is CNBC Rachel says the fifth force in the country all these with people rate is is really bad so you're basically saying we've made progress yeah they got from the bottom of the ... to the top of the bonnet about when you're out of that and that's not fashion\nWell Larry briefly was we were low when I took over and we're moving in the right direction and we're doing much much better than we are third party validated will tell you Mr Fitz looks at the Internet tax that was always attacks and you have to you have to be fair the a brick and mortar stores\nWe got I got a call one time from from address come politically place people go into a brick and mortar stores\nGet a number and then buy it on the Internet and we're hurting the brick and mortar stores that tax was always do miss the phrase is doing what he always says she'd mischaracterized this we're just treating everybody fairly right\nAway the time as the lower the sales tax for everybody if you're an expanded lower the right mix more competitive\nMr price let's stick with you the state Republicans have been very critical of Mr Mandela for tapping heavily into the legislative grant program if you win will Crenson residents just have to accept that those grants which funds such things as you know\nWas a little leagues in Utah keep programs that those are just going to disappear if you went\nWell basically I won't be promoting legislative grants I won't be asking for them I won't be given them out and so I think what's gonna happen is that if there's less money coming in from the government and people see that they'll put more money than themselves that's a charity was the legislative grants or a new invention they've only exist\nFrom the sea skates Christmas Day cold weather center here's your exclusive

Island John Hayes in white junior he is the chairman and CEO of take a group for a long time Rhode Island there's\nA his father was also John Hayes in white so you're not you're looking at the younger uh Johnny than white Johnny's on white junior who is now in charge of his family's company John thanks for being here it's great to be here [laughter]\nSo right off the top as I said people in Rhode Island no take oh they know your family's name but they might not know exactly what your business as it's been in Rhode Island since the Nineteen twenties I had accents what what are you actually do a take\nOff for the folks at home so a takeover is an acronym actually for thermal appliance company and actually we've changed the name of the identity this year to take a comfort solutions\nWhat take the company that manufactures products makes products in Rhode Island right I'm for ah the application will be for comfort control for heating and air conditioning\nComfort inefficiency or most important thing for people now is to be comfortable at an efficient to a point so so that's really our focus we make little pumps and little valves and big ... big bells and all kinds of equipment for heating and air conditioning [noise]\nUm [noise] uh for both the commercial and residential\nAnd it all goes into getting people at the the temperature they want inside to to keep them comfortable here so we're feeling good about ourselves so on last time I looked at the stats I think I think this is such an interesting statistic by a number of years ago I think around maybe around the time you took over ... take a with doing about thirty five million dollars a year in sales and yeah about five hundred employees\nNow you're doing over two hundred million dollars in sales still about five hundred employees how did you manage that\nYeah so it it's a it's a little convoluted but yes there are Nineteen Ninety two when I became sort of in putting this role\nOf five hundred people in about thirty five million or whatever you and now it's over to our with the same but but um yeah how are you a couple of ways you know for most people would say productivity improvement say OK productivity improvement surely of course\nBut loyalty dependency education of the employees we're a family that work together to to drive this company for like no other company I've ever seen some people actually in my company actually care about doing the best they can to make this company go so and so the so there's no attrition I mean I if I lose or\nTo people here it's a lot is under half a percent\nOf these people know what they're doing how to do it I've always believed that if you if you have a problem to be solved go to the person who's doing what an equipment needs to be solved because they're forgotten more about what they do the rest of us will ever know and that there's a lot of truth to that so that's how we got we now with a company in Vietnam a company in China a couple of companies in China company in the\nAh Italy now in a company in Canada and the states we have just a little under a thousand us or getting but but if you take take over here\nLocally and five hundred people or another interesting thing with the backstory and we're going to get to what's happening now and what's happening next but when you are when you took over the company and when you really got involved in the early nineties you know you wouldn't necessarily handed a company in perfect condition your father and work hard but that was a very difficult time right [noise] yeah this\nIs an interesting point to it you know because people whenever there's a blog or something out there that I get mentioned in every rights and to say you know he he got his he he he got his well the old fashioned way and Harris people what I had been when they run you know whatever but um it was a company\nThat was in fact in tough financial straights of the time and I'm so four or five of us got together interesting my father a backed off a little bit then because we had a plan and we presented them he said okay go for it and got six months to see that\nHe backed away and let us kind of run watch closely\nAnd we uh five or six of us turned in by the way some of those folks are still with me you know we turn that place but not only do five or six but the other five hundred the rest of the five hundred people came right to the front\nAbsolutely dove in and help solve this problem and so it's been a a an incredible incredible it was a rollercoaster ride now it's becoming more like a like I just hopped a surfboard\nFast moving credible way hey let's talk about that way so I'm One of the reasons I wanted to have you on today in discussing just as a major acquisition you alluded to in a moment ago you bought an Italian pope manufacture I'm going to let you pronounce your name what's the name\nEthical ... O L L is your talent getting better now that you've done this a bit of it that way for them\nOr you don't know what you find out about this but why would this was a good deal for take away with it a big deal\nFor take out so as like everything else I'm In the government is beginning to regulate the products that we manufacture just like light bulbs\nAnd refrigerators and all of that and from an energy efficiency standpoint\nSo ah we have the technology to move ahead with the with the with the government regulations but what a what this is allowed us to buy a completely developed forward moving existing company with technology which\nIs not only maybe a head of hours a little bit but but also refined\nIt's a big deal because once you develop a product you got to find that the you know the thing I've been through this a hundred times and my wife I isn't really want to do it again this time because I had an opportunity not there that was you know if you remember a few years back we we created the relationship with this company do you remember that one day and we came into a kind of a joint not a joint deal but a a partnership\nYeah you're talking to ... to get into that kind of thing and\nBuilding their products are for the U.S market and then the opportunity came up this past year to acquire them and the owner of that company in in Italy and and myself had developed a very very solid friendship\nYou know and and relationship and so uh we proceed and uh and you know it's the it's a company with high high ethical standards heightened highly regarded business practices\nUm so it's it's just been a great uh and it's I think it's going to now allow take go but they manufacture again as a high efficiency part of the little circulated pumps that we put on our boilers to to you know\nWith the you know water around the baseball and whatnot and um and it's highly efficient and and this has just been a thing that we end side from having the now the technology it's allowed us a footprint in the European market so now we can go both ways\nSo I think number one it's going to allow us to take take go to a whole different level\nI probably maybe we talked about I have a theory on product line this company life cycles all the people and that is that we have these thresholds in between these thresholds we can tweak we can improve we can cost reduce weak and whatever\nBut when we hit a certain point our product life cycle is over now it's time to go to a whole different thing and that's what this was we hit one of those ... threshold and now we've gone to the next level now we can take take go\nI think to a ... on a multiple of what we are now in terms of size\n[laughter] now ... acquisitions can go both ways you know well for companies um if if people aren't judicious about the acquisitions they make him grow too fast or doesn't fit strategic me are you looking do you think you can do a lot more acquisitions in the new face for take or is this a specific example where of course he did this deal but you're still going to be careful in other cases great\nBecause you know I think that I think for take her to continue to grow will do more acquisitions but but here's the hard part getting into this mole into this I don't know what this environment that we're now in which is a acting like a big company instead of a fuzzy little company\nI'm In which we always will have listen Johnny white ain't going anywhere right the fuzzy little experiment the Johnny's run will always be run the same way accepting value wise but we have to act now like a big company\nAnd getting into the new financial world we're in and the and the which all good right but it's different so we have to and then once we prove ourselves here which we already have I mean the banks have been so right now we're working with multiple banks as opposed to one bank as a big difference and\nMoney in the long term I have never allowed to return to be put on the on the cost of\nEducating those people in training them and all that stuff because the moment I Do that I cheapen it I don't want people to ever think\nWe've done that for them to to to better themselves just so we could better ourselves I Want people to be better and that's what I've done it and the and the offshoot and the result is we have some really wonderful dedicated loyal people and you can't beat that\nCommunity lining up to lie for a job you watch it you know that company could take on any company in the world yeah we're thinking of the break we come back we're going to talk more with John Hayes in white junior about Paco and Rhode Island the economy stick with us money that can sweet\n[noise]\nNews talk six thirty nine Ninety nine seven have family W.

on the voice of some of the New England news talk on seven of them and I am six thirty WPRI [noise]\n\nWelcome back to executive pay down that we're talking today with John Hayes in white junior from Paco talking business talking Rhode Island talking\nA false things take out and John I wanted to ask a for we have some around questions but just first I'm just curious your talk to business is about to their read on the economy at the moment how's how's business looking in twenty fifty at twenty sixteen as you look at you know what's coming in our revenue look set are you feeling any of the jitters about the economy someone saying\nUm I just I Try to get rise above that yeah of course we all have those I I have\nBigger problems and the economy and that's the weather you know I mean I'm I'm In a weather related business I depend on cold weather or However I'm also in the\nCan a construction HVAC business comfort solutions business and the good news is when it's warm or like this the residential business falls off of that\nThe commercial business can continue to happen okay because because the weather allows that sort of balances oh it was down says so I Know you know I'm I'm I'm I'm a rather a bowl this year about about growth and about prospects and and ah [noise]\nAh you know with the with the Italian acquisition I think it provides a so so from Pecos perspective I feel pretty good for other people that I don't know\nIf there's just more of the same for people that could be a rough ride ahead who knows what happens with the interest rates are beginning to creep in you know who knows what's [noise] so\nAh we had ever since governor ... took office she the general assembly as they've been talking a lot about economic development initiative they think will help on that front or you've been watching round policy makers for a long time given an advice solicited an unsolicited outlier right I\nThought well what do you think in the last a little over a year now of under the new administration with where they do you see things moving in the direction you want to see things are worried about what's your what's your overall sense the moment you know with Gina I have a\nProfound sense of hope ah I I think she's a a a wonderful person and and the and a good friend and I you know I uh I I always worry a little bit that uh\nUh the focus becomes too much on taxation versus a the only way to ever fix the problems of this state\nIs to increase the number of taxpayers we will never fix this state by raising taxes he'll grow the nonsense\nBecause people like me and others will leave here and it becomes a a a law of diminishing returns if you will I don't know if that really is what I mean but you know I've heard that in college or somewhere with\nBut um you know if if if people like me continue to leave here and the tax base has in many many more the tax base is going to it as it goes down the tax burden is going to increase on those left and that's just not good so I always wear\nOne place to start is to match up with Massachusetts and Connecticut their competitors right there just across the border so people are looking\nTo to shift somehow they're going to shoot a\nUm [noise] we've looked in the past ... this legislation can be really good about this a one time we looked at moving over to ... to Massachusetts and then we looked at the north Carolina\nAnd I actually was able to work with these guys to get some economic development stuff put in place on a a ... to keep us in Rhode Island not just take over this would not take all this was a economic development bill in matching up with\nMassachusetts on I'm On the enterprise zones and and and the\nInvestment tax credit so ... years ago but they didn't they came right to the front and worked with with the the business community on this and so it's doable but those are the places we have to look you drive down the road six I Will say why is it that people are always turning right to buy their stuff as opposed to turning left right down and\nTalk right here where we are the the ...\nYou know we need to that's that tax proposal to the previous governor had you know I never understood it because it just we need to bring down not try to figure them differently in math this and do that you know what I'm saying it I just think we need to compete with our editors and so\nThat brings up the hot button issue at the moment this truck toll proposal we've heard the Rhode Island manufacturing association has come out against it um what's your take at the moment you at your suppliers things get coming by truck\n[noise] yeah I mean to raise the truck toll I think could be ... very problematic because\nEither ... or that they're going to go somewhere else around the thing or the or um or more importantly are are are are afraid of the costs are going to go up and I don't that's never a good thing to raise a raise manufacturers for the magical stuff and bringing in not coming from Rhode Island right so\nI'm ... whatever I think that well if I may be bold\nSay I'm not sure about the whole issue of tolls or we're on a vacation home way way up in the in Maine my whole family does and we split it up and so we got about\n... years but anyway I tell you you drive from here to there first of all anyway that comes to visit the ... the first thing out of their mouth is what is when you guys would these roads my goodness you know when they come to visit ... minefield drive and it is\nA terrible only that but when they were apparently a very uh ... they don't even fix it right you can't drive along with the talk of the evidence some time and that's a real catastrophe [laughter]\nBut um you drive up to New Hampshire and Vermont or in Maine then it's like driving through Florida ... who has no weather issues right so I don't know if there's if there's a\nA program that could be talked about with a a real toll system that was but again you know any any notion of tax increases or cost increases to people in those days is never a good one\n[noise] so ah family only about a minute left um you've been committed to an hour long time as a businessman do you ever think about running for office people always wonder\nFrom the drug solutions to it I mean I Am six thirty WPRI\n\nVisual in Pittsburgh Brazil's new president I'm Evan hanging [laughter]\n\nIn

going out with your recycling or worse in the trash every week a whole house water filter might be a better option for you\nKnow that's right a whole house you'd filters the water at the main just as it comes to the house bringing you Chris clean water from every tap in your home to learn more we turn now to this old house plumbing and heating expert Richard ... through we welcome Richard him now America ensure having a version the tap water but filtering it\nHas to be better and less expensive than buying bottles or the difficult to install these shelters will\nIt really depends I mean you have to think about attacking water filtration in steps if it's a whole house you need a large unit that's going to handle all the water's coming through and in that case you're going to be going after\nThe really visible impurities dirt and rushed okay um when you think about the level of water you're going to consume you have to think local you have to think about a a filter that's going to sit on the kitchen sink to give you clean beautiful water for both cooking and for your ice make\nWas true because if you put it at the main me not only are your filtering your drinking water but it's ... or ...\nYeah so it's that you really have to do it in steps you know where a there's a whole industry it's an industry that's growing because people are more and more worried about the quality of the water what happens if the bad guys touched the water you know just they want to have some level of security in in their house\nOh shoot him on and then getting a job\nWell I think it's a dirt and rush filter is what you think about it the least case that the water I mean coming in and I think that's going to be a function of local water quality I mean there's so many parts of this country the water is beautiful I mean we take for granted this country's writers as good as it is\nSo you may not need that but if you had an old rusty Maine the ten year old town you know or you had a a galvanized a water main coming in there was going to give you a lot of rushed you know you're not and you can't change that new Maine to new Maine you might want to have a during rush filtered\nOut what about a filter that goes actually at the tap I've seen a wide variety of these types of filters sometimes you see the ones that screw on to where the air raid or we'd go yeah other times you see them to be large and fit inside the cabinet what's the best way to approach that\nWell I think this to all the ones that you spoke about you know the ones that go on to the end of the U.S her kitchen ... they will usually includes something called geo she graduated activated carbon\nAnd water goes through this carbon and it cleans it up as it comes through and so that's the least case which you would put on the kitchen sink the either the little ones you see above the sink or that these could be ones that sit down the cash turned an effect on your cold water feed\nThe other thing that people will put in is a thing called an arrow reverse osmosis\nNow that is a unit which will bring water through a membrane with high pressure it'll push\nThrough this membrane so only the clean water gets through the membrane and the west pressed of the water\nYou don't push through this membrane the clean water and the rest of the water will discharge to a drain so it's a lot more elaborate to install on that you not only have a supply but you have a drain and people will complain that either wasting some water okay but the water level is clean and pure it's almost ...\nYou know when it comes to a changing filters the amount of time between Celtic changes really very big type of cleaning second you have and where it's located\nIn well it's a function of water quality again I mean you know ... years ago we we had this filter that was so good that it would clog up all the time and people hated it but the water was perfectly clean because it was taken every bit out of it\nSo it's this is this balance point between taken out the important stuff but not having to be that you have to change it every month or every every two weeks you know what it is important to change it\nWhen needs to be changed because I remember in the twenty or to spend as a home inspector I'd seen filters that folks put in with great intentions and then never touched it again for two years and in fact if you do that I guess it could become unsafe\nI think it also becomes almost something you put on the list of when you're gonna change the batteries and smoke detectors right it's an annual thing it should be the change of season we're doing everything we're going to do as we hunkered down for the winter what's going to smoke detectors and how much change the water felt\nGood advice Richard ... the
