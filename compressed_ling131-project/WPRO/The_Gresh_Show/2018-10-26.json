of defending and there's a culture of toughness and that's not obviously cliche stuff that stuff that Providence does each and every season but I think the biggest reason why Providence has played in each of the last five in the tournament says because\nEd Cooley had the unbelievable ability to get his teams to get progressive lead better at the season goes along and I think the perfect example was two years ago there were some injuries and the Big East\nAndme ... mo Watson had a tornado for Creighton but there was an opportunity to take advantage and the coaching job at Cooley did two years

H.\nStart with World Series game free\nWe know that Rick poor solo will be the starting pitcher tonight and of course there will be a lot of I think over reactionary Red Sox fans\nThat if God Forbid they don't lose this game tonight there will be some who will blame it on not starting a left handed pitcher which quite honestly I think he's ridiculous uh it's as simple as this en route you touched on it last night\nThis isn't complicated do what you do go be you that's what the Boston Red Sox are going to do tonight\nBecause if you want to really sat there and and punch numbers and go into ...\nPlanned I'm sure you can do that with the whole she'll\nBe starting are left handed pitcher even if it wouldn't be as crappy as true ... because the numbers why blind blob Barrett out no\nYou're starting to pour so tonight they kept him out of relief in theory of poor solos on he shouldn't be able to give you six innings\nAnd it was just thinking about it for a second\nIf poor little gives you what we think he can give the red Sox tonight if you have a lead in the seventh fits Kelly and the aphids the ... and ... in the\nNinth you're turning it over to a closer Kimball Kim rural sorry John bachelor I did John bachelor yes my friend Craig kimbro who uses this stuff that makes him throw one hundred miles an hour ... thank you\nBy the way you turned me onto the John bachelor impression and the fact that he is easily and ... is one of the good things you've done for me and what role do you do it I can\nYes you do this or I I look I think they lose tonight and I don't think it's going to be because of of Alex corps heater is going to stop meaning that everything this guy has touched and every movies made has worked and how\nStar I Do also that's going to get tested tonight because in right field is JD Martinez\nIn left field ... wait a minute left field a shady Martinez in right field it's risky bets tonight and then senator it is still Jackie Bradley junior\nWhich is surprising that Alex court decided\nTo take Andrew bending tend to eat out of a line up now it's a couple of things it does give them three left these on the bench I Do believe a unless they are they did put moral and in the lineup so you have peers has a right handed paid shit option you have\nBeen in ten years you're left handed pinch an option and then you have Jackie Bradley junior\nTo yes being left handed pinch hitter if you need him to but in reality\nYou probably pinch runs someone maybe Martinez if you have the lead and I'm sure that's what they're thinking I guess you could do with ... as well\nBut it gives you some different kinds of options off the bench but bats will be in right Martinez being left a Bradley juniors in center\nYou know we talked about this yesterday I mean I Know that Alex Cora is on a bill B. who's worthy role he yeah he is when it comes to making a seemingly unconventional decisions and having them work out but ah\nYeah I'm Sorry the simple move here of on the surface is just to take Jackie Bradley junior out of the line on what I Would I mean God Bless him and his ALCOA us her aerobics he hit two hundred in that series\nAnd his heroics by the way grass and I had this last night I sent it in the ... showing that I'll say it again right now do it would be ideal for a pinch hitter so I mean you want to have Jackie Bradley junior on the bench\nAnd use him as a pinch hitter that would be great and I understand his defense is very good and while I'm not a defensive guy in terms of the regular season and the metrics involved\nIt can be very important in one game situations and and nothing is a you know more highlight ... than the world series in terms of a one game situation\nSo I understand that part of it but the news here is all fences more important\nAnd the better off fence of line up would be one that has Jackie Bradley junior on the bench and available to pinch hit again congratulations Jackie rather junior very thankful for what he's done thankful the red Sox didn't a trade them for one of the Cincinnati Reds as we suggest that\nIs true you're right I think Atlanta Braves are in Pittsburgh Pirates where I go to James you know what good on diamond Dave I guess for a [laughter] no I like I said good on him I guess I'm not a results oriented now that we're there to work it out doesn't doesn't necessarily mean it was the right move but\nYou know it's been working for them so I Would just stick with the same sort of philosophy and that philosophy is to get your best bats in the line up and that would include Bradley on the bench but that's me\nAnd I know that we joke around about the whole results oriented that doesn't necessarily mean it's the right move\nThey need to win Eighteen innings right in fact they don't even need to win Eighteen innings they need to win two innings night from both games if they do that\nThen their world champions and I think that that ... I Know what to me were\nBaseball has gone is down the road of saber metrics and band and a four and all of these different kinds of stats and metrics that people\nLook at over the long haul\nBut I think what we've recognized now is that while you can follow the numbers in the postseason logic still has to win on some level why go into it you know we will look it moves during the regular season and say what were they doing then afterwards it well the computer spit out but\nYou don't always have to follow the computer in the postseason because at the end of the day the result is the most important thing and if we remind ourselves of that\nIf if chorus stays on this heater in all these moves then he makes work out then it doesn't matter how or what ... says she used to get there just bleeping get there and even I got money than my commentary on the whole jak you'd rather junior being in there and not being in there\nUh I don't like Ben intending not being in the line up tonight\nBut if it's five three in\nThe ninth inning or in the eighth inning and they're turning the native ... and then they're turning it over to Craig kimbro or credit kimbro\nThen that's all the matters when the two most important innings and you'll be world champions and that's all they got to do really at the end of the day one eight hundred three two one W.

from my fifty years have you known in twelve years ago or from a great family that took care of the business and then it just like we try to get it better and I hope the the next step as we can you know uh get everybody else know about you know uh so\nUh what spin did you put on at once you took over\nActually I was little like you know hard because the ... but then like when I feel like a this place you could do better we just like work harder and we tried to get it like this place much better and then\nWe're open like Eighteen dollars every day and then a redo over fifty miles river which they were before so right now you know you have a great pizza great like you know a staff\nSo hopefully I can no us us ah let's see what happens\n[laughter] tell me a little bit about some of the kids it's Mandeville palace pizza but you're much more than that order some of the things that you have on the menu other than pizza\nYeah rap sandwiches salads are likely have ice creams yeah lake or any kind of appetizers that you can imagine like so when you are hungry at night or daytime at a time like the real love to serve you\nDid I hear you say you're open Eighteen hours a day that I didn't miss anything right open\nTen am to four AM every day even the storm Dave blizzards or any holidays your openness especially like the reviews even open as well six AM so if you're hungry after New Year's eve and you want to try some pizza comes to mental ... to ...\nWell there we go now that works or so a ... a part of the reason I did want to start this was because tell gators who are going to go out and football games\nLike they need professionals like you people who are running a place like men bill ... pizza to sort of give them a tip would you happened to have potentially attempt\nFor someone who maybe is that a tailgate a Gillette Stadium more outside one of the college games and maybe they're trying to make their own pizza on the grill or can you can you help them out at all\nYes like the most important thing is like you know some people they have like a well known some people they like you know of like a cross well done\nSo the main thing is that you don't want to burn the cheese so they will look ugly so just like to cook it likely you know like and then they called like patriots game I think it's better you have a soft pizza\nOkay and then finally what is your go to so people here this they come to a man willpower pizza they say I gotta try what\nOur Sicilian pizza it's you know it's famous for the our Sicilian pizza this place\nSo I don't think many people they do it if they go to cross a it's a cheesy you know pizza like at ... and you put some toppings and it looks amazing uh it's one of my favorites I guess you know everybody's favorite so try our fifth you know famous Sicilian pizza\nThere we go and for those who wonder when you walk into men do paths pizza here you will notice on the left there are too old school video games I Love the you have a pinball machine in here\nAmerican League American League eastern division and winning banner to get production the way those guys says look at it at our friend goes to the Providence Journal from Chavez Ravine here on the ground show on WNPR oh for a game three previous Mr God's how are you\n... if I'm great how are you\nI'm good um what's it like out there in LA before we even get to the nuts and bolts\nAre the Dodgers crazy or people in LA you know out of a a LeBron mind to walk to where they know that the Dodgers have a chance to the world championship I Know you haven't been there very long but what's the the pulse around Chavez Ravine\nWhile I was talking to one of my over drivers a third than they are basically the sports hierarchy out here it goes like this is the Dodgers the Lakers and us the ball and\nThere is everyone else below that that sort of the first blue blood here are the Dodgers have great history ear Dodger Stadium is an absolute Jim gorgeous park or in Chavez Ravine overlooking the saint Gabriel mountains but just stunning stunning place crack\nIs it the first time you've been there\nIt is and you know like I was saying the roots a I'm a crossover\nMost likely because their games are played after our deadlines of the journal it wouldn't make a lot of sense for them to send me hear frequently play unless the Dodgers had to Rhode Island player or they had a manager who was from Rhode Island ah so this is is a treat or feel World Series game theory it's really a a special place\nHey I'm not avoiding game three but I Do want to ask you Rocco ball deli new manager of the Minnesota Twins\nI knew that Rocco was a bit of a hot candidate I didn't think he would get a job at thirty seven years old what do you make of the socket rocket now running things in the twin cities\nI Will say that personally I don't know Rocco all that well but you're anyone you speak to about um uh they all say what a character guy he is a what a smart guy he is\nA you got to remember crashed it before he signed with the raise out and work in a heat verbally committed to go to Wake Forest um you know and that that's not that they don't let the gum guys in the Wake Forest athletes are not\nUm you know so definitely a a sharp guy or someone who's been working in baseball whether it be on the field in the front office since the end of his career\nOr in someone who I think you can bring some energy and and probably some related ability to the twins with him only be thirty seven years old he's still going to be pretty close to the players are that experience is pretty fresh in his mind and if you just like the red Sox certainly served Alex car well let's see\nNo contact with me at the Providence Journal he is out in LA covering the world series for the pro Joe read his great work not only in the Providence Journal you can go to pro Joe dot com and follow bill on Twitter act bill Koch twenty five [noise]\nAll right let's do it no better than many in the line up tonight did that move surprise you\nA lousy they're going to be bending tend to eat or Jackie Bradley junior and and I think this might speak more to the health of JD Martinez battling that sprained right ankle\nAnd I think in Alex chorus mind he kept his two best defensive outfielders\nIn the line up alongside JD Mart you know it's a in a perfect world I think he envisions Jackie Bradley and ... bats covering everything from the left center field gap to the right field line and and just sort of hoping that Martinez doesn't have to work too hard in the outfield\nA ideally if you can just make plays on balls it to him and not really have to extend themselves but you know of course it before the game that if this was a regular season Martinez probably half the night off for maybe a couple of nights off the recipe ankle since it is the world series is good enough to do\nI Know that Alex Cora according to your notes bill said they had a Nathan a bully is slated to start game for but not guaranteed he is available in relief\nMan I got to think that if they can continue with this script of joke Kelly native all the and then turn it over to Craig kimbrell they signed up for that right now and start one pot or a ... game for\nYour could be ... water Rodriguez I think the point to take away from that crash is you know if they have a chance to take a stranglehold on the series they like to do it if if you got three games to non you know the numbers uh you know the history it very very difficult to make your way back from something like that\nOr their costs will be a little bit of gamesmanship here on cars part you might have no intention abusing of all to get any point but just by him putting that out there into the ether uh it's definitely gonna make the Dodgers think about\nWho they will pinch hit in the late innings how they might double switch how they might construct their line up in the seventh eighth ninth and ... um you know so definitely something to think about it and to watch for a as we get laid in this one\nDid you have any idea of the native ... could be this good in this bullpen rural\nNo not at all I Know that that's what they envisioned when they traded form with somebody who was first of all enough you start games or come out of the boat and I think they were probably looking more along the lines of multiple innings stance\nYou know maybe a bridge to Barnes or Frasier or kimbrell somebody comes in and like the fifth or sixth inning and maybe can get anywhere between three and six out but you know justice raw stuff grass she we've seen it\nOr when he's dialed in and and commanding\nOr he can lock up just about anybody and you know he's just been a really difficult match up for right handed hitters in particular\nI Know that a Allen scoring said there's a plan for the starters to play key bullpen roles which orders are in play tonight in your opinion bill\nWell certainly of all the uh David Price has pulled out score that he's the veil as well um I Know Chris sail through his normal bullpen fashioned between start today\nSo I'd be very surprised if you saw him at any point um but David Price could be a guy a also alongside of all the who they end up going to a depending on whether or not they're able to get sale last last match up later on\n'em but those would be the two guys I think that would be in play if it gets to that point behind or sell out tonight\nAt bill ... twenty five on tour to do all kinds of the Providence Journal here on the ground show on WNPR oh Providence Journal dot com you can read bills work narrower course\nIn the old newspaper as you will get on Saturday and Sunday as well I don't know what your vibe is I don't think it comes back to Fenway Park I Know you're not in the prediction game but where bill is you're sort of lean right now on this series\nBut I think if they can win one of the next two games um and in particular you know if they can win tonight obviously I yeah I think you're right I don't think it would come back that white park or I Would like my odds with Chris Sale in game five on full rats\nAgainst the national league lined up and pitching out here in the warm weather I I think that would be perfect scenario for him\nI think he lacks sharpness in game one but I think his stuff was probably training in the right direction just with the fastball velocity and and the sharpness on the slider uh so I wouldn't mind seeing him pitch you're a in a closed out anymore it's three games to one and and the red Sox have a chance to finish it\nI I certainly think though grass that tonight if they're able to get a hold on this game and not use Nathan equality you could see him go out and game for tomorrow really get the Dodgers problem\nAh interesting I see on your Twitter feed it a core is sad about one of his game three gas it's Eric gone yeah a ... you had a big hand in ah helping Craig chemical ... to get back on track can you provide a little background bill for those who really aren't familiar with that story\nEric ... uh was watching one of the ... games against here spent I think was game for to be specific and he noticed what he thought was cracked kimbrell tipping it's pitch or you're just letting people know physically won the fastball around the breaking ball with comic um you know and I think\nYou know ... ... ... attacks the car they were teammates with the Dodgers are in the late nineties in the early ... thousands they're still good friends I told him what he saw in the red socks
