S. age I'm David Price should have been the world series MVP and he did exercise the demons or the postseason\nHowever it could have gone to bed it could've\nBeen done and over with if David Price had rolled out the same rhetoric that he did after the win in the Houston series when he came out and said hey\nI feel good\nI needed to do this he was the knowledge ing with the metrics that people were using as they were who on him were correct\nBut then when it's the whole oh I hold all the cards\nNow let me tell you something David Price and it looks like he's going to opt in and we're gonna have to deal with this guy for four more years it it's almost like real real electing Raimondo we're stuck for four more years\nBut\nDavid Price needs to know taking on the media in New England is a losing proposition unless your perfect\nBecause if they get into uh divisional series next year do the red Sox and David Price goes out there and soils themselves and they get run\nThen all of it it's going to get flipped right back around on him or it's all well what's the real David Price because the numbers are overwhelming in saying\nThat well this guy goes out and has a bad start maybe didn't turn the corner maybe there was a little bit of a mirage in terms of his performance in these World Series games\nAre willing to give the guy the benefit of the doubt the problem is this dude wants to continue to finger wag at a group of people and I will throw myself into this as well because you know I Will 'cause I'm not a huge David Price guy\nWe're going to keep score\nHe let us know that he keep score\nAnd that's fine just no there is going to be the appropriate response and if three years from now this guy's just sucking in the post season and he's like well three years ago I was great you know people around here are going to say well that was three years ago I'll just remind you of this\nIssue thousand in seven Jonathan ... ball on gay people sports water around here\nAnd he had a pretty good damn successful postseason by two thousand nine his name was mud and it was time to move on and trade him that's what I'm saying David Price he's up now\nBut and and I'll tell you another thing about David Price to David Price to questions in that press conference he came out and did the whole finger wag I hold all the cards now blah blah\nTwo questions later he was asked why does this matter to you why does why does you know proving people wrong matter to you know what his answer was\nMm I don't know\nBut just think that and he went on as normal mundane stuff\nDude if you want to call the media out there was this chance to do it and he did and then he didn't follow up but I'm sure you didn't have the heart\nTo either tell himself or Red Sox nation or twenty four other guys in the clubhouse the while he was excited to win the world series and you're being in that position that for him it gave him do would that he was able to stick it back and everybody who said something in him\nHe who is motivated by the criticism of others does not truly want to be great in my in my thoughts and opinion because you can use that in high school you can use that in college but when you become a pro and you're paid\nYou want to be great because your great and you're pro it's no different than anybody else in any other walk of life\nThere is a guy but I Can't stand at that sports radio station up north and I tell them to his face of tone to his face but I'm not motivated to be great and do a good show here because I Want to stick to that guy it's because we deserve a great show here and we're going to do a great show here I'm motivated because I Want to be good\nI'm not motivated because somebody else's who non me and by the way David Price the numbers are overwhelmingly against you\nBuddy so should have been in the world series MVP and we'll get to that would show macadam coming up later on on how they vote on all that stuff\nOne eight hundred three two one WPRI oh and the people disappointed there's no rally at city hall plaza tomorrow for the parade all of that you're on the phones you got a lot to peel part and get to jump on board one eight hundred three two one WPRI Doug craft show oh my God shut up or W.

American league championship series in the world series was another and David Price exercise some demons I've been tough on him I think everybody has been pretty hard on this guy and rightfully so and after the game I don't know what he was more excited about\nHaving more than a world championship or being able to do the finger wag back at the media because he did exercise those demons show was just a matter of time with David Price\nOr was everyone legitimate and who's not on this guy because she didn't pitch like a number one sort or in the postseason\nYeah look I'm I'm sure it was very frustrating for David try to listen to all the talk that you know he couldn't come up big a big game and point out that he made nine post season starts in his career without it with ... posts starts in his career and\nAn auto nodded to look up to about it and then finally change that and I'm not about to tell anybody how to respond when you finally break through kind of get off the personal should not like he was able to do this October\nI think it would have been better it's just sort of\nStuck to the script the hat and Houston when he finally you're you're not winning game five sort of say\nYou know now I don't have to answer those questions are anymore what a relief and it feels good those are I think understandable emotion the you know the the finger lacking seemed a little heavy handed to me you know it wasn't as if people were making up the fact that your pitch poorly in in the play offs\nUm it wasn't as if this was you know a big one or two starts in didn't get a with that this was over a number of years with a number of different teams\nAnd the result was always say that while there were a couple of instances worst pitch well enough to where they got those decisions you didn't have any are re as a starter well over five so this was hardly some fluke um but he chose to you know now I have all you have the cards\nAnd you play them well but now I have them seemed a little tiny much to me but you know everyone response to that sort of situation a little differently\nSteve Pearce was amazing in the world series were you surprised he was the world series and the pie\nAnd for those who don't know how that works Sean can you try to give people a little you know behind the curtain sort of view as to how the world series MVP is determined\nYeah um they've changed this and I'm\nA a couple of times over the years it's my understanding and um if people want a a an explanation or you can check out the Boston Herald today where my Silverman a covers the red Sox and bike is our\nIs our local ... up to a chapter chairman so by virtue of that he and the same who uh whole whole distinction for the LA chapter you\nGot to split the vote so there's one to the un numbers a one vote to Fox one vote to ... be dot com one vote\nFor him maybe ESPN Radio on and there was a ... ... that I'm maybe I'm not be network yeah I think that's true that would make um [noise] well\n[noise] I I don't agree with that um I mean it seems like baseball is farming out its award privileges based on a who what what what networks they do business in you know I I think there's a better way to handle it but that's not for you know that for\nAnother day um\nAnd apparently it was a very close vote it was free to to price excuse me pure ... overprice how I voted I Would have voted for price\nYeah me too [laughter] you know to me um you know parents had a monster game certainly and good for\nWhich kind of turn to see the the the series around a if you're if you're talking about uh you know the key moments in our series it's Mormons home run salmon which brings them back from or nothing a clear ... home run the next inning it's for for a number ... puts them up five single and\nThen they add on with piercing bases clearing double you had a great game that he had you know the two more over the span of two games he gets three home runs the bases loaded the double there's no denying that like David products pitch Thirteen dating\nAnd gave up three runs as a starter the red Sox won more games and David Price was the winning pitcher and half of them\nAnd he pitched Thirteen out of a possible Eighteen endings and those two games to me that's your MVP but you know look it's not that the highway robbery of all time but here Scott and it was a close vote circle you how to solve the theory\nIf I had a vote I Would have voted for price\nSharma Canada Boston sports journal dot com here on the ground show on WNPR oh talking some Red Sox\nAnd Sean I I Know that the parade is tomorrow and we get it there's still a lot of looking back in a lot of loving to do on this team\nBut pretty soon hard decisions are going to have to be made a fait accompli the David Price opt in to the rest of his contract now is that fair to say\nI I Would think so I you know do those guys only leave when they can get more and I don't see any one\nTopping four years in a hundred and twenty six or a hundred and twenty seven million at this point I don't think he comes even close to that so for his own well being as well as the a significant arm twisting that would come from the players association I think they ...\nAnd then there's the complicated issues for Dave dumb browse ski he's got a couple of really good players who are in their final years of arbitration handed big bullpen arms like Craig kimbrell and Joe Kelly\nAnd now you've got a factor in Nathan of all the who are going to be free agents I'm Sean how the world is done browse ski go about piecing together this roster and figuring out who to keep and who not to keep\nYeah it's got to be a challenge I mean you know John had reset the other night in the aftermath of when\nYou know we could be as good or if not better next year we got a team coming\nBack but there are some significant pieces you know it's not six or eight big name for you but there are two or three a temporal being probably the biggest and most obvious um [noise] my guess is that a\nChemical that not return I don't say that with any uh inside info because frankly I don't even think it's been something that has gotten a lot of internal discussion along the way it is so focused on trying to get through the slot that is the postseason\nThe kind of put those decisions off until you have to make them and they've got plenty of time to do so\nUm I just think that what the excuse me the uh the the market has been set for the top and close\nThose guys now make Seventeen\nEighteen million dollars a year that's what weight Davis got from Colorado last year that's what a robust shop and got from the Yankees a couple of years ago when he resigned with them ah I just don't see them making that kind of commitment\nA for a guy in his thirties to be looking for probably a four year deal is not a five year deal that you know close to a hundred million dollars for closer um I think that money could probably spend elsewhere now having said that they don't have a closer on their roster they don't have any would've done it\nAnd they're either going to have to put their faith in somebody rolling into the job and maybe that's Ryan Frasier it baby back far um or they're going to have to go out and find somebody else either either be a trade or free agency I just think you can do it at a cheaper\nA figure than you would to try to resign chemical um a ball the I think it's got to be someone that they were very much like heat but his value is now wait raider ... that it was at the start of the post season uh he's got to make a lot of money and\nFor him I was kicked around with five different organizations that had his setbacks with John surgery and all that um but when you look at you know the red Sox minor league system they still don't have a ton of pitching near the big league level\nBut sales ... more your fellow coming up for free agency after next year\nOr to me you know\n... to keep somebody like of all the uh it's important so I I think they're pretty hard after him where the market takes it alone you know\nTo a lesser extent yes Kelly and here's a couple of guys I think that it's fair to say they like to have back but they're not going to break the factory either of them\nAnd then finally Sean I Know that they're they're getting deep into the arbitration years were guys like Zander Bogart ten ... bats and of course this off season teams have been loading up\nMarket no I Know it's like well let's see which team has a ton of really good wide receiver the patriots yeah no you
