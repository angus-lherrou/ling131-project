the browns raiders game however when I flipped over to Fox to catch up on my animation programming I got to see two of the young quarterbacks in this Lee up\nShooting it out and in the ah Darren rebellion part of me was watching that saying you know what route to this is good for the NFL right here to order bags\nPeople who might not even be turning into this channel to watch football\nAre now forced into watching this football while they may be looking at it in a complaint while you know I was really looking for that episode of Bob's Burgers what they got was Baker Mayfield and Derek car two players at the NFL would love to have on center stage and that are rarely ever going to be on center stage because the nature of their teams\nAnd I just watched that I was thinking to myself this is great they're rubbing themselves up and down and illegal\nDoes right now because you know you don't get many times the showcase guys like this and there it was and it was well worth the price of admission whether or not the rats screwed it up at the end of the different discussion but that's what I was thinking when I'm watching that that's why I'm not surprised the ratings are so good or bad just that little example right\nThere yeah and and I think tonight we're going to end up getting a a good rating with a Kansas City in Denver why wouldn't you know you know Kansas City is arguably got the uh the it player right now in ... homes and that'll come your way uh tonight at eight Fifteen\nNot to mention that game is stacked with fantasy players grass you don't want to ignore that factor whether it's\nDenver or Kansas City probably the most well represented fantasy team where players on fantasy team and the over under tonight fifty five and a half so a lot at stake all the way around and nights Monday Night football game so yeah I'm with you the uh the ratings will probably be model ha once again\nOh very nice there you go what do they call that place now in fact I think\nDidn't Denver stadium used to be called sports authority field sports authority went under that sounds about right and they left it on the side of the building I think for a year on most of the check it already cleared Jeff ... those field now and then yeah it's right Amazon stadium\nWhere they just deliver the football's via a drone right timid field\nA Thursday night 'cause we talked about this one and we were dance place down in West Greenwich the rams beat the Vikings thirty eight thirty one and then you get into these uh Sunday games and man oh man\nWhat is going on with the Atlanta Falcons right now\nThey give up a scorer late to the bone goals who wins thirty seven thirty six ... uh Matt Ryan through for four hundred Nineteen yard in three touchdowns\nAnd lost and now the Atlanta Falcons are one in three overall\nThey've all losing record at home and the Bengals are sitting there three and one and if there was one team in the AFC I would've put zero money on in terms of them having a winning Caesar getting off to a good start the Bengals would have\nBeen that I thought they were one of your surprise teams before the season started that they might do over achiever maybe that was out in the ... the thing that was element where maybe he's right yeah I was not\nBig on the on the bungled at all it is over I don't believe in until they get rid of their ... I Can't believe I'm not sure that they're going to break\nNow and they're not going to break through they could go seven and a while and then they're going to end eight and eight or nine and seven or seven and nine or something\n[laughter] enough to be like the seventh team in the playoff structure in the six team AFC\nYeah you know it seems the parents to me because we talked about it before the game on either Thursday or friday and it just went so according to plan that the falcons seem incredibly easy to attack\nBecause very rarely does the uh the pre game stuff you read about like fantasy or daily fantasy goes so according to plan as it went in that way in a sense of game it's like what was that I Can't cover running backs the backfield so they're gonna be thrown into their running back to the back building there goes job or not and about a big ... Cincinnati when\nYup then Tyler I came back in that game to play one game and then he grow up and now he's out that you see the injury\n... wasn't but yeah that was a that was pretty gruesome I picked him up for one week in fantasy murder yards at a touchdown so we blame take at Enron hey that's fine he's at the end of his career anyway it's all good or the ... I\nI did by the way here's and oh and then see coming\nThe bears meet the buccaneers forty eight to ten Mitch Trybulski\nSix touchdowns Mitchell\nNo that was Mitch oh that was mentioned earlier the Mitchell would have thrown a two touchdowns in three picks a Mitch Trybulski is the guy went out there would some swag and lead them to a a a very convincing win and the bears or three in one and it's not just because they treated for ... you\nKnow and they could easily be for the Chicago Bears who they lose too\nWas that Green Bay and the first game there or a game lead in one of the gang\nUp twenty four twenty three and you're right they blew believed there a while the bears could be for no how scary is that cowboys found a way to get a win twenty six twenty four over the lions [noise] um I mean the the the cowboys are like the Cincinnati there the NFC version of the Cincinnati Bengals\nThey have all the talent to win ... games consistently every year and they just don't do it and I blame the head coach actually there were the cowboys situation why I really should I guess they're saying they Cincinnati I blame the owners\nFor having both of those guys in there as head coach is still at this point and they haven't done the damn thing\nOur bills mafia very quiet this week we are not what I was such a great performance ... yeah twenty two to nothing in the fence is terrible in Green Bay uh they're they're not good they got problem yeah\nYeah they shouldn't be shutting anybody out is all I'm saying ah well no that's fair but\nYeah that's the bills uh what was it a Jimmy Graham I Do believe that catch in that\nOne or he a leap into the stands I think that was his first limbo elite sort of been making a big deal about that but a a win for the Packers nevertheless they are now to one and one on the year and the bills are one in three and on their way to another five when season ... thank you very much to you to hear from pills mafia this year\nThey ruined everybody's survivor pool and then they went about their business now routes you mentioned earlier\nIn saying that you thought the bangles where my team to surprise yeah yeah ah my team to surprise me the eagles yesterday twenty six twenty three and that'd be a tendency I\n... I was going on that are on board with tendency now they run a high school all fence and I'm not sure how they're winning but they are winning and I know winning when I see it they're going to stay in a lot of games which is friendly to the ...\nNo question about that and there are you know what they're doing is they're pulling really a page out of the gym Harbaugh book he ran a high school\nAll fence and they went over the super bowl almost won the damn thing with it\nAt one point in time but tightened shipped to win in overtime twenty six to twenty three a Malcolm Butler is not playing great for them but hey the titans are free and on and even though the quarterback situation as messy at this point little messy a little messy it is going down there yeah\nI I just I think they're pressing Mary ... book look here we are the numbers for markets\nMariel to yesterday thirty or forty three three hundred and forty four yards two touchdowns an interception he was sacked three times he had a quarterback rating and Ninety nine point for you know it's got the exact same as Carson once\nWho was thirty three fifty referring to forty eight yards two touchdowns zone assumptions and he was sacked four times\nBut I think that the rebels playing some of those you know a Ernie Adams Bill Bill ... jet I mind tricks on markets marry other challenge him and see you know what he's got between the years if he's got to set on a good boy\nAnd I think they're going to find out that he does thank you Ernie\nTexans over the coals thirty seven thirty four oh my I mean you talk about a boxing the end of the game here\nIs one thing I've learned to crash above all else in life in life not in sports betting not and football in life is that uh the end of colds Texans games will always screw you if you bet on that game of hands down doesn't matter how it ends on okay which team you had you will get screwed and that's what happened at the end of this one is\nI mean I don't understand why Frank right in Indianapolis or going forward in the situation they did a which basically said Houston up ... game winning feel ... I don't understand and Frank right doubled down today and said hey you know when I go for it every time dude\nYou're fired man I mean really I ... my coach of he said something like that I admire him for\nWanting to win but you got to play the odds there that ball on for now it's got to be kept away from you can't set them up for a ready made field goal in the game in overtime\nLogic was just terrible it was a whole logic of you know the the Gulf War two on the road logic is basically what he\nIt's going well I didn't want the time we were going for the when I'm yeah man but risk reward says wow that was just a terrible terrible risk it took\nTheir he Marty morning way memory one morning like as they get all that well and\nThere are big issues in Pittsburgh yup they got big\nProblems and I say this 'cause I Know he's a bad coach but it starts with the head coach oh I think he's a bad coach\nAnd I've always thought he was a bad coach though when he wasn't that Super Bowl I looked like an idiot but you know what that's coming back to them about that broken\nCaught on marijuana Ron ... just in the hell out of that take our you\nKnow I've just never like I I don't necessarily respect Mike Tomlin or otherwise coaches\nThat seemed to have over delegate and my comment doesn't look like he's doing anything right look at if you walked by him he would offer you a subscription to like virgin mega mobile or something like the guy at the mall without headset on it's like\nA yeah I Would like some of those sea salts that I could Robin to my back they will lick my ... it just doesn't look like he's doing anything that's why I had very little respect\nFor my ... through the trip and people getting off the escalator rather than by line I met a man you want a coupon [laughter]\nOh boy and then there was a girl Thomas and how those are all Thomas tie into the eventual return of leaving on building the Pittsburgh Steelers we'll explore next but for\nThe red Sox now sit and wait until friday that's one of their American League division series begins again theater in New York Yankees or the Oakland A's Yankees and the A's will match up Yankee Stadium on Wednesday fussy who wins that wildcard Celtics\nIn action tomorrow night hosting the Cavaliers Bruins aren't in\nAction until Wednesday covered ruins the fence for three crew got free weeks with an ankle injury phages will be inaction Thursday nights W hosting the Indianapolis Colts game you can hear right here a new stock Ninety nine seven FM and am six thirty\nW.
