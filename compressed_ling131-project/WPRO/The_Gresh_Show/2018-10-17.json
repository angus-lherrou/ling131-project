hurricane death toll I mean President Trump has told the Associated Press at the international condemnation of Saudi Arabia over a missing journalist there's another case of guilty before being proven innocent correspondent are with daemon reports the Saudis are continuing their probe\nTurkish authorities are getting increasingly impatient now with the Saudis with regards to the investigation they still haven't heard a a proper telling of the Saudi account of exactly what happened we're all waiting for the ... investigation to reach that conclusion and for that statement to come out\nA number of people killed by hurricane Michael continues to grow a search teams going through the rubble on the Florida Panhandle find more bodies correspondent Martin Savage\nYesterday we were reporting overall Nineteen now we're up to twenty six in ... county the number jumped by nine today and it doubles in twenty four hours here in Mexico beach going from two to four\nI said uh you know Green Bay deeper and deeper than just absolutely huge written and that said a lot because there aren't really any good defenses are to speak up in the NFL at least not a defense\nBut you'd be willing to put in the company of like you know the ravens of older the bears of all there's usually in our lifetimes there's usually been at least one or two of those representative defenses that you can hang your hat on and it's become harder and harder to find well\nI also think there's this element to it as well right which is\n\nYou only need to have one third down stop on a drive to force a field goal\nAnd I and ballot check you know we would go to the book you we opened the military they both to hundreds were said fine the following\nTheir yards don't matter the points do ... but ... you know like I'm looking at the scores from this weekend right\nEagles scored thirty for the falcons played in a game that was thirty four twenty nine Steelers bangles twenty eight Twenty one chargers thirty eight fourteen a dolphin thirty one twenty eight over the bears\nThe jets the colds played high scoring game that was forty two to thirty four but the Redskins papers are twenty three Seventeen Baltimore Twenty one nothing right or the cowboy scored forty on the jags\nAnd that's a weird number but they bloom out forty seven it was really last night's Monday Night game and the patriots chief's game where the numbers really got up there I ...\nI made forty two thirty four and a head cold water that\nTotal but that's also bad football teams playing each other correct like with all due right and I I'm Sam Donaldson next big thing in my opinion but it's going to take a while before the jets as a team oh in the cowboy just said\nThe cowboy Joel West on a foul ball from Steve can do no wrong sharpest wiped uh Joe West mass quite often but like the tough cowboy that he is he's right back in they're going to be self or get myself a Steve Pearce Jersey right after the um\nBut I don't think there's a I don't think there's a real epidemic in the game of football just yet\nI don't know if it's epidemic proportions I'm willing to give it I don't know about you on this I'm willing to give it at least a few years\nIn terms of letting the younger players weren't even in the league yet letting this new fangled way of tackling yeah catch hold and five years from now we're still seeing all these forty two to thirty four games I'm going to be right there on the front lines with Rafi demand in some sort of defensive job\nBut I don't think that [noise] here's what I think the biggest adjustment in the game has happened defensively\nIt's the players and the kinds of players that are being produced think about it a decade ago right even for the New England patriots a decade ago you had Thai Warren Jarvis screen vents we'll fork and Richard Seymour\nNow you have to run bloggers in Shelton and er and Danny Shelton and Malcolm brown and then you have to stand up six foot five six foot six\nTwo hundred and sixty to Seventy five pound defensive in line backers those guys\nAren't they're not a lot of those people Roman earth and I wouldn't call trade flowers linebacker nor deter twice\nBut you know what it is is a lot of the guys up front have gotten smaller none of the guys in the back and have gotten bigger right by everyone sort of found it's almost like the NBA now his position was everyone's the same I I\nThink in terms of secondaries in the NFL right now you're getting to that route so I think that's I think that's an interesting point in that you know you're a ... a Dante high tower got paid by the New England patriots\nBecause he is an anomaly he's six three two hundred and Seventy five pounds can run can play defensive and tend to beef up ... which is what he did in the Kansas City game but there aren't a lot of those guys walking around to your point\nYour average linebacker now's probably six three about two hundred and thirty five pounds\nYour average safety is probably six foot about two hundred and Fifteen pounds maybe two twenty and corners are getting longer and link here but it's really about the quick twitch ability and their ability to redirect them in tackling space\nI I I think the bodies that used to get produced my college football relative to defenses are catching up to what's going on all ... because\nThe reason scoring went up and college football was because you had an old school thought process ... right but everybody started spreading out five years ago and then taken advantage of\nNow you're seeing everyone adapt and that's why you're seeing a lot of hybrid defensive end line backers or safety corners a corner safety's or however you want to look at it the modern day defense in three years in the NFL is going to be true down lineman\nTrue tall defensive and and there are guys who might be able to go into the flats or whatever and you're going to have maybe one or two line backers on the field\nAnd but everybody is going to be rushing to find the mark Baron type safety ... that are in the NFL right now those are the guys that are going to be those guys are going to become more important\nThan interior defensive lineman\nI think that Oliver of ... of University of Houston He is the prototypical shorter defensive lineman who will still be a top five pick because\nHe doesn't weigh a ton he can pass rush from the inside but he can also pointed to run and that's where those guys are going to go to right now it's just a bunch of fat bodies with all due respect to people like Malcolm brown and I'm standing showing Danny Shelton\nBut if you can find your six foot two two hundred and eighty pound guys who couldn't Russia but also play the rod and\nThose are going to become the people on the inside you really are going to invest money in so I think what has happened in all sense of football the last five years it's taking defense it's time to catch up\nBecause they don't have the kinds of players to play the spread sets that's where everybody's putting six and seven defensive backs on the field and that's why you can run on everyone yeah and that's why it was worth is genius\nSee I think like you know the big nickel packages that team's Ron right quote unquote big Nicaragua exactly I think the guys you would then put in your defense of backfield in those particular situations yeah I think they're going to be the guys that you want all over your defense of ... in the future because yeah like you said\nYou're going to want those bigger faster guys are basically you're going to want a defensive back field that is full of safety is I think mark Baron is a great example and to piggyback off what I said earlier\nI'm willing also to give a couple of years to the defenses in terms of scheme and personnel yeah because they're going to need to catch up you're right I mean\nFor a long time Steve Spurrier was the only one successfully running it often like that and calling us right amount ain't going to do nothing is right and nobody did anything at least of all nobody really emulated his success there with his strategy they figured well you know he's recruiting that way and he gets those guys and that's that\nBut now that so many other college teams I mean you'd be hard pressed to find a college team that's not running a spread off like that\nSo those are the types of players that are being made available and sooner or later\nA defensive players that are able to stop that kind of all fans will be more uh will be more available in the NFL and like I said\nIt's going to take a while it takes more than a year more than sometimes a generation takes almost a full recruiting soured yeah football's forty right exactly and so you know you turn those guys over down there and we should start seeing it at the NFL but yeah I think it's\nA lot of what we're seeing with these high scoring games I think as a result of just the change of the game and it's easier to change on off and so we're seeing those results the defense will catch up eventually and they'll get used to these new tackling rules\nSo hopefully fingers crossed Rafi sooner or later there will be defence again in the NFL\nAnd real quick the teams are put on thirty points this week in the NFL here or there quarterbacks ... Carson once Matt Ryan Phil Rivers\n... that doesn't fit in there [laughter] and Arnold and lock the door and all the luck yeah to a Brady and more homes\nYou had a Aaron Rodgers and beat hard DJ beat hot so you had two quarterbacks that are ... and the rest are all varying degrees of the greatest ever\nGuys who were going to the hall of fame young workers snapper Z like a Sam Darnell that may be candidates absolute most of them and I think that's part of a two and bronco just got hit on the foot by the way a they're going to review right now\nAnd it looks like it's going to be bases loaded for the red Sox bottom of the apes\nSo uh I had the UMass Charlotte game a couple of weeks ago and Charlotte came up here and got be pretty handily by UMass I Do believe when they were sending signals they had two guys that were standing there with um [noise]\nHow would you describe it it's like to polls and you pour way out and it's like a shield it's like a top murder it's like if someone were in her yeah so like changing their pants on the side ride ... guys would stand around them with this and it's\nVery ... there were a guy standing there doing their boss the coach right who was looking towards the field calling the playwright I mean you can get more paranoia that in there and so I of course these matter will will continue to peel this apart\nA worthy Astros cheating game on apparently so one eight hundred three to one to be P R O four three nine seven seven\n... seven eight to lead in the bottom of the eighth inning game free some of the American league championship series Matt Barnes is now when and then the bottom of the AIDS Jackie Bradley junior hit a grand slam factor was soon enough\nHit a guy to push in Iran and then J.

of\nYou know I let me say this crash or one of the things that has really struck me this year is it does seem like there are more injuries in ... but I'm not sure that's the case I think the reason it seems that way is because there was such a lack of talent depth across the lead\nUsed to be a guy would go down and you could count on somebody to step up and then at least put up some production look at the culture for example the white Hilton going out right and you have a quarterback like Andrew Luck who statistically for sure is a top ten\nNFL quarterback but look at the guys that were going out there and I guess we got to see\nA little up close and personal on the Thursday night when they were and Fox for all right it's Chester Rogers it's past child it's these guys that uh you know you would think because they're getting targeted seven or eight times because they're in a team of the bad defense has to throw the ball that they could at least catch them passes these guys were dropping balls all over the place\nSo I think it's harder than ever\nTo find you know that next guy up mentality or a mentality that the patriots have embraced for years and still seems to work to a degree in ... but just isn't working\nAround the rest of the league and I think part of the issue with that is you see these receivers have one good week and then they disappear the following week I mean\nKiki Kuti is somebody we spoke about a couple of weeks ago right I mean he was only targeted five times against the bill's I'm a you know you look at guys Albert Wilson is somebody for the dolphins that had a big game can you really count on him to bounce back with that kind of big game\nI I just don't think he can I I think\nI Would rather looked for guys have a bit of a proven track record that it just seems like their stock has really depressed taking a Robbie Anderson type player with the with the jets on the surface going against that Vikings defense looks like a tough match up the Vikings defense though\nHasn't been the same as it's been in recent years I think part of that is because the Vikings have gotten a bit to pass happy none of the ... not there and it's working for them to a degree and\nReally tough to knock you know when you step on eggs and Adam the human as receivers uh you know ... not throwing to those guys but I think one of the result is that defends being on the field more and I think those are kind of the things you have to look at\nThat seem a bit counterintuitive right where Robby Anderson being dropped him a lot of leagues I'm even somebody like a German curse a he had ten targets against the colds and you look at the sort of like a jet you know that the law fans but\nThat's really not the case you you look what Sam Donald's done in the last couple of weeks and that's where I think in fantasy that you can find value as opposed\nTo maybe three four years ago it was more the ... disguised down this\nGuy's going to take a spot and he's going to put up numbers that are eighty to eighty five percent of what the starter was doing\nScott grandma and fantasy football draft guide here on the ground show on WNPR oh All right I'll just give you a little dilemma that I'm In and I know roots is going to hammer me for asking the question and blood I'm sure there are a lot of people that are in this scenario\nYou resist ... in Baltimore this week I'm reading all across the Internet ... Drew Brees now for me I Jared golf I have a realistic you know I can have a realistic discussion about do I want to really sit Drew Brees this week for some guys maybe they can if you're in a situation like me what do you do if you ...\nWell if I have ... breeze brought there aren't too many guys I Would play over breeze uh there's there's a couple of things you write\nA that titans offense is partly what made that ravens defense look as good as it looked on Sunday fair you know keep in mind but when ... when the bangles went up against the ravens\nIn week two ah Andy Dalton AJ green and the gang did just fine this is not an eighty five bears type deep and statistically they kind of look like it but some of that not all of it but some of it has to do with the schedule\nOr the other thing you have to look at is how many points the sings have continued to put up coming off of by week and I just don't think that that's an aberration I think that that's an office of minded head coach in Sean pay ... who\nHas a hall of fame ... back in a guy like Drew Brees\nAnd I think that they roll out after by weeks with new wrinkles and I think you'd be crazy to over state the match up\nOr you look at just last two years I Know it's a small sample size but are coming off of by last year the saints dropped fifty two on the line the year before they beat the Panthers forty one to thirty eight so\nI I just think there are times where you can over think things and fantasy and to me this is one of those times where I think breeze is going to end up on a significant number of fantasy benches and I think those people are going to regret it I just feel like\nHe's going to put up numbers and I think you have to consider him if not top five certainly a top seven or eight quarterback even in what is a tough matchup\nWho is eat so Smith and why do you want to own him\n[noise] wow Ito Smith is the person who has kind of showing the world that ah\nKevin ... is just not ready to be an every down back and uh he's still the better option in the falcons backfield with Freeman out and now on hindered reserve\nUm [noise] but it just not uh the falcons just don't want to make him a kind of every down back and I think that the eagles Smith is somebody that\nIsn't going to put up Freeman tightened numbers but with the by weeks now now you have four teams on a by week it's going to soon be eight teams on a by week\nUm there are certainly worse options and a guy like Ito Smith the certainly should be owned in fantasy leagues I don't think he's a top thirty fantasy running back this week even going against a week giants defense but\nLook there's just nobody else out there on the waiver wire especially if you're a device to Freeman owner I think the real value in somebody like Ito Smith would be if Kevin Coleman were suffered an injury and recent history has shown that Coleman is certainly a a bit injury prone so\nI think it Will Smith as best treated as a handcuffs running back on a team with an office to put some numbers largely because of their defense can't stop anybody\nScott rambling a fantasy football draft guide here on the ground showing W.

out in addition to ... so I think a ... is as good a guy as as you can probably get right now uh you know six catches for fifty four yards\nAgainst the Steelers which have a weak defense but not as weak as the chiefs defense and that's where the Bengals face this week I almost feel like it's gotten to a point with tight end where you you have to play match ups um [noise]\nYou know maybe you look at a guy like Ricky seals Jones going on Thursday night or he'll go tomorrow night against ah against the Broncos who have had trouble defensively they're given up more than four hundred yards per game\nI'm Ben Watson our old friend ... former patriot from a about sixty years ago is a back off the by maybe he's somebody to look at 'em\nAnd give me an ... what about Austin who were you could get him in your lead from Atlanta\nYeah I I think and Cooper is buddy Hooper has been such an aggravating guy to own and fantasy it's uh\nYou just kind of way you see it from a field right and he looks like it could be a poor man's Travis Kelsey uh I Know a lot of people are high on I'm coming off the uh the nine catches Seventy one yard touchdown but\nThat was against the bucks defense that has made everybody look good or at least with Hooper he's done it for two straight weeks because he had done and against the Steelers\nThe Steelers secondary the buck secondary really both bottom five but uh yeah I think back to back and nine catch efforts there and you know even if he hasn't reached a ... he hasn't\nAnd going against the giants defends on Monday Night but the the fountains by after that I think it could be a Hooper as a short term option and I think part of the downside of him as a you know [noise]\nIf Ridley in ... new or\nA healthy then\nI Hooper is no better than really the fourth option and probably fifth after having Coleman in that passing attack I think if ... knew or not healthy released gonna ankle injury in ... new hip injury uh then I think Cooper really moves up
