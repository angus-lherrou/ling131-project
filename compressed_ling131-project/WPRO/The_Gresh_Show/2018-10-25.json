addressed to former CIA director John Brennan\nIf I and others are being targeted because we're speaking else then we're living up to a a responsibilities as citizens I think that again as a very fortunate ...\nAhead of President Trump's rally tonight in Wisconsin house Speaker Paul Ryan condemned the packaged explosive sent\nThat is an act of terrorism there is no place for that in our democracy we reject that\nOutside of opening night and they've had stretches theory there where you know six minutes ... minutes there they got to go on but usually it's just I wanted a boy they really haven't played a complete ... at this point and so\nEven ... you know he's still trying to figure out okay who complements each other and do what you know group really maximize what they can go the floor and so you know you got guys like Dan Brown camped out of it a little bit you got like guys like Irving in a word you're obviously build\nStand up and try to you know be the all started that it might take a couple months for that to happen and then you have to wonder okay like you know we're starting small here and what are we better off maybe starting in beans on some night just to have more of a defensive presence\nAnd have a guy on you know often that doesn't need the ball in his hands I can just screened for everyone and do the dirty work down low you know I think there's no question that there are\nA much higher ceilings with that are being brown\nTatum um corporate Hayward look but is that the student group that's going to win the most games on late night bases in the regular season grind you know that remains to be ...\nBe Rob how much better is ... this year compared to last year\nHe's I mean often simply there's no question that is shot making ability is has taken another step and especially when it's contested and the law that is I think simply that he's not\nTimid anymore like at the beginning of last season this others were pretty much asking him just to take open for east\nAnd you know attack you know selectively because they want to put too much on them\nAnd he had proven yet that he could be a cable you know shock greater in the NBA understandably so Nineteen years old but now clearly you know they've taken the reins off and then they know he proved last postseason you know what he is right now what he's capable of dealing you're going toe to toe with ground game\nIn game seven of the eastern conference finals meal that he's the one guy in that game but didn't really back down like treat them out of the game so now it's just a matter of you getting more confidence in themselves or Compton gang spot\nYou still you know it's going to be up and down at times is\nHistory points shooting you know with the more volume it's going to be so volatile and they might be says but there's no question that I think he's already shown himself that he can be the ... maybe not number one other I'm a championship team but he can be you know a top secondary option on a contender\nAnd for him to already be there at Twenty years old you know that's you know incredibly exciting for the Celtics imagine you know books to head for the next five or ten years\nMine Rob of Boston sports journal dot com here on the ground show on WNPR oh\nIs there anything the concerns you right now about this group I Know we talked earlier about you know the what the hell happened again store window but\nYou know other than Brad Stevens kind of figuring out how to sort of ... the chess pieces all over the board is there anything else it's a little concerning that you've seen to this point\nI mean I Do think that they the fact that they haven't really been playing well for a month is\nA big concerning crashed in the sense\nThat you know the pre season is a pre season but there weren't many glimpses of you know you know what Brad Stevens called this team out three games in the pre season like that's\nThe fact that he did that and they really haven't turned the corner yet\nIs you know it's a bit worrisome if you're saying now that that's not to say that this isn't going to be you know fifty five one team this year but when you look around the rest of the eastern conference right now you know Toronto's clearly for real now the quietest show him that he's\nPretty close to his empty before ... you know Milwaukee looks great after getting a new coach in their ... holds or who knows emphasizing the three of all we know how tough they were allowed to proceed so\nKnow I don't think it's you know not that I was ever going to be a cake walk in the eastern conference for the season but they have some pretty formidable competition going up and you know they have time to figure things out right now but just making sure that you know they're not going to be able to be a\nMiddle of the road often than probably get to the NBA Finals I Need to be a top selling that in that department to keep pace with some of these teams that have so much firepower and are that are already ... so it's that that's the thing where you know the town is all there on paper obviously but\nWhen you see you know the fact that guys like Tatum are taking a step forward\nCan be just as a concerning when you see guys like ... taking a step back though it's going to be you know there have to figure out what works and what doesn't then you know Brad see what might have some tough decisions to make just in terms of you know who's going to help you win the most uh mainly basis and\nThat's gonna be lead to some anger guys down the line but winning is what you got to do that as we've prior to but when\nI Know that oh I see on your Twitter rap Brian T Rob and you can follow the robin's winter right there ah Jerry rosier speaking on the minute that he is or is it getting thrown his way in rows you even mention in your piece about the tough job the Brad Stevens had\nA well like what was the tone was it oh my God I Can't believe this I mean I Know I was you had to go when knowing that Mitch may end up or not being completely to his liking\nUm I mean the guy that might be impacted the most in all of this considering the contractors coming up around the corner\nAnd we know that whenever he does get hot he can fill up in a big way\nYeah there's no question that he is you know strictly in the crosshairs him and market smart in terms of the guys that take the biggest hit with Kyrie and\nHey we're back in the in the fall and he is again going back to the pre season he's the one guy is kind of showed up ready to go\nUm on both ends of the floor with both his you know bring energy moving the ball around the bringing in a hurry from all areas of four and he knows the reality of the situation and he that's like and he was you know he wasn't really mouse enough that you just was trying to kind of you know\nEmphasize with like ... ... right now 'cause they just you know it's one thing to sacrifice when the team is winning but when you're you know you're getting hurricanes I meant and your lives at home to the magic I think that's ... ... or a guy like him to wall so I mean again that it comes down to you know\nWhereas Stevens gonna how much you know if it's going to give guys like Dan Brown and you can carry out certain nights when they you know are shooting you know five Fifteen five or twenty from the field and\nYou know not giving the Celtics the best officers are independent and they can get away with you know Kyrie struggling on defense of the score thirty points late but when he's having trouble\nOn that and and student so I was out of the game too that's when you know you can understand all rosier frustration there\nOr be Rob is it even plausible to think that the only way to help Brad Stevens do his job if you're Danny Ainge\nEaster trade away one of those guys and have one last option to have to sort of shift through I Know it's counter intuitive\nBut I just wonder at some point if he can't make everybody happy and then they've got to liquidate an asset just to make everyone on the bench sure to make the pieces fit better I guess I Would say\nYeah I mean if if we're in a couple of months down the line and it's still\nYou know the rotations are changing every night and this group is still you know covering a couple of games are over five hundred that will definitely be a possibility just to like you said kinda simplify things for Stephen and make everyone fall into that role will be easier but at the same time we also saw how much injuries\nPop up in the last couple of years so\nUm that that is obviously a very\nImportant thing for this group is group definitely wants to contending is the number one priority of this year I'm even though they're you know\nCould possibly lose some of these guys after this year for nothing in terms of free agency so I Do think if if a movie's made to kind of clear things up there I Would expect rosier would probably one of the state for guys were out there but what a surprise me if someone like Marcus Morris\nWas you know move if things aren't going well and a couple of months just again just to shake things up kind of free things up more and that part of the roster and maybe bring in a more defensive mining guy a nightly basis like those you lay\nAnd which would again free up more shots in the office for other guys\nGreat show as always be Rob I appreciate it will talk to you too thank you brother All right thanks grass\nBrian Rob Boston sports journal dot com boom talking about cheeseburger [laughter] but not trade G ... story maybe they'll doubled down on the ... twins do get a chicken sandwich\nYeah that's probably right and a ... and just as something's up to if I were the Celtics\nAnd I were Danny Ainge while ... may be a very valuable trade ship I think he's much more valuable to this team as its backup point I Would agree because you're trying to win a title I mean good luck trying to win it without Terry rosier in terms of\nI Know he's not the best player on the team and I said things like that and I can't win with it yeah yeah yeah but you want to make a deep run in the playoffs you want to go after Golden State you're going to need if not Terri rosier someone who does exactly what he's doing for you right now\nAnd to your point about the whole you know well you're not going to make him your number one point guard and and ... ...\n... he's in a in a perfect world cherry rosier is the perfect complement to a guy like a ... yeah the problem is\nTurning rosier shows you flashes of being the number one

have been able to give them a little bit more there are some high stress sitting there and I think that's one thing that the numbers can't tell you all falling\nApart in the fourth David prone to his credit he may end up ... able to get not only through the ports but the fifth and sixth as well so to his credit\nAnd I think that's where you look at it and you're like gee you had more bullets in the gun he could've gone one more any no I thought out score got 'em out and just the right time\nAnd the the thing that's in vogue now Russia and you're and you're basically hitting on it right now is\nYeah eighty eight pictures is well short of a hundred but it's going to get through the next inning with twelve right know how do you want necessarily your pictures to be coming in with guys on base we know nobody wants anybody to come in any more with guys on bases like maybe five guys and the entire league\nThat get trusted in positions like that everyone wants to bring their guy in one possible in a cleaning so there you go eighty eight pitches might as well be a hundred cars the odds of you getting through another one would just while there are very slim in this day and age\nOld friend Ken Ryan I saw him last night over channel twelve I went and did some TV after last night's show and a squeeze that in there before the ... that Iran today and we'll get to all that and uh I saw Kenny and there was one that are just spit Tibet and he goes no\nHe's he's okay he really is because I thought that for sending when it was too on Dodgers I'm like okay here we go this easier to come out in the fifth can be trash and they're going to get two winners they're going to get them out and it couldn't be further from the truth I mean he got those are the line\nNow turn to the ground out and freeze to line out\nHe did a great job I mean I got to give Dave Price all the credit in the world and\nYou know I don't know if this run is going to embolden him to want to stay here or if he is so miserable and getting a championship\nThat it would empower him to then say mission accomplished let me go re boots somewhere where I don't have to deal with this intense scrutiny but the guy was magnificent and by the way I didn't think uh the Dodgers picture I keep screw rye your ... or whatever he was not terrible last night he really wasn't\nDoesn't think Roberts is in my mind rightfully getting heat for is taking him out when he did I I agree and we'll hear about that are coming up in terms of the fifth inning where it all seemingly went wrong there for the Dodgers where they had two outs and nobody on base and then it all fell apart including a lifting a review from the\nGame you know and I do think that the two out hits the red Sox are getting\nIs getting into the head of the Dodgers are you know and it it it affect how could it not write it affected the way a day Roberts manage as you mentioned their roots\nBut I also think for the red Sox standpoint it's one of those things that when it gets into your head it's okay we've done this before and all you got to do is get one guy on with two outs and then\nEverything starts to bubble to the surface on both sides and I'm not look what the Red Sox are doing in terms of hitting with two outs is not something that you can count on all the time\nIn like next year I don't think we go in the next season with a lot of this roster\nSaying well they were great with two outs last year this is a characteristic relative to this year's team and it's working for them in a big way and they've been able to capitalize on it David Price great last night six innings and after the game and\nHe joined ESPN's Tim Kirk ... on the field\nHave and what does it mean to get the first two games at home in a series\nOf effects August of being able to uh [noise] going on and um and I went through that was a very big for us all on LA now for uh for three days [noise]\n'cause then it was always later\nHow good was your changed up tonight [noise]\nUm it was good oh man I spoke to some very good one [noise]\nUm it basketball command I felt like a cause for me that was another good night for my uh my father committed that says so\nEverything kind of plays off that and it was good to know\nWhat is your goals and men in this postseason and especially in this series\nOf events you know obviously [noise] so um that the [noise] of all the coming in for [noise]\nI mean just the [noise] and then it's it's not about being a daughter of an earlier right now so I'm going up and put up a Zero Dark out on a really good about a\nMuch more runs the night with two outs what does that tell you about your off at\nSeven minutes on all you know they don't get away with that really don't do it doesn't matter what the score is what the ending is like I said right away but I don't believe was operas all year long and it has a\nBench David Price or Tim church and after the game and what are your favorite songs claim they're yeah I I'm going to try and saying well it's a it's a it's a good day to be a Red Sox fan and I don't want to crap all over that song Michael ah I'm trying not to ... because I Am in the mood that I can do you know what I mean like ...\nLike one thing goes wrong I go off at exit ramp pretty quick so young and I shouldn't play shipping up to no no we don't have enough I Will say this though you talked about and I've been on David Price for not having a set of balls on him a joke Joey ... native all the\nShown up where giant grapefruits when they've gotten on the mound and it's funny my uh uh one of my oldest and dearest friends who are probably haven't seen in about four years my buddy from the pharmacist ... treats me out the real question says I Want to follow the is the closer next year yeah I'm\nNot the pirates are gonna be paying them twenty million so they don't so it's a sentiment is fantastic\nIt's so funny you say that because if if the best pitcher on the market as David Price and then it's native all David prices painted so we'll all be I agree and I'm from ... to get paid yeah I\nMean he's done humans work and I know it's going to be poor cello in game three and then I guess it's all the endgame for but maybe that's switches it's work Chris Sale that made me take that spot out of the bullpen if all the is going to start\nHow I'd say ... if they Roberts I thought that he left he was against\nIt and and and I think if all the as the set up a guy that is working right now and it's working at a big way and machine young machine gun joke Kelly\nThe guy through Lebanon pitches eight strikes got to strike outs he came in and didn't foreign around out there went in and got the job done a Kelly has been big in this World Series so it was the ...\nYou get a great start from David Price I don't know what ... told Craig kimbrell but kimbrell looks much better and it's true wins the white folks Eighteen innings away from another world championship for the Boston Red Sox\nAnd I remember being on the old school for the night that the red Sox won the world series in two thousand four and taking phone calls all night\nAnd now the red Sox are two wins away and it's like people expected one eight hundred three two one WPRI I don't know maybe there's much Red Sox fans if they don't want to talk about this game or it's going to good that people don't

sure I mean I think that this very well could be a\nOne of those where you know multiple ... and\nThings we've gone to side with you know we have too many good young players on the roster a re may have to pull the plug in mid season and just sort of patched together and get to the end of the year uh you know I mean for the first time in a long time I think you'd agree with this crashed\nThere are a lot of good young players of that team I mean there are the other ...\nBaker ... from Baker Mayfield events do war did she broke peppers a ... job will be\nA got a lot of promising young players in that roster\nAnd right now I think was paramount for the ... the owner is ... what can we do to Boston to the best environment for those guys to grow what do you do to make sure that they could feel is it positioned to hit the ground running in the Nineteen and um to me if\nI you know bigger piece of this thing is you know what is the coaching staff look like and I certainly know that you know some of the stuff that you've said publicly on Sunday when I was like it was that one can be off in some other coaches their\nPowder brutal Monday morning quarterback dot com here on the ground show on WNPR oh um yeah I I'm with you there is something doesn't seem right ten I don't find a way of thought he may think taught Haley's the long term answer I don't know if he's really the right guy to go with ... what did you make of the\nUh I guess\nA dissenters on dissenters crime in terms of read getting after Malcolm Jenkins of the eagles\nYeah you know that one to me that that was difficult too because you know I I both guys are probably trying to do the right thing um\nI've gotten to know about the only um to some degree and I know of course because of where he went to school I Know a lot of people who've been around you know and I think it would have a hard time finding anyone who'd ever say\nAnything negative about Malcolm seconds I'm personally you know I I I\nI have a hard time seeing where the right answer for greed was trying to publicly embarrass you know by trial and trying to make an astronaut guy and I think it's it's hard because you know you're judging what's the motivation there\nAnd you know part of me thinks that there is some level of jealousy here is that your Jenkins and some other guys you know has taken a player's coalition sort of move things forward it blew past or the game and I think part of this goes back and you can look at the\nMeeting where I'm at a bus valley who eating in October right like where the owners of the players that down um and you could see sort of thing kind of coming to Ruth where\nYou know Eric Raymond in there and um and that for about four hours it good productive meetings and they went through and made a lot of progress in ten minutes last you know Eric ... basically jumped in there and you had a very ... hearing you say well what about color and\nYou know that's what the ... there's been out for him is like you know who's the later this broken or calling captain well right now ... ... ... ... you know the whole thing or I think ... is so\nThere's the question of leadership there there's a question of motivation on there and you know I just tell you I mean I I think that going about the way he went about it and\nYou know what looked like a very and I'd be curious to hear what you think of this what looked completely stage [laughter] um you know I just I have a hard time private my ... my my head around why it was\nYeah I didn't get it from the the air agreed Sam point we'll give you all in this together why start bickering over who's leader who's the issues that\nIf you're really committed to the cause then that some shouldn't matter a but it seems like it does and that's the part that I think what bothers people but you know it's amazing even though they had that does some burn the whole and some things has not been a story this year at all\nYeah and I think the banks or credit to you know they screwed up a lot like the ... younger players on the union they screwed up a lot in the handling of this thing over the last two years and then they finally got it right and you know they did was they had a set of meetings in the summer\nAnd then in August I'm the one final meeting it was the giants filled is the end of August you know right before the uh the fourth preseason game\nAnd they basically came to the determination what's just leave it alone but time they go now spent ... doing let's just leave this thing alone it wasn't a bad spot at the end of last year it wasn't a national talking point in the playoffs so\nWe're sitting here right now it's not a talking point now let's not make it a talking point let's just say let's just kind of it's almost like continuous without a fight you know just last month this thing that the world goes I think it was a brilliant way to handle it there there are a couple of guys and those rooms not\nNot at liberty to share the names of the people who get who uh what part of who are sort of leading the charge in this but a couple of smart people and those in the in that room\nA came up with a really smart way to handle it and you know I think so far so good I think we're ... we're seeing all out of a lot of unity involved with the players and the teams are healthy players um you know attacked the causes that are important to them as soon as progress being made on that and\nAnd but the flip side you know they're not forcing the players to do anything they don't want to do there's no sort of\nYou know you you need to do this so that was being forced to do anything um they've sort of let the thing be and you know it's it's not an issue anymore I mean they've accomplished what I think that we wanted to accomplish which was you know putting the focus back on the product\nAnd finally will Patrick Peterson be traded before next week trade deadline\nI'm going to say no I I don't know I I think that they're they're they're you know Arizona I think almost the good amount of the rosters from Alamo\nUm if if you want to pick up the phone and make a call already there are two guys are sort of sacred cows there and that's Patrick Peterson alert it's Gerald and so um I Know those guys are ever going to be traded without you know having a talk with ownership about it\nUm and I don't think ownership wants to trade them in our both those guys are sort of seen as being in a different class and the rest of the players and Ross you're sort of the cases of French fries\nAnd Arizona is not one of those markets it's going to sell out ... you know I'm going to have ... people at the stadium you be interested in the team um if you are going to rebuild and that's you know they're beginning stages of that so um yeah I think that the\nCardinals or am I to hold onto those two now I think if somebody comes along and blows them away you know the baby sit down with Patrick yours and having a talker I think we're right now\nHe's probably sticking in Arizona\nAnd you know you'll see some other guys that roster you know be bandied about trade talks but for right now unless there's some sort of

this\nGuy is bailed on I think eating normal human food because every time I see former NFL offensive lineman Ross soccer on TV or muggy and on Twitter at a game in London\nHe's not like eating fish and chips or anything like that Ross Tucker joins me here on the ground showing WPRI RT how are you\nCrash a fantastic man good to talk with a good to talk with you too where you uh have you been like running around outside playing with the ball can and what do you weigh like two forty now\nNo pro uh I I after my trip to London last weekend I think by the end of it started out through sixty five by the time I flew out to Detroit\nWhere I Am now I'm like through sixty two I happen to be wearing very slim and clothing in that one that won't take sure those couple pictures from one that I Wish\nI Would run around with the ball yeah that which I was doing I mean I literally just crushed day or a Ben and Jerry's half baked so good\nThat is for his catch\nChecks I checked into my hotel\nAnd I'm and I'm from Mary out there you get like a welcome gift right yeah\nI looked at that I'm like oh I'm going for better and Jerry I I Need a nap here like I Know there are there for ... well after I'm done talking I might take like a twenty ... twenty minutes now I mean ... that's ... ... is a great Rubio joke from\nThat is that is pretty awesome I think I was to sixty in like eleventh grade I don't think I've seen that was\nI was there when I when I graduated high school here you go out on the little\nHere forty eight but football season is a pro with all the traveling it's just oh that's a cookie ... yes I have one of those\nOh yeah all the delicious food that they got in all of these stadiums across the country I Know that the folks who the patriots feed the media well and even though the patriots got off too little\nIf a slow start Ross I think they're probably about where most people would have expected them to be I don't consider the bills much of a challenge this week uh Ross what do you make of that nature so far this year\nWell I'll be on the sideline for that game Monday Night and I don't expect the clothes that played for both of those teams that have\nMore of an affinity for the bills just 'cause I actually started a bunch of games there and played there for years but I don't expect much from the bills I mean I\nI feel bad for my former teammate Derek you understand that he has to START I don't think there's any reason I don't think there's any way he would have signed for the minimum to go and play in Buffalo if he knew he was gonna have to start games behind that align with those receivers I think he thought\nAll right a million bucks to go be you know the number three guy mentor Josh ... sounds good\nI don't think he thought it'd be easier practice today he's like old beat up already after one game I'd I don't feel that bad for them it's a million dollars so you can cry me a river but still\nSigning up for I Would say the patriots\nAre exactly where we thought they'd be a you know they raised the bar so high Russia at this point that it's like every time they lose the game were done I mean I I I Do pick some of the Lost Ark or football part gas on friday and I haven't even money gambling pod cast and the reality is\nWhen you bet or pick against the patriots\nThat is not a recipe for making money that is not arrest you for being right cause more often than not they're going to beat the spread more often or they're going to win and I got to tell you I've been doing a lot of stuff in Philly radio living outside of Philly\nWatching the eagles have gone through this year and even looking at them their game against the jagged in London on Sunday the patriots to sustain success\nIs nothing short of amazing 'cause you watch the eagles it's like they just can't win the close game that they can't close it out they have an issue here an issue there and next thing you know they go losing record meanwhile the patriots win ... games every year I laughed\nAt their their season when total before the year when it was like ten and a half or might have been nine and a half I was like yeah I'll take the over until Tom Brady doesn't play football anymore thank you\nRoss soccer with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh you've once one one you can follow him on Twitter\nAt Ross Tucker NFL the raw sucker football pod cast in the uh the Ross Tucker network and podcast including our friend Andrew brand is under the raw sucker umbrella a you know and I'm Glad you brought that up Ross because\nI think part of the reason why after Eighteen years Tom Brady bristles at bill ... check and there was the whole grammar and stuff but\nIt's the fact that she has to push the team so hard for them to maintain that level of success like when I hear Doug Peterson saying everything is fine there is no problems here\nWhen you hear that from ballot check it's yup we've got a problem a damn it we're going to fix it and I think that great some players who've been here for a while but that's why as you mentioned they win all they've been told games every season\n[noise] yeah I ... and just I don't think I think what Peterson\nWas saying really was we're not going to get the number one seed like we're not going to get home field advantage not even worth talking about at this point we just got a we just got a we just the pressure's off in that regard weaker winner division now yeah I think that for the men ... but it has been remarkable\nAll right All right listen this week yes we're gonna play Perry's are were known Perry's way okay let's say that I'm going to give you the minus ... who's gonna win okay and I should be\nAnd it doesn't matter what it is on game day will lock now you're now you're like wow All right I think that is something we're going to be six in sex with the production okay why us Harry anyway okay here we go so this is the Perry super contest but this is\nThe way we are going to do it for the rest of the year okay so no more over under you can't do that you're out on them that we should all righty\nOh stop if you're unbelievable All right here we go pick on Perry's picks week eight Perry accumulates already weak eight\nYour favorite holiday is common Thanksgiving yeah yours is coming to mark you're going to say Halloween your hair 'cause I'm always dressed up like um uh have the perfect ... get out of here All right let's go here we go Perry's picks week eight let's hear it\nWe're going to take Chicago minus seven over the jets\nChicago minus seven over the jets now was this because you were influenced a little bit by what you saw from Chicago last week I'm going to tell you something they own most ... is\nA good team ... ski can't roller ball with mark however he's putting up good numbers\nHe is ending up some decent numbers last week I might have to pass up the patriots T plants I said that oh yeah yes the Bronx that rocky but mess but mass ... check we'll figure it out what was that a bad semester bass was at bat\nBest oh I'm Sorry okay but I'm Glad you said there were a mess All right ... thanks pick for walking nightmare\n[laughter] a Kansas City minus nine or ...\nI like that can city minus nine overtime or that's what I have and uh I mean the chiefs are just putting up so many points\nIt's hard not to go and I ... I took your favorite team this week Pittsburgh oh really mine are seven and a half or Cleveland\nWell it's interesting and uh yesterday my boy scout rambling things that said that he thinks Cleveland is an ascending team and they're gonna share well okay All right well there we give all Perry has spoken so patriotic such Pittsburgh minus seven and a half you said\nYeah they're going to be two and six and ... All right well when the Cincinnati minus six over Tampa ooh I like that play I'm not big on Tampa says that when they find them to have they\nAre no their foreign foreign three I Do believe that but I have a good team well they're they're good enough to win at home again stay Tampa bunch that is a a little sideways side Perry what else do you have\nI got Minnesota with one in my mind has one I have yeah was over Drew Brees just seen\nA over New Orleans yeah and in a a Minnesota\nMalls center dome though because Minnesota has got that new fancy stadium up there so uh it it'll it won't be an outdoor game in Minnesota I'm just proud of you than even though you've been a lifelong Rhode Island or you didn't say Minnesota\nMinnesota I Know you do a good ... you don't you don't have the Rhode Island or not say ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Gresh Show", "city": "Providence", "day": "25"}
