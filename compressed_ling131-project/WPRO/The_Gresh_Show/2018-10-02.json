we've answered Donald apparently had a more a rock 'em sock 'em robots plays and that's your game that didn't seem to help because um\nYeah I just think that that helmet rule that's that's really just going to be for defense they're never going to call on off and if they do it's not going to it's like president be a consequential part of the game right\nI mean they should be calling offensive pass interference almost as often as they are calling defensive pass interference but yeah you never you almost never see a cold and ah yeah we are the NFL operates these days ... all the rules are in place for higher scoring contests better off ... lots of all parents people like often\nThey don't like golf and there's no question but they also like fairness to\nAnd that's something that uh people bring the NFL isn't fair to begin with in terms of the the way they structure their rules and you know you don't want to you don't want to lose people at that point so rich and put this out on Facebook for people okay biggest development\nIn the patriots game yes\nSo you had the defense playing great you add Josh worn out their ... you had this team running the ball maybe there's something else was the biggest development out of yesterday's game\nIt would have to be the fact that Sony Michel was able to uh adequately run the ball and are made good use of his carries and I'm not one of those people\nThat was calling Sony Michel a bus I just want to make that very clear I Know that several of our New England radio brethren were making the rounds on freezing cold takes this morning on both Twitter and Instagram because of the things they said about Sony Michel last week\nUh I Am just not a fan of running backs and spending collateral a either a draft pick or cap space on running backs so I was against the Michelle selection for those reasons that being said I had not written him off\nA he had been very underwhelming though I don't think there's any denying that whether you want to say it was due to scheme or do to people missing blocks what have you he hadn't been very productive at the very least a through his first stint there as a running back so the fact that he was able to show yesterday\nThat he can't take advantage of old when he was given them and then he's good at finishing runs very important are those are my takeaways was because again I wouldn't have been high on Michelle yesterday or his performance yesterday if he was running through truck size holes and skipping out of bounds\nBut it was over he was finishing runs he had a lot of good runs I liked the vision that I saw from him and so that's my take away as it seems a little\nSuperficial I suppose it is it at all that I'm calling myself out so it's not it's not that I'm a waiting for I'm not trying to disarm you from criticizing me I just uh you know it seems a little superficial I guess is why I preface it that way but yeah Michelle has to be the big takeaway for me if for no other reason though crashed\nI Can't now revise it and say I respect Miami I didn't respect them going into the game I thought very much uh what was going to happen is what happened that was that was more or less my prediction they not the exact score but I thought the patriots going to win that game comfortably\nSo you know it's one of those things where I didn't respect Miami going in so I'm not going to make a lot of judgments coming out because of how the patriots played against Miami but I Am willing to say that I think the running game especially when it comes to Michelle is is headed in the right direction\nYeah and that was my big take away too because look the defense they're not going to shut people out all the time their their goal in my opinion is to hold people to twenty or less\nNormally in the NFL you can hold a team to twenty or less you're in pretty good shape defensively and I think what we saw defensively was a reinvigorated Dante high tower\nAh I also think we saw the secondary do a good job of you know being able to convert in those third downs situations\nBut the biggest development was this often sublime finding a way to set their pads\nAnd then run the ball the way they did and the ... the third quarter with the lead and don't run the ball in the fourth quarter with the lead\nThat's where this all feds can't completely be transformed if they continue to run it\nAnd you know you've got to be willing to stick it out in the run game and that's where to me the patriots of all he's got lost in that they want to run the ball\nThey want to make it seem like they want to run the ball\nAnd then they turn around and as soon as they hit a couple of bumps in the road they decided to bail on the running game or it becomes all let's run a shotgun draw series\nAnd all that stuff they mixed him a lot of different looks you know not for nothing but the patriots have\nHeading into prominence tiny find south bound up fairly sluggish from Smithfield out

[laughter] and that was pretty funny\nI've seen him freak out many a times and let me tell you another one of those guys you off the air different kind of language that on the air our friends the Buckley now of the athletic here\nThe ... show on WNPR wrote a book I I Do want to ask you a couple of questions not to break it down in depth but\nUm true tie breakers for two division titles here this year for game one sixty three\nWhere we rarely see that happen and I guess I kind of set in the old G I bet you if anybody would know the last time that happened it would be the Buckley but in all seriousness as kind of an interesting way for the season to end the two divisions had to be decided in game one sixty three\nYeah and also what really added to the weirdness\nIs that all four teams going playoffs anyway so it was a little less compelling I mean this wasn't the third game of the Dodgers giants series with the you know the Bobby Thompson Home run with third Nineteen fifty one did this with a little different in the winter\nWe get a few days off to to to rest and and arm up the division series\nWhere the two losers as happened uh would go directly to the wild card game so but but we we were joking um the other day and Fenway when this was looked like it was going to happen\nLike you could have a situation where all four teams like say say you got the cubs ruins game the gay men and place in both teams are jumping up and hugging because they're going to play out so it's very strange uh obviously you want to you want to weigh the division I get it you want to be that way that's the five\nBalloons or you know with their whole season now comes down to one game\nSo it it it is a little different if I knowledge it's never happened in a season um\nIt it's it's entirely new and shiny and in ... and again it was less than dramatic it's because obviously the first time you've got to play a game where you know obviously the winters and the winners and losers both go to the post season\nNot like the party that game and Seventy eight or the you know they said the or the or the um the red Sox and Cleveland Indians played one game playoff in Nineteen forty eight and that to me was cataclysmic because at the red Sox\nWon that playoff game a date of one of the American league planet kind of and you would have had the first and only the Braves Boston Red Sox World Series was the Braves had won the pennant so so yeah there's a lot of stuff that but no I don't think it's happened twice once he's\nBarking as you look at the Yankees aids match up Yankees won a hundred games there at home we know they can rake BAs are going to have an open or and then they're going to do this whole hey we're just gonna piecemeal through nine innings and hope we can get a win what's your read on this game\nFor the wild card playing between a one hundred wind team and a Ninety seven when the\n... I Would echo the fence about core of careful what you wish for if if people think they're going to have to use your time ... days I mean it's a it's a bumpy team it to its I ate goes back to what we set off the air to the athletic team\nAnd the court said they they run they go for the third their their their you know almost like the Miami wild cat a few years ago they just do a lot of different things and they're a team to be reckoned with\nNow now the romantic gave me once thought she had the opportunity it's almost a cliche but be that as it may so I think he is more history and there's the border war and and um and you know pick your favorite Red Sox Yankees ... capability of our personnel are fifth\nBilly Martin ... a ... point rich you are right field that game and that is just ... I'm Sorry of air attack a riot\nOr a rotten Bronson royalty oh fourth it there's just so much there ... Boldin Wakefield radio like Pedro it we can go on and on but you know having said that\nThat's not to get this did some decent history with the socks and the ... you you've got Nineteen Seventy five when the stocks went to the world series they swept the age that they knocked off a three time defending World Series champion the old days it won the world series Seventy two Seventy three Seventy four and the ... knock them off three ... that's a big deal\nThe a sweat socks to ... you know four straight healthy as both an eighty eight Ninety in the stock in two thousand three leading into their catastrophic loss to the Yankees nails yet\nThey went down too old to get the aid and came back and won three strikes and then some decent history that we can have some\nYeah no question about it and uh you know I I I think the yanks send up one of the game just because I think they can rake their tail off and then they can which is a little book at the red Sox what is the one thing heading into the postseason about this Red Sox theme\nThat you're confident you know they're going to do and execute and then\nI get I mean as if the bullpen is it just fate accompli the bullpen is the thing that is the shade here's what's your read on the strength and the weakness of this Red Sox team heading into opposing\nOr to the shaky went first 'cause like it's like you don't even want to answer your answer it for me I Know I I I did ... you you kinda pushing me around a little bit there [laughter] um but uh you know I write for the athletic now I'm not going to be bullied by okay I'm not you know that's not going to happen anymore [noise] [noise]\n[noise] I can always pushy around that there are overcrowded allow that is funny I redirect your honor the strengthen the weakness of the red Sox are\nWell I Would say that well you didn't say weakness you said concerns okay and that's all I Would I I Would\nSay my concern is not so much the bullpen but the\nStarting pitching because at the starting pitching go deep if you get seven plus innings from these guys which means that pitching in the eighth inning\nThan the flotsam and jets and that you're worried about coming in the fifth and sixth inning isn't relevant because they're sitting out in the bullpen ease flowers seat\nThe issues they they knock them out of the playoffs a year ago is that they couldn't get a starting pitcher to go five minutes the reason they got knocked out of the playoffs in two thousand eleven when they had an awful month\nWasn't just the beer and the pizza it was go go go look at baseball reference go look at the entire month of October ... and count the number of times they got a picture go into the sixth and seventh than it was it was unbelievable and or or tease you may remember was complaining oh what a Seventy shifting the location\nAfraid of seven and drink on it that I Can't put them into education because I Need them like every other day that pitch and the fifth or sixth things he was pitching multiple innings\nThree times a week because they couldn't get started to go teach so bottom line starting pitchers go deep you don't have to worry about the bullpen than than it is less of an issue and I think Steven Wright could be that seventh eighth inning guy getting into chemical and the nice\nInteresting stuff from our friends the Buckley at ... in Boston on Twitter and you can
