I got to tell you I Know feel for what the Tampa Bay buccaneers are going to be I don't know how they're going to play with James Winston and uh and when it was hot baths right now\nAbout mass and we talked about match ups in terms of Atlanta they're kinda vulnerable when it comes to match up then there's another one where the falcons like the buccaneers off fans ranks fifth ah impasse and against and the Atlanta Falcons deepens ranks twenty eight so even if it's James Winston\nIt was passed defense is so bad awful that pretty much anyone will be able to pass on them I Would recommend everyone staying away from this game Betty allies for that exact reason like who knows of Winston is going to show up Matt Ryan is that even that healthy and even if you were there past events are so bad that it might not even matter\nA bags mongering pick Pittsburg at Cincinnati you've got a Pittsburgh never plus to correct that is correct or in Cincinnati hey look I doubt Cincinnati all the time uh they're very much in the middle of that AFC you know they're probably on the fringe of being a playoff team\nAnd Pittsburgh look it's it's as simple as this\nPittsburgh has a massive case of ... this right now while usually a\nMore talent talented enough to overcome\nTheir constant ... caused by that is rare but this year it seems it might be catching up to him a little\nThey got there they got some issues that's a big one in the old AFC nor and how about this\nFor a bed and sat on that one ... which I helped bags ... make his election this is the eighth time the bangles had been favored against the Steelers under our good friend Martin Louis there one in six straight up and said spots and they're only nine and Twenty one against the spread since two thousand against Pittsburgh\nWhile I'm very bad I Can't believe Marvin Lewis still has a job let's say what are you going to\nThe LA Chargers I add the Cleveland Browns and I go to the roots there is a part of me and it's excited for this game because\nYou know even though whether they just can't get much feel goals or score points a normal way put a put touchdowns on the board\nMajor Mayfield is a hell of a lot of fun to watch and if you're in Cleveland you actually have a reason to be optimistic about the browns now this is also the beginning of that run where we looked at the meeting part of their schedule and said oh my God they could lose like nine games in a row\nNevertheless I still want to watch these Cleveland Browns play especially at home\nYeah and uh you're low scoring prediction there are a lot of field goals perhaps could come through the Cleveland Stadium whatever the heck it's called now or is most favorable to under is more so than any other stadium in the league and\nYou know Cleveland this Baker Mayfield versus a Philly a river is there a couple of greedy could have a couple a gym rats basically guy so yeah there's one goes down to the end we get to see Baker Mayfield celebrate maybe and C. pill rivers go nuts because something goes wrong at the end they'll very have you ever\nHeard of something called the bark box yes I've heard of the bar you've mentioned if I have and I heard it other than a you mentioned you why how are they not ... how are they are not like the title of Cleveland to bark box stadium or ... blocks feel you know I don't know that would fit with the old dog pound I think that seems to logical though\nUh Seattle is taking on Oakland at Wimbledon he said here we get our first one game and you know what route that ended up itself is a reason for the generosity to stay away from that one just plain ...\nYeah I mean the only way I can or possibly recommended there half my heart would be the over just 'cause you don't expect anyone to play defense but neither of those fences are good enough that I really want to hang my head on that but that's the one\nPlay I'd look at their well let me tell you something you know we got these the they got good fish and chips over here and you know I bought my defenses flaky like the chips they just break can crumble\nThat's the best scrutinize ... and ... you know a peak Carol Carol has a Ernie Adams feels very much so yeah or just on the sidelines of\nErnie Adams infringe on one of my favorite and gee you're talking about is if you uh Pete Carroll when he was smuggling walking down the sidelines after I Do believe a maid bill Gore touchdown is like five or six years ago but some of my intrepid enter Weber went and a perfectly placed in my article in a top hat and a campaign\nTo give them this defeat mystery writers marching down all smuggling down on the sidelines of\n... a very good so you know the feeling when orders gimmick now yeah Chicago is at Miami or one of the bags ... picked out of gays fired after the game\nAgain these two teams you know Chicago is a Chicago center what free and one right now I Do believe or three one in one or something like that I Know that ah they've actually gotten off to a way better start freeing one right now I'm no way better start than I thought everybody is all ... that\nI don't know and then the boom was going to come off that rose in Chicago I think so too but Miami but my enemy is a mess a and a couple of weeks ago it was wild because they come in here to New England and beat him and we were like come on and we've seen Miami crumble after\nThat if you see this line has been moving northward I got it at minus three but it's all the way up and so at some books of dolphins plus four plus four and a half that would probably be a decent play if you get Miami and that many points but I Am of the opinion at Miami is falling apart before our very eyes and so I Will take whomever they are playing against\nI mean plus for\nMiners for which means he has the under yep Arizona at\nMinnesota but this should be a skunk and last time I looked through his Minnesota minus eleven yeah I Do not see a Arizona putting as much of a challenge\nAt all no but the last time the Vikings are by double digit home favorites we know what happened there who are so we do but uh I think it's a little I'd like to think it's a little different now I I Know I was high on\nMinnesota with our predictions the beginning of the year I think they're starting to turn around and\nThe ... absolutely they're one of my favorite teams right now the Minnesota Vikings and uh that's just too big of a number to to lay those points with any sort of confidence but I'm with you I don't think they struggle with Arizona but just stay away based on what they did against\n... if I had to fill out a complete week card yeah I Would go Minnesota but I wouldn't feel great right if it was a competent situation there would be one of the lower ... agreed Indianapolis at the New York jets and um [noise]\nI get very I I don't know what the hell the Colts are I I they suck I mean we saw them against New England and ah you know the patriots kind of smack them around\nOr however the jets are very much up and down and I'm a big believer in sand Arnold I Know he's not thrown for three hundred and fifty yards every game so that people can go over the guy he's a rookie he's still learning\nBut I don't know the jets at home if I had a lean I Would go with them at home\nBy the prize we're not getting the crooked three here minus three and a half to two and a half I mean again the jets aren't great but it it kind of looks like stealing money\nWhich makes the smarts mighty waiting or I don't I don't know I don't that late or the number starts to move for me the reason I didn't target that game is because there's nothing consistent\nAbout either one of those teams right now so I mean could Andrew Luck come out and find guys that aren't TY Hilton or jak oil and pumping up points to beat the jets yeah he certainly could uh but you know if I were to lean one way I'd be leaning heavily towards the jets but just like I said when it came to the Jacksonville Dallas game\nOffer different reasons obviously and for you know not nearly as as good a team and the New York jets but if they just can't cover this number that's a bad sign for them as much like of Jacksonville can't cover you know are there are seasons over obviously not but these teams want to be certain things and if you can't cover a two and a half at home against the colds you're probably not moving in the right direction\nWe mentioned as a bags ... that Washington is a favorite at home in Carolina\nAnd I think they open as a to point dog so wow yeah I was ... the other way yeah it's interesting um I you know Washington is one of those teams to me they're the\nThey're the Miami of the NFC you look at them and say they've got talent they should be better than what they are but they're nothing more than somewhere between a seven to nine nine and seven team each and every or\nSomething to look at it though in terms of recent see bias if you're going to bet this game the Panthers were six point favorites and of course they needed that uh that field goal from our good friend grand piano [noise]\nAwesome you know so they barely were able to beat the giants so you have that and then you have Washington getting embarrass on Monday Night and the second half particularly against the New Orleans saints so a lot of people were probably looking at that and thinking oh I don't really like either of these teams and that's why that's the the weird looking number\nYeah I've got a funny feeling Carolina ends up winning that game by about ten points because Cam Newton does a ripped the ass you know rich the Jersey often the Asher underneath that wouldn't surprise me All right let's get one more one o'clock game and uh then we will finish around the

Sunday night right here on WNPR oh patriots and the Kansas City chiefs and we welcome in our friend Bob so see Mr so see how are you this evening\nI'm doing great anti good to be with you again on your right biggest game of the year for the back of the biggest game you're in the NFL\nNo question and is this a must win for the patriots given what could be home field ramifications\nOr must win is quite a statement to make but when you consider what Kansas City has done already with is five and I'll start having one other thing that we're having eaten\nSome bill and I still think the Steelers could be there in the end is going to ask you can send her\nTo talk about those two teams in particular uh they've gone on the road and they won over the chargers within their division a they won at Denver within their division and they've got to strap home games coming up\nIn the middle portion of the schedule and then they end here with the predominantly a home based schedule last month of the season it would be very difficult to catch\nA if the patriots were to fall further behind when you're talking about the race for the top seat in the sea so from that standpoint it's a critical game and I think also it's a statement game and a lot of ways and and that's the phrase is way over used in our business but\nFor the patriots defense for example going up against this high powered Kansas City often\nIf there are indeed to show that they're in a groove unit over what we saw the last year ... we saw in the weeks two and three there'd be no better way to do it then with a solid enough performance against Kansas City that's a cutting down the cheese but making enough plays to give the patriots often the opportunity to score moms that company\nBob we saw in Kansas City and we've seen Kansas City in the past and I know they made the switch your quarterback and they've gone with ... homes you played very well but in what ways are the Kansas City chiefs different from the team the patriots dealt with flash\nHere well let's take a couple of different things stand up for me I don't think the Kansas City is as good defensively and they struggle a for large stretches last year defensively but you know right now when you look at them\nThere's a strong likelihood that just the Houston and Eric barrier or playing this game uh they're both doubtful or the chief secondary is really beat up no longer is there Derrick Johnson back there in their line backing group no longer ... Ali\nThere as well and it used to this guy to add a couple of stacks against the patriots back in twenty four gene ... get patriots last year or the ... the guy who really did a great job of frustrating ... last season and we won defensively Arab Barre tours\nLeft Achilles in that game and he's been bothered by white heel injury that's kept him out of a lineup ball all season long date\nNow that from the defensive side often ... I think this cat that each team is better because of my home and the people ability consistently Alex with last year through the long fall far better than at any point previously and his career\nAnd you were told there are some uh what several buses on fire in the\nYard I think at that time we were told that there were three buses on fire obviously you know as the fire spread there were more versus a much more damage done 'em and that the police and the fire officials are on scene and they were calling the fire and then obviously beginning an investigation as to how it started\nYou know I just think of you know when our kids are in school or even you know you're younger than me so you can remember being back in school and something like this happens it's such a it's a major distraction plus they don't have transportation to school the students\nPlus the teachers um according to the um teachers president a union president ... told me last week that morale is at its lowest it's ever been a they're struggling with a contracting situation with the mayor just it it I don't know if I can get worse ah hopefully can get better but how what how does this affect the teachers and students\nWhy the teachers I mean we're very professional teachers and they make the best of the situation that they're in and\nUm you know I think during school hours in the classroom um I think business is proceeding as it always does for them and they're doing the best that they can come to work every day they're working hard and they're playing their lessons and\nUh their coach and their teams and they're writing those college recommendations and then when you go back to the to the business of negotiations and\nAnd disagreements than you know that's why they have a very capable union president they have a very capable attorney and executive director and you know I I felt like there was progress hearing from both sides that progress is being made\nI don't know if that's been disrupted by the\nBy the issues here obviously with the buses the buses have become the primary crisis that we're confronting in the\nIn the school district but you know prior to this standoff with I'm\nRelated to the contract of the teachers mhm [noise] I get appointed on the heels of of every teacher in the city having been fired in the wake of that you know a hundred and ten million dollar\nA structural deficit that the\nThe prior administration was working hard to close and they confronted a tremendous financial crisis and they handle it as best they could\nUm ... you know at that point I think the teachers morale was as low as it had ever been obviously um and with the to various administration the school board and the space and Mary Beth collaborator at the time we we work together yeah to repair the trust to repair that relationship\nContinued in the Lord's administration now obviously as this contract situation is as a cover up we've kind of taken a step in the wrong direction on morale\nThat's going to happen I mean there are always going to be disagreements between municipalities and labor unions and you work through them and they'll eventually get resolved it\nYou know we'll get back to where we were a but to come you know to get to do and you have to go through the night and we're going through the night right now\nAre certainly I was saying when they came in he is the board chairman of the provenance school systems will department\nAgain the students I you know I I I Can't stress enough how um I I feel badly for you know the families in the students involved what happens at the end of the year if we if kids have already been no fault of their own if what if he couldn't make it into school if the classrooms are behind because you have a you know three quarters of attendance\nAre there any plans in the works for what happens to make up the work or do you have to make up days yet or what what's happening go\nSo our overall attendance right now\nIs um you know we're up in the ... I think I told you this before it a good day we're about Ninety percent on a great day we're about Ninety percent right now we're kind of eighty eight eighty nine percent so um [noise] overall the nine thousand is that right but\nThe great majority of them are getting school the kids that are not are are most vulnerable you have about a hundred special ed students that have not come to schools and the strike started\nWe have a little over two hundred students overall uh that have not come to school in eleventh school days so what we're doing the areas where we're coming up with um you know make up work plans homework when parents that have access to technology because again and probably not everybody has wife by it All right um so the ones that do ah there's\nSome electronic in online portal based\nAccess to make up work um and then as we're you know working through this trying to find a way to certain as best we can and they're all over the other thing we don't put the are the though and you know we're not going to wait\nWe're not going to wait we're going to seek bids we're removing the preferential treatment for a bus yard the located in Providence uh hopefully open it up to more companies to make that bidding process for edited um than it was the last time\nAnd if we can get someone who's got the buses\nOr someone who's got the drivers and put them together if we have to admit ... you know we're not going to wait so we're trying to move as fast as a state law will allow us to move we're going to go through that purchasing process we're going to go through the Iraqis\nAnd you know hopefully we can find a new boss company and I'll you know I I'll call whatever special meetings on my end that I have to go to the vet and approved those contracts because\nIt's it it it it's absurd it's ridiculous it's it's a tremendous inconvenient and it's probably the most negatively rose negative thing in terms of impact on students that I've seen contract our school district and the seven years that I've been on the school board\nI I Would agree with you but haven't we been led to believe Nick that there's only the one company that has the amount of buses and I wonder\nI mean I think right now as it stands today\nOnly one bus company has the buses immediately available but with a contract available can these other companies get buses here from other states\nUm to service it but you're not going to do that on speculation if you bit and you say I can get two hundred buses but I'm going to a an is by labor force\nAnd the ... and you make those available then yeah I think that it is true that on oh we kind of neat didn't help right now thirty days or so you know I don't think there are companies that can do that but for a long term three or four year agreement\nYou know I think they go out they find the capital and they get the buses here um what's what's been the barrier I think is the idea that the ... yard I think there's a misconception that it required the bus you ought to be here with the current tracked into Pakistan as it was preferred the bus Yardley year than they wanted an off debt payment\nFor the cost mhm associated with the transportation the buses here\nTo me that amounted to a requirement that the buses be here\nNobody wants to be paying the taxes where to locate it and then have to pay the taxes here profit so by opening it up we can see what's out there we can know for sure other than speculating um and and trying to work with companies that we talk to you on a daily basis we're going to cast a very wide net\n'em and see what we get a response is you know what I've heard from from folks in the in you know I'm an attorney so other attorneys I Know if they do I know this company I Know that company or you know we're going to put the bits out there we'll see if these companies come forward\nA who's leading the charge Nick ... is it the mayor is a David Salvatore as it use it a combo\nI I think the mayor is the leader of the city um has been leading the charge you know I don't think everybody sees it I mean he has been deeply involved in trying to get the situation you know I served um you know basically at his pleasure confirmed by the ... who I served in England doing this I'm trying to help\nOr where he thinks I can be helpful to the city and um you know I think he and the superintendent have been working pretty much twenty four seven on this is before it started as a\nYou know I think he's the leader of the city and he put together a team of folks to try to help resolve it the rest of us are all doing our part to do that I think the ... president I think the other members of the ... who have had tried to be helpful to try to really try to hold everyone's feet to the fire\nAnd as a community we all have to continue to work together to to get through the situation um and if we can't resolve it then we'll move on from it\nA realistically Nikki ... is the board president Providence public schools how long do you see this dragging out\nOr I have no idea Terry you know these things and I think a couple of times what I hear that\nThey've been close and then it hasn't happened um you know I oh I can say is I think we plan\nThe responsible thing on our end as we have to plan that it doesn't it and you know because it does no good to sit around and say well I'm hopeful so I'm not you know we have to play for the worst case scenario and I think that's what at least on the school board level that's what we're doing that is what um we have to do\nAll right Nick ... he's the board president of the provenance public schools I'm sure we'll be chatting with you\nAnd all of them are\nMissing journalist to return I mean President Trump has vowed that Saudi Arabia will be penalized if it is behind the murder of a missing Washington Post columnist correspondent Sam Kiley\nThe Turkish foreign minister you saying that Saudi Arabia must Turkish chief prosecutor on technical side because all the investigations get into the country wants to be able to do the job they're setting the bar high\nOr no indication sort of fall because Saudi Arabia denies any involvement is going to come\nIn and Trump has taken credit for the release of an American pastor who had been in Turkish custody for two years ago that\nWas fresh and they were not going to do anything [noise] and we took it over with her and how they get this phone got different people out of various countries that were being you know\nHow I'm a I'm a minority that I'm not doing as well as the stock market how calm I don't have all my money and not stock\nMarket because the more diversified my portfolio is no worse it's been doing relative to the stock market because it's been the u._s. stock market that has been out performing everything else\nOf course that's what they were saying up until Wednesday on Wednesday everybody started changing their tune to\nBoy am I really I don't have all of my money and the stock market boy am I really glad I have a highly diversified portfolio boy am I glad I have money and investments other than\nThe stock market see my point in other words just because the given asset classes performing well and even might be performing better than alternatives doesn't mean that you ditch the alternative instead we have to recognize that every dog has its day\nAny given moment fortunes can change as we saw was striking evidence on Wednesday and Thursday when the Dow fell Thirteen hundred points this is why you don't place all your money into stocks and it even goes beyond that because what Wednesday and Thursday demonstrated for us was something else that's\nAnd we fascinating you all know what's been going on with General Electric right\nWe've been talking about gee for a few times throughout the year because this company which was at one point one of the biggest companies in America and one of the best performing companies in America certainly one of the oldest companies in America\nHas been doing terribly over the past several years of stock was down forty percent over the past year GE he was kicked out of the Dow Jones industrial average earlier this year\nWow really awful so far this year\nGee is still in the ... five hundred but its stock performance in the U.S and the five hundred year to date through Tuesday\nRanked\nAt the four hundred and Ninety six best stuff out of the five hundred it came in at four hundred and Ninety six only for stocks were worse than the\nYear to date but as of Wednesday for the past week jeeze stock performance is now number one [laughter]\n\nIn other words nobody wanted to own Ga all year long because of all the terrible things that have been happening in that company but certainly with\nThe stock market dropping so much on Wednesday compared to everything else she did fabulous and became the number one performing stock for the week through\nTuesday of this past week I mean this is why you really can't try to decide what's gonna happen next because you're probably going to blow it in fact it wasn't that just the GED went from among the worst two of the very best for the weekend and Tuesday\nIf you look at what's been going on in all of the death filed the top ten percent of all stocks compared to the worst ten percent of all stocks there has been a complete flip flop\nYear to date the three best performing stocks of the U.S and the five hundred were advanced micro devices\nA bio med and Netflix they were the three best performing stocks of the year but now as of Wednesday they fell to number three hundred and Ninety three number four hundred and eighty one and number four hundred and forty three respectively\nThey went from being the three best to for the past week as a third Tuesday among the very worst in the marketplace there has been a complete flip flop\nAs a result of the changing of fortunes as of Wednesday the very best performing stocks have become the very worst and many of the very worst have become among the very best this according to analysis published in the wall Street Journal on Thursday\nSo what we have to recognize is that all of this is fleeting the ability to make an investment decision based on how things have performed in the past well that's just a suckers bat and therefore my message she was very simple number one\nLet's not get overly anxious and fixated on point declines in the Dow Jones industrial average number two this is an argument reinforcement for why you need to maintain a diversified portfolio based on your goals and objectives and number three to maintain your focus\nOn those goals and objectives if your goals and objectives have not changed if your personal circumstances have not changed if your attitude about risk has not changed than there is absolutely positively no reason for you to be making any change in your investment strategy\nThe fact that the stock market had a lousy day one day this past week is not in and of itself enough of a reason to make a change in the portfolio now I'm not suggesting that we aren't going to see continued\nVolatility in the market my point is very simply\nWe can't draw a conclusion one way or the other new or should we attempt to make a prediction about what's going to happen next instead look at the economic fundamentals unemployment is at the lowest level in this country since Nineteen sixty nine wage growth is at its highest level over the last ten years\nThe economy is still hunting along just fine and on that basis the argument for staying fully invested in a diversified portfolio remains completely\nIntact and so if you're upset about it if you're watching the news and worried about what you're seeing\nStopped watching the news it doesn't mean you should change your investments that means you should change much at all that the most effective advice I can give you on the show today I Want you to stay with us because if you're

the line how you doing fall\nOn my question is about the option of taking a a lump sum pension brief player but given the opportunity to take on a lot of your input on it\nUh the question is whether you take the lump sum\nA or a series of monthly checks for as long as you live and uh it's it's an important question isn't it because once you give them your answer you're like stuck with it forever [laughter] so that's a yeah it's like they're no reduced though do overs and such like that and that's why it's pretty vexing for a lot of folks\nThe good news is this it is\nStraight math in other words we simply want to look at\nHow much money they're going to offer you on a monthly basis versus if we take the lump sum\nPay any taxes associated with that invest the rest how much income can we reasonably expect to produce from a an investment we make with that lump sum and is that money going to be equal to what you would have gotten from the pension\nSo the good news is all requires is a bit of math and I can tell you this usually\nWhen we do that math for our clients the answer is take the lump sum and invest it on your own to produce your own monthly income usually not always but usually that is the more\nCost effective more economic uh the the superior answer given the two choices now I say usually and here's one big case where it's\nUsually not true of great or stretching our federal employees and the reason is that in some pensions\nThe pension amount you receive will grow over time they will actually increase the amount of income you're receiving sort of like Social Security increases this year they just announced that there will be a\nVery small Social Security increase for folks mostly about thirty or forty bucks for most Social Security beneficiaries\nUm so if you have a pension where where the monthly income you're receiving will rise annually than a clearly that are in most cases is the better choice but most pensions don't do that most pensions it's a fixed amount\nWhatever they're giving you one day one is the same you're going to get ten years from now Twenty years from now Thirty years from now and that's a big reason for choosing the lump sum over the monthly pension because when you take the monthly pension\nThere are several pieces of fine print\nNumber one is I just said that amount will not rise which means overtime inflation will take its toll on the value of that monthly check\nThe the ability to buy goods and services diminishes because those costs rise but the check your receiving doesn't second is that when you die that pension benefits stops are you married Paul\nNo single okay so it's not an issue for you if you don't have a spouse or a partner you don't have to worry about that but for people who are married to have a partner a vet pension check stops when they die and that leaves a huge crisis for their surviving spouse\nUh so that's a consideration a that's not a problem for you so not as big a deal another major one his lack of liquidity once you take the monthly check that's all you ever get as a monthly check if you ever need access to the big bucket of money it's not available to you whereas if you take the lump sum now invested and generate your own income\nYou can increase that income whenever you want to keep pace with inflation\nYou can reduce it you can start it stop it if you need a lump sum it's available to you you have greater flexibility and when you die whatever you didn't spend stays there for your heirs\nSo the lump sum has greater flexibility that is often superior to taking the pension benefits but here's one final point in favor of the pension\nYou don't have to worry about your own habits in other words some folks if they are given a lump sum\nWill blow the cash and they will discover at some point that the money was spent on vacations and on jewelry on on big screen TVs and on lottery tickets and beer and they have nothing to show for it in ten years and now they're in trouble whereas if they had taken the monthly check\nThey can be pretty confident that they will get another monthly check next month like Social Security checks and so they can protect themselves from their own\nA tendency to get my ... so you have to know yourself but you have to know can you be trusted to receive this lump sum manage it permanently properly for your own personal benefit or will you be your own worst enemy\nAnd you would say the best thing to do is put in a A R a\nYes or assuming you're eligible and in most cases you are you roll the money over to an IRA and then you begin making withdraws from that account whenever you're ready to start taking it if you want it right away you can start if you don't need it for a while you leave it there until you do need it\nAnd you go from there so in order to find out the answer for sure we need to do that math we need to do those calculations to evaluate how much money is your employer offering you and can you reasonably expect to generate a similar amount of income from an investment strategy crate on your own\nAs I say usually the answer is yes we can do that but not always\nAnd that's why we need to go through the exercise we actually have an office in Troy on in your neck of the woods and so happy to sit down with you and go through this one detail looking at the amount of pension benefit your being offered and contrast that with a lump sum they're willing to give us an alternative to see what strategy is best in your situation\nThat sounds good\nSo yeah but it is is like I said it's largely straight math that doesn't require a too much judgment will show you the spreadsheet analysis and say here's what you have this way and here's what you get that way which number looks better to you and it'll be pretty self evident\nYeah without the the growth uh especially I be taking it ten years before I ... for the fall out so there's a lot of room for growth and that money\nYeah that was ten years yes and so you have to calculate what you would expect as a reasonable rate of return over the next ten years and what kind of investment strategy is ideal in order to achieve that goal\nOr as opposed to the promised pension that the employer is providing so the good news is that fact that the employers promise is a guarantee the employer is saying we will give you this money every month for as long as you live no matter what happens in the market\nSecurities prices based on that in other words this was called a leading economic indicator and that's what the financial markets are they are leading indicators in other words they are pricing security today based on what they think is going to happen as opposed to a lagging indicator\nThat occurs when prices are based on what already happened so the market is a leading indicator not all lagging indicator so yes to some degree prices are based on what everybody collectively thinks is going to happen but having said that\nWe are never really shore truly what is going to happen or when so while many people believe that the fed will continue to raise rates nobody's really sure when the fed will raise rates max or by how much and therefore bond prices are not fully baked in\nOn that answer so for that reason you can expect that there will be further declines in the bond market if there are further increases in interest rates second\nBonds react differently to interest rate increases depending on the maturity date the duration of the bond a thirty year\nBond will have a much bigger decline than a thirty day bond\nThat makes sense\nThe longer the duration of the longer the maturity date\nThe greater the swing and value due to changes in interest rates so if you're fearful that there will be more rate increases then you should probably not own long term bonds\nUnless you plan to hold them to maturity if you're holding the maturity you have to worry about it you'll get your money back at maturity regardless of what interest rates are doing but if you're thinking it might sell your bond prior to maturity meaning you'll be subject to whatever market prices are being offered at that time\nThen you would probably want to a shorter term bonds rather than longer term bombs in our case we tend to recommend three or five years seven year majorities rather than twenty and thirty year majorities of for that reason\nSo yes you do need to be aware of this and this is something new and different for investors most folks are owned comfortable with unfamiliar with unaccustomed to\nInterest rate risk\nFor the past forty years if we go back to the early Nineteen eighties interest rates are pretty much done nothing but go down\nAnd when rates go down bond prices go up so for a generation many people have grown up in an environment not realizing that rates could go up not just down\nAnd they haven't been used to the fact that bombs could lose value because for the past since Nineteen eighty the bombs are pretty much done nothing but go up in value 'cause when rates go down bond prices go up or down a different environment\nGenerationally so a lot of folks are unfamiliar with us and that's why I'm Glad you raised your question because a lot of folks at the very same question don't buy a bond unless you plan to hold onto maturity if you're going to own a bond fund you should probably own bonds in that sons that are shorter immaturity rather than longer\nAnd to know exactly what kind of bonds are best for you\nAnd how much of your money you should be placing into them\nYou should talk of the financial advisor and we're happy to help you triple each plane wreck to tackle that question for you\nHere's another question and we got this on a lot of people's minds that comes from Mick here it is\nIraq is Mick more prone to answer a question about tariffs we're hearing a lot about additional tariffs being applied all kinds of products and the fact that this is likely going to lead to an increase in prices for a number of the products that we consumers purchase\nMy question is where does all that tariff money go does it go straight to the government coffers\nDoes is in essence become an indirect tax for people to us thanks for taking my question yeah Mick\nThe terrorists are getting a lot of attention and rightfully so and yes you are you are correct a tariff is essentially attacks\nIt's attacks targeted on a foreign company that is selling goods and services in the U.S and it's a way for the government to tell American consumers don't buy that foreign product instead by a domestically manufactured will provide a product or service and stuff\nSo yeah terrorists are essentially taxes and the money essentially does go into government\nCoffers I'm really that simple\nForeign governments retaliate by doing the same thing you know when one government you know throws a punch the other governments throw equal punches and uh and there you are so yes the terrorists um make products and services more expensive\nAnd the money goes into the government and taxes which is good news right we've got a massive deficit right the government is spending more money than it's receiving this helps to solve that problem but the burden is paid by American consumers\nWho a foot the bill so\nYeah that's what the terrorists are terrified his synonym for tax\nRevenue generation protocol right I mean they come up with all kinds of you ever noticed that you no longer right your taxes at the end of the year to the IRS they want you to write your check to

management and more to my heart she's the director of the Boston College Center for Retirement Research that might not sound like a big deal you but in our circles and the financial planning world\nThe Boston College Center for Retirement Research produces some of the most important data a useful in the financial planning world so at least you're I'm really excited to have you with us on the program today\nOh I'm delighted endorsement\nAlicia is a former member of the president's council of economic advisor she was former assistant secretary the treasury for economic policy um so how is the retirement outlook these days for today's workers\nIt it's not good at um the we calculated in ... shows about fifty percent of today's working households are not going to be able to maintain their standard of living once I stop working\nWell that's not very exciting and and is this situation been this way for a long time or has the landscape changed in recent decades\nUm the landscape has changed a lot in decades and it's gotten to a worse since the financial crisis\nMean to some to those me\nWhy what ... and that's why we lost a lot of money into a lot of those items haven't returned\nWell wait a minute hang on I mean if you sat through two thousand eight and took no action I mean the stock market back then was at fourteen thousand before the crisis\nUh today the Dallas pushing twenty five thousand housing prices back you know seven weren't as high as they are today in major markets so shouldn't people actually be better off today now that we've had an extra ten years of savings on top of it and yet you're saying that's not really true in a lot of cases\nSo let's talk market the people who hold stocks and the people in the high end so you look at the top third and yes they have they have a their stock values have gained in\nThere um but for the bottom two thirds of household St really don't hold stocks and I think the story is yes for almost back to where it was a month or two thousand sixteen and hadn't gotten back to the\nOf the bubble by two thousand sixteen but really on the coasts as you know in Boston New York and California and and not so high in between and not even all parts of California\nAnd this is I think the point that a lot of folks really don't fully comprehend them and we see this every day and our financial planning practice that\nAlthough it is true that people who own stocks and oh seven had they held through today they'd be a lot better off the first fact as you pointed out as most people didn't know stocks that all second those many of those who did hold stocks and those seven panic you know nine sold ...\nLow or near it and so they're kind of frozen in time there are ... are pretty much were they were even though we're ten years later they enjoy the run up in value because they didn't hold on to their investment that haven't continue to add to their investments and so they are still stuck where they were ten years ago\nThat that's right and it's and it's a lot of people lost their jobs between a two thousand seven in two thousand nine and had to turn to their four one K. and other retirement holdings to make ends meet during that period\nSo even if I hadn't ... events just demanded access they\nWithdraw the money's level of marriage issues medical issues other family issues they just didn't have the luxury of holding on to their investments\nSo that means people are now in a conundrum because here we are ten years later everyone's ten years older retirement is ten years closer\nAnd they might not have the retirement savings account values today that they had hoped they would have by now that's forcing people to work longer but is that as viable or an answer as you might hope\nSo I'm a great fan of people working longer I think it's the most powerful lever Pete that people can control and have a huge impact on their wellbeing a in retirement\nSo we've got the issue that people in order to improve their situation and generate income for themselves what they want outlive one key working longer the longer you work\nThe more money you're adding to investments to more but those investments can grow in value and let's face it the longer you work the shorter your retirement will be and that means less money open when we need to accumulate so it was a double benefit or by working longer\nIf you take your Social Security benefits Seventy and set a sixty two it's Seventy six percent higher and so your lifetime benefits will be the same but your monthly benefit will be um that Seventy six additional present\nSo work longer so that you are saving more your investments can grow more value your ultimately going to get a higher monthly Social Security benefits and all that money isn't going to have to last as long as it otherwise myself exactly\nRight but loses only one other us up is less than a lot of people I think ignore and that's the equity in their homes is that a potential resource for\nOh I just I I Love the house almost as much as I Love working longer\nUm you're right for many people their houses their largest ... outside of the\nWealth that they have them in their Social Security benefits and a tapping home equity I think is actually going to be part of the answer and going forward or the difficulty here is the mechanism is they're\nThey're basically three ways to do it one you can sell your house and go buy a cheaper house\nAnd it has to be a cheaper house not smaller house because a lot of people sell their house in the ... suburbs moved to the city and the costs just as much if not more right and so it has to be a cheaper house that's one way to go the other is a first mortgage but there are so complicated to many people you need to have\nCounseling before you get one um and so\nSomehow we have to make them simpler and better\nThe alternative a third way is in Massachusetts we're talking about property tax
