I mean seriously those all those counties and found that Red Sox ban or how would they rise that guy Fenway Park how would they rise that guy if he were there ... you can just hear them yelling the named Chester\nProbably come in handy running across three lanes of traffic though I'll tell you that relative speed\nI mean I may have run across three lanes traffic\nThat is made it a post race there are no question Rogers\nBy the way has let's say three six eight he had a reception last\nGame Brady five yards bringing him to a total of sixteen year old girl lookout\nChester may come in and be a problem but uh I find that I think this colds team\nYou know they played in overtime game a very physical overtime game against the divisional opponent they've got a bunch of injury issues and oh by the way they have to get ready for a New England patriots team that will be welcoming back\nJulian Edelman to the lineup now both wrong and Josh Gordon are listed as questionable this is a gut feel on on my part\nI think Gordon is more likely to be in there then ... in terms of ranking those two\nI still think go wrong is probably going to suit up and give it to go and then once the patriots jump up on them which I think they will then they can decide what they're going to do with drunk ... after that but as I wrote\nAggressors grades at six through the repair oh dot com and then the Providence Journal which by the way you will be able to read on Saturday I Do believe in the paper edition I'm\nGonna turn around a quick grades are for six or to be pure dot com and the pro Joe uh after this game tomorrow night\nBut as I wrote last week in ... grades but you can't compromise drunk ... like if it's that bad but don't play the guy and let's make this perfectly clear here I Do think there is a chance that as the root cause and William what's worth Bella check\nWakes up tomorrow morning and just goes [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] ah we're only going to in this game and grown doesn't play\nSo don't be surprised if it is a late decision on wrong because I don't think they need Rob Gronkowski to be able to beat this team they're already into their backup tight and their best\nWide receiver isn't out there and\nAh I'm Sorry I disagree with some people that I really like\nIn the sports media who's talked about Andrew Luck and said that you know the ball so comes out of his hands and there's still some velocity there Andrew Luck is nothing more to me than a short to intermediate thrower here's here's the way I Would term it\nFor everybody who used to sit around here and say we'll talk radio has only a system quarterback and he can't throw the ball down the field and doesn't throw the ball down the field efficiently [noise]\nUh I think a lot of that was bunk then but that would apply to Andrew Luck right now short to intermediate type stuff and do what the Philadelphia Eagles do\nNow I Do think this will be interesting for me maybe match up against Philadelphia down the road once again kind of standpoint because the head football coach of the Indianapolis Colts role by the way was the sloppy seconds on that job after Josh McDaniel said yeah\nI think I'll just get up and walk away from the table\nFrank Reich is rooted in that Philadelphia system which is really what they used to run in Kansas City for Andy Reid got there so it is a derivative of what Doug Peterson is trying to come up with what he's running in Philadelphia and\nHow much of those concepts that the patriots saw in the super bowl and struggled with quite honestly will a Frank right try to roll out here tomorrow night just with a different cast and crew\nI'll tell you the one thing the patriots must\nDo they cannot let Indianapolis from the ball\nAnd there was nobody on the outside the you have to be afraid of it's a little bit like the way Detroit attacked New England quite honestly when the patriots play Detroit two weeks ago there was nobody on the outside you're worried about so they doubled grow can they took away ... easy throws and read and you saw how difficult it was\nFor him to get the ball into the end zone I think there's a little bit of that here against the Colts there's nobody on the outside I respect I Do not want them running the football and I want to try to hit Andrew Luck as many times I can because I Want that guy thinking in the pocket is my shoulder going to rip off from my body\nBecause they don't let them for all hail Marys\nThey put your company ... and I think it was three weeks ago to throw a Hail Mary so that kind of gives you an indicator as to where Andrew Luck is that in his comeback\nGot some more coal receivers airport I liked it Ryan grants you Ryan Grant to Washington Redskins and I do believe or Washington red and Green Bay running back to I think that uh yeah that might be a different guy but I sure will go with that ...\nIs another wide receiver what shape pass go help exactly if you get there early or you can get some really good deals from early bird specials or somebody named Matt Hazel\nAm I making these names up this could be a contest what I was making up these named ... and that's all that or I pretty much went through every one that Dr King's has to offer for the uh Indianapolis a New England game tomorrow so yeah there you go that's what they're working with although I must say that's as good as jak to oil is\nA ... bronze good enough in that the patriots almost are always victimized by tight ends in games like this I mean how many times it's scat chandeliers after rip them apart before they eventually just got out and brought the guy in and of course he wasn't that good he just looks great on the bills because the scheme they ran against buffalo allow the tight end up just waltz around and hey here I Am and\nThat's what I think this this one might be yeah is the tight end might be able to eat a little bit I Do believe roots that in ...\nI'm trying to remember the numbers off the top of my head but basically about fifty percent of Andrew Luck throws this year have gone to running backs are tied at ya which means you're not stretch in the field whatsoever ... the patriots are going to walk them they're going to get them good\nIt could get it couldn't get tilted pretty quickly and my score could be wrong to the to the good side meaning that I gave the colds too much credit and thinking they would come in here and scored two touchdowns\nOne eight hundred three two one WPRI four three nine seven seven six you can hear me up on Facebook

I Would lean toward the Sean Watson against the cowboys and Philip Rivers against the raiders if those are my ops instead of ...\nBut anybody else you know I'm not I'm not starting a guy like her cousins or Carson and wins in that eagles Vikings game over somebody like the homes\nAnd ah you know we've kind of seeing the freefall that the ah the hawks are in so whereas you might have drafted Russell Wilson has your top quarterback owns as your back up to me my home is a no brainer start even going against as tough of defense as Jacksonville is\nOur friends ... Graham link talking fantasy football here on the ground show on WNPR oh sponsored by receives heating and air conditioning cost three five one R. E. S. T. or receive owes\nLet's look at some of the guys coming back from suspension here Graham Wang I Know we mentioned the colds a little bit earlier running back Robert turban is back\nOr do you expect him to make any kind of impact as we ripped through some of these\nNo I don't I think that uh you know you do have to look at a body of work and you know Boehner the day's notice pass happy league where\nIf they were running batches ended up getting a a decent amount of Harry's you would be a viable option or they're just not the case anymore I feel like what\nYou really need out of running backs and you know we'll call them ... streaming running back is guys who play it in the passing game guys that play a role in the past in game so you know as much as you don't want to roll out if you read it or an Austin at color and you\nKnow in certain cases of James White to me those are the kind of guys that you need as your by week filling in for the black spots as opposed to a you know a guy like Robert turban and there are several civil ...\nGuys out there you know out for Morris type guys that are are just going to grind out a few yards but the upside is so severely limited you just don't want him\nMark Ingram of the saints what do you do with him in fantasy if you have options\nIt's a it's a really tough one to ... have to say I don't think you can overlook the fact that late last season Camaro\nReally took over that job from Ingram ... came more limited and limited\nAs that sees him on on I certainly think that ... somebody to own and fantasy I feel like he's more of a match up play he's certainly not a a every week starter certainly not now when it's only the buccaneers and the bears on by we cared a week five and the as the by we start to kick in and we start to get a better feel\nFor or you know what Ingram will end up being what his role end up being you know he average Eighteenth touches a game over the course of last season I kind of see that number of being maybe a little more half that or this season I think he's going to be closer to ten eleven twelve touches per game\nIt really comes down to is he going to get the goal line touches and if he does I think he has\nA potential to maybe be a top twenty five maybe even borderline top twenty fanning running back but I Would not expect that much more than that I think you have to ah\nSee what you have on your roster and where you need to buy weeks Dylan's and if it's a good spot for ... and a good spot for the saints than you rolling out there but they do relatively tough schedule coming up after this red skins game at Baltimore than at Minnesota I Know Minnesota in week defensively I think they're going to get better\nThan they've got the rams at home than their at Cincinnati that's playing pretty well and after that got they got Philadelphia So I just don't see too many opportunities where you're going to be able to start mark Ingram with a lot of confidence as we get into the thick of the season with the by weeks\nAnd you also have New Orleans by week coming up uh after week five they've got a ... a week six by so\nIt uh I I really don't see too many spots for him but he should be on your roster certainly the handcuffs and ... a little more as we get a sense of what the balance is going to be in the carriers\nAnd playing Edelman this week if you're an element owner and been waiting\nI think you'd do brash I really I don't think it's a wait and see type approach right he's coming off a suspension not an injury so there was not a worry that maybe he's not a fully a hundred percent um you know I Would\nStart Edelman who you know I'll give you some comparable guys you might be deciding between I I'd start him over like Devin fun just sterling Sheppard ah to marry a St Thomas and dies like that not play him over a higher upside players\nAnd by that I I'm Talking about guys like Cory Davis coming off a big game John Brown who's been a a vital part of that ravens passing off and that should be a high scoring game against the browns\nPilot Boyd is a a legitimate fantasy option now they're going against the dolphins and Calvin Ridley of course what he's done over the past couple of weeks if those are my decisions between Edelman I start\nCorey Davis or John Brown avoid originally but at the lower upside guys that I mentioned before I pull out Edelman over any of those guys\nYou know you mentioned Corey Davis and Calvin Ridley how close are they to becoming every week starters or are you still playing the match up game with those guys\nI think that every week starters I think for two distinct reasons I think David is in every week started because\nThat is a very slow team and the slow off and and he is the speed he's the plane maker in that office and to me they're just going to continue to figure out ways to get them the ball was almost like a eureka moment you almost needed them be down as much as they were in that game\nTo decide All right well we don't have any choice here let's get a two hour really one and only play maker with an office that really was always running through the lady Walker as long as Marcus Mariel that has been there\nWith walking out for the season to me it's going to be Davis that going to be getting nine ten eleven targets a week and I think he's in every week started with Ridley\nThe falcons are so banged up defensively ah especially in the secondary that they're just not going to be able to stop many other teams from scoring and because of that they're\nGoing to be playing a lot of these thirty thirty five type games that they've played the past couple of weeks right a forty three thirty seven game in overtime against the saints and they have thirty seven thirty six games this is going to become the norm the over under fifty seven and a half in the falcons Steelers game and I think because of the falcons had always lack\nThat solid enough to receiver to Holyoke Jones they found them and they invested in with a first round pick they fully intend to use and I think he also Calvin Ridley isn't every week starting from this point forward\nRambling lastly is there anybody there was jumping into her role on a team in the NFL because of injury that you like in things either\nHas a chance to be productive or someone you're going to keep an eye on like CJ Bedford I Know nobody is keeping an eye on him but you understand the bane of which I asked this question with Jimmy gee out is there anybody across the league do you say you know would keep an eye on this guy CB takes advantage of this injury time opportunity\nYou know it's interesting rest because I've got to put too tight ends out there because I've I've gotten a lot of questions about ... recently and actually I Am going to put a third one out there\nUm you mentioned that third and I would counter that with for a comment that when George Kendall because I think that George Kendall is going to become more a part of that often said he would have been with Rob Lowe because\nI don't think ... that type of either going to trust to get the ball down the field of our sewn and Markey's but when when he's healthy so to me I think there's gonna be a lot of George Kendall so the arrows pointing up on him\nI think that Eric ... jak oil continue to be out is somebody that looks somebody's gotta catch them passes from Andrew Luck and just like I mentioned with the falcons I don't pick the Indianapolis defense is all that great so I think let me put the ball up and I think ... is a somebody look at their\nI think with Baker Mayfield now under center\nI just feel like David and joke who has way too much talent to continue to just swallow there in Cleveland I think his day is going to come sooner than later so he is somebody that I'm looking out for let's not obscure injury play but it kind of is a pirate Taylor suffering the concussion even though they may feel should have been in there anyway\nWe probably still have or rod under center adding up the got his bell role so those are kind of read tight and I know there's a lot of people looking to tighten up and people like looking for tight and help or if you can't uh ends up not going tomorrow or I'm not sure if any of those guys are waiver wires but if they are I think there's some\nAnd you didn't accurately a you know give the information via the taxi sent you\nOh I'm sure it'll be a good on bridge there will be on bridge taken yeah I'm sure there'll be something\nThat uh that I missed because I didn't have my news hat on

consideration as we move forward\nMain home then you know have you got several you know I'm a minute but it's going to be a great series against the red Sox for the red Sox took because it's not the
