yesterday's game today the Tampa Bay buccaneers fired their defensive coordinator Mike Smith and ... I don't know about you\nBut I think kids the beginning of the end and unfortunately a good guy in the world of football Jason light the GM it used to work here in New England or might be getting wrapped up in all this but yeah it was nice to James Winston put a big numbers\nBut if that team doesn't start winning soon considering they have to make ... they have to make a commitment\nTo old crab leg to pay twenty plus million next year no don't do it yeah it looks like there might be a significant blowing up\nProcess and what better time to change the GM change the quarterback just started new yeah Tampa's like close to winning anything and they should be by now with James Winston if that were working and it's not\nYet it isn't so uh Atlanta finds a way to get a when a end of ah of course Tim and I get a look it up because I'm space in the name here a\nCalvin Ridley who I had in fantasy got off to a great start three catches forty seven yards enrolled and ankle and it

game\nRoss burger and crude driving down the field they're looking at just kicking a field goal to get the hell out of there with the when\nThere's I Want to say tall seconds on the clock and Ross burger hits Antonio Brown\nWillow inside slant and he took it to the house and there was some question as to whether there was an illegal pick or not on that play\nOr in my opinion there wasn't and a Steelers when twenty eight Twenty one but uh it turned into a big to do and\nLay beyond bell not really missed right now James Caan or Nineteen carries a hundred and eleven yards and two touchdowns and we're also burger through for three sixty nine and the win so maybe lazy on that was kind of playing his way out of Pittsburgh by not being they're owned by the way she was on the by week this week\nSo blame the on bell signed his tender and showed up today at the facility he would get eight hundred and sixty five thousand dollars this week for doing nothing and yet he's still not doing that routes what am I missing that's like free money you know\nI think he's in it for the long haul here in terms of now and it's again we talked about a clarifying your message maybe at the beginning of the stance that you're making ... and I talked about the whole Curt Flood aspect to that is where I maybe I'll be on ballot setting himself up to be a Curt Flood type figure\nI think he's now reforming his stance and that he's digging and so now it's not about you know this money that I could make it's more about what you owe me and the principles of the situation so I don't think ah the the amount of money\nReally a ... a ... it doesn't matter to him because he's not in it to get money he's in it for the fairness of it or at least that's what being led to believe now and I do believe that that's what he believes now so they're that\nHe'll be in New York Jets next year\nOr in Oakland Raiders I there's no way he's back with Pittsburgh there's no way now\nOr in a game that was eminently predictable the Los Angeles chargers beat the Cleveland Browns thirty eight to fourteen well wasn't predictable was Melvin Gordon running back for the chargers\nWas there a rip it for a

touchdowns in this game ah the bears got\nBack to the point scoring ... points in the third quarter dolphins at a scramble to score late to be able to get it the overtime and then it got real messy\nYeah not to mention the fact that Kenyan Drake added on the one and he bungled it and I think that's how we got the overtime and the first place I didn't believe you are correct was Drake was on I mean that game was just a waste of everyone's life and ah [laughter] to personalize it ... had Chicago minus three\nWakes up Sunday morning see is that the line is now minus seven and I was like oh man what is what is happening here I noted been moving already but I looked in up tannahill has been ruled out and rock up while I was going to START I said to myself gosh I was like you know

twenty eight and the dolphins get a victory I didn't even want\nTo push either at the end I was like no I don't want [laughter]\nPlus I don't pick up he'll go I Hope it must have hope it gets blocked

the patriots and let's get into it with our friend first patriots football weekly the patriots football weekly on NBC Sports fall stating that\nThat would be any hard any hard how are you\nAnd now we have a new female host Megan O'Brian so I don't know if I'm starting what we know Paul thriller was not the star does have a little competition now well you know it's\nOkay in the friendly competition is good the unfriendly Paul Perriello bad and we know that so we're we're all able to move on handy I thought the patriots were going to handle business last night there were a couple of big plays and kick return and then the big one the hill where the guy flipped him off at the end and the fourth quarter\nYeah kind of got Kansas City back in that a little bit\nBut overall considering this explosive off in St played against thoughts on on the whole they quit themselves pretty well what was your take away from last night's battle with the chiefs\nYeah I think we got we expected everybody's set up going to be a shootout and even though it started a little slower the turnover on down and then a couple of field goals certainly picked up pace and the second half in the fourth quarter um we know neither defence is very good\nAnd it doesn't really matter you know I read it in the fourth quarter it's it's no big twelve foot ball in the NFL where just out score each other and you know you look a couple of weeks ago a marquee matchup between the Vikings and the rams and you end up with a Thursday Night Football shootout\nNow you got a marquee matchup in the AFC and you've got a shootout and ratings are up and fans love it so you know from patriots perspective I think\nYou'll get us off and that did enough to win forty three forty and I don't think it's headed strike yet I think there's still room for growth here with Josh Gordon And Julian Edelman getting back into the mix and Hogan settling into his role so\nFor them to keep pace with you know the next big thing in the NFL this Andy Reid Patrick my home I retail off balance I think that's a really good sign and\nIt's a big win I mean you lose this game and I know we're only in October but there was a good chance you might be going in Kansas City in the playoffs and now if you have a rematch there's a much better chance that rematch happens that Gillette Stadium so I think the patriots reestablish themselves as the team to beat the conference\nAndy to me it kind of felt like watching that game that as you mentioned New England\nIs sort of just beginning to find their stride off offensively\nAnd Kansas City definitely had some things taken away on offensively by the New England defense and you know I Wonder if they're going to become Jumo homes happy like we know they can make all those big plays in the running game but I don't know if the run game is going to be consistent for them I don't know maybe it's just me\n[noise] from WNPR road traffic center ears you win the lotto insurance

called up now and said oh hey what channel can I find the game on I wouldn't be able to give you an answer based on where\nYou're at twenty seven on er Cox here ten twenty seven after Russia our three you see a tip off and then I'd be a basket\nSeemed like twenty seven or ten twenty seven oh my God no one Ryan is sitting right behind Joe West at home plate and\nI also I saw on the front row without game a friend of the show Carmelo Anthony [laughter] Paul also and it's all a couple of rockets and joined the mission you know what I didn't\nKnow that a Morton Hirsch burger over a channel twelve was another part of this Syracuse ... you could have easily assume so so now it's a came back you old Morty over their good grief huh\nI'm sure there's some writers over at the journal and went to Syracuse and just\nOrange in it up absolutely terrible but\nAnother story for another time we're a lot to do tonight it's a very busy night\nUh it it will be one where we believe in some NFL but with the red Sox playing games free on the American league championship series right now they're in the top of the third they have a two run lead they scored two runs in the first uh and the native already gave one back in the bottom of the first and\nNow everybody is at least kind of settling in a little bit although the starter for Houston Dallas title was already up to fifty pitchers\nSo if you're thinking he may be getting them into the sixes and sevens the red Sox are very much laying off the soft stuff and are making them work\nSo maybe getting into the Houston bullpen will be good however\nGetting into the red Sox bullpen won't be good unless ah Chris Sale and I know reports solo as opposed to pitch came for I don't know they're gonna roll poor so a lot of getting out of the bullpen rain tonight thread Sox bullpen might be a little scary but we will keep you updated as the night goes on I Would\nBe Warren Red Sox fans out score already came out before the game and said hey if you secrets sale warming up in the bullpen tonight that's not because he's scheduled to come in the game he's just getting in some work because we all know crashed you need to throw and get some are more can we have a stomach ache\nYeah that's true like Kevin our intern is got that I'll be sick today he's got a bad cold so I told them they should be throwing some long to us and then he'll be good yeah I mean you would I Know he had a little mess belly were again it I mean you know [laughter]\nKevin is just a really like snobby sniff way right now and a phone booth with them I was gonna say yeah hopefully but he uh he has been the most respectful sick person leaving the room to like coughing and\nClean out the old ... and whatnot so I Will give him credit on a ah he's shown tremendous respect to you in the a tin can booth\nOn the old the other side of the glass Red Sox have two on right now top of the third runners on first and second in the mortal Steve Pearce is if the ship a and apparently Joe West is well as the route should say ... west ended up back there be a\nCowboy job I mean again I Can't I Can't stress enough that we should not\nKnow the names of any of these empires let alone the fact that I Know Joe ... nickname like that is just yup he is the epitome of and I'm Joe I haven't been able to watch it whether or not he's embarrassing themselves especially the night but I'm sure between one to ten is probably riding according to exit\nThe very yeah from what I'm seeing on Twitter or a former big league or who is a friend of mine just put out on Twitter a Joe ... says him self tonight and that is good for the hitters ego and I guess Tyco was staring at them a little bit and ah you know there was a ball was low in the ... bowl guy saying\nSee I miss the days when I'm watching the old Braves pitching staff with mathematics and grabbing insult where if they are in the zone they would get absolutely any call as long as they hit the myth like Eddie ... would be set up in the left handed batters box right but medically thought right to the glove and reading 'em up\nIt's an amazing thing that was Ninety zombie pirate right there are so beautiful and now it's a ball ball ball strike ball walk on the computer it's yep hoping for a home [laughter] [laughter] oh God where the robots guy can you imagine computer Joe West\nJust stick a cowboy hat on a day you go a remain women need to bust out ... you've heard the ah Joe you've heard about Joe West to the country music because that's how he's got his nickname ... well but\nHe always got a band he tours with Jimmy Dolan and they play in front of [laughter]\nCells of their unpaid death\nOn the bond\nWith your case he's a pleasure that it didn't even exist a pony presidents\nAnd is that James Harden sitting on the rockets are there okay oh that's where you're a close personal friend ...\nWow what a catch in the outfield up against the uh left field wall their owner who in the world made the made the catch but there's a third out and we are moving on to the bottom of the third inning a fantastic play made up against the left field wall\nAnd the red Sox squander and opportunity but Steve Pearce did put a charge into it and you know it's one of the rare times that outfit or actually had to leave for real the\nMail yeah is that right at the peak of his jump and I had missed that would've been hung on but it would have a\nShort and it ... it would have definitely scored too so that's where a rat on the red Sox game will keep you updated and folks tonight is the night where the Celtics begin the march to a championship now I Know there when in eastern conference I don't know who they're going to play in the west\nWhere are you on the Celtics

like Harry rosier\nFor market smart and I think Brad does that route the roster and so\nIt's not going to wear a guy out a plan thirty six thirty seven thirty eight minutes a night in going to serve a you know conserve their energy play every body between twenty five thirty two but it is a challenge I mean if your market smart\nYou are starting during the second half of the season are you going to be OK only clay and twenty minutes indicted so up rats 'em out as a way of\nFiguring it out at a you know that they get\nA why he's one of the best at what he does because he's an eagle this guy in it for some reason that right\nAnd he's with the players however I Do think Brad Stevens drapes was a little ah hot and his team towards the end of the pre season I didn't go as far to say than Brad Stevens hates his team but I think he was very I mean he was I mean let's face it for him to come out and see some of the stuff he said\nHe was pretty unhappy with I think the effort during the pre season do you think that has all worked itself out and the message was hurt by this group from the head coach\nWell we'll find out tonight right uh to me the problem with the Celtics and Brad alluded to it and some of the players alluded to at all so we know it's the preseason crash we know these games don't mean anything\nBut if you have the Celtics you can't act like that\nThe problem with the Celtics during the pre season is they act like they already won something\nLike they were to defending champs they act like they were Golden State Golden State can do that walks through the pre season that's not a sign the Celtics bathtub over the years we've talked about\nYou know the Celtics being greedy bunch hard news but we know they're going to play hard every single night we didn't see that in the pre season so I'm hoping these guys aren't believing all to hide the press clippings are up there getting\nBecause if they're going to make it to the eastern conference finals they still got to have that ship on their shoulder at during the doubt it down and dirty kind of attitude\nTom Draper of NBC Sports Boston with me here on the show on WNPR oh you've been around them you were around them last year how different does Jason Tatum load from the end of last season to what you've seen in campaigning into the regular season\nHe's always been a confident kid out on the court but I feel like now he feels like he can score against anybody and I've talked to some of the coaches about them at times grass they say Jason Tatum is the best player on their team\nUh take about a twenty year old kid but he spent the off season working out with koby hanging out with Iran and Kyrie so he's a little more advanced than your average twenty year old uh I I think this guy's going to take a big leave I I Would not be surprised that I'm putting this out there\nI Would not be surprised if he made the all star team this year\nJust because I feel like the Celtics will be that good\nWill probably get three all stars maybe than for it I think ... going to be one of those guys and so then that question becomes what do you do with Gordon Hayward right where does Gordon Hayward get his touch it and I think that's a question for Brad Stevens good thing for them\nHey we're going to come along slowly early on and he's going to be on a minute's restrictions so it's not like you know ... it's got to get his touches\nThirty minutes a gay know bring them along slowed\nHow 'bout genuine brown I Know is entering its third year but young like Jason Tatum as well\nI feel like he is another one of those guys who was ready to have a breakout season but drapes I don't know if he'll get enough touches to be able to get the volume of shots and opportunities that he would need to have the numbers for us to say he's having a breakout year\nYeah yeah but you know you could argue that with the you know a lot of guys like let's say a coyote retiree could have a great\nSeason but is he going to average twenty five probably night it might be more like twenty two because you have so many weapons but the thing about jail and brown is\nHe's one of the most aggressive players I've seen in the league you know a ...\nWhen he when he gets to the opponent on his heels uh he's he's trying to go for their wrote freshman so I Know we got Gordon Hayward back I Know Tatum is making this leap and everything but Jay Lynn brown and I've taken a backseat to anybody trust meal that he has put it in the work that we saw a video of him\nOver the off season working with Tracy but Grady out there he's worked with some of the big names as well and so I just thank God James Brown that kind of do\nThat he worked so hard at it I wouldn't be surprised to see him take a leap we saw it in the postseason that Milwaukee series he's the best player for the Celtics adept Milwaukee theory\nUh we'll see what happens now was born a we're back and everything but I think all these guys will take leave I don't think it'll be twenty points per game leak or anything like that I could see the Celtics with five or six guys averaging between Fifteen and twenty two points for gang\nFoundry proven BC sports Boston with me here for a few more minutes talking cell tearing the grants show on WNPR oh it's weird to say this about a guy making thirty plus million dollars\nBut use our ... referred to the glue of this off in ... and defensive group when he's on the floor and where are you in terms of our skill set and what he's got left no I\nI think he is the glue because if you look at the makeup of therapy they don't have anyone that do exactly what out uh uh he sort of like\nThe market smart of their front court market smart they don't have anybody that can you know get down defensively beat dirty like Margaret smart well without work or they don't have anybody that can\nPass like him at the big man physician shoot threes like him at the big map position anger the deep end rotate on picking a role coverages and so he's sort of that guy that you know may not be that Fifteen and twelve guy or twenty and twelve guy\nBut he does the things that nobody else on his team can do and it's not a coincidence when you look at the Celtics team and keep an eye on this quest throughout the year\nWhen our core Ford's not out there or now or for let's say entered the team doesn't function as well I think he's a big part people get on him because he's making the thirty million dollars and expect thirty points for gay but I feel like he impacted in different ways\nI Do too and I'm trying to come to grips with what our ... within the context of this basketball team trade show me ask you what's your one worry or your biggest worry that you have about this team to start this season\nAre just trying to reintegrate Gordon Hayward uh I didn't think he looked good at all during the pre season and it was clear\nA he has a step slow he was thinking out there and so there may be some early bumps ah you know trying to acclimate Gordon Hayward back and I think that'll be really Brad biggest challenge I Know he said\nHe's going to be on a miniature ... twenty to twenty five minutes per day but where does Gordon Hayward fit and he is the guy making the most money on his feet and then the a glorified role player on this team the season or it can get back to being you know Gordon Hayward I feel like if he is you know all star level board and they were by the time the season ends\nAnd they got a shot or even against Golden State\nWide thing for ... Draper you've got silly you've got Washington he got Toronto Milwaukee's on the rise who is the second best team in the eastern conference this year\nOh this is a great question when we talk about tonight on to pre game show I I think it's Toronto I noticed Sixers Evan beat and salmon I still think they're white year away I think to Roger and when you look at it people are forgetting that ... was the top five player or you know a season plus ago\nThe best to a player in the game and so to me he's an upgrade over demar to Rosa and you're throwing the guy like Danny green so let's not forget about the rafters who won fifty nine games or was it the number one seed in eastern conference I think they're going to be the toughest out for the Celtics I think the Sixers have one more year to grow before they really get to that point\nLet me run a quick ferry by you know I think over the next five years we're going to be talking a lot about Milwaukee and Boston in eastern conference finals true or false\nFalse trash and here's why wow I Love the honest I Love me on it\nWhat is he going to react with Milwaukee\nIs he going to stay in Milwaukee I think he's up and twenty twenty I think he could be a free agent and so uh that's something they keep an eye on you know to do the Lakers make them play do some of these other teams does he want to go somewhere where he can truly wet\nIf the bucks don't have the time the team that can produce a championship or at least a a trip to the eastern conference finals are finals around him\nWill he go elsewhere will he test free agency so I think that's something to keep an eye on I think we're going to be talking Celtics Sixers for the next five years I think the Sixers with their young core beat and sending those guys will be locked up there'll be ready or not this season I'm saying next season you're talking Celtic Sixers\nStuff from our guy called ...\nByrd catch him during the pre imposed on NBC Sports Boston a yet scout with you
