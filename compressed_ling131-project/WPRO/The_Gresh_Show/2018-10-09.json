S. age and yes game forest tonight is the red Sox when the Yankees are out and it's on to the American league championship series against the Houston Astros\nBefore we moved to tonight let's look back at what\nWent down last night and if you did not hear the comments from Pedro Martinez relative to umpire enjoy Hernandez who I Will get to you will hear that in just a smidgen over five minutes let's say six minutes here on the grass show on WNPR oh\nBut last night that was a woman and the biggest thing for me to come out of last night was in the rock hall hit for the cycle which we will get to because\nThere's some um [noise] there's\nQuestion as to whether he broke and unwritten rule in the world a baseball did that black hole\nWell last night was about Nathan evolving and they sort of all the did something that the thirty million dollar man couldn't do you gain too and that was find a way to show some\nSome great show some balls and go out there and was money last night\nWell\nThat's all you need to know about that guy right there David Price that's all you need to know\nIs that it ... it guys like Tom Brady and others would rather throw up all over themselves real legitimate competitive athletes they would they would rather lose on the mound trying to get the team there then just winning it being along for the ride but they\nSort of all the last night who would have sunk seven innings five heads or Ron earned five strike outs know walks\nI'll tell you who would have thought so grand who was that they've done brown ski that's why you went out and got this guy I knew he was the Yankee killer and he knew he was going to be exactly what's a Red Sox rotation needed come postseason\nWhile maybe diamond Dame is a step ahead of everybody else rich and you know maybe that rats Julie rabbit might have known what he was the one of the silver Fox got it right it also helps when you're up to ten nothing are heading to the bottom of the fourth inning and they've given you a bunch of runs\nBut give native all the credit because you know David Price would have done would attend one hour or ten nothing would have been ten five in about two winnings and able to add to lift them out of there and they set native all the gave the red Sox exactly what they needed you know well they were able to do they were able to\nPitch this ... in terms of heath Embry and Eddie Rodriguez and that's all due respect Eddie Rodriguez read pretty decent here but they were able to just get a couple of guys out there and get through the game just get through the game\nAnd of course Austin role mind pitches for the Yankees because they blew through a bunch of guys in their bullpen and um I I\nGotta say the amount of heat\nThat Aaron Boone is taking down in New York is pretty significant right now\nThere are a lot of fans that are pretty restless and who are unhappy with the job of Aaron Boone but the big thing last night was native faulty now of course the red Sox won out and slug ... their way to a victory there's no question about that and I'm prior angel Hernandez now\nWe are a very sports inclined region here in New England and when it comes to the red Sox there are certain things that are definitely\nYou definitely get some memory burn when it comes to calls that were weren't made by officials for teams around here [noise] um you know we remember about the fed up not block tagging\nNinety eight right that was American League championship series I Do believe that things like that we have a we take it personal there is a bit of memory burn\nAll boy angel Hernandez last night club Ron Hebrew not warned not to but three calls at first base last night I was blown away\nVery danger Hernandez was that awful I'm not blown away but angel Hernandez is all for it his job I was aware of that what I was shocked that is that level of all for them is that early in a game where it's on the national stage and oh by the way there's no more divisional series left\nSo if you're a baseball fan you were watching what was going on last night\nSitting there going up boy there's angel Hernandez just doing whatever he would normally do which is but but I mean he had a string of bad call after bad after bad call and it ... you should care head\nAnd it infuriated former major leaguers if you're on Twitter last night you saw a bunch of guys that were spitting hot fire endanger Hernandez put folks\nNo one did it better\nThan someone who we claim ownership to Pedro Martinez is one of our guys Pedro Martinez a Red Sox pitcher\nA Red Sox legend and last night on the TBS post game show which apparently nobody watch 'cause it took until morning before this started to roll around on the Internet\nOh can you blame people for not watching the game of the of that uh with that al ... I was out Yup I was way out I didn't ... well I'm Casey Cernan either the guy who said do not get along at all and there's a great story there I'll sell some other time I fell asleep and when I didn't wake up to forty taxes\nI knew that the red Sox had held off a not only did the red Sox hold on a journey and this was terrible and Pedro Martinez made sure to drive that point home on the TBS post game\nThey\nThere's a lot of side I got it on the other side\nWill uh I was wrong I was I'm fifty fifty and that's better than ... into this horrible [laughter]\nThat allow major league baseball needs to do something about angel or we didn't know a lot of how many time he's losing Majid league baseball they also have [laughter]\nHe's he's a love there is the main reason why we're sitting here so late\nOh boy Pedro Martinez not holding back and if you you know we will look at the collective works of angel Hernandez a little bit later in the show because this guy has a history including Pedro kind of joking about their\nThey angel Hernandez was suing major league baseball for basically racial discrimination\nIn it and it is the one sport\nThat we really celebrate here in America that is so friendly to the Latino player and Latinos and Cubans I Do believe angel Hernandez is Cuban\nUm it's pretty interesting to see angel Hernandez roll that out and guys like Pedro Martinez himself all Latin ballplayer throw it right back in angel Hernandez his face so that was the big story line and here's what scares me tonight to bring this full\nCircle angel Hernandez is going to be behind the plate now I don't know about you but I don't think there's going to be a lot of gray area here angel Hernandez is either going to a\nB on his best behavior and is not going to get into it with anybody\nLet me put all my money on the more I could be or be it's going to become a self fulfilling self aggrandizing prophecy for him\nAnd it will be the angels show tonight really call these shows I like it was well I I have to give credit to someone who just guessing you don't like but I got that from Keith Law\nYeah you're right [laughter] [laughter] well it was a human being with a pulse so I just took my you know but it also but it's also one of those guys would be like oh yeah bronco hit for the cycle well the number say given the hell out of there tonight don't ride the hunch and by the way ... cold is out and and I will say this about bronco cycle\nOr he did jump first pitch fastball on a guy who knew was going to serve him up about our first pitch basketball I don't hate him for it because I probably would have taken advantage\nOf the opportunity as well I Would have been jumping out of my shoes to smack that thing out of the park you can make room for one thing I didn't know was that there never been a cycle in postseason baseball history well there you go the rocks are are we going here we can hear that cycle next scratch if you like or we can move on to something

K. O. C. H. twenty five\nI'm it's going to be Christian Vasquez tonight behind the plate and we know it's not about hitting it's about the pitcher and apparently he asked\nThe court records cello since almost a year ago I don't want to say to the day but pretty damn close why Baskins\nWith pretty risky on the mound tonight\nIt's interesting I I look back at the career splits with\nA fellow in terms of Leone behind the plate and baskets behind the plate is you're right it's almost identical it's four point one of four point one five can't get much closer than that obviously Vasquez had to shift in game three\nAnd lay on his five for his last eighty four dating back about it uh I think the red Sox really just a critical mass behind the plate here are the catch inquisition isn't really a place where they've gotten off ants from throughout the year\nUp a ... who was then is to the point where he's basically like having a National League pitcher up there um you know closest season five for Seventy nine\nWas over five and this is where the sacrifice are as close to an automatic out as you can get and I you know I think like I spoke about earlier Cora sort of being patient\nAnd being even handed and level headed well that's it out over two months not not just over two games um so I think you got to the point where you had to take action and you see Christian Vasquez he's worked with Nathan of all the in the past he he was a pretty natural tech start that game\nTonight is a little bit more of a risk a you know but I think he spent on the same long enough for the cello where they should be able to work together well\nI Know more cello made a postseason starred against the Yankees way back in twenty eleven when he was with the tigers and I think like Aaron Judge was still in college and a Sanchez was in the Sally league I Do believe\nWhat are you expecting from Fort Sill on tonight bill he was great against the Yankees during the regular season but his postseason Sixth Sense well there really isn't much\nYeah his his last couple of starts with the rat talk in the playoffs he was in effect for that Cleveland than twenty sixteen uh he started game for last year only lasted creating the red Sox were eliminated stood up for sale is all about coming in or if he's\nAble to paint both sides of the play if you'd be able to change he'd been and keep the Yankees off balance it can be very effective like he was at Fenway Park earlier this year he turned eighty six pitch complete game against them during that four games sweeping August ... and you couldn't imagine a guy\nYou're pitching a better game uh you know it it was beautiful to watch 'em but he has to be very precise whereas if all the younger ... his raw stop or Chris Sale because of his truck stop they can get away with some of the state for cello\nHis margin for error you know it isn't isn't quite as comfortable as you guys have got to be really find a and really sharp put the\nBill dodge comes the red Sox me for the Providence Journal he's with me here on the ground showing W E P R O U bill follow on Twitter at bill Koch twenty five what version of cc ... bill are you expecting to show up tonight for the Yankees\nI think the Yankees would sign for you know five innings one or two raw it's you know four or five heads and then turn it over to the bullpen and if you told them that they were going to get back from sushi about the I think they take it right now uh to watch tennis career the wife of all those are the Seventeen or Eighteen years that you'd better the majors\nOr came up with Cleveland was you know dynamic power left handed pitcher at the type of guy you don't normally see\nI'm was able to just dominate opponents with a fastball\nOr now he's much more guy a lot of cuts basketball's a lot of breaking balls or he's actually going to pitch a lot like fellow does try to keep God's off balance he's been really tough on the left handed hitters this year um they had no PS about a hundred points lower\nAmsterdam a so this is why you see the red Sox back to line up with rent that editors\nUm and and I think they would be grill if he's able to go through this line up a couple of times get them to five inning and then they're going to be the bullpen brash uh no I don't think there's any reason why ... wouldn't go to weddings tonight David Robertson didn't cuts last night a sack Britain enrolled us Chapman\nDidn't pick last night I I Would assume that all of those guys would be available early and for extended where\nWere you make of the criticism in New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone fair unfair justified unjustified what your by\nWhat when he was sixteen to one and you get dominated by an opposing pitcher you could say that they could have lost that game three to one and and he might not have been able to do much I I Do think he made one critical mistake last night and the fourth any um\nFirst you can debate whether or not sending Severino back out was was the right ...\nAh for him to give up to singles and then walk Jackie Bradley to load the bases I think he probably left them in a little too long\nDecision crashed and I think really hurt them was going to lay in in that spot you asked to start or to come into a traditional reliever role um whereas in game one he went from Jay half straight to chat green a I think\nIn those situations relievers who used to doing that they're used to coming in with men on base it used to coming in and close games and\nThey used to getting our gym that's how they make their money um started was a little a little more gradual\nAh it's not as immediate uh you know they they tend to pace themselves over six seven innings and they asked lamp plan to do something that he's not for a million or with doing\nA and they asked them to do it under the most extreme pressure that he could face\nAll Steve uh so I think in my mind they should have gone to chat green there right away\nThen you go to laflin for a little try to see if we can get you in the ... and then you go with somebody you're shorter reliever so I think on that point specifically boon definitely deserves some criticism\nNo gods or the prominent sharing that with me for two more minutes here on the ground show on WNPR oh ah what's the vibe there tonight is there a big pucker factor are Yankee fans wound up I Know what it sounded like today on sports radio ... what's the feeling the ballpark right now\nAre not quite the bus we had last night I think might be a little bit more weight see tonight um but

most where everything's sort of training for Jews on the calendar we've got NBA we've got an NHL horse who had the baseball playoffs than the NFL and the Boston Bruins won a home game on Monday\nThey will play again on Thursday night and joining me now to talk about the bees senior writer at the athletic and Mr hockey I Joe Mac hockey on Twitter Joe McDonald here on the grass showing WPRI Joe how are you\nFantastic rich how about yourself\nI Am very good I'm Glad that we're able to talk at least a little bit of park and I know the first two games not so great this game at home much better for the Bruins are Joe early takeaways on this Bernstein\nWell the thing is ... if you look at the pre season and the ... the schedule it they had in the trip to China like everything was just totally disjointed you had the team separated around the world and when they came back you know they still had\nThe ... days to get ready and just really nothing kind of came together to Wade through Cass she wanted to we saw\nThe end result that in the season opener against the capitals where they just got blown away by the defending Stanley Cup champs so I think it's going to take a little while for you know get their legs under ... obviously there went on Monday in the home opener TD Garden was\nWas a step in the right direction yeah Patrice birds around with a hat trick or near that set the tone\nAnd even Brad march in a in the second game the season in Buffalo where you know he came back with four assists after getting into a fight with law Zeller first game of the season and Washington so\nI you know it this team is is going to build on what we saw from season to go and we expect those those younger players who are now in their sophomore seasons to really take that next step in\nAnd we'll get to see that uh unfortunately they're already deal with some injuries that you know it's part of the\nPart of the the routine here right especially in Boston so you know you expect this team to to basically just growing the success that they have from a season or go\nHow the world is Patrice burns Ron still this good Joe yet still bass fully under rated outside of a hockey world\n[laughter] it's crazy isn't I mean do you think of everything this guy is done in his career and\nI to me he's still one of the best players are in the world you know he's an elite hockey player and he can be up there in the conversation of the Sidney Crosby esteem in stem coasts as the Alex Ovechkin to the world because he does everything so well he's the complete player\nAnd not only is he a complete player he's he's the complete team a he's a good person I mean even if you want to create the perfect athlete or you know this is the guy that you want um you know I've been fortunate enough to cover him since his rookie year when he was Eighteen years old and just see the development\nOf from this non English speaking kid from Canada the second round two\nNow one of the best players in the world so I'm you know he's had the same with birds are on is that he's so humble that even though he has\nAchieved a Stanley Cup\nTitle and and it has achieved all of a success\nOr he's really humbled by it but the one thing that's interesting above version or on grass is we talked to him during the pre season about getting to a thousand games in some time in December right before Christmas\nOr barring any injuries are games missed a he's going to hit the thousand gained plot which is pretty impressive especially given the fact that\nYou know he missed basically a season and a half because of the lockout and he also was basically a season because of the serious concussion that are maybe suffered back in two thousand and seven so everything that he's accomplished you know you got to you know give us thick topped guy just because\nYou know he's done it the right way fans love him he's one of the most well respected guys and the national hockey league or you're never going to hear a bad word and maybe the ... the worst thing you're going to hear about Patrice birds Ron from other centers in the late saying that he cheats on face off that's why he's one of the best and the leak but\nUh it's just a it's a joy to watch this guy play and and watch how we how we performed and how he prepares and that's why these younger guys in the pros organization\nThat kind of they're they almost like a sponge off from him and and all the mission that it can give and just watch when he does on a daily basis and and it's impressive that it really is\nTalking Bruins hockey
