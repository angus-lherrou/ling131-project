I they they heard the the ... as the Stafford it you know I said I didn't hear them first he he ...\nHe actually contacted ... like this double think it in the eyes like Three Stooges type rights and that's the kind of in the middle of the caught me off guard when he did it because I I didn't expect that but Larry Larry is not a bad guy\nHe's he's really not a bad guy I mean since then we we we mended a disagreements\nBut what he can do is he can get when he gets really upset he starts to shake\nAnd he was at that level and and he his I guess the first reaction was put me in the eyes\nSo you think it was an intentional poking wasn't like him just pointing a finger at you and got too close\n... made contact us we actually did he go right on top of obsolete\nAbsolutely and when you slapped and just like his hand the way it is you're slap in the face would you do you know I don't remember I just I just opened the he had the lead slapped Adam about four or five times and he started hollering and ah I stopped so you had um a couple of times yeah maybe four or five times I mean it was a quick big big big big big big\nAnd you can see that to be defending yourself in that moment I'm singularly absolutely I you know I Would do it today you put me in the eyes show and I'm an old guy\n[laughter]\nSo [noise] I don't know if you call that an assault sounds to me like self defense if you're what you're telling me it's terribly\nUgly it is you're right it is self defense\nYeah and and I you know and I reached out to Larry are hard today to let them know what I'm Talking about this and he may\nHe said it's gonna be listening he doesn't he didn't seem to think um that this was a big\nDeal I didn't think it was a big deal either but [noise] them\nThe excuse me the members of the minority caucus Brian Newberry and company who were aware that this incident happened there ought to get me at any cost so I worked at for for\n... you know [noise] and they're working guy give you a chance to clear to all kinds of democracy can call yourself so that we can we can hear you I'm so this is I'm Sorry you back now\nYou know they're working for fun and um you know they're out they're up to get me this members of the minority quarters right now that I Know are supporting me for governor and they can't publically come out and say it because the fund camp\nIs so bound and determined to destroy any buddy and anybody that gas support means is a Republican\nAnd yesterday a Dan your cat on the show a woman who worked for a Patricia Morgan who came in Studio to tell and show her text messages from this person who's running against a hand a gal oh I forgot his name off the top of my head Mm\n[noise] but he um Republicans you don't have a younger version publications\nWill removing her but it's not so much that they were removing her and I think one of the things that got lost in the discussion yesterday\nWas ... it seems like it's turned into the fact that the young Republicans were removing her from her executive position on the board that to me that wasn't the story the story was that the Republicans\nDirected by Alan ... and his minions with threatening this girl to ruin her political life\nAnd that was in the text messages which includes the name of Brian Newberry who's the ... let me tell you something about Brian do very\nWell we're doing tell the truth\nBrian Newberry and I served together I was the whip he was the minority leader I went into at the end of a recession we'd go into the speaker's office to try to get bills passed fraud caucus and we would sit with the speaker and discuss what bills that the that the members wanted\nI went into that office within three years in a row\nBrian blueberry sold his caucus so every time we went in there\nEvery time we went in there he had already he we would go in I Would go into negotiate you Brian Newberry would say well you know we know we're not going to get any bills passed\nAnd he would just accepted as the norm and the ... and and I've come out of there and say Brian what the hell are you doing and we would go the next year and I were ... kind of get him fired up and say let's go in there and fight for these people\nAnd he sold his cortisol I've never talked about this publicly but it's all out war I mean you want to draw the line it's dirty line Let's talk\nAbout that for a second we come back they take a break we come back on TALK about the all out war I when I ask you a few more questions about the incident with Larry ...

I have no choice but talked about things like he killed somebody in an accident he shot the body Ninety six feet and the fire is sealed hoping the fire well let's find out if you were on drugs let's find out what was going on he was\nNineteen years old and a grand jury alive at the grand jury said there was nothing that it in a diner um if those drugs that he was ...\nHe was initially charge with the heck you a homicide his family at a restaurant across the street from the police department so he was in with all the cops in France thing he went out and hire ... the mafia lawyer to defend them\nTheir officers Arpaio's that's not the case and also they saw it in the super bowl remember\nDoug Peterson was the offensive coordinator for the chiefs before he left and went to Philadelphia So this is a style of our fence the patriots have seen before and\nHaven't really been successful defending we'll see if it's\nDifferent tonight six one seven seven seven nine zero Ninety eight five the phone number for you want to jump on board here on Patriot's preview mark portray Chris Gasper that splits bill patriot place getting ready for Sunday Night Football between the patriots and the chiefs who are five and on the year let's talk about the importance of this game and the AFC Chris because\nIt's not too early for this to be really important at the end of the year\nNo it's not I mean granted you remember that she's got up to five and it started last year and you know sort of down the stretch\nThat they weren't in a position really you know to get that number one seed but still if you're the patriots you don't want to be at five hundred after\nSix games looking up at the chiefs at six no being three games behind them particularly when you look at the cheap to know like I'm In the raiders or in that division and the raiders aren't very good in the Broncos aren't very good either so it could be hard to make up ground so this is an important game for the patriots when it comes to home field throughout the play offs and the AFC\nYeah it is and you know what it's a matter of at the end of the year or if you're looking at a situation where if you believe the patriots get to the super bowl which I think we all do yeah they're all in that category I Do I don't think anyone here is I'm not believing in that\nYou want that roads that go through ... through Kansas City yeah you want to go to our head I don't think anybody wants to go to arrowhead for a playoff game that is you know I I think that whole field is at times a little overrated a little just a little bit because I Know how important it spend or the patriots yeah here and they're building and I look at the home field advantage\nAnd a true home field advantage I think it only really exist for a couple of teams in terms of the fans the fan of the way where it's actually and that's one of them and Denver's the other Seattle I hadn't heard that ... got\nThe the altitude which nobody else extreme an advantage like\nNo one else in the NFL yeah and I know Seattle has you know the twelve man they're allowed to buy the themes of ... or our head in in Seattle right and arrowhead I think is the one that I'm doing it longer case like you never have to worry about that than based not being ready for a playoff game that's true but the hard place to go to our place in LA\nAnd and just to say what you're saying are wrong and rent lines of home field I Know he said you'd be three games behind the cheese but it's really for because they would have to head to head and if you have finished you finished high they they get it so you'd really be effectively sort of four games behind them\nYeah I don't think you want that swing so to say that you know the odds early it is early and there is definitely room for error for the Kansas City chiefs down the stretch but this is a really important head to head match up for the AFC and it's the best opponents patriots play to this point this is the biggest game of the year so far yeah and they end up being their biggest game of the year period\nYeah it's a good point and you know I think you could probably say the same thing for the chiefs you know to this point the patriots are probably the best he may play now they play Jacksonville last week I I Know that uh they beat up on the Steelers pretty badly as well but\nComing into Gillette Stadium against Tom Brady and bill valor check I think the chief says well we'll sort of learn something about themselves so a lot on the line here for both teams\nWere looking at a shootout tonight I think we are because that's the natural you know obvious thought that a lot of people have look out for points tonight lots of them\nI mean of course that means they will go the other way will be like I Hope I'm holding game\nI home where are you going to show we're looking for tonight or just throwing that ball all over the yard and everybody's going to\nGo yeah hey you know give that scoreboard a work out I mean I think that's what it's going to be and then we'll get into it more but if the chiefs are susceptible anywhere I think it's defensively I mentioned how many past plays the ... of twenty yards are more twenty five but defense is allowed twenty seven so\nYou know they've done some things really well bell checked talked about the third down defense for the chief it's very very good\nThey can generate some turnovers there you know they'll generate some of those in the red zone to but\nIf your defenses bend but don't break or their bend but don't break too because they give up a lot of yards in fact the most in the NFL going into this week so with the Patriots' offense that struck thirty eight points in consecutive games you would think that they would be able to get in the end zone against the chiefs tonight All right we've\nGot something to talk about here and that is the three weapons that the chiefs how that would be um drivers Kelsey yep three months and

today Texans over the bills twenty to Thirteen Josh Allen hurt for buffalo Nathan Peter make comes in throw the ... to give you the when jets beat the colds forty two thirty for Sam Donald\nYes and the Kansas City chiefs have scored a ton of points in the process of using all of their uh their weapons patriots effects not who they lined up on Chelsea campy ... recordings and\nYeah I I Would think maybe Patrick Chung would get that assignment I mean I remember a day when Patrick time was you're the first time that\nThey would use Chung in star against wide receivers they they did at one game against Indianapolis when Peyton Manning was still hearing when he's up against Blair White\nIt didn't go as well as they hope but he was you know competitive in terms of being close I think ... pretty good\nOn on tight and so I I Would go with Patrick Chung there but I wouldn't be surprised if they try and slow Kelsey down the line a little bit and ship them slow down those routes and in slowing down a little bit for China or whoever covers him I think that's one of the issues for the patriots for me in this game and you know do they have enough athleticism and speed ... when you are dealing with somebody like Kelsey\nOr creme ... out of the fact feel and what he did last year he's not as much a part of their passing game as he was last year but if I'm Kansas City and I'm Andy Reid I'm looking at than I'm saying I Want to isolate cream on on a patriots linebacker that match up as an advantage for us if I'm if I'm a chief coach that's the way I feel\nFor the patriots offsets perspective in this game Chris I Wonder how many more staffs were going to see Josh Gordon get tonight if this game does go the way of shootout and the patriots or look at a match points with what Kansas City is doing how much more involved does he get more than the Eighteenth\nYeah yeah it does it depend on a hamstring you know where we are with the hamster and mayhem stream of pretty good when you cut that touchdown and kept the gold it did it and now it's been ten days off yeah so you know where do they feel about that he seemed to feel comfortable in the ... I Would agree with you that he should get more snaps this point he's a weapon\nAgain this is a secondary a defense that will give up some place down the field or they done that this year I don't think they're secondaries really anything special their banged up at safety Murray's not going to play tonight oh so you're looking at George Lucas Ron Parker will be in there as well and I don't think they're corners are that great they traded\nPretend to bowler when they moved out Smith the Washington border was part of the return there they have more than ... who's been around for forever and has been a pretty good spot corner in the league but he's getting up there and then Steve announcement who's you know\nThese okay I mean he's using the average corner I I Would look at the patriots and find the patriots I think I can throw on these guys can make a lot of yards built rivers went over four hundred yards against these guys like ... did it sorted Rob is burger you can throw on them\nAnd the patriots will certainly look to do that tonight six one seven seven seven nine zero Ninety eight five Sunday Night Football happening in box borough between the chiefs and the patriots the chiefs five and oh the patriots undefeated at home to this point Chris and the patriots have an excellent record\nAre playing and re straight home games and that last third that third home game when you're playing in a long stretch it home the fact that the extra time off extra prep time playing at home there are some things that that certainly go to the advantage of the patriots right\nNow I mean it does feel like they're catching Kansas City at the right time doesn't it yes I'm In Kansas City coming up you know it's a tough opponent with with the jaguars as you mentioned the patriots about ten days to prepare and dissect\nThe chiefs and you would think that the patriots would be fresher and healthier and the cheap to have a lot of health issues at this point and we we talked about some of them but just in Houston their best pass Russia and you're not going to play in the game they're banged up so it it's a tough one for the cheese and I think it's a good scenario for the\nPatriots six

five hundred and Thirteen and for Tom Brady it's one thousand two hundred and fifty nine fourteen touchdowns already from homes with two packs for Brady it's twelve touchdowns and expect now we've all come in\nFrom the athletic it's Jeff our joining us here on Patriot's review I bought up\nHey who's the sausage yeah who's referring to who they call it sausage down there oh who that is\nI heard that the highlights oh totally distracted now the sausage nights ruined yeah well we'll figure it out we'll go back and listen again and figure it out for you if the wife I let me know oh we've had some white by a short little Internet connectivity issues\nUh what are you most excited for this matchup that I just there's so much to sort of look at say there's a lot happening in this case I think\nThis is a good chance to really see a well rounded team effort to an extent I mean I don't know how much you can ... you know realistically expect from the patriots defense but this is the type of game that is in the patriots or Bill Belichick wheel house you've got ten days to prepare for them\nYou've got those in higher ten days to say hey you're often isn't as good as there often that's what it you know everything everybody keeps saying you know what your defense can't stop there often because they're so good there is nothing you guys can do on paper that is nearly as good as what the Kansas City chiefs are doing\nSo you know what all proven me wrong\nSo these are the types of games where you see the patriots really kind of you know we've seen with their mettle it really is over or has been over the last couple of weeks and this is just that next chance to go out\nAnd I mean this is the marquee matchup probably the first half of the entire NFL schedule\nEverybody's watching the game the patriots have a chance to send a message so there's you know I Want to see what Tom Brady is often look like with that extra day a practice I Know it was a walk through what you want to see them go out and sort of make a statement I Want to see them respond to scoring drive better than they have you know they've had sixteen\nFull possessions after and a potent score so far the seasons they only scored rethought stances do field goals so I think their response drives a really important tonight you have to be able to control the game play with\nYour own momentum and and play on your schedule because you fall behind the scene you know fourteen nothing or fourteen three making the longer night\nYeah and that's been happening to a lot of teams that the chiefs of outskirts teams in the first quarter this year fifty nine and\nI thought a team falling behind the Kansas City chiefs you're talking about the op eds Jeff I Want to ask you about Tony ... always been good the last two games a hundred yard performance follow that up with Ninety eight yards against the cold\nBut what's the status for tonight popped up back on the injury report this week with the knee and it it there are some report the un Rapaport study the game time decisions now\nYeah I mean look I I never thought this I I never knew this thing to be honest I mean I was talking to Sony about his knee on Wednesday and he said it's fine and I I mean we know it's not fine because it's certainly not he's riding a stationary bike before the walk through I think it was Thursday\nWhich you know again it's not ... it's probably unrealistic they knew when he had that surgery in early August but it was going to be voted two months of recovery for him to get up to full strength\nI again I just his status has been the same for I think four or five weeks at this point and then we miss the opener but he's pretty much been limited in practice every time out since then so\nI again I I maybe I'm missing something but I never realized that his dad is who's going to be an adult and I don't think it is and you know find out if I'm completely wrong in ten minutes but again I I just didn't know this is the thing\nI think it's sort of speaks to worry that with the knee and general right where all of a sudden because you've got to chronic knees you that you're dealing with that is it fully healed but in any given week you might have something to come up where you say well it's probably not really smart to play it is\nRight I mean it's possible but with their running back up shark you know would you let Ralph Web walk is easily you know would you cut him from the practice squad if you thought a couple of days from now the knee is going to flare up\nOr if there was a realistic chance of that happening so I I don't know just trying to read the signs I asked him you know as they say when you have the surgery with just because something happened to practice or was this sort of an extended build up\nAnd he made it sound like and it was an extended build up learn how to be a pro take care of your body better so you know was it something where he said hey you know what I've got to pump the brakes on this I got to really get this checked out\nYou know I'm Wondering about that sort of deal but you know when the report came out that it was a ten day thing that was not even close to what I was told and I thought there was some lying\nGoing on behind the scenes kind of make everybody you'll Kansas City shuffle you look at the left I go right I I this is something that's probably gonna needs to be maintained for the seats\nYeah that yeah it's interesting because he played really well and I like when he brings you know to to stop and so I think there's an element of explosive and is there in the running game that they've struggled a little bit to replace\nWith the on Louis now being in Tennessee let me flip it over to the other side of the ball jak when you get a patriot defense what concerns you the most about them trying to defend his she's often\nMore than more about the chiefs and Andy Reid and that all kinds of system than anything else and I mean I Can't believe I'm saying that considering how easy it's been sort of you know poke at Andy Reid and his history but\nWe've always been a great offensive coach which doesn't mean you're a great head coach yeah you're right I mean Mike Shanahan by the way up to coach not a great head coach\nYeah uh but he's had in his office of systems and going back to the super bowl ... school uh they've had the the patriots defensive number so I think the patriots defenses in a better place certainly now than it was a couple of weeks ago and having three flowers back as we talked about\nBefore the Colts game it's been a major part of that and yeah but they can attack everything they attack you at all three levels from sideline to sideline there's got to find your weaknesses they're not going to be scared of stuff on Gilmore the way that they weren't scared of jail and Ramsey we can go\nYou're going to see Patrick son go against Travis Kelsey and you know he's going to get some help too but you know the the edges you contain they're running a attack\nCan you keep the homes in the pocket the kid can make every throw I I mean he was he's really and I can't believe how good he is is bad but you know Jason ... played really well Patrick song is always good when he's healthy well we'll see what they're made up on the back in there\nThat guy for the line backers through Jeff\nYeah certainly but I think you're starting to see that come into focus better too because you using the same rotation of high power in the ... over the middle you're not\nScared in the sense that when you wrote dating some of those younger guys you got to back way off the line of scrimmage and allow those catches over the middle and then just making tackling those guys were able to play closer to the line that eliminates some of those crossers\nThing is they just the seats are going to be so creative you're taking away the crossers right in front of line backers they'll start the submarine routes they'll try to get ... he'll open behind the line of scrimmage will see that with Travis Kelsey too I mean last year Patrick I think helps to have like five catches in that season opener Patrick something had them shut out in their ... you know against each other so\nBut again that that doesn't mean that the seats are going to be able to ... ways to beat you whether it's a weakness is ranked or whatever they are just that good\nAre Jeffrey share your time looking forward to your coverage on the athletic and on Twitter at Jeff the outlets replied making thanks jak\nUh checking in with Jeff ... by

forty six man roster bonuses that are adding up so you know you can't be overly upset with that but to your point beat all he he does not look the same to me that he looked like he lacks the explosion that he normally that\nYeah I mean I I Would agree with that as well and you know that's something in a game like this\nWe're going to need sort of all hands on deck all offensive weapons on deck against the Kansas City chiefs but I think part of that ... is making sure you give Tom Brady time to throw the ball the patriots has done a great job of that the last couple a week they haven't allowed attack the last two games they're number one in the lead us act allowed\nHer past that times have you notice any change in Brady sort of the last couple of weeks with this protection he's been getting\nWell I definitely think the ball has been coming out gradually quicker as as they've gone along and certainly with Edelman back last week you start off the game and there's a couple of quick hitters to Julian and you sort of get your feet wet and you you do to avoid the rush that way now\nI I think the object of mine is under pretty good job in past protection for the most part there have been some times where I think that they've lost that a little bit um and and Brady is they've gotten rid of the ball but you look at some of those places that you know the the uh the the really the the signature play of last week's game against ah the cold\nThat was a play that Tom had all kinds of time moving around the rocket looking looking right before he finally go to Josh good and so give

was a kind of pressure on him this week I just\nUnless you're there I don't think you understand what it's like the coach that environment and everybody's finger was pointed at Scotland a hand the alternative coordinator after Alan Hern said what he said publicly in a couple of different places during the week and I just tell you this\nInternally there's been a lot of talk about Lincoln Riley the Oklahoma head coach getting that job next year and the implication is like an rallies is off at the gym yes we need somebody like that to coach the press got coaches you allow it we need to move into the twenty first century\nWhich of course would mean Scotland and the games pass you by shove you aside this feels like when he got creative and was able to find some things in the Jacksonville defense and I wouldn't have guessed score forty point or sort of sparked\nThem possibly is what that conversation as well yeah I'll just talking about the AFC playoff pitcher and just the AFC picture because there is still early but\nThe patriots have a lot more to gain in this game tonight that begins a city Jeff do patriots gotta win well I don't know you're you're looking at this as a who you know when you ask yourself who are the two dominant teams in the in the AFC\nBut the patriots when you're talking about the patriots and chiefs where the chiefs when you're saying right now it's the chiefs in their own yeah are you isn't that kind of the way it will go either chiefs\nCan take such a major step towards home field here but this is a major step towards home field because you're in essence basically putting the patriots board games back\nIf you can win this game and I don't think that we can make a big enough deal out of the difference between this game being an arrowhead and January versus this game being here in January arrow\nIs one of the more difficult places in the lead to play or we've seen the patriots played poorly there in the past we've seen a lot of teams play poorly there in the past and\nNot only would just be validated for the chiefs that you're knocking off the defending conference champion and obviously the marquee franchise in the NFL over the last Twenty years you're picking a major step to making sure that\nMaybe an extra playoff game or to play the arrowhead\nYeah that obviously would be big I want to keep it in if the ... year Oakland Raiders one in five now rumors that they're looking to move on from a mark Cooper young Carl Joe said do you think those guys are really up to the trade blocks so to speak and it it was this a rebuilding job but John grew didn't he inherited jogger and\nTold me flat out he thought the roster sucked wow it was so blatant that I had to so I circled back with them and I'm like are you surprised on the record like he was very strong about that like\nI don't think we've drafted well over the last five years what's interesting about is the guy who drafted ran all those dress and still in the building but he was willing to come out and say that stuff\nLook I don't think it's good it hasn't been good between John Gurdon Reggie McKenzie there was some talk about him potentially bringing in his own personnel guy I'm On top of you know like the guys that are already there the guy that he brought in\nIts\nGuys I think this is going in the direction of\n... ... ... is not

twelve games two years ago yeah I thought it was to versus versus the coaches come in and said no this sucks like I'm going to come in and I'm going to blow the whole thing up and I don't care what you say and it almost feels like look we know they're not the most catch cash rich franchise right yeah true\nI don't regiment can't due to some degree was forced on junk food right to some degree was forced to John group because I just got an extension and I don't think Mark Davis was going to fire him he likes Reggie and I don't think he was going to pay to make them go away\nThis feels a little bit like John ... trying to push ready to quit and we know that\nJohn Gurdon is that a year of Davis for very long time I was ready to have it has like he's looking posters on his wall\nJob at that on
