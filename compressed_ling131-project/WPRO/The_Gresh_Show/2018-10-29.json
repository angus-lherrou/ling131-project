is on the line who came home killing Jerry ... tell us about it and hopefully that wasn't too much damage\nI'd been gone for about a week I turn the master water ... off the water supply to my house go for about a week came back with him it's a split foyer pretty fair size house or so came into the garage came into straight through and the man's day in and out here to say on a good thing or\nA which is obviously never a good plan\nSo I'll go back to the far end of the house away from the garage and the whole day upstairs has substantial amount of water in it and I look up and it stripping down from the ceiling\nAnd really directly on them a big screen TV that point that I got to know not good so that was set up the stairs\nSo it's all a very far into the house a is our washroom the washing machine is full of water and overflowing ... and that was the source of off\nInto Washington you mean the like the ... was that taking the districts of washer was the washer itself or falling to the washer itself\nSo you're basically saying that you were away and when you came back you found this water had collected in two in the laundry area because the washer was filled up with water and that was overflowing leaking down through the house right on your flat screen TVs and correct we've got it right that's correct but the but the main water was turned off\nYes and when I when I looked at all is I thought I'm almost sure I turn the water level I went to the nearest faucet turned it on nothing no water pressure everything there was there was no water pressure in the lines of my house\nThat is a mysteries not\nMali theory is that when you come in the garage downstairs\nThere was a bathroom there and that's where the washing or a correction that's where the hot water heater is so it's basically middle a mid mid range of the house on on the bottom lawyer level right the washing machine is on the upper level far into the house and this is about a five thousand square foot house a pretty good size house\nOnly thing I can ever have come up with as it created some house on top of the socks on right now my head siphoned water from the hot water heater all the plumbers your mother ever talked to said no way no thing possible us will give me your alternative and nobody ever has\nLike a [laughter] that is wait a ministry where friend quite a mystery there would be water\nIn the pipes but doesn't seem like it's enough to do what you would you're seeing did the other thing I was thinking about is whether or not that was waste water and backed up from the street because that's not controlled by how\nThere was no odor to it\nYeah well I mean it it depends on how on how the plumbing system is designed and it's only one weighs probably be I Would be even if you had a great were planted would not be stinky um but I don't have any other ideas not than that I mean I I was trying to the ... an idea but it still it extraordinary circumstances never happened again is that right\nIt has not but again I have always now since and turned the violence off so yeah no water to get to the washing machine right\nNow the smartest way you normally would do yeah because I was going to say is that I I Know that sometimes even when he turned faucets off you can get you can still get water that leads through because I've seen this happen um in fact my mom lives in Florida half the year and one year she got a letter from the ... from the water company saying she's ten thousand gallons of water problem\nShe wasn't there for that month and I'm like where do the ten thousand gallons of water go and I knew that we are turned off valves well it turned out that one of the valves\nWas not completely off and it was leaking through the toilet so thankfully it went down the drain but you know even sometimes when you think the waters off it's not and I do wonder if some if that could have played part of the scenario that you've experienced\nBut thank you for sharing it with us I don't have an a ha moment but I think I can speculate as good as the next guy and and that's kind of what I'm thinking this point good luck with that project thanks so much for calling us

at that two ways really in a workout one is just a rental for this year for the patriots the how it goes and bring them back where you look at and say hey you know we're willing to pay this guy and he is an older guy and will give him some money here will keep him here long term and he's the guy we think fits are often\nSix one seven seven seven nine zero Ninety eight five a dumb areas Thomas you in or out on that\nI'm Out on some areas Thomas you know I've been pretty pretty adamant about the fact from from the jump that the the Denver receiver the seeds oh saying no no those out on some areas Thomas's well\nYou know the Denver receiver I Would have interest in its Emanuel Sanders and all indications are that you know John Elway is not going to move him he's having a very strong season patriots obviously I'd interest in him up before you know going back to the twenty thirteenth season they sent him to that offer sheet and and and the Pittsburgh Steelers ended up matching that thing so Sanders is the guy would want from Denver not to\nMarry some and I always thought Sanders and make a great patriot and I thought that offer she was terrible patriots could have done a much better job on that offers she'd get him out of there\nBut they didn't uh and I'm with you I'd still much rather get him here than even really entertain the idea of the marathon is six one seven seven seven nine zero Ninety eight by bill is in Framingham tonight I built\nGuys hey I Would just get rid of Josh Gordon like no other show when he came here they laid it out crushed to clear the rules in ... he was supposed to abide by and I'm trying to shock that it only took she screwed up\nAlready I figured it would be down the line but since it's so early how can you trust this guy for the rushed to the edge just get rid of them now and not have to deal with this any more shallow lead thought on Josh board\nOkay they'll appreciate the call I wouldn't get rid of them simply because it is but I Would just have the understanding as they should have from the very beginning which is it's nice to have the talent he can do a lot of different things he's very good but at the end of the day\nYou're not going to be shocked if for some reason he's on available to you you're just not and I think you've got to prepare for that if you're the patriots I think they're approaching it the right way they're out there looking for more right now today yesterday this past week leading up to the deadline tomorrow they're not done they're still looking I think it's the right approach\nBut yeah I Would agree with you and I think yeah you have to go into an understanding that\nYou know it's a little bit of a tenuous situation and there will be games like last week against the bears where he helps you he's he's that talented I mean no one has ever questioned the talent it's the dependability it's the professionalism it's the maturity it's all those things and the patriots know that they they knew what they were getting into\nSo you better have a plan B you know like you said for Josh Gordon but that being said I think it would be premature to give up on him now and the reality is as long as he's on your team he can help you when football games you know as long as he's not doing anything that's detrimental at this point and this is not a good time no question about it\nBut it's not like he's causing a problems in the locker room or he's in a situation where he's not showing up at all he's here he was on the first bus he made it here so we'll see how we respond to this and bounces back but now he's on notice\nYes some of my other question would be what's the next step what if it happens again how do they handle it then\nWhat do you think you know the next step would be you'd have to suspend them for a gang\nRight so you're talking about an inactive type of thing yeah healthy scratch the next time he shows up late but as you've said Chris he showed up on the first bus to the stadium today from the ... hotel and if you're just joining us the news is on Josh Gordon\nOr he was late to the bus yesterday before the team left Gillette Stadium before they traveled to buffalo he was late and therefore tonight he will be facing discipline from the team according to reports including the first one coming from Ian Rapaport he will miss the first quarter or so of this game as discipline\nGoing up late it's the first uh disciplinary action that's been taken against them your New England he's obviously got a long history of facing discipline from the brown and the lead in his time in Cleveland so we see where it goes from here we see how we respond to night in the game\nAnd so far what we know about a day that he was the first bus to the stadium so he's\nMaybe responding already do whatever I just when he was facing run\nThe team that that is the news on Josh Gordon and on top of that there are rumors and reports that the patriots have been engaging in trade talks around the league continuing to look to add a receiver that's what they're looking to do the tray deadline is tomorrow in the NFL and that is not the only trade rumors that it's out there

of ... andme accordion harm in that you would expect I I think those guys are are capable of playing better\nOkay um that's a good thing and what I Would say is that if if the patriots feel the same way and again I'm I keep repeating it's I don't feel they're any worse than they were a year ago and they almost won the super bowl to be able to make sure they get back to that point their thought process might be one of ...\nThere's one touchdown better what what if we can make up and that's asking a lot of Tom Brady I Want to make sure I state that that it okay that's asking a lot of your quarterback that's asking a lot of your off ... is it fair no what is it possible when I think you have the best quarterback on the planet yes I Do\nAnd I don't think he's dropped off and I think they could do it exactly the way they did it a year ago but when you do that you got to make sure you got all the guys possible when you need to pick up a third dwells\nYou know what I mean yeah you got to be able to sort of maximize your scoring potential which means\nHaving guys like I'd I I hate to bring up the ending of adult because I don't have a big issue with the moving on from Danny I'm at all\nBut you need to have players like that you guys you could count on you need to have good players in the past and game to be able to do that lately year the way they've done it in previous seasons and so that's why I think they may be looking at it right now saying\nI don't know what we could add that would be such a significant upgrade that's going to immediately change our deep sense but\nI Do know that if we add a receiver going to make our off it's even better than it is yeah and I wonder if I understand the thinking yeah\nI agree and I want to ... plays into that to it you know there are some longer term concerns about Bronx health ... with his issues you know the ankle and the back and whatever else might be bothering him if there are\nLonger term concerns about this season and what level you can reach you know Mike one party has been out there talking about ground is not the same in terms of visibility separate in his quickness and I wonder if that factors into this\nAs well so that's the one seven seven seven nine zero Ninety eight five on regrets couple more of your calls we're going to go around the NFL coming up and you're on Patriot's preview a Andrew is in Bedford a low Andrew\nHow are you doing that's taking the call 'em ... question actually I'm so first of all I'm kinda wondering um why isn't conquest and tonight because I just feel like isn't this a real honor to do it like not a great history against the bill\nLike no offense to the bills but I feel like we can probably get through them without him and does it have anything to do with the fact that ground contractors now incentive base and is that going to shoot the patriots and the foot with him being tired at the end of the season\nI think it's fair question to ask I don't know the answer I don't know the answer but I Do know that isn't it's not unreasonable to ask if that was the best course of action for the patriots on this deal to make an incentive waited because it's going to have a guy who earlier in his career I think they were concerned about not being willing to play through bumps\nAnd bruises but now as he gets older and he's had more bumps and bruises and more surgeries and more injuries\nIs this the guy you want playing through that stuff or is it a guy that you want to make sure it's healthy for the month of January I think that's a balance if they're going to have to figure out here\nYeah I I think it's the latter mark but the problem is the way that you constructed this contract and ... you know it it's the former he has to be out there I mean already\nWeek just missing that bears game that cost him a hundred and nine thousand dollars you already missed two hundred and fifty thousand dollars because he was an ... which is on him that's on him that\nI don't I don't know how that I don't know about what what I went out last week\nWhat do you know mentally ground confident is trying to make it out he's trying to make it up and so in order to make it up you have to be on the field and he used by and and\nAnd they're now than it make it up they're not letting to make it up by playing the playoff games no [laughter] I don't know they do it in and it built in so that he he makes all of us is that there is a good place to play off games in the division around her AFC Championship it's not like that carrot is dangling\nThere no say in it you know we're we're going into this'll be the halfway point right\nAnd he enters his game twenty six catches four and five yards one touched down you know for him to get paid for him to hit these incentives these one point one million dollars and cents per thing he needs Seventy catches a thousand and eighty five receiving yards and nine touchdowns he's he's not on pace he's not on pace and he knows it\nAnd he's trying to play to get some of those incentives or come close try and make his money are coming up next we're going to go around the NFL here on Patriot's preview\nCleveland as a fire in

in box borough boat Chris Gasper in our gas jak hollow the athletic or in Buffalo jak what's going on how we do it\nGoing good uh let's get to your reporting first on Jamie Collins between having discussed this internally about bringing back what do you think the odds are that they actually go ahead and try and do it\nI mean I was shocked to even find that I I didn't even want to believe it at first just knowing the nature of why they shipped him away a couple of years ago so the fact that it's gotten to this point is interesting because you know obviously means they've softened their stance or that in in the why they you know sent them to Cleveland a couple of years ago but\nIt's a I I still think it's a a very slight chance of it happening or because the contractors sort of an issue we signed that fifty million dollar deal about a year ago year and a half ago\nYou're gonna have to figure out that I mean they have ways to create several million dollars a gap space by restructuring some other contracts so again there there are some complications with it but\nThe fact that they are even considering going after Jamie calls I think is very interesting and that might even be something to you know if it doesn't happen by Tuesday that's something to keep in mind going into the off season if calls becomes a cap casualty as the browns continue to rebuild\nJeff I Want to go to Jeff Gordon here and there are reports that are there out about the discipline that the patriots are going to enact tonight because he was tardy showing up yesterday to delight stadium as the buses departed for buffalo what are you know about the situation in in why do you think they decided to discipline and\nYeah another really really interesting case because there's a lot of layers here and he showed up leading up yesterday that it was obviously noticeable to the rest of the team and I don't think this was an isolated incident and you saw Kevin Duffy at the Boston Herald saying but he also was late for a meeting or earlier in the week so they weren't going to bench guy\nAnd then do it publicly on Monday Night football if it was just one incident the other side of it is you know you're showing up late you know not to the point where I think he held the buses back or anything like that but if you show up late enough that everybody's noticed thing\nYou know it's only a quarter so you know I think that sort of fascinating\nDid he get sort of preferential treatment I mean if this was a lesser player would he get the entire night off so I think this story is still probably you know might be a little more to continue unfolding here\nJeff are given the reports that we heard yesterday including the one for Jake laser that the teams up their shopping for\nA wide receiver do you think that that desire to go out and maybe look for another guy is partly related to a lack of trust on the reliability of Josh Gordon and I'm not saying that you know one led to the other yesterday because I think that it probably happened prior to yesterday but do you think that's part of the equation for the\nI don't know that but I Do believe it I mean it has to be right you talk about a a guy who was been late at least now twice that we know of and it's probably more than that and you just you understand what you got yourself involved in when you went after ... and you know I'm not criticizing the move I think so far it has worked to their benefit but\nThey understand that you know they're kind of got to be told on the line with him the rest of the season and just because of his history\nAnd you can't necessarily have a hundred percent trust that everything will work out perfectly over the second half it into the playoffs so if you are trying to find another body of wide receiver then yeah I mean I I think that is part of the equation\nYeah I mean I think that's interesting narrative patriotism and trying to find that other body a wide receiver the way that Jay Glazer sort of frame that it seemed like you know it's not just another body it's it's almost the number one type wide receiver is that a situation Jeff where they are looking not just for this year but\nBeyond looking at someone like Chris Hogan being a free agent not knowing if Gordon is here for the long term and as we see joined Adam and get a little older\nYeah I mean it's got to be because you know that was my my reaction is well I mean I don't think you're just going after a rental especially with how much we've discussed\nThis season and in the past how difficult it is to come in and learn this off and on the fly so how much you're really going to get\nFrom anybody that you acquire this week if that does happen so I think it's it's got to be a short and long term type of deal\nAnd I really wonder is it more than just a you know the the names that we've been throw it out there is it just the Mary as Thomas or Emanuel Sanders and gold and tape for is there a pretty significant name on the trait block that we just don't know about yet I mean is it\nAre we talking about a super star caliber player that's out there I mean Jake laser doesn't just\nYou know he doesn't break little stories this guy hits all runs and\nI I'm really really curious to see who might be available to be moved and the next twenty four hours\nJeff I Know you're sort of been reporting on this this afternoon in terms of who could be the last in active for the patriots is Rob Gronkowski definitely ago in your mind\nIt sounds like it I mean he sounded pretty optimistic he looks a whole heck of a lot better than he did a week ago I mean we're talking about it I saw him in the locker room friday before that Chicago trip and he looked sip as a board and this week he looks like himself again so I think uh all signs are are pointing toward him being up\nJeff in any concerns going into tonight about the lack of running back that the the patriots elected not to bring up ... practice\nUh it's just two running backs tonight uh James White and Kenyan foreigner\nYeah I'm going to go back to my favorite word of the segment here I was surprised that they didn't bring up a feral this week and you know we'll see what Fahrner is capable of\nI think if if it were anybody other than the bills I mean if they were facing a legitimate NFL caliber opponent this week then yeah you know the running back situation will be a concern\nIf you've got a Brady dropping back and thrown think fifty times and James is out there for eighty percent of the steps then you'll be just fine because again look at who's across the field there Geoff\nJust quickly to follow up on that what are you hearing on Sony Michel I Know he was back at practice on on Saturday a lot of times that just sort of you know like a walk through type deal but it can be a prelude to a guy coming back the next week\nYeah I agree completely I think that was what their intention was you bring him out there for Saturday was more than a walk through it's because of the Monday game so you get them out there Saturday you let them touch the knee and you know that you're not putting the pressure on him to play Monday Night the letter of the nation you see how the knee responds if there's any swelling or anything like that\nA while he gets a few days off and then you bring them back out there you know assuming everything goes well you bring 'em back out there Wednesday you see what he looks like and back to back days on Thursday and then you find out by friday afternoon if the guy does have a legitimate chance I don't think they know for sure one way or the other yet if he'll be ready for the backers\nAre Jeffrey she at the time as always checking in with Jeff ... by Rocklin\nFederal credit union where remains free free

yesterday that the patriots are still shopping for a wide receiver ahead of tomorrow's NFL trade deadline if they could go get a guy I make a deal who would you want us to be for\nYeah I mean obviously we read a lot of stuff about the Marius Thomas I'm I I Would have to think that that would be a insurance for Josh Gordon right you know based on the the reports from from earlier today from Ian Rapaport\nUm you you sort of worry about how much Gordon gets a how much of the other part of the ... he becomes it's sort of a catch twenty two you want him to assimilate and start making plays I think he can lift the ... you know a higher level\nBut then you start to rely on that\nAnd you put yourself in a position where if he slipped up and he's late or whatever the way these reports are and it becomes an issue now you've really lost something whereas that whole we have no risk here we're going to pick up a guy if it works out it works out if he doesn't we let him go we've lost nothing well this is the one possible downside is that he works out\nFor a couple of months and then all of a sudden he doesn't work out any more and now you've lost something off and so I think bill is probably looking at some of those guys\nThomas is a guy I Know our buddy might she already has been a banging the drum for I I don't know golden tape looks like he you know we go back to the summer when all the Golden Gate talk I Would take a wide receiver but I think the bigger needs guys are on the other side of the ball I\nI'm looking to some athleticism on the fence and they could get Jamie
