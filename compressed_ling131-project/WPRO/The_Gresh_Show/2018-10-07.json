times and it's it's it's appalling\nPeople go around and they froze word rape and sexual assault around like those words don't mean anything and uh and they just they just limited to literally people going around and I don't know if there's anybody in public the like this I'm sure they have I just don't know it can't pull off the top of my head but you know people talk about this stuff\nUm and they like well Brett Brett Kavanaugh serial rapist watch what\nWhat are you talking about I mean do you have any idea the difference between\nWhat a rapist is and what this guy's even just been accused of\n\nNot that it's a great thing to do the thing if he was found you know if that was true that he did any of these things not that great but the difference between him and like Bill Cosby what Bill Cosby was convicted of and evidently what are what are your Harvey Weinstein has been accused of others things he he's a big difference there\n\nBut the modern politics is is what we do we just take one little thing we conflated with a bunch of other things we make one thing stand for everything else and so therefore it's all one big pile of terror\n\nAnd so you know I got to step back and start to you know understand that's a small example of it but I saw this today and I said listen to the audio and over and over and again and you know as far as Trump goes is it very presidential no\nIs it something that you should even be kind of flippant about or be litigating at a at a rally when we're in the midst of this and it's a very delicate negotiations in a delicate process no\nWhen you have a I mean he's he's sitting there and they're at a rally where was the ... and Mississippi is the Mississippi to uh you know obviously red meat crowd Heathrow in red meat to the crowd in Republican circles right now they find doctor for it to be completely um\nLudicrous in terms of\nHer ... her viability in in in veracity and I will tell you this on top of that you know this whole Supreme Court nomination has become something of a\nUm [noise]\nIt's it's it's a symbolic victory rather than an actual discussion about whether or not a person would make a good justice you know the idea of being a good justice or not is you know is is like second or third on the list\nNow you've created so that's one team versus another and losing is a is a shot and not in not like oh we lost this guy okay we got to find somebody else it's if you lose\nThat's not the worst thing in the world the worst thing in the world is that the other side would win\n\nAnd so it's become like this political Rorschach test you can make the cabinet appointment about whatever horrible thing you want it to be about\nWhether or not it's actually about that doesn't matter it's about whatever you want it to be about whatever your cause lab is whatever your cause does your is whatever it is you're you're the thing that you're most upset about a more angry about it can be whatever you want it to be\nBecause you know when somebody says words you can take those words and as long as they're loosely kind of created an loosely connected you can make them out to be whatever it is you want them to be\n\nJust reading the story with Cory Booker was yesterday afternoon talking about you know even the ultimately I read the court to us from the daily wire\nUltimately not whether he's innocent or guilty this is not a trial said Booker but ultimately have enough questions have been raised that we should not move on to another candidate the people on the Supreme Court ah should preserve the integrity of the court and be beyond the report to these difficult partisan times\nHe wants to get rid of the guy now and get a new candidate because there's too much stuff around it\n\nSo you know to me I'm sitting here and I'm watching this old it's it's it's really got into an absurd level\nAnd nobody's got now I was reading the story of last night about the uh the FBI investigation that could wrap up at some point today supposedly\nUm and\nYou know they have it usually with this kind of uh things background investigation they give it to a junior agents who are just trying to learn how to get to learn the ropes and do the the proper\nUm [noise] uh you know\nPaperwork and things like that and so what's happening now is they get these guys and they're going out there to get to agents going out there usually be probably be like one now they got two agents was a supervisor because you know God Forbid there going to be they're gonna be crucified no matter what comes out of this thing the question of whether or not there should be made public as being out there\nOr they'll say no it's going to go to the senator's only 'cause that's what they've always done but it'll be leaked in about three Thirteen seconds\nOr and everybody will be able to read it\nAnd of course it'll just be a bunch of this is what they said this is what was told to us this is the information we found will be no different than we were a week ago today or we could go friday and everyone's going to have to go ahead and decide what they think\nAnd the acrimony the um symbolic nature of the vote will then take its course people will make accusations about what a vote for does to this person does to the does a says about the individual senator\nThey'll they'll use it to deeply divide the people going into the mid term elections and ultimately one of those two parties really to prevail or lose and you and me will be sitting here with the wreckage the social political\nInter family inter societal wreckage where you know the idea that people walk and we have some form of rape culture in the United states and that you know we put a rapist on the on the Supreme Court without any sort of consideration for evidence or anything like this is going to be now commonly thrown about\nWhether or not this reality whether or not it's it's real doesn't\nMatter reality doesn't matter\nIt's whatever perception they can hammer into your forehead about an individual about a party about a situation about a person\nWhat actually happened doesn't matter\nIn in this case the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh has now become a a block Miller I say ... like everybody knows what it means\nYou don't you think everybody knows what Russia has this didn't blood tests you know what do you see that it's like when you're a little kitten you stand that lay there on the ground and look up at the sky and you say oh that cloud looks like this that looks like that you could still do that by the way probably not 'cause not a computer screen 'em they probably have an app for that\nBut you still have that will take a dog it was like a dinosaur\nOh really I think it looks like I Know\nOh okay so that's pretty much of this has become it's the patriarchy rape culture that is what it is\nNow now there's no evidence that as a matter of time and it doesn't matter guilt or innocence doesn't matter it's the it's it's whatever ... whatever for form of of of political manipulation we can achieve on a mass basis that's reality doesn't matter which true or not\nSo you know\nThis is what I see today a you know Donald Trump making a great strategic move with that not really as he mocking a victim of sexual assault that is yet to be determined number one whether or not she actually was or not\nOr you know I tend to believe somebody says they are because those types of things are very serious and I think it only take a deprived human beings to lie about them but some people live on them so it happens um and on top of that you know sitting there and and making fun of somebody would make it funny was poking holes in the argument yeah going here sorry\n\nThat's the way I see it you want to look at the block and tell me what you see my phone numbers for three eight WNPR oh\nThe toll free number one eight hundred three two one WPRI this portion of the show sponsored by guilt appliances killed appliances Columbus Day sale September twenty six through October tenth and joined basing saving showrooms and personal in Middletown or online that guilt appliances dot com\nAnd I have people on Facebook saying that you're always anti Trump and I got other people calling saying come on not wake up he was mocking her\nSo there you go let's look at the ... together you and I we can sit down and can analyze each other's insanity for excellence of flatulence as well speaking of which\nOf of him anyway not of which I'm next our chemical and the and from channel twelve going to join us I Want to know she used came as close as I can tell from anybody else to actually seeing face to face the person who may have called shell the White House's office about beating and Brett Kavanaugh\nKind of like somebody who seemed Bigfoot that's coming up in the mat Allen she'll stay right there\nSouthern New England weekends on his talk six thirty seven F.\nW. A. R. O. he's he's he's unelectable and he's on the radio Saturday mornings at eleven am faced John ... the former congressional candidate retired army\nI did ... did not see anything to you about whether or not they they do is this like the by rote thing they do or somebody comes in he was voted on we don't do any sort of work on our end to determine whether or not legit would just for that and that's it\nSo he and he expressed to me that he thought he had done the proper thing you know I got this complaint we wanted to make sure that was bought for the proper channels and he was frustrated and upset that it had been sort of both right before it was properly\nThat's why I Want an apology because he said that to to put this stuff out there with the identifying or the ability to identify the Twitter account anyway right on right that was something that wasn't a prompt is this guy was just a regular guy was just a regular constituent of is\nRight and and if you've seen the transcripts you know that his name is redacted transcripts but those are the tweet and the Twitter bio are are identifiable um and as we also know from that Twitter account this man has said publicly we're attracted a story that he supposedly told us that are White House so\nUm it's been an interesting thought I got to try and thought well I Wish that um someone a preferably me to talk to this guy\n[laughter] I have\nA I was the one outside of your door you know I think it's an interesting story to tell a regardless of what that story it\nYeah I mean it seems so\nAssuming that you know obviously there is that that Twitter feed Twitter name belongs to him and that he was the one who made the phone call um the the ... the name of the door and the Twitter name match yeah yeah that's about all we know so somebody using that name has the same name as a person who lives in that apartment\nIt's like you know actually we really need a human [laughter] yes has forward\nAnd say hello to me yes that's my Twitter account yes and the same person who called senator White House right now it's all sort of you know we're trying to connect the dots um but I I think it\nYou know we haven't really been able to pin that down yet and until we have a person for 'em and and talk to us face to face a I don't think we can ever really know for sure\nI'm even though all signs point yes that a person a this Rhode Island man and connected with his Twitter account and with that complaint that with me\nAnd a being a dog a reporter that we know you are you obviously tried other messages well I Would imagine right to try and get some kind of confirmation of connection to this guy to no avail though huh\nYeah yeah of course I mean like I said we we tried calling him an an emailing him we've looked on social media for relatives um some of whom have responded to us but\nUh some of the housing and it's been a it's been really tricky to even try and break through a I think the closest that we've gotten again it's just going to the department knowing that he called down to his supervisor and said I don't want to talk of the media which to me is a good sign that were on the right track does of someone who\nIs not confused about why the news is outside of his door\n... right right okay yeah because ultimately if you're if you're confused you open the door and go what's this all about right\nTo have ... who are you what are you doing here [laughter]\n... facts may may seem as though that this might be the person who did it and we just don't know why\n[noise] right right and that's really why we went and knock down his door because by the time friday morning both around he had already seemingly taken to this Twitter account and set\nThe story I told is not true um I've been getting them boarded with tweets and so what we really wanted to do with not question the validity of his story anymore but the question him on why he felt it was necessary to make that kind of call in\nAnd people can recant stores for all different reasons right does not for me because I was made a mistake or it wasn't true it could be made a mistake by even bringing this up is now part of this morass that I Want nothing to be part of you know I don't want any part of it so I when\nI mean over my head and I want to get out and um so it's interesting All right so I as far as I knew you were the only one that actually tried to get a face to face with that person in terms of\nPhysically being there that you talked about it publicly anyway I'm sure other people maybe you've tried so I wanted to kinda see where you were in and um and so you're still available should the person who want to reach out and talk to the lady who knocked on his door\nAbsolutely lady who was at your door if you if you wanna get in touch with me I can do so on Twitter at that convenient [laughter] so yeah I think I think he has an important an interesting story to tell you just get to see if he's willing to tell it\nCan thank you for everything I appreciate it thanks Matt or ... a gentleman channel twelve\nSleep you know is this a situation where the simplest explanation is the correct one right don't use of this me earlier today so huge that discipline has the simplest explanation is that is the right one\nGuy called cinder White House in White Houses here if you want to go tell your story you know it's in your story to the kids to the committee they're going to investigate it\nAnd just in case you want to go ahead and tell the media about this go right ahead here soon so and then you know whatever um and then\nFor whatever reason this person and it could be a very viable explanations person doesn't um [noise] see I was when I was wondering issues if we couldn't find anybody if nobody's come forward and nobody you know is this is a person who's who's phone number was was on you know wrongly assigned\nOn the Internet\nAnd we don't even know there's no picture on the Twitter feed is nothing like this was this person even a real person who was just somebody screwing around on the Internet now that Kim's bent toward door some place in the room\nWith the guy's name that matches the Twitter account on the front door it leads a little bit more credibility to the fact that there might be actually a human being behind this now what they were trying to achieve if anything is still the mystery is this is one of those things where somebody has a memory and they go oh\nThis must have been the same thing and then realized his later on oh no that was not it or somebody trying to pull a prank or somebody's trying to get involved in something you'll people do there\nAre so I'm not saying this happening here but then some kids situations people actually tried to go ahead and get involved in things that they're not involved in a while to get attention to to be able to you know puzzle chaos or whatever reasons that they have\nBut um you know the idea that some of the White House is now saying this person should get an apology or something like this to me\nUm you know when you if you make a a you know when somebody says hey we can't something I made a mistake to me that is you know they they screwed up and they made a false allegation\nIt doesn't have to mean that but that's what I take us\nSo for me this has become now part of this uh this Kavanaugh um [noise]\nYou know so called the last hour the or the ink blot test right there ... test where you know ultimately my mind on your mind goes is that there's partisan politics at work here and that you have\nEither somebody who's a willing volunteer or somebody's ... knowing a participant in a partisan war between the Democrats and Republicans when it comes to the Supreme Court justice and if there's anybody on this earth we can say is a virulent partisan did Sheldon Whitehouse\nAnd as Bob ... points out the other day if you're going to sit there and talk about uh in in in in a an offer of people who post complaints media contacts you go to reporters\nUm you're you're I Would say that you are in my mind back to what I think your your motivations can be called into question and all sorts of fashion the

some of these right you'd look at all of them did you look at all of them know when I saw the first so it's kind of like to see what's interesting is that says here that this is a multiple choice test this was a multiple choice you know\nSo but that doesn't mean that people can I think you know I I'd be shocked if there's one you don't know most of them are pretty I thought it was pretty easy he thought it was easy ones that are so some of them\nAre ... are you going to give me a bunch of the un [laughter]\nSome of them are contextual too\nYou know where you live so like you know what your

they get their two year associates degree they might go you know what I Want to keep this thing going and they they end up at your campus\nThink that's actually highly likely we have very robust transfer pathways and we're working to make them even more comprehensive and end user friendly so that students have seamless transitions between their education at ... and continuing their education at the universe\nRhode Island or in a whole host of majors and we're working very carefully and care and closely or with the leadership and and and faculty it's easier to make that a reality in a better reality for for Rhode islanders were beginning cc arrived but want to pursue a four year degree\nAnd yes we're we're also supportive of of Rhode Island promise I think uh the early returns SEC awry indicate that the program has great potential to improve um\nThe throughput of students that completion rates of students and the transfer rates of students into our institution and the Rhode Island college uh we think that uh it's a another good investment one of the ways we look at it at the University of Rhode Island as it is a as recently as about a\nYear two thousand or so the state of Rhode Island provided to the University of Rhode Island more than Seventy percent\nOf the funding to educate the student uh Rhode Island student at our university today Rhode Island provides the University of Rhode Island about thirty three percent of what it costs to educate or whether it's one of the worst in the country it is one of the worst in the country and\nI I've been saying since I arrived here in the state in two thousand nine Rhode Island needs to develop strategies to systematically invest more resources into higher education because we know that there's a tremendous invest return on investment for those resources and funding\nFor Rhode Island public higher education um is amongst the poorest of the nation\n[noise] All right we're overdue for break our guest this week Dr

R. I. N. Rhode Island college but I'm going to shift gears here now to another money topic and that is student debt\nAnd Rhode Island it doesn't matter which study you look at Rhode Island has some of the highest student debt in the country I think I uh we did a report on it a while back and we were third of the nation so that was a couple of years ago\nBut that is for students to graduate from a Rhode Island college how much how much debt they have a ... ... that's right and and actually I have a note here and while private schools nudge that number up for sure I Want to speak specifically at you arrive the average debt there is a little over thirty three thousand dollars\nA widow Seventy six percent of students graduating with debt forty percent with private loans that was the higher number that that that sort of surprised me\nI I Know it's a big question but how do you help change this alarming trend of him in\nDebt it's a very profoundly important question to him and it's been coming for decades you look back at the history of funding particularly for public higher education in ... in America it has been on a and a two decade at least downward spiral\nAnd it goes back to something an hour point I made earlier it once was the time when public institutions like the University of Rhode Island\nReceived the majority of their funding to educate undergraduate in particular a from the people at the state and that was true in practically every state in the nation that's not true anymore\nCosts for our have strange state budget costs for health care costs for a incarceration costs for public safety costs for Medicaid and ... and those kinds of of\nDifficult large programs that now devour so much of the state budgets have grown [noise] ah the percentage of the state budget devoted to higher education in particular has declined I Know you're not the speaker of the house but every state faces those bubbles absolutely every state station faces those problems it it's a it's a national issue\nAnd it reflects both the strengths and weakness of the American higher education system in the sense that rather than a bar with a model used by much of a world\nWhere funding for public higher education flows from the federal government into into the institutions\nIn the United states is done on a state by state basis and so it depends on the economic fortunes of fifty individual states in part as well as the national economy just how much money uh state governments have to devote to higher education\nSo as funding for public higher education from those sources have declined uh institutions have had to\nFace the uh the costs of offering those that education to undergraduates by raising the cost to the students themselves and that's been another decades long trend has been the increase over time of tuition to attend public institutions and\nUnfortunately with the current economic climate that we see we don't see a lot of um new changes that Rhode Island has done an excellent job of re investing in public higher education as you may remember in the beginning of the the last great recession\nUm stay Rhode Island over about a twenty four month period took\nTwenty five million dollars out of the your eye budget we still don't have all that back in twenty Nineteen so more than a decade later\nWe have less money now from the state to support undergraduate education at the University of Rhode Island and all the other essential things that we do then we had in two thousand and seven and you have a decade worth of inflation and other kinds of costs built on top of that so that's what ... what do you do\nDon't so I think I think a doctor to lease absolutely right we have to look at how we finance higher education in the state but also I think colleges are having to become much more innovative\nAnd much more thoughtful about how they use their existing resources and hadn't keep college expenses down a couple of examples that Rhode Island college you know this year were twelve hundred students will see open source tipped textbooks completely free textbooks\nToday in America I think textbooks costs college students about nine hundred dollars a year or we've started an open source textbook program where twelve hundred students this fall will\nReinvented and there's actually a new group trying to bring together a number of the companies that are surviving and thriving in textiles to look forward for the industry and when I talk a bit about how that's going but first up we're going to talk a little about the business of sports and these are always interesting conversation that I'm joined today\nBy Bob Driscoll a Bob is the athletics director Providence College since two thousand one right and that's going to get a couple of years on your belt over there\nAnd also an associate vice president at the college ... thanks for being nice the earth and obviously I think everyone lives around has heard of the friars probably at some point in their lives but can you get people may not know you watch over all the athletics not just basketball and the stuff that they get some network attention\n... tell me about the full scope of what you're watching over as athletic director\nWell we have three hundred fifty student athletes which represents ten percent of the students at Providence College were in the Big East which is arguably the best basketball conference nation and we play in hockey as well\nWhich is one of the top and the nation and and we have a clearly defined vision we want to be the most respected program the nation where he graduated all of our student athletes and and complete the chapter chips and so it's a\nIt's an important role we use sports to teach the core values of hard work dedication and commitment suddenly go out when the graduate to be successful people I'm In the world so it's a it's a great opportunity to really enjoy being around young people in us all compete\nPC synonymous with especially basketball or hockey or they've got a pretty good run last year ...\n[noise] well we're the only school in the country that's been to five and say basketball terms are all five and say hockey tournaments around if you look at our great coach right Tracy he's been at twenty five and say tournaments their own cross country in a school for thirty eight hundred and you're competing against the big time school that's that's pretty impressive\nThat must be a just ... adult level to excitement to a program to have that kind of success you know and and ... to be able to sustain over 'cause you're you're turning over a all the students every every fifth year it was a close to it\nYeah well it's difficult because you have to relocate but success breeds success because we've got this great brand now thanks to Fox ... every one of our games on national television so you have millions of eyeballs on these games and problems in the small school in the country competing at the highest level so it's a really unique\nProgram or not like a Michigan or a Notre Dame or a University of California we're a small school but competing at the best at the um athletic and academic areas\nBut when you took over a PC athletics and two thousand one you know every time you read a story sort of history the last couple of decades at the college\nHere did not necessarily have the financial and fundraising base that that people who wanted athletics and he's trying to be the need and that was a clear mission to you is to build that up and you you've had some success there how big a challenge has that been and kind of why was it so important when you came in\nWas about changing the culture we wanted to great lengths in the country with the biggies but we hadn't really invested in it was kinda we kinda took it for granted at the University of California big part of my job was an rolling people to support us\nIn a small schools like Providence College which is a tuition driven institution can't afford to put them\nThe multi millions of dollars into the athletic program that's required so when I first came here I basically went to the community and said you love big time athletics we want to be champions this is fryer town this is Providence Rhode Island we need your help\nSo it's about relationship building and then as we started with baby steps and building complex isn't having some success\nPeople bought and now you look at where we are right now we've raised I'm a over a hundred million dollars to build all of these brand new facilities which is nice as the country but a lot of the support comes from season ticket holders and donors in life so we've been really blessed but you have to return on investment veterans successful\nHow much or more of a challenge I think it is as a as a major program without football you read it other places that football can be such a revenue driver for the athletics department they can also help to you know the rising tide lifts all boats and held I asked about health and the other ones you have to do it without football\nWell I think it's an advantage I was at the University of California we had football and I took Ninety percent of our resources in time I think the fact that the Big East is one to the free national championship said over and sixty percent of bending the NCAA tournament if you basketball center I'm not dealing with a hundred and Fifteen student athletes in football that cost\nThirty million dollars around and there are very few programs in the country that actually make money on football if you look at anything out of the power five conference they're losing millions of dollars so it's not a a return on investment if you were involved in football unless you're one of those five\nPart of it on it maybe that those big football programs necessarily going to mean to a huge profit effectively for the rest of the program\nOr the big ones like Alabama yeah are you in Miami deal you're not talking about the top twenty Notre Dame but once you get beyond that I think if you look at their ledger she most of them probably end up losing money\nYou're talking about renovations little they're one of the biggest project in the new new Wayne fryer development center name for a man who is a real estate guy from Boston Roman very good to be seen recently is Kevin Matteson round a good piece in the journal about highlights the new facility even has its own barbershop tell us a little about what's special about this place why excited about it\nWhere were the last one of the big issues to do it so we had an advantage we traveled to every school in the Big East and took all their big ideas with Olympic Training site and and took some of those most of the universe Oregon\nBut we had to build something that was a unique niche for us and a lot of our young men or men of color African American men and believe it or not as difficult to find a good spot to get your hair cut so we thought how cool would that be to have a a little barber shop in their\nUm we have some really cool high performance we had the cryogenic machine which I don't know if you've ever heard of it but it's liquid nitrogen and you went up for two minutes\nIt reduces your body temperature so it's like sitting in a ice bath for\nAbout an hour I don't know if you've ever sent an eye for an hour but it's not a pleasant out this one and two minutes you can flash all your lactic acid out we have meditative rooms we have orthopedic rooms we have nutritional is it's a pretty cool spots of the idea behind his recruit the best student athletes\nGive them the best support structures can graduate and if you want to play an NBA we're going to try to help to get there so\nI'm overall the investment in facilities uh remains in its most recent one but there are other big projects right that of an important under since he took over\nWell we're renovated or built brand new facilities for every single one of our student athletes we won the national championship five years ago and two years before we want it we built a brand new renovated um Schneider Arena so\nI tell people all the time you have one chance to make a first impression and when a young man or woman comes in and they see that and you have a beautiful campus in first class facilities that's a differentiate or for you compared to your competition and then if you show that you can compete for big Easter national championship\nYou know you can still a lot of the big time student athletes away from the high ... high profile schools so\nAnd do that in Britain niceness for us so\nWe're going to take a break and come back we're going to talk more with Bob Driscoll about what's going on at

save\nSo um it's no secret that the industry suffered a really sharp decline in the early twentieth century we're talking a long time ago now and this really happened but\nThere was a big decline that said the industry never disappeared and there are companies or that kept continue textiles to this day is we're going to talk about how much textile manufacturing remains in Rhode Island today and as we're talking twenty eight and\nWhether it's still Seventy textile companies here in Rhode Island to and that represents twenty five hundred jobs so it's a it's a it's a big industry still here in Rhode Island um and um yes we've gone through a lot of trials and tribulations but the textile companies that have survived the massive off shoring in the sixties and seventies\nAnd have gotten through the great recession are\nLeaning mean companies and they're far more involved in advance textiles than most people realize\nWell and I'm going to go to the show and tell them that can be can give people example so we have a shot and they know they're gonna take it in a second and brought a second guess I'll say his name I didn't have they nana can that we have here on set their people are taking a look at a ... right now I can see 'em on the screen there what are we looking at in and what have you have to ... well\nWell David the dummy but and he's smart enough to know that when he I'm a ways into a riot he has to wear a proper tactical gear so uh this is the day was made by a John Kato with um Arizona grants Rhode Island\nAnd the students actually designed for combat training to protect against full force blows including knives for example it's currently being used by the military in the middle east and the textile for the uniform is woven with stainless steel threat that's what makes it cut resistant\nIt's also anti microbial and fire resistant\nOr the mess lining ... fabric to breed um he was a total of eight kinds of textile\nAnd a parts from American courting Web England socket some ah some textile fabrics from northeast knitting and took it as well um so this is a type of apparel that Rhode Island textile companies are manufacturing not\nTeacher heck of a T shirts scarves people think of that with out this is textiles to what we're looking on screen right there correct so I'm Talking about what you mentioned a few there what are some of the other a significant textile companies around making these days that have kept on six are there are number of them\nAre too many to mention but companies like the cooler group a Concordia fiber hope global Kenyan industries a lot of them had been here for over a hundred years and they're still strong still thriving\nAnd your company transect is of course a textile makers to tell us about your own company what you guys that we manufacture commercial goods\nSo the products we make our not advanced a business model is advanced that we manufacture things like land you're a wristband had bands we uh do strapping for shopping carts\nBut the thing about trans sections of the business models and Vance so are we do things were very short customized production runs very fast quick turnaround time and high quality product\nI'll tell you can't really a lenient for example that sounds like just the kind of thing that so many companies lost to China where they could compete so cheap how especially than for your company how have you continued to make a lenient in Rhode Island that works financially when there's so much competition from offshore we compete\nDirectly every day with China and the reason we're able to beat them is we focus on those three principles fewer faster finer again few remaining shorter more customized production runs faster twenty four hour forty dollar return and a foreigner good quality products trying to compete with that\nI'm also curious just before we go on to the textile innovation network the terrorists you know we talk about the nine right now we're talking in a in October twenty Eighteen what how has the tariffs discussion or the tests that are commonplace impact in textiles around if at all well most of the textile companies in Rhode Island are prime\nUs manufacturers so uh the terrorists in general are can be good for us manufacturing companies I Would like to see it more on end products as opposed to inputs sometimes if the terrorists are\nInput parts that's not as effective for Rhode Island textile manufacturer for examples rather than the one in products\nDo you think that's a different way and do you think though could benefit manufacture saying that you know let's talk about the textile innovation network you're pregnant and his group it's been formed and help the industry tells us how did that come about what the goal of having the network\nOr we came about a due to the uh uh the push of Senator Sheldon Whitehouse who was very instrumental in getting started he actually\nRally I'd be pushy [laughter] rally the\nTextile company's together back in late fall of twenty sixteen and he he kind of pushed us say you know textiles are important to Rhode Island let's get an industry cluster together to make sure that we keep textile manufacturing in Rhode Island so about three months later we had our first organizational meeting\nWe received funding from the department of labor and training and from the Congress corporation\nAbout a year ago and we just had artificial wants a last Monday it's like no one's talking\nSo what are you hoping to you know you can get together you can talk you can discuss issues what what's your grand are planned for what having an industry group and maybe you know why the center of thought this could be helpful as well for the textile\nIndustry heated success for us to is not only working with fellow textile companies we are collaborating with you or I were collaborating with the ... the\nUh we're collaborating with the Chevy center at Bryant so these ... by collaborating with universities uh it presents a number of great aren't the opportunities and we're also working with polaris I mean the the manufacturing extension partnership\nA we've had a great encounter we've had him on the Christian yeah we had a great relationship with the uh the wrong road island Manufacturers Association they Jennifer you solve with our guest is so we're we're we're we're all about collaboration or as opposed to simply just the textile company's trying to come together\nSo any success so far I Know you just had the official wants but you have been working for a while on this what what do you feel good about\nWell and feeling really got about a website I mean if you go to W. W. dot ... dot org and to our Web ... and re R. I. T. I. and done or take a look at our website I particularly as folks out there and the audience to take a look at the videos we have videos of three textile workers\nAnd if you listen to what they have to say I I think folks will realize that are textile companies here in Rhode Island and not just creating jobs were created careers\nUm textile hourly and non supervisory textile workers make one hundred and thirty six percent more on average than people who work in a retail store for example so they're great textile jobs out there great textile careers out there for young folks who are interested\n[noise] have you been able to find the workforce you need to continue that you know I hear from many factors often come out on a show that when these industry for much larger and around you everywhere you turn there was a worker with some experience and now and it's a narrow group of companies that can be harder to find people who are prepared to come in\nYou know that that's a great question Ted and uh you know one that ... when we surveyed I textile companies one of the first things that they mentioned to us as you know how do we closest skills get so in our conversations we came up with an idea that Sheldon Whitehouse actually has taken to in order to create national legislation for job training program\nThat would pay a company to use a retiree to train their replacement\nSo it's a much more rifle shot approach to training than you typically say a ... with John training programs most job training programs they're very general in terms of general skills is very rifle shot only about thirty seconds left what do you think the biggest opportunity right now for the industry\nMakes opportunity for us is to continue to go down the path of a partnering with our colleges and universities creating great new products ah I've got another example of that than I can but I can show you folks on that later but uh\nFor us it's about advanced textile manufacturing again not T shirts and by partnering with the colleges and universities we think we can do that\nAll right we'll have you back on for that next to Michael youngest president or Ireland textile innovation network and CEO of ... where the parents that translates and Cranston road Iran than Rhode Island All right so we've got a lot of companies are still being ... would be proud\nWe'll catch this episode in every episode executive suite on WPRI dot com will see back here next week [noise]\n\nAndres said the the leaders you'll elect make decisions that affect your\nYour job your health care much for your voice counts so make your account\nGet voted election day this is talk now you know seven at them and you have six thirty WPRI\nSponsored by Marshall building and remodeling when it comes to choosing a company for you a new roofing signing our window someone or by a landslide Marshall building in remodeling going all the New England\nW.
