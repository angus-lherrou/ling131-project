comes in with some things match\nUp wise that can give the New England patriots problems one they do have some corners who can cover yeah they're young and Brady and I think that we'll check will\nFind a way to take advantage of some of the some of the youth but I mean that your your Alexander played great I fought against the LA Rams and that somebody that you got to deal with you know claim Matthews he might be older but he's a witch and he can get to the quarterback\nAnd then as we mentioned there is Aaron Rodgers and the dangerous thing about Aaron Rodgers is that\nHe is still like young Brady in that he'll spread the ball around to everybody and anybody and you got to deal with Jimmy Graham and\nI sold ... been bowling got those nobody little fingers to type out on Twitter today or a comparison of drunk and Jimmy Graham is the tight end spot and the numbers are eerily similar really\nOh yeah in fact I don't know if I even follow of on so that might take me or it might take me a a second here too yeah I don't so give me give me a moment\nA grand probably was able to compile some serious numbers not to say that he is a quote unquote compiler but his time in New Orleans you would think ah did him very well statistically\nOkay the difference between the two is a ... team games so Jimmy Graham and nine seasons\nOne hundred and twenty eight games five hundred eighty four receptions seven thousand one hundred and Seventy yards and Seventy touchdowns pretty good yeah Ron ... nine seasons in a hundred nine games so basically one less season\nFive hundred and eighty three yards seven or five hundred and eighty three receptions excuse me seven thousand six hundred twenty seven yards in Seventy seven touchdowns so groggy has more yards on less catches and more touchdowns\nIn Eighteen Nineteen Nineteen less\nGames and not to mention a to my knowledge only one of them can actually block worth a damn well and that's that's the thing Jimmy Graham is an assertive in terms of that he can't block but he is much closer to that\nThan he is too are good at four and a way now and root for instance or no questions only out there to block yeah and so while the numbers are similar more games more catches less yards less touchdowns\nJimmy Graham has been a glorified wide receiver his whole career or coming up this weekend on New England nation I I Do a little bit of a drunk breakdown because I wouldn't watch some of it today and I can't figure out whether Bronx is\nPacing himself meaning there sometimes reason second gear knowing that he can crank it up the fifth year or is this guy kind of playing through injuries and that's why there are times where it looks like he's got ... out there\nBut if you go back and I'm going to I'm going to break this down and getting a New England nation this weekend on Fox Providence and if you look at what wrong did on the play with Cornell Patterson where he had that big run to the right side Jimmy Graham ain't doing that\nBlocking first level and then getting up to the second level then Jimmy grim and to me Jimmy Graham is the guy who can challenge the hey\nI'm a wide receiver or if they were going to put the franchise tag on it that was in the desert I yeah I\nThink he wanted to and I know Aaron Hernandez at one point talked about it oh it was definitely\nGraham and I forget who is an agent was or is but at the time when I Do believe it was the saints we're looking at extending or franchising Jimmy Graham and uh there was all about you know the people like the ... of the world and the people who would get the sort of information our saying how\nAre they were looking to attack the statute that are only allow tight end to be paid by tightened 'cause it was all about the franchise and in that situation you have the top five guys it's still an average of the top five guys right uh yeah it serves that so\nThe average at the top five titans I mean all you have to do is play fantasy or daily fantasy to know that after about four dudes it is a cliff\nAnd then balls off and so you're an average those top by salaries good luck to you the point being\nThe top five average wide receivers which is what Graham wanted to be included in at the time makes a hell of a lot more than the top five average\nTitle yeah and I know that there was the whole well Jimmy ... in the swat fifty some odd percent\nYeah no that's all the number that were around out there you go to Scott Boris like a binder I'm sure that they use for those negotiations and a failed miserably\nYeah Yup yup very much failed miserably there and uh I I just think that when you think of the traditional tight and you think Rob Gronkowski\nIf you want to go new age hybrid tight and then that is was Jimmy gram but nevertheless he's six foot six I mean he's in terms of size dealing\nWith him and wrong is very difficult and very similar by the way well have you ever\nWatch scratch or had your team I Know you don't have a team but the royal you know and the royalty that you have you ever gone up against a Jimmy ... team and you were worried about stopping Jimmy Graham because not for me and again very talented player\nIf you want to make the case that he is the second best tight end and the NFL I won't are not going to argue with you probably all too much maybe people take Travis Kelsey Greg Olson whatever\nBeauty is in the eye of the beholder there but I think we can all agree\n... is the best but like all the teams that he has played on\nAnd maybe this isn't necessarily fair to him but it's always been the quarterbacks that I was much more afraid of and he was a dangerous part of the offenses he was in but he was surrounded by other dangerous play makers whereas groggy again not to sell guys like Adelman and stuff like that short but people are actively\nGame planning to stop groggy and maybe this is the best way to put it I don't think people are actively game planning to stop Jimmy Graham and I don't think they have been for quite some time\nWell I think it's I think it's twofold Jimmy Graham doesn't play the physicality the way Bronx\nDoes and I also think the Jimmy Graham came along at a point in that run in New Orleans and I just brought up the numbers here yeah [noise]\nUh in twenty eleven now that's a long time ago now in twenty eleven a hundred and forty nine targets he had over Thirteen hundred yard yeah into thousand twelve it was a hundred and thirty five target some of the books you know the catch some folks you know the\nTarget right because it doesn't matter I mean he caught enough of them but it's how often was lighting made a major part of the often\nVery yep and one thirty five and two thousand twelve nine hundred and eighty two yards in two thousand Thirteen\nOr it was a hundred and forty four targets and he had over twelve hundred yards and he has not a thousand yards since and I think unfortunately what happened for Jimmy Graham is he went to a place in Seattle that he didn't fit and they didn't know how to use them\nI mean he now again last year Jimmy Graham he had fifty seven catches on Ninety eight targets ah\nThree years prior and if you're not out right now that's like three years prior and two thousand fourteen he had eighty five catches on a hundred and twenty four targets and I think the difference too between Graham and wrong is\nIn play action you don't bite on any fixed the get Jimmy Graham open 'cause he doesn't block right and part of the reason the drunk and get those truckers\nIs because he can just jab step towards a down lime and then get into route excuse me get a free release and breeding putting it on him in stride and wrong is able to go do his thing\nYeah and and one of those things Gretchen I don't have Bronx target number is necessarily in front of me I can bring them up where it's not really important because I think is going to fit right into the narrative anyway or compare maybe the targets of a guy like ... Jones but to the Jimmy grand point\nThose target numbers are so large that that kind of leads to what I was talking about because if teams were really afraid of Jimmy Graham back then in terms of afraid of him controlling the game Drew Brees wouldn't have been able to throw it to them a hundred and forty four times because of all the double teams all the coverage being rolled his way\nThey would have used them much more as a ... and in the past and game and those target numbers again\nIt sounds almost like on dumping on Jimmy ... he's very talented player worth the money is getting it sat around and he's had a very fine career but in comparing him drunk\nLike again if you were able to do you think groggy gonna get targeted a hundred and forty four times you know I and the patrons don't have any wide receivers usually I mean more or less in terms of that guy that's true here to New Orleans I kept their only one thing got out of the woodwork whether it's Michael Thomas now or\nOr why might mark east coast and like they bring in guys are always reload and down there and and Drew Brees or your finger he had to throw the ball to grandma hundred and forty four times\nIt was it ... it was he wanted to and could why Cody because seems just weren't all that afraid of Jimmy Graham like they are ... side of rock rock cat scanned\nIn terms of targets to the point rich or the the lowest of the triple digit number of years of targets for Jimmy grandma's one twenty four ... the most wrong kids had in his career is one thirty one and that was the two thousand fourteen season\nI like I look at least that you I had a reason why you were taking two guys on the same\n... yeah exactly I mean I'm sort of like backing it a little bit and you know it's sort of like if you've\nGot a a bad on the on the the the don't come\nLine and then yeah batting crap sure there are ways to be able to back but anyway we will get the oil that later on and folks just around the
