and I noticed the Yankee nation is pretty silent today\nOr the you know smattering\nOf Yankee fans that we would have jumping on this show we have not heard from even at the beginning of the series nor do I expect to hear from them\nUm you know if we didn't have such a busy seven o'clock hour which got rambling and fill us this Nevin Roberts of the fan in New York\nMaybe on that ride home from politics in a pint we'd be able to squeeze in our friend Dan York and I said the day and that\nYou that that had been wouldn't be representing his time meaning New York Yankee fans who now have realized his team's been built are wrong they don't have enough starting pitching they don't have guys that are Koch and everybody had John Carlos that we'll get to all that with Evan Roberts because\nOn this side of the ledger were getting ready for an American league championship series and look this for me is among the few times that I agree with someone that I loathed the in the Boston sports media\nBut there's a line from a certain gentleman who says if you make it to your final four you've had a good year\nAnd that's where I'm at with the red Sox right now I Hope they win the series against the Astros but I admit this coin flip from me\nAnd we'll get to that in the in the coming days but here's what I Want to ask you one eight hundred three two one WPRI oh for three eight nine seven seven six and always on social media Facebook dot com slash the real grass that takes you sort of Gresham Facebook page and of course on\nTwitter at the real brash and you get rich and rich nation this series had no rivalry feel to it whatsoever\nNow maybe just maybe I have been infected\nWith rivalries uh the feel of the rivalry past\nLet's say I tried to do with like a Christmas the reference or something like that you had to figure it out on the fly\nOut to a different Tiny Tim now being referenced and back to back I liked\nThat that's good like but this had no thanks\nYou know what it was from my anger route from my end because I have a lot of friends having gone to school in New York I have a lot of friends that are in New York Yankee fans and uh I Would say this one of my life more of my friends are probably New York Yankee\nFans in Boston Red Sox fans and the impression I got from both fan bases was both fan bases but there was a good chance that their team was going to lose which is why I think a lot of us both on both sides of the fence\nWere prevented from going all in because from the red Sox fan standpoint\nYou know that bullpen is hot fire and basically a couple of cans of gasoline waiting for a man and the Yankees fans are the Yankee fans they knew their flaws as well so I think in years past we are both teams were loaded for bear and expecting a championship I Know the red Sox had a hundred and eight wins in the regular season but as we've documented here throughout the entire year that are\nThere were notable weak spots and his team are weak spots that tend to come back and bite teams in the post season\nSo I think a lot of the lack of drama or lack of rivalry talk in the series had to do with\nYou know just neither fan base was really all that confident and and I guess a better way to put it was they wouldn't have been surprised had their team last\nHere's the reason why I asked\nThe question ... ... and I do not dismiss your thought process because I Do think for a portion of people that definitely apply here if I could always speak to my own experience but even with that in the past if you're sixteen one beat down\nThere would've been a visceral reaction from Yankee fans that was not there yesterday absolutely and that's where it made me realize this truly is a rivalry in name but no longer and passion\nWe don't let people calling up today at one eight hundred three two one WPRI oh from the red Sox and they're screaming you know the old bugs bunny ... firecrackers this boom bah Red Sox Red Sox rah rah rah [noise]\nSpanish version of that thank you a hug money there I've tried to dang I couldn't figure out ... now you couldn't move guys I don't think it's hugs that's for insect Cheetos I don't know\nBut there was no broader role visceral reaction to this series and that's what makes me think\nThat the robbery isn't dead anytime you put New York versus Boston on the march ... there will always be a reaction and there will be a significant part of a sporting society now will gravitate towards that\nEven last night when it was over you know they're not that I Need a rioting and Red Sox fans get knocked out on the street I say that\nBut even there wasn't\nThe massive brewing when it was over with you know whenever they came back and run them up and said he was out\nThat people were like up just turn around and\nLeft it wasn't it wasn't let's fill beers that those guys it wasn't let's all tell them to go wears off it wasn't let's stand around and try to take them to finger or anything like that stuff and it was over with fans just kind of laughed and got on the two are the three or four train and\nWent home and that was it was over and they wait for next year in Yankee land\nI got to admit it was kind of disappointing like even on Twitter last night routes I Know about you I was trolling around on Twitter last night after the game and\nI didn't see widespread panic I didn't see oh my God how could this happen it's more Aaron Aaron the boom is a boomer and oh my God I Can't believe we have nine more years of the strike out machine known as John Carlos then\nYeah a lot of overreaction as you would see but now I'm with you in terms of its not two thousand four anymore and that's pretty clear after last night's game if it wasn't clear already\nAh the rivalry you're right it's still alive and well but\nI think the bar has been set so high for this rivalry that unless both teams are completely stocked with high end players both in the rotation and then they're starting line up then the hype just isn't going to be there it's just the bar has been set so high and justifiably so it's nobody's fault of the bars that high\nBut the rivalry was so good especially in the early to thousands there the bars but so then sets so high for this a generation of fans\nThat it's going to take something like that we're both teams are clicking on all cylinders and loaded for bear in order for this rivalry to I reached that level and\nYeah I'm with the roots are really and this is what you get from having not one but two generations almost after\nTwo thousand four of fans and the way they react and to your point rich the expectations of oh they're both going to be loaded well let's just get into the American league championship series game seven and then we can really have some skin in the game Sox fans\nIs this validation for what they've done browse ski did and what this organization didn't the off season and bring in our score one eight hundred\nIf you're one W.
