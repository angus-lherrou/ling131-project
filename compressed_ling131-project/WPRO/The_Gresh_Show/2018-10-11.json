I'd love to see him do it uh I think he's tried hard\nTo ... to a um changes immature he certainly has been a better guy with a uh owning up to things with the media this year\nI'm even after game too and so yeah maybe the story isn't fully written yet wouldn't that be something if he goes out and gives them you know six or even seven quality innings game to\nSign up for it and be no question about it and I don't want to see the amount of ... men quite honestly Bob like if you can't start he would scare the hell out of me even more even though he did do\nYou fear is he right\nThough I knew there was a track record their\nRight but it was also losing ... you know and and they were they were down in the bullpen was pretty ... at that point in time Bob your thoughts on cruise sale I Know they really let you found a way to get him to the end of the season ah I thought that was pretty gritty stuff coming in last night\nOne inning they look great um you know it looked like for sale and uh [laughter] so let's see um my thoughts are that it's it's a shame that but you know my thoughts are this\nWho surprised that he has a problem physically given the violent nature of his motion didn't we always wonder it's just like let's say ... didn't you didn't we know when he was winning size that sooner or later trouble would grew\nBecause of the bio went and met in a ... and of course his case he was five feet eleven whereas as sales sixty seven but but uh the violent motions thing did worry I was always worried people um and and I I don't know what what we can we do we expect how many innings we can expect to be any\n[laughter] I was present no I wasn't I was watching on TV I like a foot deep it's one of us extraordinary games no baseball this year when he struck out twelve guys will sixty eight pitch us back in August\nThat I mean usually if you tell me somebody you struck out twelve guys you figure the minimum ... would be Ninety five to a hundred right and and yet he did it on nice sixty eight which is why most amazing feat some baseball this year and then one of the deal the next day for the second time this year and you know it it it would just have to live with the fact that these days fragile\nUh and and he's paying the price that they would with this body build and the way it goes but for baseball uh this is the price he has to you know this is the compromises made you know to the pitch at its peak the way he can pitch a um but he can be when when the boy healthy we know we've seen it a as good as a pitcher in baseball\nWe blame with house money when it comes to need to hold the or the expectations dawn or can this guy give the red Sox another ...\nWhen he could um you know is this is like the he's given us\nSome really memorable you know his first two games when he threw the fifteenth shutout innings and\nUh the twins and Yankees that we know what's in there and and they had the formula to beat the Yankees he had a he has to high gas and the and and and the variety of stuff there\nAnd and I don't know how that matches up specifically against the the Astros ... more\nQuality hitters I think all around hitters than the Yankees had a you know I I think so we'll see but uh you know you kind of feel good but you know the fact is that the other the other guy's got a games want it to the going up to terrific pictures\nAnd and the best game has been pitching the post season so far this year was pitch by coal up for the Astros so um they they know they they're to me a favor\nAnybody Red Sox fan who goes into this thinking the other favorites just because they got the whole field a sober up no no the Astros should have entered this is the favorites and and to me are still the fate\nYeah and it's one of those deals Bob we're ... and the red\nSox are the defending James we'd say All right you got to beat them and that's the position that they were in on this side\nThey got to find a way to beat him obviously you know that's the defending world champs when I tell you Bob I don't know about you but by the Houston had last year just in terms of the way they're interacting with each other all the way that were managed the way they played the game\nI kinda think there's a little bit of that with this Red Sox theme this\nYear I like er there's lot there's a lot about the team and one of the things I thought it was very really fun to contemplate about the Yankee series was that the stars weren't the focal point of bats had a series right\nA better teddy had that big free one double and and ... out a home run but\nCertainly they weren't the story what we're thinking about we're thinking about the contributions made from the from the the uh uh supporting cast guys were talking about Sandy Leone saved their life blocking that play in that in that game or talking about ...

L. network responsibilities or whatnot so I talk to my little while ago and I gotta tell ya I I think from a football breakdown standpoint it's probably the best interview we've done\nMaybe next and when we talk to Darren ... a former ah I mean an NFL Special teams coach not just because he's my former teammate but because he brought but white stuff\nThat as fans you would never think of\nAnd I consider myself pretty educated football person but there was some stuff that ... is set in the interview when we talked to him last year about special teams in the ... and the changes they made me think uh Mike may Iraq has got some great breakdown of the patriots coming up that is a at six thirty five right around there\nTonight here on the grass show on WNPR oh so\nIt is looking like out in Kansas City that uh one of the aisle\nThat line backer pass Russia's Justin Houston may not play this week out of practice again and this would be a big huge development\nIf their star safety Arab Barre can't go very has had some issues injury wise this week uh I don't think you practice today or if I got that correct you know he didn't practice today that there you go if he can't play\nThat's a guy who could be huge in the run game aired Barry is first of all he's an amazing story for those who don't know berries the guy who beat cancer\nHe came back to play at an old pro level in the NFL which I mean deployed an old pro level healthy is one thing to be cancer and then come back and do it again or is just amazing to me\nBut as a strong safety he's a guy who can play to run and quite honestly you know I've talked a lot\nAbout the safety position now the patriots have started you give ... berry to build bell a check\nYou will see the power of how good the free safety look can be I remember a couple of years ago when Marty Baron was coming out of Alabama I Know for a fact I talked to people they wanted to try to get Marty Baron because if you give ballot check that\nHybrid safety linebacker that's the piece he's been missing in the defense for a long time and they still figured out how to piece it together\nBut in and do a little more break down to the Kansas City\nChiefs there's a couple of things that has jumped out at me and one of them is the confidence with which\nThe quarterback ... homes is playing with not a reason I bring this up is because\nThere have been very few teams who have been able to take away quote unquote the easy fro for ... more homes yes he can press it down the field but if you really watch the kids the chiefs play off ...\nThere are a lot like the patriots in that they want the ball to come out of the quarterbacks hand quick now brainy is great at the whole pre snap read and sort of knowing how to get to his second read quickly\nAnd this is where ... homes could get ballot check\nYou take away in the first three for ... homes and it takes\nHim that extra half second to get to the second read and then you've got people who can jump those kinds of routes I think what you're going to see how the patriots defense and the more I watch some or Jacksonville did and what other teams have done\nThey tried to take away the first throw\nFor or the first option for ... homes and coming up on a New England nation over the weekend and you'll see it on Sunday on WPRI on Fox Providence there's a play that I found from the Jacksonville game\nWhere it was first and goal and I want to say they were on maybe the six or seven yard line\n[noise] and Jacksonville dropped a defensive\nTackle and took away the first throw from homes and you know what he did in the pocket he pulled down he tried to look he felt pressure sprint around and got sacked for about a nine yards loss\nThat and running the ball or going to be true of the keys to beating the Kansas City chiefs and but one thing Bill Belichick has always been good at is what do they always say oh he could use as young quarterbacks\nMaybe what he does is he test them he\nHe takes away the first row\nNow the great ones or the guys who were going to become legends have the ability to say I took it away I'm going to go back side and put it on my outside receiver or I'm going to ... to the tide in or I'll flip it sort of running back\nThere have been a few of those\nAh at times Russell Wilson at one point was pretty good first so taking away bam let me go to the check them a New England had issues I felt kind of fooling him at times but they were able to quote unquote full him\nFor the biggest play the game and Malcolm Butler's may you know Seventy million dollars off that interception in super\nBowl or they don't check is going to have something cooked up for ... Holmes the question is going to be ten more homes fight for it or is he just going to be\nLike a lot of these other young quarterbacks who are just going to you know they sound like goofy from a you know the Disney Hall and they just throw it right into it and you know well it's worth the genius once again because the quarterback doesn't have the ability to adapt\nI'm not going to sit here and tell you that this defense is so good that they're going to take away stuff from pat ... homes but what they're going to do is challenge him in a way that I don't know if he's been challenged before and we'll see how the kid reacts I'll tell you this he's operated with a lot of confidence\nAnd he can swing it there's no question\nAnd Kansas City also does a lot of what I call eye candy I mentioned this last night and I'm watching a little more of them\nMan those motions they do with ... what the patriots do with Cornell Patterson and if you really sad and broke it down and watch what they called jet motion so when you see\nA quarter Patterson lined up and he goes running by Tom Brady as fast as he can\nWeigh Danny I'm and do you use to do it made me think about it when that element in there and do A M and do what was that ... motion guy now it's a six foot three speed stir where if you lose him he can get down the field and Brady can put it on them and make some place\nBut they do a lot of that in Kansas City they give you a lot to look at you can't get fooled by the eye candy\nAnd that's something the patriots the feds have been yeah Mets the Mets\nBut you do a little mini by you have to sort of retool this the fence a little bit because of some of the injuries and what's going on out there like this would not have been a good match for John Bentley I'm kinda glad well I'm not quite he's hurt don't get me wrong\nBut the fact that he is in in this match up I think bodes well for the patriots because they're not going to try to put a square peg him around in a round hole biggest Kansas City can really run\nI got tickets to WWE Monday Night raw to give away at some point this hour my conversation with Mike may are coming up this hour about next I mentioned Julian Edelman he spoke today and the patriots locker room had a lot to say well here that next\nNo one is more plugged into\nThat more than we are your twenty Eighteen and like the central I talk on the last seven I Am six thirty WFDD our\nNew England [noise] from the WTO\nRode around like center looks like they're still working a player an accident Ninety five south than of six ten can echo traffic flow south down through the ... into downtown\nNorth than Ninety five is still mostly under the seat when it between thirty seven and state offices Ninety five West I'm still fairly sluggish though he's prominence\nHeavy but moving easier with the Washington Bridge to Ninety five one forty six south found [noise] bumper to bumper sticker on my nerves firing out all the way down to Ninety five south is update is sponsored by maximus the smart security lights at Costco\nAnd not even getting a.'s the video of all activity at your door from your smartphone that's what ... smart security license view plus much more talk live with visitors from anywhere better than a video doorbell and so easy to install get maximum security lights at your local Costco\nPlenty of regional right now traffic on Robin Murphy on WNPR oh\nThese big long hair weather's\nPlus flood watch it affects through tomorrow morning given to them with periods of rain low sixty three to ... followed by some sun breezy a cooler high sixty five most of the clear in Chile to part I lower forty three chili Saturday a free showers at Iowa fifty four with W bureaus excuse\nThe ... the weather ...

who will be calling that game on Westwood One you know him as an NFL\nDraft expert seen him on NFL dot com and I know he's got ties to those that Philly Philadelphia Eagles folks but let's not go nuts it's Mike may opt of West wouldn't want my Candy Crush here in Providence thank you for the time this evening\nHow are ya I'm doing great in the I'm looking forward to it to a game that I think could be one of the best games early in the seasons\nYeah Mike I look everybody here is excited for it because the chief said five and know we know that the patriots got off to a slow start let me just ask you out of the chute how is Kansas City gotten to this point at five and no because I Know they drafted pap homes last year\nYou were one of the ones who liked him a homes from what I read your thought maybe he would go later in the first round but I Know you know that at the time hey this allows the chiefs to continue what they've built Mike how they've gone about putting this group together for this seat\nYeah I mean you have to look at the head coach and Andy Reid has a very often says minded coach or the first thing he did when he got the Kansas City was was kind of a rebuild the office of line which he's done and there is solid often supplying at this point but what's amazing is the group of skilled position players\nHe's put together and you start with Tom Murray kill and Travis Kelsey why sneaker two of the most special often in some players in the entire National Football league and present different sets of challenges for each of them you know I'm not even including Sammy Watkins who's a former\nTop ten Beck and a heck of a football player so they're skilled position players were outstanding and I think the drafting of my home number of ten a year ago\nWas the best place he could've gone because a Andy Reid\nIs quarterback friendly puts his quarterbacking good positions and to they've got\nThat group of skilled position players that make anybody look good and Leslie he got the ... behind Alex Smith for a year and I I think that's really important Alex help them learn how to be professional what the study out of study and now you're looking at the ... what I think them in the rams\nFight for the two most explosive often says input for\nMike I Know what happened to homes looks like coming out of college you know what he looks like now tell me how he's gotten better as a football player over this last year plus\nTwo things number one consistency of mechanics\nNow the kids can make any role for many platform side on them over the top or he can he can floated he can drill it he might have the biggest arm and football but his mechanics especially footwork has gotten a lot better\nAnd I think more importantly Andy what has happened is that when he was in college every single play something big was going to have either really really good or really really bad and I think what Andy Reid has been able to do is throw situational football into him and he's basically eliminated\nAnd your your goal what what do you see all of a sudden it just comes out and and it's a comeback late or the ... and other times he knows it's got to get out early and um I I look at a quarterback and if you didn't know he was forty one and you were just comparing him to\nAll the other quarterbacks in the league he's obviously is still a thought five quarterback the NFL\nThat it's pretty amazing Mike ... call with Kevin Coogler on Westwood One on Sunday night where patriots fans have all day to hydrate my kid should be a hell of an

Holmes has played this year do people buy it do they think it's real do they think it's smoking mirrors what are you hearing from people across the league about the way my home just started this season\nWell I think most people expect that there is going to build a leveling off which you know I mean if we're being fair to the kid um\nI I don't think it's fair to expect him to keep this up [laughter] you know a ... because he's been spectacular or ... you know his first five games a fulltime starter a yeah but I I think that the encouraging thing you see a\nAre ... first of all the first few weeks the fees and like ... as much as we heard about him being the ... are you pretty much doing everything on schedule as first for the first few weeks\nKnow the the last couple of weeks has I think you know he's been challenged a different way\nYou sort of had a good knack for wanting to go off schedule and went to turn things into scramble plays and so\nThe challenge is going to get tougher for them you know there's tape on them now um there's tape of what the chiefs are doing a they use it now and as you know body of work builds up defenses are going to get a better better chance to diagnose what he does and be able to plant better again you know\nUh but I I I think what we've seen the first time we got to get those who've been around them\nOr would tell you that he's he's got what it takes to work through\nA you know the challenges that are at that every young quarterback faces ... that that that helped me staying in the next few weeks\nOr again grass I mean I\nI think it's fair to expect a little bit of a leveling off but most people I Know that know him feel like he's very very equipped to fight through that to\nHistory I think tells this bird than in a situation like this one extra time to prepare the off and says gotten at least healthy in terms of the bodies out on the field\nThis looks like it set up for a typical high Nobel check figured out a way to slow down a team that was on his team got right they go when the game is that what you're expecting on Sunday\nSo yeah um yeah I I I think the bill\nWill have a have a good point um if that's what you're asking [noise] there are a couple of things that go into my you know I I think they're one this is right around when the eagles level up\nLast year and they they came out of the ... last year to an incorporated a lot of the news spread stuff and\nI'm ... gonna seals for for about a month but this is right around when they leveled off they went to the box that is one piece of it the second piece of it is the bill's got ten days preferred to prepare here and so he's coming off of that Thursday night game so you had those two things together and\nUm I think bill is going to have a good plan if the question then becomes can Andy Reid find a way to turn this into it I mean the same way that the Peterson turn the super bowl on to attract me because I can just tell you\nKnow just from man demand standpoint this is a difficult matter for the patriots\nGot bigger longer people in the secondary and Kansas City is small and quick everywhere\nAnd so I think the challenge for any reason is the situation is it going to be so much countering what Bill does I think it's going to be finding a way to create situations where there's just turns to attract me Doug Peterson was able to do that in the super bowl we'll see if we can do it on\nOur prayer the Monday morning quarterback dot com here on the ground show on WNPR oh let's get to some other stuff around the league\nI Know you read about this in your a giant Monday breakdown where are we in terms of the pressure on Jerry Jones from maybe even the fans and people on the outside of the organization\nTo make a move on Jason Garrett because clearly I mean I don't know how many times you got to swim his head against the wall burn to realize that the structure he's put in place ain't working well\nI think this is a little

New York\nWhere are the one in four giants will take on the Philadelphia Eagles the eagles have not exactly followed up their Super Bowl win with a hot start however with the rain and the weather and all the issues it's very difficult game to handicap perch ah but apparently\nLate money is coming you know the gene men yeah lots of sharp money pouring in late on the giants here due to the weather and a lot of other factors as well graduate so odd to dive in here the eagles open as a three point roads favorite which you know a lot of people like to take home underdogs seems logical than\nThat the lesser team may play better at home so somebody came in on the giants\nAnd that line moved from three to two and a half and again\nIf you're not really in Tibet in that might seem like a minor thing but that that makes a push a no longer a possibility a two and a half\nAnd a game like this that figures to be close that could be a big difference that half point right there\nBut one thing to look out for Russia's ally has already moved so that was two and a half that was yesterday the line is moved today two giants plus one so another point and a half move\nIn favor of the giants while I was just explaining this to our intern Kevin what has happened to their is known as a steam plague rationality yes I'll listen to the generosity word of the week here\nThe steam play is what's known in the industry\nIs when a lot of sharp but money so known better that wind known winning better is a lot of sharp money\nComes in across the industry on the same bed now this could be the same better spreading their money around but more often than not it's just a lot better is\nIncidentally placing their bets at the same time so there's been a massive steam play on the giants\nBut that's simply already occurred now why that's important is you look at the giants plus one and you see that the line has moved and you're like wow so the smart better is must really like the giants 'cause they're pouring all their money and on the giants but what you're missing in that equation\nIs that they liked the giants they liked to the giants at that number that's why they poured all their money and then again you can look at it and say well the numbers barely change there's still probably some good value there and that could be true\nBut it's important to know why steam play versus just the market correcting itself because of money coming in steam plays can be very important to take note of because again that means known better is known to casinos for winning known for making what are known as sharp plays\nA lot of them got in on the giants at plus two and a half and plus three and move the line across the industry which\nYou know it's something it's common and that had happened multiple times a week but it's rare and that it it doesn't happen in the majority of games that happens in a small percentage of games which is again to say that it happens every week but it's happening tonight and giants in Philly\nWas the steam play created in Cleveland\nYes that's a very funny or observation your grass I don't know if it's eight o'clock yet I don't know if we can make that maybe another hour we'll revisit the uh the birthplace of the steam\nOr the match a predictor\nAmong the four letter network has the giants at fifty point one percent and silly at forty nine point five\nI liked that I\nDo because I think uh I I don't know Miami says to schizophrenia they just can't score alright game to like\nI've got Tampa Orlando they get around minus ... hats\nHang on Tampa over Atlanta and let me find it on my a sheet here hang on every oh I got a Atlanta minus three and then over under fifty seven in ...\nThere were going to definitely going the younger ones that I liked that play I'm with you James Winston back and I noticed that yeah I don't need that Tampa offers would be as productive even though they are I Do believe coming off by women home time ... it's an advantage so\nThree here we go we got the rams over Denver that miners Senate I've rams minus seven in an over under a fifty two on that we're going to go into\nUnder rams Denver so rams go on the road and you're going under with are going to go into them I like that I thought let me see if there's any weather issues there no I don't see in All right over the\nColts who jets in the coal miners who what do you think of Sam Darnell\nI think that he is a good quarterback he's hot and cold but I think you commit to his own I see them being ne ne ...\nI'll tell you one of the jets are eight and a with a rookie quarterback Perry not that that would be awesome friends that it'd be bad for us here in New England were they going to break playing the cold because they just can't buy or when I'm Out of the cold sank guy you know my thoughts on them pride I of colds jets forty five\nFor an over under and the jets minus two and a half\nUnder under the forty five Indianapolis the jets ladies in Germany you're going to be running these fix down because they are straight fire or for pat right we took the ... the Cleveland All right hang on here chargers are minus one on the over under forty four and a half their\nPlate in Cleveland so it's that ten am start for them yeah we're going to go over All right well over forty four and a half inch I kinda like they're going to school I think I think Cleveland will put up enough points any charges win that game\nWe have a I got Kansas City of the patriots you\nKnow let's get a little analysis on that you were in the ... Holmes the New England the feds can't deal with Kansas City it's an it's an extraordinarily big old or among match\nUp this kid is defined than on the plane patriots at home\nUm I mean I don't know if they're willing to pay for you to tell the but I can tell you this everybody in Kansas City it's healthy and they got a lot of young talent on that theme these guys are rock and roll and I like them and so I'm going to give them or we're going to go over the fifty eight\nWow you know that this is one of the highest silver\nUnder like in the in in the history of Vegas there's right up it's going to be a unbelievable game but do you think there's going to be a lot of points you okay just quickly Kansas City wins\nOutright I think it's going to be told his New England find a way to win but not come out I think it's going to be like thirty seven thirty one I'm going to watch\nThe New England they show this weekend and you'll see mine number I got thirty seven twenty eight New England and I think okay Hi each game\nLast Thursday action\nI like it you know the weather's gonna really sucked yup weather's terrible really bad so eat over the giants you got to go with time get lonely I I'll take the ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Gresh Show", "city": "Providence", "day": "11"}
