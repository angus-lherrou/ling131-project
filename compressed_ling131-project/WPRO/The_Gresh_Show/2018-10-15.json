well\nThat is true he won't even do I think I think you have another problem that might be a bigger issue for the giants and that is I don't think this head coach is head coach worthy\nLike his

in on a friday and Monday to be able to hear what we have to say in terms of breaking down football um\nI Would say that the breakdown was pretty spot on and the two things that I did not expect in last night's game was one that the New England patriots special teams kick off coverage was going to be hot garbage\nAnd number two the Tom Brady and I do believe it was right after one of those bombs mood ching oh Brady and talking about the poor and working with Tom House and talking about how fundamentally he needs to be sound\nRight after that breeding it didn't that third down situation and he was running around like Doug ... for crying out loud cue that whole Benny Hill music and the ball gets knocked out of his hands\nAround trying to make a point even though we've got a big one they are going to show that\nWe all\n\nThank you\nWas really sloppy on that play in the pocket\nIt gave Kansas City life but they didn't need to give the chief any life there and that fourth quarter got a little hairy but\nThe difference between quarterbacks that people fan boy over and those who get it done in the fourth quarter was clearly on display last night and what I mean by that is\nThe patriots got the ball back meaning a field goal in a tie game they got the ball back with a ramp free minutes to go\nThere to paint thing going around a little bit to get it to the two minute warning and then it was we know what planes going to work and then we'll throw in the long run and then we'll come back the wrong and will run it down and we'll call time out and break it takes to me and then when we go home happy it was\nTextbook text book Tom Brady looked like a guy who had navigated through a fourth quarter to a win forty plus times in his career\nAnd I can't dog out ... homes\nFor making that big fro to ... kill but I think there's a real difference between what we saw out of our lord and football savior Thomas Edward braiding and what we saw ... homes Pamela hoses athletic as hell and can run around and make plays\nBut that's the point is that when he was in the pocket and his accuracy was challenged\nHe couldn't rise to the occasion\nAnd then there were times where he got duped by the defense and they asked the greats like Brady did do that you're ready to go to Don one earlier this year why it happens to someone like him\nBut it happened on true interceptions where ... homes one got fooled and then to got greedy because there was pressure and he tried to let the ball go\nI'm not as big on ... homes having seen him as everybody else is because a lot of what they do you can catch up to it and eventually the league will catch up to a lot of the zone read stuff you know what the you don't you're going to happen quite honestly with Kansas City\nIs teams are going to start to load up on everything else and Sarah kid you want to run zone read runs zone read\nAnd let's see if you've got the goal needs to be able to try to run zone read against men that are going to hit you because her mother were quarterbacks are runners you are allowed to attach to them as if they're running backs\nAnd that seemed to be the change with that kid and you know it's going to happen he's going to get hit so hard they're going to have those birds swirling over his head at one point and then he's going to start to think twice about how active he wants to be outside the pocket for me that as may the bigger\nIssue for me or the bigger take away from me and I want yours at one eight hundred three two one WPRI row for three eight nine seven seven six and on Twitter at

R. E. S. H. the big takeaway for me was that\nRunning the football is now a part of the patriots DNA and not only did they just don't with Sony Michel they did it with James White and when you run game is so productive make your brain the number two running back in like let's be honest folks right we've all seen\nWell most of us have seen Nineteen years of Tom Brady let New England patriots football and would ever get sounding got caught in time what always happens once spread 'em out but for all the really quick and throw the element on the return routes and get drunk and let Brady do his thing now there's a healthy mix\nNow they're going forward on certain to and running the ball and converting because of Sony Michel they're hitting quick hitters on first down with James White because you've got defenses that are trying to figure out which ... which side are you running the football\nToo I thought\nThey were magnificent in the run game and Kansas City never and maybe you can maybe there's a point but you remember that I don't but I read through that game today\nThere was never a point in this game where the Kansas City defense provided any push back on the New England patriots running the ball none none nothing that they couldn't overcome maybe they stopped them on one third down but if they want to line up and running again on force in one\nThey then had the ability to do that\nOne eight hundred three two one WPRI oh four three nine seven seven six on the Twitter at the real grass G. R. E. S. H. then there is the red Sox win yesterday which I I'd be very curious to see of all of those reading numbers that are out there\nHow was split amongst New England sports fans and to what they were consuming at one point in time\nBut the red Sox gotta win yesterday they needed in game two of the American league championship series where our David prize was David Price once again it drives me BS crazy\nThat starting pitchers get leads and in the very next inning they turn around and spit Tibet and give it up\nAnd that's exactly what David priced it up to nothing here's your lead settled down and go pitch and he turns around and gives up to right away\nAnd then turns around and gives up to more\nAnd walk through the red Sox responded in that bottom of the third inning but there was no confidence that David Price was going to be able to put the team on his back after they gave him the lead again\nFor him to finish the Neal instead he throws eighty pitches fifty or for strikes in what was a very pedestrian performance\nAt least with Chris Sale OK Italy's with Chris Sale folks I Know there's something wrong with his shoulder and that guy trying to pitch through it\nDavid Price is trying to pitch through having no guts know grit and no intensity that's what it looks like to me on them out there every time he needs to hunker down and can't do and I know it's the same thing last week but it's the exact same thing here again with this guy\nAnd now\nGot sales were sick he went to the hospital so who knows how that can end up changing the the pitching rotation\nMight you have to move things around in a couple of days I'm ... I'm going to just go out on a limb and say right now that ah Chris Sale would rather throw up all over himself\nThen give the ball to someone else in game five and I think deep down we got him on the truth o meter there'll be a part of ... that would say ain't no way I'm giving up my start to that\nGuy if we're going to go down we're going to go down with me on the mound now with David Price on them out because we all know how that's going then we got Red Sox we got patriots and I got you I Want to hear from you\nThere's been a ton of political talk was a great sports weekend this weekend but to have some fun one eight hundred three two one W.

make sure I Can't believe I Can't give it up and I think with price that was kind of more the thing because we've seen how he's been pressing a drug postseason\nOver his two ... two years when the red

Michel weren't great weeks two and three but since then they've dedicated the time to with the effort to it the runs to it and they've had it pay off yet two hundred yard games last three weeks and the other one was whatever Ninety six Ninety eight yard so essentially\nSony Michel spin a three time hundred yard Russia I think he's in the top five in the AFC now we've talked eight in the NFL\nAnd this is what we we thought he could be I mean anybody who saw him in college saw the ability to\nBe more than a I think some people thought it was just a thunder lightning thing at Georgia he's more than that he can carry the ball between the tackles he has some power the one thing we actually I haven't seen yet is you know the big plays in the passing game and I think that's still going to come and involved for him as he gets more comfortable if Brady but\nThere's no question Josh McDaniel has made a commitment to the running game and give that all kinds of line credit your boys your big boys up front and I know it's the chiefs\nThey have a terrible run defensive banged up on defense but they own the line of scrimmage just wasn't like last week where it was one yard run one yard run thirty are run okay you end up with a hundred yards\nThis was six yard ... yards short yard as you move the trains this was ... plays gassing them consistently and that's a good sign their balancing out the fence and that just makes them more dangerous it also\nI've been a big believer that when you can run the ball you should run the ball and I get into a lot of fights with with all her all over this he says all that does is low the game down keep score down well\nYou should run the ball last night you did run the ball last night you squirt forty three points so stick that if you're low scoring game\nNow I'm with you on that man and and I think that it does a world of good\nFor this football team to know that you know it's always been sop thrown stop the wrong guy that went on third insured well you know there isn't there's never enough chatter on winning on third in short on often send it's always well radio figure it out well\nIt's nice to get out of Tom Brady hands every once in a while and quite honestly I think Tom Brady love being able to turn around hand off the phone trust that they're going to get two yards when it started in one\nNo question and I mean we talked about complimentary football a lot with being often defense special teams that's complementary all sense if you can\nDo anything you want or at least have the threat\nOf doing anything you want it's not a ... it's not a coincidence that you score a lot of points in defenses are struggling to stop you and\nYou know you mentioned not since bill and really you know there were these stretches where it would get to November or early December and it's like all of a sudden okay you know what we're gonna try to run the football now doesn't work that way you don't just flip a switch and decide you can run the football you know whether it's with Stephen jak center like one or any of these guys it's hard to do\nWithout putting some effort into it early in the season and and and being dedicated to it and that's what I like to see and you know you're going to be able to throw the ball ready to rock radio Edelman now that's coming and even the the Gordon\nBut if you can mix in Sony Michel I think it's really intriguing to see\nHow you can lean on that and it gives you another weapon in the tool box right you have those days even the oh Seventeen yeah one of these days where the pass Russia's getting in the super bowl your scoring is down to turn to just be able to run the ball with some consistency and and I think they're they're putting in the investment now and it could pay off later\nAndy Hardy patriots football weekly with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh through six weeks the patriots kicks coverage units have been now not grade\nThey had the big hit up last night as well Andy my theory is you know normally it's a lot of those defensive backs that around those teams and now that you're playing five six sometimes seven defensive backs last night\nI Wonder if the way the game is changing in terms of spreading it out and put in five and six defensive backs on the field is what's hurting the patriots kicked coverage unit cheerful\nIt's a solid theory hum I don't know if it's it's you know the answer if that's really what's going on I Know you know some people say oh is it is to do with the new you know schemes and the new rules in lake guys are lining up and I know\nYou know there was discussion or early in your talk coach Bela truck for a few times better than some of the TV production meeting sort of the personnel on the the ... coverage team and even the kick return team and how teams were doing it all a little differently and you know some teams going was safe over line backers or\nYou know defensive ends over linebackers and some spots and sort of changing their personnel and I wonder if that's some of it with the patriots as they work through this the defensive backs the linebacker defensive and figuring out what what the right combination is but\nYou know the answer is simple they're not very good right now and you know I don't know if you've caught it last night but after they give up the long you know Ninety seven yard or and they kicked the next one back seat for a touch back\nThere was a Bronx cheer at George stadium and they deserved it they're kicked coverage in their decision the way they used the kickoff has been horrific and you know I think what really frustrates people is when you look at it and say\nOkay there's Matthew Slater running down the field and Brandon King and Nate ... Gino gruesome and these guys are like these guys have one job and it's to play specialties is to make sure you're not giving up thirty to Ninety yard returns with so much regularity to have them dead last in the NFL and kick off coverage when you have a very good kicker\nIs just unacceptable and you know they need to figure it out sooner rather than later because you know you have your shoes on defense\nAlready you don't want to be given them extra yards you know you certainly would prefer to make the often go an extra ten or Fifteen not give them a free ten or Fifteen so I'm I'm not sure exactly what it if it's what you're talking about the extra TVs and get worn down if it's game if it's a combination of factors but you know they need to figure it out sooner rather than later\nHate the scouts was kicking them until the goal line on purpose last night or did he does not have a good night booting the ball out of the back of the end zone and making it a moot point\nNo I think that was intentional I think bill very much wants to do that they were so good at it last year taking it to the goal line getting people short getting some of those yards play to play and this year they're just not very good at it when the other team runs that they're getting twenty five to thirty yards a return there were as I said worse than the NFL average\nStart Dr start for opponents of kickoffs um I think the south you he hasn't been great this year you know he had that\nSort of mortar one early in the year and a week to week three you didn't get high enough it was a dismal kick but I think some of the scheme and the decisions of when to kick in the end zone Wendy kicked to the goal line and try to get them to to come out when the squid ... that was a terrible ...\nStill not exactly sure why they did that or what exactly happened there but I can tell you it was\nIt was it was to cue whatever it was um so no I I think it's more coverage issue and bill wants to be able to do it and I think some of it is he doesn't trust later in the year that goes out you will be able to when it's a little colder and when you're driving through the end zone so they need to be able to cover but right now they're just not cover\nAlways great to catch up with the star patriots football weekly on NBC Sports Austin and read it on Patriot's dot com and of course following him on Twitter at jumbo
