will joke with Rudy ... every once in awhile by being a balloon popper but you know\nWas he was right and realistic about David Price and they I think it took me three weeks to get on that bandwagon when Ruth ... on this guy just not being worth anything and I finally figured out what bothers me\nAnd I mentioned Curt Schilling and this has\nNothing to do with the businessman Curt Schilling but you know one thing we all admired about Kurt showing\nIs that when it came time to dig deep one Curt Schilling is in the sixth inning of a start and he's trying to get through six and he's thrown a hundred and eight pitches or whatever it is it doesn't matter whether the sock is leaking or not\nWhen it came time to have guts Curt Schilling had guts\nAny hunkered down and he dug in and even if it was eleven or twelve ... bad if it's late in the game that mattered that guy would not cave in\nDavid Price just says no guts he's got no fire did any one eight hundred three two one WPRI oh did anybody watching or listening to that game on Saturday Night\nDid anybody see any sort of guts guy oh or gumption out of David Price and I think that's the part that bothers me the most and I know that there are a lot of the\n... fans out there for ...\nCrackers just pulling bar Red Sox Red Sox rah rah rah where it's all you got to be positive with this guy\nYou have to try to think a certain way with David Price you've got to be behind him what's make him comfortable he gets he sees thing is you get angry when it's cold we have to make sure the conditions are perfect\nWhat it's all the collective fan base pat I'm On the bomb telling our good he is and maybe he'll be able to get through foreign ... playoff game\nThat\nWe could be realistic and realize that this guy is saying hokey for those of you\nWho do not follow the Virginia tech hokey ths football team I learned a long time ago and I've been going on I haven't gone to snopes to see if they the bunk this ah but I have gone on to the Wikimedia to check it out oh hokey is according to war and legend a castrated turkey\nEssentially and that is David Price he's not Derek Lewis from us each one to tell you that much will get all that you see stuff coming down the road\nOh\nAnd you know what I did today I started crunch numbers because everybody knows how now on David Price call and especially after this oh by the way you know certain tonight folks made set of ... you know why they have all the starting tonight because David Price thinks\nThere are plenty people want to throw the word stinking suck around and a fraud towards oh I don't know rookies play three games in the NFL and think they're terrible how much more evidence do we need to David Price because this guy has got he's a hokey he's got ... he's got\nKnown ads whatsoever that we should call them know that instead of go that's known ads\nBecause that is David Price\nDid anybody see any sort of hunkering down and this guy trying to dig deep in battle through\nRoutes did you see that at all I don't know if you consume the game and I'll watch you know TV\nI consume the game and it went to exactly as I as predicted what do you want from me I mean you gave me props earlier so I guess I Will take that from where it is but uh this is the whole expecting a tiger to change its stripes or a zebra or whichever striped animal you would like to choose to make your uh example there\nBut David Price has proven with such a lengthy track record that he is two things he's a great pitcher in the regular season and here's a corrupt tested pitcher when it comes to the post season so while as a Red Sox fan I was hoping\nThat this would be the blip that this would be the outlier if it were as in terms of David ... starts but yeah now we got more of the same and more of what I expected than ah thankfully I was able to hedge against him on Dr King's and so it wasn't all for a lost their\nGrandma there you go and you were a as I Would say operating with knowledge there with your your belief system you were with the number I saw her with\nYou and there you go well it's known as the the generosity hedge crash whereas if a man you want your team to win but\nJust in case they don't win it's like an ... works out to even out the old life cycle there are good\nFor the quality of life but I mean that guy he just has no ability to dig deep\nNow the moments obviously are too big for him or you know it's easy for me to sit here and say that but I'll admit they'd be too big for me as well which is why I'm not doing those things\nAnd I'm sitting here behind this or whatever that says there that I'm sitting behind but yeah it just seems that whether he gets in his own head or if it's actually a physical thing like for all we know his stomach is not out there that's not something you'd necessarily be able to see\nBut there's something mentally that ah you know prevents him from performing in these big spots it's pretty obvious by now the sample size which the generosity like to point to is pretty large when it comes to David Price much larger than than your normal picture so when you look at it while you still would say or do you still could say well you know\nIt may be able to give 'em fifty starchy come back to the norm yes that that very well could be true but he's not going to get those starts in his running out of time to even out back to the norm here or to the point where I think it's safe to say he just has trouble performing and big spots\nRich I as you were wrong that out a certain thing to this you know who he is he is the ... he is the baseball equivalent to Jay ... where he has all the talent in the world\nAnd I don't think it keeps them up at night that he has a bad playoff record but we just say that about Cutler especially in Miami last year old smoking Jay hey man the checks are clear and and I'm doing okay and I play in half way decent so there you go but that is David Price\nI don't think it keeps them up at night I don't think it really bugs him\nI Am now I the first of all\nFolks you know that I'm looking for any reason or way to get rid of David Price and get them off his roster now what I'm hoping\nIs that he is just so kind of apoplectic about winning a championship and being great but he just\nYou know he owned plugs and he goes somewhere where people are gonna love him regardless what St Louis is the perfect town very ... he should have gone there and you know what when I started to dig into the numbers\nI don't think it's completely ridiculous that this guy might on ... and be willing to take less money when you start to look at the price points I mean we didn't even get in to report cello\nTerminating game one and getting big outs in the eighth inning to help save the bullpen now poor souls you're starting game for native all the is gonna go tonight who would have thought that a guy that we will be laughing at two years ago when the Yankee Twitter was putting out stuff white nasty\nMate and stuff like that on Twitter we used to sit back and laugh at that and now some two years later that guy is starting a game for me\nTo take her to do something and there's this guy has the natives after my cocktail sort of everyone here like fresh fish and\nAll of a it's a great one\nMeans arrow masters coming out of left field that's when they have all these coming out of left field and I love a lot of the talk as well he's a secret weapon and that's what they position but there's\nNo then you're supposed to have two ways is crowd Allen David Rice and if you have to start a third guy and I will start a third guy other than that it\nShouldn't be well there's other secret weapon that we picked authorized scrap heap in Tampa\nAnd he's not a secret weapon you know when you're doing your crossing your fingers and hoping to God that he gets you through five innings tonight and that the game is tied or you have a or you have a small lead that's about the best you can expect from native ... if anybody knows how to attack\nNathan have all the he'd be the Yankees considering he spent a bunch of time in that organization\nOne eight hundred three

rushed back to be able to watch that you actually fight and\nUm\nWas a good guard ah they were really a couple of a big time by the card there would be worthy of discussion\nBut but one of the caught everyone's attention was the aftermath not even the fight the aftermath of ... and Conor McGregor for the white weight title so there was a title on the line\nAnd ... did what he does he wrestled McGregor he got I'm On the ground he tired him out he probably hit them and a half dozen times you've been around a good joke\nDidn't look like he added on to the gym and he had the chin down a little bit I saw macgregor was going to try to find a way to wiggle out of it but it's thrill three around for he was done [noise]\nAnd then it really began now let's go back a little bit for those of you who are not diehard UFC fans to beat the market Madoff and his camp were affected by the actions\nOf Conor McGregor when us see was it the Barclay center and McGregor crash that thing and then he took that Dolly any through through a bus window and it yeah I mean it injured people I think police herring herring one of the uh UFC female fighters who I Do believe\nIt's kind of affiliated with to be your mother met off\nA she was injured in that and we no charges were pressed against McGregor and ultimately those were planned out and I think it was community service and\nYou know you're you're plenty rich maybe rightful checking will ah you know ... hours for a year or whatnot there's a lotta weigh those things can end up being settle\nBut we knew that going in the bad blood between to beep and Carter macgregor was very real to me by the way said I'm going to make him tap out they didn't make them tap out and then afterwards is one that went overboard\nIf you have not seen the highlight the best way I can describe it as this\nAnd you must see there's a lot of talking in the NFL there's a lot of talking sports there's a lot of talk\nKevin Garnett or heard of that I Want to learn that are going to finish that ran without a million up Kevin Garnett haven't gotten that perfect\nExample many blast someone in the sand bagging runs backwards like Pedro Martinez when someone says\nThere's always been a level of jaw jak him that's gone on in sports well could be taps out McGregor he turns it looks so the corner as you heard and then out of nowhere I mean really out of nowhere\nOver the cage diving down on McGregor is jujitsu coaches you heard and then it was on now you have these fights\nYou don't have the regular security and then you have the red jacket security the red jacket security that is that these fights\nOr I Do believe associated with the Nevada state athletic commission when Derek Lewis who fought a fighter earlier and took his pants off in the ring [noise] there was a guy who was a red jacket who had on a real official looking badge\nWho I was from the Nevada state athletic commission he pat I'm On the ass and said I Need you to put your shorts\nOn and he did those\nGuys were all down there there was extra security that was down there\nAnd I'm Talking about down there and when you hop over the octagon you ought to go on to lift it up so people can see it\nAnd then there is a floor area so once you're in the Florida are you walk down the aisle for us the fight right you go down the aisle\nYou come to your entourage and you go to one of the USC UFC approved cut men and they put all of the vast or trade shit on your face and check you out and make sure there's nothing illegal in your mouth and you know the your belt winds okay and all that stuff [noise]\nSomeone could be jumped over the cage he landed on the platform that lifted up and then he jumped down to then try to get it the McGregor people and then all hell broke loose now\nWhile this was going on one of\nA no longer Madoff's crew was in the ring being restrained by security because he was trying to get to a recently defeated corner McGregor\nAnd then you see one guy make it into the ring who is a part of the ... crew who goes around to everyone\nAnd then he comes back around towards McGregor and right at that point in time there's a guy and a red shirt\nWho by the way is a UFC fighter I Do believe hops into the ring and while the first guy came back around to catch McGregor but do it in a red hits McGregor with two right hands from behind total chicken believe horse crap tons of stuff\nThen you got security they're trying to separate everybody down on the floor so more security get in the ring and they try to separate these guys the crowd has completely lost their marbles during all of this it is oh my God I Can't believe what I'm saying\nSo to be an amalgam it off the whole leading up to this fight to me he was\nTelling people I'm a man of honor I Am not like Conor McGregor I Am different I have respect for us see I have respect for this that and the other blah blah blah and then in the biggest moment of his career after the biggest one of his life\nHe hops over the cage and literally Somalis the USC brand and part of the reason that crews on the broadcast was about to say what he said there in the end because once they got everyone separated right\nAnd eventually they went to the broadcast crew\nCruises the one who said I've been a champion in USC and our sport he called it our sport has an issue with people and the perception of what they think an M M A fighter really is\nThere are sadly a lot of people walking earth right now\nWho think that if you are in all of them in fighting the your crazy\nOr the you must have an anger problem or the you're just like walking around looking for someone to fight all the time because you're an out of control human being who is getting into a cage and playing in the competing in what would be considered a barbaric sport\nYou mean like a counter McGregor the biggest star of UFC or you could argue that I got and then we can get into this I got a huge problem with all the mouth pieces of USC talking about how this is bad for their sport it might be bad for the utopian version of their sport they one day hope to reach\nBut this feeds right into what the fans want to see from the sport and\nAnd and they're in lies the rub as I Would say because that you are a million percent right right now but the people who bought USC and oh by the way it did you see he was sending your ringside\nHow you know we're like Bob wants to pick up the phone\nAnd of course there was one of my one of my other\nCosts I was here ... you are on the moon where you are oh wow ... craft group\nHas sunk significance venture capital ball was and so the year of sea going out a lot of fun we're far from there you know why I wanted to prove a\nHe's sitting right there are three rows deep\nBut true your point right now this see she ate a lot of fights and correct\nWhat it doesn't do is help them get the U. S.
