one against the Dallas Cowboys\nWashington in Dallas neither of them are any good so I'll take the home team there\nWhat could be the game of the weekend Gretchen I'm taking your New Orleans saints plus two and a half at Baltimore ... both teams are great at covering the number but as we looked at earlier in the season Drew Brees actually covers the spread better outlook ...\nMiserably is actually called me just read better when he's out doors are counterintuitive but them the facts Kansas City minus five and a half against Cincinnati a lotta sharks jumping on the bangles\nKansas city's undefeated against the spread including covering the three and a half number that close against our New England patriots last week and finally Monday Night magic\nI've been hitting on Monday

don't think you need ... plus it's much better by the\nNew gym is really any good but er Indianapolis should be able to get out there Derrick Anderson or what\nEver quarterback they decide to run out at whatever point during that game so I don't expect them to have a lot of time to throw the ball and uh when you can't throw you can't really run either but yeah just don't watch the game right in front skipped this young it's on CBS how did you tell the people that they might accidentally sees them\nWell because I Know the CBS around here will be showing on living in Chicago where say we are say good\nBye Detroit is at Miami Miami ever since the New England game has been up and down but they're foreign to on the year and a three you know at home Detroit come out to buy right yeah I Do believe so yes that is correct and um\nI mean ... if they find a way to win this game Miami five in two and you have to consider them live for a playoff spot even though they're playing Brock ...\nYeah you you would think I mean Miami it's just not any good even with Ryan town in my opinion\nI think they've been able to work the scheduled to their advantage so far in the early going so\nThey're probably not nearly as good as the foreign to but it's not like they're a ton of great teams out there any way troubled they'll have in this game is ... ... hours or quarterback but also met Stafford they've been protecting them pretty well and if Miami can't get the Stafford that could spell long afternoon for the middle\nI Am with you on that I think Detroit you're going to show off well and they won't be ... why we're on the back to the Jersey ... as he and he's just not good for the fun when you know ... hours in the lineup versus oh\nWe're going to spot stardom here yeah no when you can prepare for him I think it's very different\nMinnesota is that the New York jets you know what I'm smart and on Minnesota from the beginning of the year I think that's a good team uh they come in at three two and one they haven't exactly blown people's doors off off offensively\nHowever I think this could be a get right game for Minnesota in terms of the amount of points they can put up against the jets and if they get to lead this could get tilted and turn into one of the real bad performances or the rookie season for Sam dark\nYep I agree a lot of action coming in on the jets earlier in the week\nMostly because we talk about uh like rush recent see bias people saw the jets run up a million points against the colds and figure hey they're at home maybe they can do that again again these are individual trials that really have nothing to do week to week with one another the Minnesota defense and the Indianapolis defense now that my friend is a horse of a different\nAh very much so the Philadelphia Eagles at three and three are going to take on the three and two the Carolina Panthers Panthers rolling into Philadelphia there on Sunday afternoon\nI think it's just a matter of time before Philadelphia starts to get back in the groove again you know when you re insert a starting quarterback who's been hurt all year and you've had success with the other guy I think there is a natural adjustment and I just don't believe the Carolina\nHas a great defense you know the numbers for Carolina are okay they've only given up a hundred and fourteen points but we haven't seen Superman Cam Newton yet and I think we're more likely to get Superman Carson once than we are Superman Camden\nYeah I mean I'm not with you on the eagles I thought as as successful in impressive as they were last year\nThat I never really bought into the fact that they had any sort of identity offensively I mean I Know carts and wants his good I'm not saying he's not and I liked errands roles and Algernon Jeffrey they have plenty of players that I like their titans have they have been very good for the last couple of years\nBut it's like when you play the patriots you know there Tom Brady is coming for you and if they run it then you're a little surprised that you play you know certain teams just have certain identities and I can't necessarily put my finger on the identity for the Philadelphia Eagles which is why\nYou know I don't really love them in any spot and five points against Carolina camp Newton usually plays well when you're not expecting him to play ... so I wouldn't be surprised that this games close I just don't have a ton of confidence in Philadelphia I'm I'm not with you on that one\nOr two awful teams are going to battle it out as the Cleveland Browns will take on the Tampa Bay buccaneers ... it feels like the buccaneers or a mess and it feels like the browns were a mess but the browns have some hope\nBecause their quarterback is not out you know a sexually assaulting rubber drivers and ah you know in ... well yeah I mean I think that\nI think Baker Mayfield is a guy who um is going to put into work and put in the time and I think what James Winston has changed his body I don't know if he's gotten any better as a quarterback and I I I some of the tells me the browns are going to go on the road and get a wind down in Tampa come Sunday afternoon\nYeah I mean that wouldn't surprise me necessarily but this is like the bills ... you know this is this is Cleveland Oakland again [laughter]\nWell that's just a different corner of the country doesn't I\nMean they're unexpected I think the over under I Know our friend Perry I think took the or the under and that one I think he did I don't think either of these teams is necessarily going to be able to stop the other one and I'm looking they'll do a good job of stopping the themselves yeah sure that's the way you pick Sixers yeah let's let's do it maybe a formal return for a score but\nYeah I'm looking at this a lot like that Oakland Cleveland game coming down to the wire they're forty two to forty you know something like that I wouldn't be surprised\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars today traded a fifth round picture you're running back Carlos Hyde out of Cleveland now Carlos Hyde at one point in time a a a top sixty pick in the NFL Draft\nA flame down in Arizona and went to Cleveland of course they drafted some guys want to make more room for Nick Chubb\nSo up there and what it is is really an indicator that the jaguars have an issue running back in that one for net straight up needs to be shut down for five or six weeks before they can get them healthy what's interesting about this Jacksonville game as Jacksonville is going to host Houston\nIs that don't look now but the Houston Texans are three and three and if found their way back into this I'm not saying they're great\nBut after that terrible start they've kind of found their way and look the jags great defense and they got a lot of swagger\nBut right now often simply you have no idea what you're going to get out of them you might be able to say the same thing with the Texans\nBut with the Texans there's always some sort of baseline tons of mid level okay this is what they'll be well Jacksonville on often Syrian are really good or really bad and there doesn't seem to be a baseline of here's what we can expect about that group\nYeah and I talk about Houston to you talk about how they've been turned it around maybe Houston has on a three game winning streak right now\nThey've turned the ball over in each of those games are too including three times against the bills and well Jacksonville is deep violence has been missing a big place there's too much talent like on on that defense that they're going to turn they are going to get several turnovers at least against Houston and Jon Watson and I would expect that to be the difference\nNeither of these teams is is very impressive at all and I talked last week about how if Jacksonville couldn't cover in Dallas but that meant they weren't elite a they have other problems rather than being concerned whether or not they're elite or not they just want to win some games and talk about our own going out and getting another running back I mean\nI talked to last week I cough one right there were downs thirty to nothing or whatever it was against Dallas and they're still handing the ball off it's like I mean maybe it's not the the personnel back there and maybe it's the philosophy you might want to take another look\nAnd that is a interesting there's no question and uh you know the letter for that thing would be interesting to watch because without him and he's a part of their identity on off ants whenever he's right ah but the problem is young man right very often\nNew Orleans at Baltimore a one may argue this is the game over the weekend that make that argument you don't have any number one off into New Orleans against the number one defense against Baltimore\nHowever running Baltimore is going to be challenged in a way they haven't been yet so far ... bags among men rolled out a bunch of numbers in terms of Drew Brees playing outside of a dome and how about this and he's just really good and I think New Orleans gonna win this game because I'd only Baltimore can keep up often simply\nNumber will ah both ... both of our opinion on this uh situation which again if you could use a number to support your point why not you just leave out the ones that don't support your will have to exactly the same pie saints are

saying that over the long term they're expecting\nTargeting and the sun shine a seven point two percent and oh by the way\nThat's before fees because you know Ohio doesn't pay the kinds of fees that retail investors had 'cause you don't have a hundred billion to invest and we all know that people will invest a hundred billion don't pay the costs that retail investors who have one million or one hundred thousand or ten grand et cetera et cetera get my point\nNow let me take another stuffer\nWhen you are making your investments\nWhich investments is it your assuming are going to perform well because a lot of investors think that the key to generating successful returns is by picking the right\nInvestments in other words they're Thirteen thousand mutual funds out there which one are you going to pick well\nLet's look at it this way according to ... them in twenty twelve this is six years ago there were five hundred and Ninety us stock mutual funds that beat\nThe S. and P. five hundred that year only five hundred and Ninety out of the thousands of mutual funds that exists only five hundred Ninety of them be the S. and P. five hundred so I Want to ask you the question do you think you could pick\nThe fund that's going to beat the overall market first of all the odds are probably not since such a few number did that in the first place but let's assume that you manage to successfully pick one of the best funds of the year good for you\nFive hundred and Ninety of them in twenty twelve of those five hundred Ninety you know how many of them beat the market again the following year in twenty Thirteen\nHundred and forty\nSolve the five hundred and Ninety who did it in twenty twelve only a hundred and forty of 'em did it again the next year and of those hundred and forty how many of them did it again in twenty four team\nOnly twenty two\nAnd all of the twenty two only three of them did it in twenty Fifteen and all of the three only one of them did it in twenty sixteen in other words of the entire universe\nOf stock mutual funds on the ... of them that exist over the five year period from twenty twelve to twenty sixteen\nOnly won the the us and the five hundred\nEvery year for five years in a row one out of thousands so unless you again do you think you can pick the\nFunds that are going to outperform the market I don't think so\nI don't think we can do it in our firm we don't even try instead what we do is provide passive\nInvestment approaches for our clients instead of trying to beat the market we're trying to provide the return of the market modest fees and taxes and expenses associated with the investing exercise and guess what\nIf you're investing in that kind of a pattern you're not trying to beat the market you're trying not to get beaten\nBy taxes than inflation so that your money is earning a competitive rate of return which should be sufficient to enable you to achieve your financial goals and objectives and that's really the point it's not about beating the market it's about achieving your goals think about it this way two thousand eight\nIn two thousand eight the S. and P. five hundred stock index fell thirty six percent\nSo if you picked an above average fond of funds that beat the market instead of losing thirty six maybe\nYou lost thirty two\nIs that like you know any consolation of any crime [laughter] right\nRight I mean we should be feeling really good when it was thirty six percent of our money we only lost thirty two percent of our money you see my point meaning the markets and that's the goal that's not what you should be trying to accomplish what you should be trying to accomplish\nIs making sure you are long term\nFinancial goals and objectives are met and to that and I'm going to cite a new study that just came out that shows that forty percent of middle class Americans forty percent are facing\nPoverty in retirement [noise]\nForty percent nearly three quarters of American workers say that they are\nGoing to have to work past traditional retirement age because they don't have sufficient money\nSaved and invested so instead of saying the key to my financial future is beating the market wrong the key to your financial future is making sure you have sufficient money saved on a regular basis\nAnd that the money you're saving is earning a competitive return if not\nBuying a lottery ticket and hope you get rich quick\nJoining the latest hot fad getting into what's hot in the void and what's not that's not the key to achieving your long term financial goals our goal here for you is to make sure you are not among that forty percent of the middle class who's facing poverty\nIn retirement your financial future is much more up to you than it is up to the markets and if you're not sure if you're saving enough if you're not sure whether you're saving in the right way if you're not sure you're saving and investing strategy is designed to get you where you are trying to go\nWell that's why your call us AAA plan wreck we've been doing this for more than Thirty years we've been doing this for tens of thousands of folks all across the country just like you\nAnd now it's

I ... I didn't know him and it's crazy ranting get him and shame on hand like God man\nBut now what was fascinating here is look I I I don't know if I'm really doing anything wrong at all because she's still listening to the show so obviously I'm doing something right to get her to keep tuning in and I'm not quite sure why psychologists would be recommending psychiatric help ah she should be recommending psychological help but anyway\nUh I guess it just shows to go you not everybody's a fan\nOf the ... show so I don't know maybe I should have you know some regrets of hell I'm handling the show but I'll tell you who does have a regret\nSuzie Orman has a regret she says that she has a major money related regret that back in Nineteen Ninety seven she bought five thousand dollars worth of Amazon's stock\nAnd sold that just a few years later is she still owns the shares it would be worth more than six million dollars [noise]\nSuzie says quote it makes me sick to even tabulate it unquote she says she purchased the Amazon shares because she liked the branding she said quote\nI thought it was such a cool name for a stock I could identify with the idea of me being a woman that wanted to be an Amazon\nThat was due diligence that's Susie Orman did for choosing an investment but she also says quote\nYou should do lots of your own research before buying an investment unquote so let me get this straight she's telling us to do lots of research before picking and investment but she picks the stock\nBecause it was a cool name and she liked the idea of being an Amazon\nGet rid of a man who was on businesses that are the other night say whatever he sat and got him here too and I\nCan't wait oh boy oh boy I'm not aware of ... and I will say oh boy\nLet me ask you the question before I described for you whether you should be investing in a strip or investing in a chip a treasury inflation protected security uh tell me what it is you're trying to accomplish\nA I guess what I'm trying to accomplish is that I have quite a few CDs right now which are destroying regular interest and what I wanted to do is take out enough money or I don't go over the limit that up to my Medicare payments\nEvery year mhm with increases\nAnd I know it could go to somewhere around a hundred and eighty thousand dollars in income and I like to do that only by drawing down on my Ira between me and the wife and I don't want to have any additional ... oh I did I had the you know be\nPaying to the state in other words what I read there is that they do is take you don't have to report that to the state\nOr hang on hang on hang on I think you might be focusing on the wrong thing here it sounds like you're focusing on trying to avoid additional taxes additional Medicare expenses\nWhat I'm more concerned about is do you have sufficient income to sustain your lifestyle and will you have sufficient income to sustain your lifestyle over the rest of your combined lifetimes of you and your wife that's much more important issue isn't it\nYes it is so have you done an analysis to determine that\nI had a really done it out there but I think I probably have enough money stashed away that it probably going to be you know whether or not you know depending on how long outlive naturally and how long the white blood\nSo I think it would make sense to do that calculation or let me just do a real quick back of the American effort what's the total amount of money that you and your wife have between savings accounts investment accounts retirement accounts IRAs et cetera add it all up what's it worth\nA probably a couple of middle I guess\nAnd how much money do you and your wife spend on a monthly basis\nOf probably three thousand bucks maybe\nTotal all end all expenses\nAre yet probably about three grand on\nThen I Would agree with you based on two million dollars in savings and investments and only spending thirty six grand a year and we haven't even talked about Social Security yeah I Would agree with your urine find economic shake\nWhich means you don't need to be taking a lot of investment rest and therefore I don't think you need to be getting terribly exotic with your investment strategy I mean although it's possible that you might get a higher return from a treasury strip or a a inflation protected bond a relative to a Banksy they I don't know if the difference is all that\nWorthwhile relative to the complexity these securities\nAnd the lack of certainty you have about them and understanding of how they work compared to ordinary bank CDs the difference in the yields is not going to be all that significant and I don't think material enough for you to bother doing something different\n[noise] All right I was wondering if it were to have any effect\nDon't think it's going to be material enough that this was based on a thirty second conversation I'm having with you if we delved deeper\nOr I could certainly argue that all of the choices you've mentioned are paying very low rates of interest in today's economy as you know and there are other strategies that are worth considering that can dramatically improve the potential for higher rates of return\nIs it necessary in your case not really not relative to the amount of money you've got an amount of income you need not really necessary is it perhaps desirable well maybe that's up to you\nYou are so I could argue that you should meet with one of my colleagues we have an office in Cherry Hill not far from you in Mount Laurel where we could go into all of this detail and show you the alternatives that are available to you\nBut that's entirely up to you if you just kept doing what you're doing financially speaking I think you and your wife would be fine\n... in Cherry Hill New Jersey right\nYes it is then if you like I'll put you on hold and get your phone number will connect you with our colleagues in a Cherry Hill and go from there\nOkay that'd be fine All right Neal I really appreciate your phone call thank you very much you can do it Neal dead and call triple each plant record it's really important that you put your investment strategy and the proper context why bother adding complexity to your life tax complication to your life\nGetting into securities you not really familiar with are accustomed to win the material differences in results are really not going to be there when in\nFact you might need to be addressing a totally different question instead which is am I going to be able to sustain my current lifestyle for as long as I in my spouse may live that's the more important fundamental question and you want to make sure you have that answer nailed down first\nThanks so much for your phone call you know I'm really glad to see folks so intently

the world [noise]\nAnnouncing involvement in the block chain and crypto world and why should you care\nIt's because this fundamental technology\nHas the potential according to the bank of England to completely transform the financial services industry\nSee we operate right now\nFrom an economic perspective\nWe operate on a trust basis when you engage in a transaction when you buy any goods or services from anybody else you're trusting that they're going to honor their end of the bargain when you buy a house you know it takes three months right from the time you sign the contract of the time you close\nIt takes three months you have to do a search to verify the deed right you go to a title company and you got to make sure that the ...\nHouse that the dean of the house is legitimate and that title search exists because well you don't trust the cellar and so you spent months and you spend thousands of dollars in a title search and you buy\nMortgage insurance you you buy insurance on the deed in case something goes wrong it at the time it adds money it doesn't do any real good doesn't increase the value of the house for example\nWhile the block chain isn't authentication process it replaces the trust process with authentication under the block chain using this technologically on the Internet\nThe only way the seller can sell you the house is if they do in fact owned the deed and once they do the transaction on the Internet there's no need for title insurance so the transaction can occur much faster\nAnd at much lower cost and it limits the middleman\nAnd there's no way the transaction can be changed altered duplicated or delete it and this authentication process radically and rapidly makes improvements in the financial services sector let me give you an illustration\nIf you want to wire money overseas you've got to spend about eight percent in wire transfer fees and it takes five days for the money to show up and the other country\nBut if you do this with bitcoin you can do it in about ten minutes and it's virtually free\nSo a company like Western Union\nIs now under threat because they're no longer needed so when you are living ate the trust and replace it with authentication you wouldn't lemonade the middleman you no longer need that trust company you know the longer need that title service company\nAnd as a result someone's out of work so the middle man\nCould be disrupted as a result of the block chain and the technological improvements the ability to do transactions faster and cheaper with greater safety and confidence\nIs why David Swenson has made his announcement\nOf putting money from the yelling down and fund into bitcoin and the block chain Anwar Sadat witty has just announced that they're engaging in this as well\nThey're

problem is it any wonder that there's now an escrow company in California that now let you buy a home\nUsing bitcoin and the block chain which is the technology that allows bitcoin to operate is now being used in voting in West Virginia they allowed\nMilitary members who are West Virginia residents who are serving overseas to use the block chain to vote they\nDid it there the first state to have allowed it and they did it in the primaries this past may and they say they're now going to allow it to be used in the November elections for some of the residents in West Virginia by using the block chain there can be no voter fraud\nAnd that the whole point is that it allows a hack proof means of logging transactions in this case votes and West Virginia is proving to be a pilot for the entire country it's quite possible as\nPredicted in my book the truth about your future that the twenty twenty presidential election will be done on the block chain meaning you won't have to go to a voting booth\nTo cast your vote you'll do it using your smartphone\nPretty exciting stuff on the other hand there are still worries about what's going on the FCC\nAnd the CFCC that's the commodity futures trading commission and have issued alerts warning investors to watch out for frauds because there are some crooks claiming that they have SEC or CFCC approval for their block chain and they point investments and they are fraudulent\nYou need to make sure that you are being very very careful because it's still the wild west in fact the international Monetary Fund has warned of new vulnerabilities in the international financial system because of the rapid growth of bitcoin another crypto assets\nSo is this a time for you to invest in this stuff like David Swenson has\nI don't think so I don't think it's ready for main street\nYet but the day may come and the need for you to become aware and informed and educated is right now\nAnd that's our job for you here on this program

be a noxious ... it's just so confident I mean it says um high quality I'm substantial flavorful but I don't have to prove myself to anyone this mind green leaps out is practically an inspirational poster I Want to possess the character of the death of this nine grain we said\nGuys thought he might think of that and I greatly southern again\nTry our new nine green we got Jimmy God's we breathe

coverage to give you more benefits than original Medicare you have Medicare and Medicaid United Health care had one in five five three one eight six three than wind eight five five new three money they can read\nThis planet available to anyone who has built medical assistance from the state and Medicare [noise]\nYou're listening element show have investments that are high now you know that's what buying marijuana stocks are all about if you can't get hot and they should be ... and that's part of the problem marijuana\nStocks are all the hot conversation these days because a lot of them have done really well and twenty Eighteen and guess what when a given segment of the stock market starts to perform well especially if it's new and different\nThat's when the fraudsters come out the FCC has now charged an investment fund in Texas with defrauding investments they made false promises of massive returns in cannabis related businesses\nThe FCC says green view investment partners and its founder Michael Cohn\nUsed misleading marketing materials to raise over three million dollars from investors the guy higher sales people to make cold calls were promising twenty four percent annual returns and guess what\nThe guy used an alias to hide prior criminal convictions he lied about having a former agent from the DEA on staff and he lied about having a long term record of profitability by investing in cannabis related businesses\nThe guy in fact actually has no track record the company sold investment of four hundred thousand dollars has yet to produce a single nickel and profits and the guy guess what\nHe's spent investors money on designer clothing and luxury cars yeah somebody got high\nBut it wasn't the investors in fact the only question you can ask the investors about making the restaurant was already on drugs stay away from high fashion sales pitch is based on getting high with investments\nWere taking telephone calls here on the record them and show heading off the valley college New York welcome to the program Greg how are you\nHi Rick uh thank you for taking my call um my wife and I have a six month old baby girl she is our first one uh she has already accumulated around five thousand dollars in cash\nFrom Gail ... first of all on your daughter's arrival and she's already got five grand\nYes yes I'm\nVery proud of that I'm\nCurrently we have the money just sitting in a custodial a savings account\nSo my question would be is should we leave the funds and that seems like al or treat moving into a five twenty nine plan which we are already contributing fifty dollars per month or shall we invested in the market\nWill wait whoa whoa whoa whoa we we've just covered two very different questions here I don't want to make sure that we separate them because that's key the first question is when are we going to use the money\nIn other words are we going to use the money for diapers we're going to use the money for preschool we're\nGoing to use the money for Troy circles we're going to use the money for their first car we're going to use the money for college or are we going to use the money for them buying a home in their thirties or going to use the money for their retirement so what would you tell me is the expected use and timing of the use of that money\nUm this'll be a more in the long term so we would say a college\nOkay so we've got Eighteen years before we're going to use the money\nAnd theoretically it might not even be Eighteen years it might be twenty four years because you don't necessarily have to use the money in their freshman year of the daughter's freshman year of college you might use the money and your daughters senior year of college and the average kid today\nTakes six years to get a college degree so the money might be able to remain invested not just for Eighteen years maybe for twenty four years so good that gives us a a good\nA basis for the conversation because\nThe timeframe is what determines\nHow the money should be invested in other words if you were told me you're going to use the money for diapers or a ... in three years my answer would be leave the money in cash leave the money in a bank account a CD a money market fund\nA savings account checking account something a U.S Monday treasury bills something very safe very liquid very available something that wouldn't be subject to market gyrations because I'm a short period of time who knows what could happen I mean look at two thousand me write it took years\nFor the markets to recover from the debacle of two thousand me so if you're dealing with a short term ... and you can only choose or something very safe like cash\nFor cash equivalence but if you have a longer term ... something as you suggested Eighteen to twenty four years now we can take a much different point of view since Nineteen twenty six according to its an associates and no Fifteen year period or longer\nHas stocks ended lower than when they started\nTake any period you want since Nineteen twenty six any here as a starting point go Fifteen Years later the market was always higher so if you're telling me that we've got Eighteen years maybe twenty four years to go\nThat gives us a very high degree of confidence of course I have to stress as you well know that past performance is no guarantee of future results in the assertion that country's a federal sense right we know that\nBut it's the only thing we have to go on so we can with a pretty high degree of confidence say that if I've got a Fifteen or Eighteen or twenty four year time horizon putting a hundred percent of the money into stocks makes a great deal of sense and so that's what I Would recommend for the account for your daughter\nNow your daughter is not allowed to own an account she's a minor minors can't own assets you as the parent has to create a custodial account on behalf of your daughter it's called the UT em a uniform transfer to minors act\nUT amazing account it simply says you're going to set the money aside\nFor your daughter and uh the problem with it\nIs number one you're going to pay taxes on that camera manual basis and number two when the child reaches the age of majority you have to turn the money over to the child and instead of using the money for college she might use the money to buy a Corvette\n[laughter] so ah for that reason especially since you're targeting this for college we button said recommend a five twenty nine college savings plans which are available and all states all around the country and in this way you own the account not your daughter your daughters the beneficiary of the account\nBut you control it you determine how the money's invested you decide when the money is withdrawn for college and if you indeed use the money for college\nThan the withdrawals are completely tax free no taxes at all it's fabulous and that's why the five twenty nine plan is the preferred way to save for college because you can use the money at any college in the country for any college expenses tuition room board books pretty much everything except travel\nThe implications on estate planning\nWhat are the legal rights and responsibilities what are you doing about properly naming airs because when you are married you have certain automatic rights under tax law and other federal statutes but when there is no marriage certificate many of those rights\nDon't exist so you need to make sure if you were giving birth to a child who's other parent you are not married you need to make sure you're talking within the state attorney for the protection of yourself\nYour partner and most importantly the child\nWere taking telephone calls here on the record all been show heading out to Dana Point California Bob you're on the air how you doing\nAll right Rick I'm a a question or a is actually a market neutral ones um\nMy wife and I are retired we're in her sixties uh you know I'm a little I Would say I would say not nervous but\nUh uh uh just concerned uh about preserving by uh uh what I accumulated and I started researching these so called market neutral on the for a you know a portion of my portfolio I Would say\nAnd I guess I just wanted to know what your take is on them\nYeah yeah I appreciate the question by the whole name is ... ... of a sales pitch\nIt clearly is titled in a way to appeal to someone who is afraid of losing money in the market and therefore they pronounce themselves as market troll ... earth is not supposed to mean and the first place\nA market neutral fund is by its sales pitch suggesting that they're going to generate\nA neutrality meaning that if the market goes down they're not going to suffer losses it's going to be neutral\nThat's a ... that's the sales pitch no one has ever been able to really deliver on that kind of a promise a and there's no reason to expect that they're going to be able to deliver on it in the future\nSo rather than trying to choose a sales pitch that his so called market neutral well we would simply opt for instead\nDiversification in other words don't put all of your money into stocks have some of your money there to give you some opportunity to keep pace with the cost of living but don't put all of your money there instead have some of your money and bonds and you have some of your money under the mattress having some of your money in cash\nOr does make perfect sense we don't have all of our money in any one place but having a little bit of our money and lots of places makes sense so not just stocks but also bombs on foreign securities and government securities and oil and gas and real estate next potential technologies and on and on and on so\nThat is what we have found to be the best approach in fact when we phrase in another way it's not the best approach it's the least worst approach um because what we have really found it's kinda like democracy right the worst political system ever devised except for all the others and it's similar to the same thing we don't know what is the best way to invest so which", "show_name": "The Gresh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence",
