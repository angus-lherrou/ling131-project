either\nI don't believe you can have someone who would authorize the sort of an act ban a position of power what the nation that's very important to us but we have to have the limits as to how far away would go to work with them or at a very difficult complex part of the world\nNow everything is unique about this including the framing it's not your run of the mill two by four walls it\nIt's not just wiener who is our local builder this time he's working for us down here in Rhode Island you know his goal is to try to get as much insulation in his house off so he went to a two by six law and that gives us a deeper capital of the other thing that allows us to do is because the two by sixes are bigger than a two by fours you could threaten 'em out\nAnd you don't have to be sixteen inches on senator you twenty four inches on center and that allows you to drop some of those two buys out of the equation and again as you know when you take the tube\nFor as out of the equation there sort of you're weak link that way you get the thermal bridge rather have insulation in the wall there is that what it in the wall and we were able to drop about forty percent of the lumber\nA lover or whatever that connection from from outside the insides for those two by fours now you have fewer studs and uh you're going to have that much less connection that must thermal bridge basically been limited they're\nAbsolutely and and we're fighting for every possible ... production trick that we can get and that was one of\nThe windows were another thing that you worked hard on you very very carefully selected some windows for this area that we're all paying\n... yeah so a triple windows helps us a lot when you look at sort of a house and you think about the wall assembly if you use or fancy words you know how it's built\nYou've got two by fours you've been insulation you've got air sealing any window which is otherwise just a big hole right [laughter] yeah you like oh my gosh everything's going in and out of windows\nDull pain is better than single pain triple pain is better than double pain and that's what we actually have year also controlling for the UV um are controlling for even says he\nAnd the city I think you as a he gained in and out because you haven't to minimize the amount of air conditioning they wouldn't need 'em in heat load and the friends that Marvin helped us you know not only designed these windows again you know up to code right up to speed for us but there's a lot of them and we want as many as we possibly could so an efficient windows ...\nProjects continuation of your brand Generation Next initiative you got some friends who work in your house that initial going in and what's your message you know people are out there\nThe message to young people is that a career in the trades can be a very good one it could be something you do after college or instead of going to college there are there's a huge need for people who work with their hands and have skills and we've got two younger practices who've been working with a side by side one of the young woman who keeps us from Mississippi the other one is local former marine\nWho's already been employed by his wieners so it was a great way to show people that this is a good job\nNow the other thing that was unique about this is you had owners that we're pros so that must have made a process easier because sometimes it's hard when you're building a project to communicate the needs to the orders that are not projecting architect and designer here how's your wife who owns property\nOr not just pros but smart pros and the ones who sort of manager their appetite and it's not a big house they didn't want a big house they didn't want excesses space um and it was really up to die on our architect really at the dawn to come up with the net zero calculation to make this whole thing work right so we were pleased to be working with them\nIt's still going to be on them over the next twelve months to live accordingly places you know even if you build a perfectly\nIf you leave the windows open at the air conditioning crank too low you will not make next year and now

to do the last remaining tack were and then just run away from the kicker there's a lot of guys who can run away from the kicker\nBut that's why he's there where you don't expect is for him to be sloppy carrying the football on a kickoff\nGetting dotted with someone's helmets and the ball popped right out of his hands and into the arms of the Andre Houston Carson who's games I called at William and Mary bunch of years ago\nYou know that's what you don't expect from Cornell Patterson and people can look at it and say\nWell did it make up for the mistake or no the mistake is inexcusable when he got to recognize how great the touchdown was because of Cornell Paterson's ability to put the old ... ... and make somebody miss in that situation\nAnd normally you put some pretty short tax colors on your kickoff teams\nSo there's that to kind of chop up there is the performance of the fence\nWhere they had chances to make plays they got a hands on football's they just didn't make some of those poised to interceptions in the end zone and I'll tell you this about Jaycee Jackson\nI white that kid he can play now we're gonna have to ride the roller coaster with him he is going through what Malcolm Butler went through his rookie year but if you look at JC Jackson and you\nThere's if there's no number on the back of the Jersey\nYou might think at times he was Malcolm Butler trail technique corner guy you scraps and competes and that intersection I mean that was that was great stuff and it was a work of hustle that one you know there are certain defenders you for those who are not\nWell versed in football slang or the football nomenclature of our day you will hear the phrase oh he plays like a dog that Jacey Jackson but that was Malcolm Butler\nButler play like a dog he was going to chase you until you couldn't chase you anymore\nThe great thing about that Jackson played to crash was that he didn't go up to catch the ball no he went up to make a play he went up because he knew he saw the receivers hands go up and even though he didn't know\nWhere the ball was at that particular instance he put his hand up and when the ball hit his hand it was a perfect combination of study and so mark and athletic ability because once he put himself in the current situation he was able to take advantage of the lucky fortunate situation he was in that hall in that interceptions so\nYeah as frustrated as it was to watch him getting absolutely smoke like a stale pall mall for the better first after that game that that was very impressive and showed that you know he wasn't down on himself so out there to make pipe yup\nAnd corners don't like wide receivers they gotta have unwavering confidence unwavering confidence and I think he's got that I Do ah that wasn't Jackson I made the other way Jackson made the pick were stripped it yeah\nTalking about the one hand while Jones made that intersection oh my God Jones holy cow\nYou know what it is that still still same thing applies to all the way that he didn't let themselves get down so it was able to make a point about\nJones is that he pointed that football when he pulled that thing in the up and you're right they did drop to in the end zone and look what kept points off the board and the all fence well it was the special teams then the fence\nBut didn't really help them and setting them up and short fields with the defense at a bad spot you know and when I did my grades\nBut I didn't think Sony Michel for fumbling while getting hurt I Know you should I have a philosophical disagreement with people who do that\nUm got shot in a way but then they should have held on to the ball like come on there's got to be something within reason in terms of\nThat guy is in a pile his way clearly got twisted you would've loved to seeing them go to the ground or maybe forty went to the ground and then the football comes out\nAnd it was a couple of short fields the set Chicago up and look Mitch Trybulski beat the patriots with his legs he did not beat them with his arm yeah there were throws to to recall when\nAnd there was a throws to Trey Burke and\nOf course those hurt\nBut what really hurt was Mitchell troop ... ability to keep plays alive and uh also get in the end zone with his legs I mean the one point where he ran around\nSeventy five yards was probably the patriots worst offensive player of the day and age for a couple of reasons you go back and watch that number one look at the pass rush lane of Adrian clay born when you're an outside pass Rauscher you never\nEver ever ever\nWork the inside shoulder over the quarterback so agent clay born is normally rushing\nFrom what would be the right defensive and spot so he's working against the left tackle and with a write in a quarterback\nTheir turn down the field so he wouldn't be trying to get to the outside shoulder of the right shoulder of the quarterback\nAnd instead he dipped in and then of course tray flowers runs right beside him and that is true risky turns around go back and watch the effort to trade flowers on that play on the backside Raasch\nUnmitigated lack of hustle\nIt's the kind of thing that normally would get you pulled off the field under a bill ballot check just watch Ninety eight on that play and you'll see great initial rush\nAnd then the guy who was like hopping around like I don't know if somebody's baby goats\nWill just hop every once in a while right they'll run a little bit and then they'll hop that's it that's a trend flowers did on that play the backside pursuit from the defense of Wyman was hot garbage there was none\nAnd that's where that guy was able to run for a touchdown and until it crosses the line of scrimmage eight secondary player can't come up and make that play\nThere was there was a lot to quibble with there's no question but the patriots find a way to when you got Josh Gordon getting more involved in the game and a game plan was blown up because all of a sudden we find out on Sunday Morning that grumpy turned into a drink\nAnd his back hurts and he can't play\nAnd yet they still want out and did what they did your thoughts pats fans on your

Want to hear his thoughts on this postseason run so Dave you've seen at all what are your takeaways from what you've seen from the old town team and they're run to the world series\nWell it's been a tremendous accomplishments to do what they did you know to the beat the Yankees that's one thing it's a one hundred went team\nBut I thought the Astros were in a different class as far as the red Sox opponents to go in there and frankly whip them three in a row of their own building with a very very comfortable and I think a lot of people thought that was with serious might turn it uses favor\nI I think there's ... reaffirmed did he how good this ball club was all season long because\nThere was so much crying about the bullpen and so much crying about kimbrell and clearly he hasn't been the same guy get the post season and still they won those games and they want them the way that they've done 'em all season long break it up front of the other guy quickly and the starting pitching is pretty darn good and the bullpen has been better than anticipated so\nI you know I'm looking at this Dodgers series the Dodgers were third place team in September at one point and I think it's another opponent it on paper right now the red Sox absolutely out class going into the series\nAs you look at the twists and turns of the bullpen has there been any thing David has surprised you either in a player performance that you didn't expect or in the way our score has gone about managing the pieces that he has out of the ball but\nYeah that that's the one thing in the I'm not surprised at the fact that he has used or cello he's ... guys who were starters in relief appearances you know I I thought you would do that I anticipated what but the guy who surprised me\nI think from jump street

story by now we called it a lot during the season on ... but the fact that you know he did it and now he's asked to do it on the biggest state there is\nThat his surprise me a little bit probably more than a little bit I think the fact that he's become a go to guy is it's been a big story for this club\nYeah I'm with you on that that it's the old come out of nowhere and you know I don't know if our score has sort of\nGiven Frasier enough opportunities to where he naturally trusted him or if it was kind of like necessity is the mother of invention hey this guy's pitched well I Need someone I got

R. E. S. H. let's start with Chris Sale\nNow I get home from UMass on Saturday Night probably about nine thirty\nDo out western mass call the UMass came on that some plus nine eleven sports I get home and I finally settling in getting some ... and my wife says to me\nOh you haven't heard what happened with Chris Sale and I'm like I kind of didn't a film in she goes well apparently his stomach thing was because of a naval\nRing and made he got an infection through a belly button rang a Christ sale to me was clearly clowning with the media in terms of I think there is my theory 'cause nobody knows\nMy theory is that Chris still kind of did that as sort of a day over there because there was a picture\nFrom Sam Gross fell out of the globe on Twitter today and they were showing Chris Sale throw on what the left hand\nAnd there was a red bowl buzz figure on Chris sales elbow but stand grows felt caught on that picture and made me say something ... right\nI think it was a very coy very smart diversionary tactic to sort of get people on the wild goose chase wait a minute a belly button ring causing an infection wait what no\nSo I think ... did a good job for a couple of days of ... hey look over here now the approach and the game one uh I think he has to talk today I don't know if he has talked tomorrow I Know the managers do if I've got it right if I remember the algorithm all the way they do this so\nIt's normally the starter in the next game speaks to the media the day before they start so\nLike tomorrow sales not going to have to get up there until after the game and David Price will speak tomorrow but he won't speak on game day I think that's kind of how that goes but regardless\nI'm I [noise] I Try to talk myself out of this opinion all day and I can't do\nI actually have more\nConfidence\nI could have talked to this is David Price than I Do Crist's sale but not for anything other than I don't think sales arms right by David Price is just a mental midget on the mound and his gutless themselves\nSoft that's right Chris sales not soft but\nI don't think he can cut it loose the way you want him to in game one of a World Series\n[noise] um heaving right now because of that\nOh well\nLike my I or my stomach is doing flips right now are in a natural on a healthy thought process you go and talk and I can see why your body would be rejecting such nonsense\nBut I Can't get over the fact of what I saw on Twitter today would that giant red whatever the hell with it is on Chris sales elbow and\nI Love the fact that he's pitching through something I Love it that's guts that's not what is your own finger single men yeah things are single men yeah\nDavid Price fingers single men are going to come out\nLike I appreciate the fact to Chris Sale is you know drop in the old you know watch and going forward\nHowever well I mean what what what are your other options here well no there are jobs\nRight there are no this is a this is every individual fan has their confidence meter when it comes to white murky beds at second base board flow inducing for oh\nThat's a bold move by a manager who wants to win a World Series I Love it to be I don't I don't know why well\nBecause rule number one brash is the second you change your own strategy in order to combat your opponent you're already putting yourself at a disadvantage so combine that with the fact that I Would never ever in a million years go out of my way to get a two hundred hitter into my line up that's why I wouldn't move ...\nWell you're not getting a two hundred hitter in the line up or if you're making room for JD Martinez not Steve\nPearce I can make room well okay but the reason a lot of people are wanting to give out some of the second base is to keep Jackie Bradley junior in line all own J. D. on the line up it doesn't JV Martinez is going to be out score made that very right\nBut the only reason risky bets as moving is because that then gets JD andme a line up at a position where you hope he's not going to soil him so\nNo it would be so you get Jackie Bradley junior be able to play in the outfield 'cause that's the only place you can put in you can move J. D. first base if you want it to and then work your own meals first bases are not a difficult position to play as opposed to second base with someone who has never played there before\nI I'm not running all the dice yep okay fine he played there when he was in little league and one's in AAA nobody on the lenders\nHe he play there are a lot and I if I remember correctly when he went up to double way that was the position and then he moved in but I hear what you're saying yeah I don't have a problem\nIn theory with someone who doesn't play second base playing second base believe me\nMy problem is moving heaven and earth to get Jackie Bradley junior and the line of which is ... and you can have your opinion on it if you'd like that's why they move movie the second has nothing to do with J. D. J. D. in the lineup period if they do Martinez has to play second base to get 'em in the last ... will do that he's in\nThe movie it would be going into second in order to get the ales yes MBP who by the way in that series hit two hundred a Jackie rather do it\nI think it's one of these deals where uh\nWould you rather have Jackie Bradley junior on the line up her bra cold\nBecause if under your theory the J. D. drew is or J. D. true [laughter] JD more wow what a dumb as not ... Martinez is in yeah so then you're so then it would be between Brock holding Jackie Bradley junior really and or or ... ... ... has really\nDone he\nIntends where is a nice safety net for when you have to go there but he's not somebody you want to START I love it that they're willing to entertain this and I don't mind in that ballpark making a choice\nThat\nAnd again does it when you championships\nI don't know someone said defense when championships in football I think the league is changing I think defense was a key factor in them beating the Astros\nSo it's kind of a can is the way this team is playing right now regardless it's going to be game on them are night and it's really going to begin and end with Chris selling a lot of ways\nMay ... only goes three innings dear God\nMe then you're then what are your turning to quickly Steven Wright works off the mountain today might be on the world series roster\nGoing to be honest with you that would make me feel a hell of a lot better about Chris Sale if Steven Wright were on the roster and yes knuckleball is can be flighty but at least it's somebody who'd be able to give me some meetings in theory your thoughts one eight hundred three two one zero four three nine seven seven six on the Twitter at\nThe real grass G.
