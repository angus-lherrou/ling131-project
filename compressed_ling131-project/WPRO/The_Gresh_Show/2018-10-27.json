passing up ends up there but they've been running the ball with a lot of guys I don't know and they'd been having some success\nBut like I said they haven't been beating good teams they've been winning and that's always good but they haven't been beating good teams whereas Detroit as I said before has been winning and more difficult spots a which is why I I give them a leg up in\nSeattle by the way three and three I don't know what the hell they are just yeah I think we're the only three a month\nAnd ... they've been playing better football yeah that should be a good game I mean by all means that should be a good game but I like Detroit\nUh Seattle at Detroit Denver is that Kansas City\nUm [noise] I mean you got to think the Kansas City is going to handle business here ah and then a pretty big way however from Denver is very skipped a frantic they're very much up and down or sometimes they look great and sometimes you're like what in the Bronx ... going on right\nNow the divisional game that I mean I don't see the games are always tough right I look at the the Broncos and the chiefs very similarly as I look to the patriots and the bills in terms of\nIs one team clearly better than the other team absolutely but they're divisional teams and with those big spreads and those two games in particular I Do believe it's still ten points with Kansas City\nDenver and obviously it's fourteen it's probably Seventeen now it's probably climbing Everytime I open my mouth in terms of a New England in Buffalo\nBut this one million already there which can't be overlooked and I mean well I'd be surprised if each of those teams wins by forty no but there's a reason why I'm while we all sit here and I'm like well of course Kansas City is going to be Denver and of course New England is going to be buffalo\nThere's a reason why there will be a lot of sharp action most likely coming in late on both of the underdogs knows games because that's just a lot of points\nRedskins are at the giants uh marriage the giants are hot mess\nHowever you can't trust the Washington enough for them to cover the number\nAnd I can't trust him on the road and there is no number I Do believe it's a ... yeah is it really I'll take the ... and there are yeah\nThat say you know that that feels like if you want to bet on this game than here your job I don't blame will make it easy for you just pick the winner good luck\nA Baltimore Carolina I Know we've touched on that I like Baltimore a lot of mistakes I'm with you something doesn't seem right and something doesn't add up in terms of\nThe line on this game but Baltimore right now\nI you know I I I hate the phrase what what are the best foreign free payment football but you know what they are that's not a bad football team there lawsuits have come to the Bengals which was a surprise ... they lost at the browns in what was a a just a mess of a game\nAnd then they just lost the saints by one it very easily could be ravens at six to know are six and one right now and we feel very different about them we knew they were going to be good or is just a matter of you know sometimes they're their own worst enemy\nYeah you mentioned New Orleans Baltimore and New Orleans in particular again Kansas City New England LA the rams are they seem to be the class of the league right now but Baltimore New Orleans two teams we were both high on coming into the season who seem to be a catching their stride if you will so look out or if you're playing against New Orleans or Baltimore for that matter\nBoy you want to hear some hot garbage four o'clock game as I Do Indianapolis at oak yeah talk\nAbout if you weigh in taking Indianapolis as a road favorites I I mean that's fine that Oakland is flaming refuse but yeah\nIt is good luck with that like in a straight up pool I'd pick Indy and not think twice yeah when it comes to throw in the ... the number in their forget about it that way too many variables and the and the ugliness and by the way\nThat is I don't know who has the double header I think Fox is the double header\nIf CBS says the double header we're getting that game at four twenty five or four or five\nOr ... it by the way the start time tells me everything I Need to know I think Fox says the double header because then before twenty five star I Would think that's correct on a really bad game between San Francisco at Arizona or\nGreen Bay I ran the hour talking well\nFirst of all that San Francisco Arizona game that's another one where okay fine it's a big fast and that's fine and we're not going to spend a lot of time on this because it is there a lot of time really bad games this week right but when when you're talking about looking at bat in lines and scratching your head\nArizona just beat San Francisco in San Francisco by like twenty a month ago yet now San Francisco and our good friends CJ beat hide march in there and all of a sudden they're road favorites against Arizona now I Know Arizona is terrible I understand that\nAnd a little turmoil right but what I think is happening here grass is people are getting used to seeing the San Francisco forty niners over achieve in spots\nCompared to the number people saw him in that Monday Night game again with the Green Bay or whomever ... up in Green Bay and they hung around in that one I didn't believe it was ... and they've been playing teams closer than the number would suggest I think that's what's happening here again just like with indie and uh\nOakland just to stay away from the scams if at all possible hopefully don't have any fantasy action in it but\nIn terms of sketchy looking lines\nI didn't expect to Arizona to be six point favorite no but I was expecting them to probably be a point or two favorite I guess there's a pick the fact that San Francisco is a road favorite against anybody is pretty funny\nGreen Bay at the rams I think this is the week the rams could give me\nI like that call only because we're both wrong but yeah go nuts but yet but uh defensively I don't know if Green Bay is going to hold up but the one\nThing the Green Bay can do\nEspecially considering they've gone through what they've gone through some ups and downs\nOr they can score and they're not going to fool Aaron Rodgers now there's two things that could happen here that could injure him that well yeah I mean he could get a beat out of him so bad\nAnd they beat the bag out ... whomever is the key Jay Lynn Lee or whomever they held up backed up his there I think ... you had John Mikhail skiers elastic Batman yes we'd have to come in and uh and play for Aaron Rodgers of God Forbid he got being dumped just Sean Kaiser allegedly well if they hit Aaron Rodgers\nThen they'll slow him down if they don't Rogers we'll figure it out\nAnd they're starting to get healthy now they soon hammer on game I understand that but Aaron Rodgers will get fooled very easily and I think he has the ability to keep them in that game and I'll tell you what a statement that would be for Green Bay\nTo press the rams late into the fourth quarter if not find a way to win the game\nYeah that was another number that almost made the bags mundane super contest pick their Green Bay plus nine and a half on the road and while I'm not you know I'm with you know you called the Green Bay when you said it would be a good spot for them and a feasible spot for them to possibly get a big upset\nOr I wouldn't go that far but in terms of the nine and a half unless they injure Aaron Rodgers I have very high confidence in Green Bay covering that number however since it didn't make my five pack\nThat leads you to a jury real that there's some pretty legitimate concern that they could end up injuring Aaron\nRodgers and then you know to Sean Kaiser or whomever\nAnd various holy by just legitimately heat in the hell out of hundreds is usually his own worst enemy in those situations whining around and really the one running into the injury\nSo yeah nothing nefarious but or if he gets knocked out they'll get knocked out otherwise I like Green Bay a much like you to hang around and that one\nNew Orleans at Minnesota is the Sunday night game that's a great one now I Know it's a Sunday night would they open up part of the roof they're\nJust trying to make it a little cold at us paying stadium or do they want everybody toasty warm and who cares even though it would sort of a level the playing field for New Orleans 'cause playing in domes are covered stadiums or whatever uh those guys are pretty damn\nGood job but we know graduate what's what's one of the things we've talked about many times in her raise he's better at covering the spread when he's outside ironically and um then he is in the dome so Minnesota they tried to get to Cuba\nWhat are we talking about the Alex correlate philosophy day Robert ... whatever they normally do up there and do it a few they probably do it

a bottomless pit like you think it is and when you start going out a lot of money to family and friends and charities you'd be amazed how fast you can put the cash so a lot of lottery winners end up bankrupt they end up divorced the end up with drug and alcohol abuse they end up with suicide\nThey lose their jobs are friends even their family and if you're going to say I'm going to keep going in my work every day like always know you're not you know why because every time you show up at work all of your co workers are gonna be resentful\nBecause they got to be there because they need the money and you don't and they know it and if you're going to go out to lunch and not treat everyone you're going to be a pariah\nSo if you think your life is not going to change Oh yes it absolutely well you're going to lose all your friends you got to be ostracized with family if you don't give them enough money to\nSatisfy what they believe is how much money you ought to give them so in addition to having a lawyer\nAnd an accountant and a financial planner you need a personal security team as well the first thing you gotta do is get out of your house because everybody knows where you live he's always do Google your address not only strangers but crooks\nMight come and do you harm they might come and challenge threaten your family members in order to extort from you blackmail\nYou so you need to go to an undisclosed location choose a suite at the rich to be with me and have a security detail around your your life is going to change in ways you have never thought possible because you need personal security and when it comes to gifts to families and friends well let's think about this for a minute\nHow much money you're going to give your mom you just met it\nAfter tax four hundred and Ninety two million dollars how much you've given them a million bucks you cheap little sun come on you're going to give her ten million\nYou just got a Ninety million dollars how much\nYou're giving your mom how much you've given your dad how much you've given your brothers and sisters how much you've given your children your grandchildren let's say that you decide to\nGive ten people ten million dollars a piece that is a hundred million dollars guess what you didn't give away a hundred million dollars\nBecause when you give away a hundred million dollars you know my friend not them you\nHave to pay a gift tax guess how much the gift tax is forty percent\nWhich means if you give away a hundred million dollars you incur a forty million dollar gift tax now you've just spent a hundred and forty million dollars so of the four hundred and Ninety two that you did you just gave away a hundred and forty of it you're now down to three fifty\nWe haven't even talked about charity let alone Bentley's do you see my point in my friend you got to recognize that winning the lottery\nRequires a massive change and lifestyle massive calculation and preparation and planning because your relationships are going to change with virtually every one you're not going to be able to trust anyone because they're all going to be wanting to know what you can do for them and whatever you do for them\nAnd got to be enough in their opinion\nLet me give you another reason why I didn't buy a lottery ticket instead of buying a lottery ticket if you were to say take the money you would have spent on three lottery tickets three dollars a day instead of buying a lottery every single day you take that three dollars and you invested into the S. and P. five hundred stock index and you do that for forty five years\nI'm On a bet you'll have more than a million dollars is what you'll have\nWon the lottery of course best performances medication future results on your social in the country as a federal ... and therefore my friend now you know why\n[noise] I didn't buy a lottery ticket\nBecause as I often say to friends and family well okay not friends and family what I often say the enemies may you win the lottery because it's often the worst thing that can never happen to you and I mentioned all of this for one simple reason trying to make you feel better for not having one subject\nAren't you glad that you didn't win the lottery I thought so that's why I'm here to help you make you feel good and the reason I'm trying to make you feel good is because you probably have been noticing that not only did not win the lottery on\nTuesday you saw the stock market meltdown on Wednesday and you did notice that\nNot only get you get rich you got a little

modernize sweaters ... modernize Slattery and paid for by a ... type of question three paid for by environment capital of Rhode Island\n[noise]\nWelcome back to the elements show we invite you to send me your questions by audio and that's exactly what George did here says question he sent to ask Rick and Rick Adelman dot com\nI read this is George from California my in laws are both over eighty five years old and have an investment balance that likely could pay for a long term care for those if needed\nMy question is should they maintain any stock investments since they could earn over three percent in bonds and it is unlikely their life expectancy will expose them to significant inflation rate so Rick what do you think thanks\nSo that's a great question George and a lot of folks faced this question in my older years\nI'm In my seventies my ... my nineties I have far more money than I Will ever need to spend even find curb massive medical costs are long term care costs\nBetween pensions and Social Security and the money I've accumulated over my lifetime I have lots of cash and I'm not spending it because I live kind of frugally\nSo therefore we would argue traditional financial planning strategy would argue that you should place all of that money in very conservative investments you should put the money into bank accounts you should put the money into treasuries you should put the money into guaranteed\nInvestments that they might not pay much of an interesting not only pay one or two or three percent puts so what\nYou don't need to earn high returns it's more important that you have protection of your money than that you try to double your money because doubling it isn't going to change your lifestyle but losing half of it could so traditionally we would argue don't take any more risk than is necessary\nTo achieve your goals but let me turn that inside out and give you a different reason why you might want to consider\nA riskier investment strategy and they'll strategy that includes investing in stocks some perhaps even significant degree\nLet's say that you've got a few million dollars saved\nAnd you're hardly touching it and you don't think you'll hardly ever touch any of it because you get plenty of income off of that money you've got plenty of income from pensions and Social Security you only spend a few thousand dollars a month your house is paid for your expenses are low\nAnd you've got this money now ordinarily I Would you know we would say like I said a moment ago\nBut the money to those call today but think about this when you die who gets that money\nI'm willing to assume that you are going to leave that money to your surviving spouse and ultimately to your children and your grandchildren\nIn other words if you have a very high degree of confidence that this money will outlast you and will ultimately be transferred to your kids and grandkids\nYou could argue that that money really isn't yours it's bears and you are merely the steward of that money\nYou're the custodian your the caretaker of that money and if you know that you're going to transfer that money to your children and grandchildren who will use it for their lifestyles and their personal financial needs and the achievement of their financial goals\n\nWell then maybe we should be investing the money with their goals in mind\nMeaning that if your son or daughter had the million dollars they would invested in stocks because they would have a long term time horizon and they would want to earn a return that net of taxes and inflation is growing and real economic terms\nTherefore we could argue you should be investing the money not based on your age but based on ... and if your kids are in their fifties or sixties if your grandkids are in their twenties or thirties then maybe you should invest in a portfolio allocation that mirrors them and not you\nKnow we want to make sure we're not doing so to the point that we are really placing you at financial risk or jeopardy but I think we could strike a healthy balance between protecting you for your lifetime while also having an eye toward the legacy of protecting your children's financial\nFutures as well and on that basis we could in fact argue that you should have stocks in your portfolio\nTo what degree should it be ten percent of the portfolio fifty percent of the portfolio somewhere in between the only way to know for sure is to meet with us all sit down with one of my colleagues here at the firm\nSo that we can examine the entire family dynamic look at what your true expenses are relative to the income available and the resources and design what that strategy might be taking into consideration the circumstances with your children and grandchildren\nSo don't automatically assume that the older you get you shouldn't have any money in stocks instead look at it as an intergenerational family dynamic because after all that's exactly\nWhat it is so George thanks so much for your question if you would like to have this conversation with us you can do so just cause to Tripoli to plan wreck or visit us online at rice

development is continuing MIT has announced that they're creating a new\nCollege focusing on artificial intelligence backed by one billion dollars\nIn funding just imagine what MIT is going to come up with over the years with that kind of resource focusing on a on\nHow about in the world of transportation Colorado was now building a smart have it's a pavement that will act like a tracking piled on your mouse it'll know your speed and direction and if you leave the pavement at a trajectory and speed that is on safe\nThe automatically notify emergency responders or someone right off the road how

Bluetooth connection and it can destroy anything Amber Alert or announcements cars than stolen if the vehicles parked it can display ads making use the money it can pay the toll\nI mean this is you

autonomous vehicles in certain communities\nSo you don't have to go to the store anymore to go grocery shopping you order your food on a nap and they will deliver it to you\nAnd they won't be anybody driving the car\nI you know what else GM is doing they're launching a new peer to peer car rental service think about that so where do you rent a car when you go to rent one you gotta have us you've

insurance\nPretty cool huh is all this explaining why the evidence of self driving cars the advent of cars on demand the advent of borrowing cars are renting them only as needed that the number of

down\n[noise] this is the first time in over twenty five years that the average cost of tuition declined at both public and private colleges are you ready for how much prices fell one hundred dollars\nOr you say we want to have well okay let's not get terribly excited but look I mean college costs have been rising seven\nPercent per year on average for the past twenty five years according to the College Board and now prices were flat they didn't rise seven percent which means of college was going to cost ya twenty five grand\nIt's now twenty five grand one hundred as opposed to seven percent increase of thousands of dollars so this is really very exciting news and demonstrating slow but sure\nThat college is becoming more affordable I Believe we're going to see this trend continue we already have colleges that are freezing tuition we have private schools that are offering to charge with public schools pay we have out of state schools charging with in state students pay\nWe have states that are providing free tuition half a dozen of them so far around the country we have companies that are providing free tuition as an Employee Benefit Disney Chrysler gee uh see I\nUh we have Walmart and Starbucks all offering free tuition for employees it's really very exciting it doesn't mean you don't need to be saving for College of course you do the good news is the amount of money

the college savings\nPlans network the average account is only twenty four thousand dollars yeah that's not going to pay for college for your kid and oh by the way less than half of parents who have a child headed to college less than half of parents\nAre saving in a five twenty nine plan so none of the parents are saving for college not enough for setting in the right place and not enough for setting enough money so yeah college costs it looks like they're stabilizing but that's not enough to do the deal so um I Hope you're paying attention to that and I want to share with you the
