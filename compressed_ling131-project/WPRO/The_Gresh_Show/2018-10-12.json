from what I read your thought maybe he would go later in the first round but I Know you noted at the time\nHey this allows the chiefs to continue what they've built Mike how they go on about putting this group together for this seat\nYeah I mean you you have to look at the head coach and Andy Reid is a very often minded coach or the first thing he did when he got Kansas City was was the kind of a rebuild the ... line which he's done and there are solid office line at this point but what's amazing is the group a skill position players\nHe's put together and you start with diary kill and Travis Kelsey why think or two of the special offers some players in the entire national\nFootball league and present different sets of challenges for each of them you know I'm not even including Sandy Watkins who's a former top ten Beck and a heck of a football player so their skill position players were outstanding and I think the drafting of homes that number and a year ago\nWas the best place he could have gone because a Andy Reid\nIs quarterback friendly puts his quarterback and good positions and to have got\nThat group of skill position players make anybody look good and lastly\nYou've got

are beating the Kansas City chiefs and your your boy knows football you know that I put the working on this but I'm telling you if they stick with the ... game they're going to be\nCity because a couple of different things are going to happen it's going to open up play action they're actually going to be successful running the ball and they have a chance to possess\nWhen there are a lot of times that I look at time of position for the New England patriots and think that it really matters because normally this group if they need to score thirty five they can do it if they need to score forty they can do it normally\nWould Tom Brady they find a way to be able to just get enough points regardless of style and the way the game is played but I mean this week possessing the football is important because the bigger the lead they get in the morning to shrink the time but more than I think it's going to cause ... homes\nA little bit of a panic and you're going to be able to see it on New England nation coming up on the Fox Providence this Sunday at eleven thirty AM as we a break I I did some play breakdown\nAnd there are things that you can do to slow down ... homes but one\nOf them is get the lead and slow down this Kansas City all fence force them to be efficient and that's where he put a lot of pressure on the quarterback\nThere is not a situation in professional football than I Am worried about Tom Brady handling and I think that's the difference between the New England patriots and a lot of other teams I could probably count on one hand\nThe amount of quarterbacks that regardless of the situation they're going to know how to handle it may be either experienced it or they prepared for it and they've got sworn that mindset to be able to handle whatever's thrown at them\nAnd clearly Patrick homes has not dealt with any of that and listen maybe will be here on Monday and\nMaybe the jaycees in east Providence and people like that and I'm only bought some uh boy Jaycee with the people who are rare they're ugly head when the patriots losing get on these phone lines at one eight hundred three two one WPRI row for three eight\nNine seven seven six did they started to come out because the patriots lose the game and maybe I'll be dead wrong and maybe\n... homes will pass the test or Brady or somebody else in this all ... themselves\nI just continue to look to Kansas City and see how teams have run the ball and all I keep thinking of is the patriots are going to do that on Sunday\nAnd they got to win those critical runs as well we'll talk more about that and other preview for Kansas City in New England with our friend Bob so see the voice of the New England patriots he will be a board in twenty minutes at six thirty five don't miss it here on the grass show\nOn WNPR oh of course we have the convergence of sports this weekend and I know some of your going to have to put some thought ... thought excuse me into\nHow you're going to consume all of the great sports this weekend\nSo tomorrow it starts with Bruins hockey they move their came up to three o'clock\nBecause at eight o'clock or just after eight o'clock it is Red Sox Astros she get Bruins on Saturday\nYou also get me three thirty on NBC Sports Boston calling UNH homecoming game which trust me you want to see the suit I'm wearing it's pretty dope or even ... degrees or friend or or per se Russell bird otherwise known as Perry who's also don't want to start seeing that as it may\nThen you get Saturday Night Red Sox baseball then on Sunday you have all the NFL and then you have Red Sox and patriots on the same time roots I'm going to ask you to make Sophie ... choice you can only watch one\nRed Sox for patriots what are you watching I'm watching the patriots\nI'm with you because I think if I planted correctly that game really goes off at eight or nine and kick off as an eight twenty you Joe let that I'll see David Price crap his pants and get pulled out of the game then I can flip through the patriots and then figure out the red socks off a little bit later on\nThat certainly sounds like a sound us strategy there Andy but uh you know I happen to have one of those newfangled televisions that has the picture in the picture that all the kids are talking about [laughter] I'll be able to pull off watching both at once but uh since your question in the spirit of your question Adrian will dominate the larger portion of the screen offer as long as that game as close\nOkay now here is something that I'm really serious about but no one's talking about anger is about oh I Know that because this one could affect the plight okay\nDo you remember back in old for I Want to say it was when the patriots are playing Tennessee at home and they were showing Red Sox highlights from the playoff game\nEnjoy at stadium so what you had was a ... a patriots had the ball right certain tan and its\nBrady walking them up to the line and then the background you here\nAnd people go nuts\nOn an all sense of certain ten where you need people to shut up\nBut why was that because they're running highlights of the red Sox game was one of the first people to complain about it and no no\nNo of the players how it should I mean given and again I completely flipped on this guy because as a member of the media he's fantastic penny Bruce was the first one\nIs in a moment and whining about how well you're always noise on like that say he was one of those guys who I\nAm at the you know at that point had to speak up and say something and then it turned into well the patrons don't like the red Sox and what are they playing this earth yeah what's your line rich pet tend to fall in with our pets [laughter] right so there's oh there was but\nI Will roll the patriots resist\nRunning Red Sox highlights I think they're going to be smarter about it and they'll sort of run it whenever there in commercial break\nI Would think they're smart they wouldn't be smarter about it but uh that for me anyway is one of those behind the scenes deals that I'll be following along on Twitter to see if Fenway is showing patriot highlights and if it Gillette they're showing Red Sox highlights\nBecause again the last time that all happened players were bitch about it afterwards\nThat's why I said it's a real fish are very serious one eight hundred three two one W.

Sunday night right here on WPRI oh patriots and the Kansas City chiefs and we welcome in our friend Bob so see Mr so see how are you this evening\nI'm doing great anti good to be with you again on your right biggest game of the year for the battle the biggest games you're in the NFL\nNo question and is this a must win for the patriots given what could be home field ramification\nAlmost when it's quite a statement to make but when you consider what Kansas City has done already with is five and I'll start\nHaving one other Pittsburgh having eaten Jacksonville and I still think the Steelers could be there in the end is going to ask you can better\nShe's talking about those two teams in particular uh they've gone on the road and they won over the chargers within their division one at Denver within their division or they've gotta strap on games coming up\nThe middle portion of the schedule and then they end here with the predominantly a home based schedule last month of the season it would be very difficult to catch\nA if the patriots were to fall further behind when you're talking about the race for the top seat in the sea so from that standpoint it's a critical game and I think also it's a statement game and a lot of ways and and that's the phrase is way over used in our business but\nFor the patriots defense for example going up against this high powered Kansas City often\nIf there are indeed to show that they're in a groove unit over what we saw the last year ... we saw in the weeks two and three there'd be no better way to do it then with a solid enough performance against Kansas City that shutting down the cheese but making enough plays to give the patriots often the opportunity to score moms that company\nBob we saw in Kansas City and we've seen Kansas City in the past and I know they made the switch your quarterback and they've gone with Pamela homes you play very well but in what ways are the Kansas City chiefs different from the team the patriots dealt with flash here\nWell I took a couple of different things stand up for me I don't think the Kansas City is as good defensively and they struggle a for large stretches last year defensively but you know right now when you look at them\nThere's a strong likelihood that just the east and then they're barrier playing this game uh they're both doubtful of the chief secondary is really beat up no longer is there Derrick Johnson back there in their line backing group no longer ... Ali\nThere as well and it used to this guy to add a couple of sacks against the patriots back in twenty four scene at a sack against patriots last year\nOr the ... the guy who really did a great job of frustrating ... last season and we won defensively are buried tours left Achilles in that game and he's been bothered by white heel injury that's kept him out of a lineup ball all season long date\nNow that from the defensive side often ... I think this cat that each team is better because of my home and the people ability consistently Alex with last year through the long fall far better than at any point in his career\nBut I think with ... there's a different dimension you know certainly you look at Albert Wilson versus Sammy Watkins and the way that she has used Watkins that's far this season at least with one really a breakout game\nYou know there is maybe an upgrade their it's an extra year of experience for a guy like Kareem Hunt Cal she's onto a terrific START I think it's a comparable team all fence to flee\nAt every position and better at quarterback the what the patriots face last year\nBond so the the voice of the patriots with me here each and every week on the ground show on WNPR oh previewing these Sunday night battle with the Kansas City chiefs again you can hear with an aide twenty kick with Bob and so\nSo ah Bob I don't know if you were around for you know there's been these narratives with the patriots almost a year to year why oh they win the coin toss then they're going to defer because they want to double up the score and I know there was a year or two where it was got us for first got to put those points on the board and\nAmphibians the Newt's route an abundance and all the time outdoors in the great outdoors ... and then I Will but my wife's ... does have other family members we hunkered down in front of TV sets it was a ... and the chiefs\nAnd then on Monday after a brief trip down to Fox runs you let stadium came back and we did the pumpkin thing\nI took my daughter for some uh pumpkins and hot apple cider\nAnd it was great it was really an awesome weekend\nYeah that is a New England uh like why is he a television show right there my friend and that is a very down on the freeway you can Robert thank you I appreciate it have a great call on Sunday night and I will do it again next week thank you very much at\nBanks daddy pretty shaded\nGlass show interest on W.

quality performers always been important to me when it comes to maintaining our home I look for those same quality that's why it was a no brainer choosing garage headquarters\nAnd I think the players really took note of that and and didn't like it now that that uh have anything to do with the Boeing out in the divisional series\nFor the second straight year probably not but uh and and you have to also understand that a Alex core\nA judge Judy Martinez you know drunk Carlton have Judy Martinez and so that had to add a many wins to the process and are you also are marching is obviously impacted other guys around them like ... like ... or\nA you know and so those guys got better because he was there so I'm you know all those things factored in and and plus the core played\nIn a much weaker a division a than last year the Orioles were just dreadful this year as opposed to a year ago when they were somewhat ...\nAnd so all of that added to it and uh uh but having said that you know uh\nHe pushed all the right buttons to kinda reminded me a little bit like twenty Thirteen when the red Sox so insurance and signed you know about eight new free agents and put them on the team and federal manage them very well and uh you hardly ever had a complaint about\nAnything federal did that year and I think there was the same kind of situation with core\nNick ... part of the Boston Globe talking the red Sox Castro's here on the ground show on WNPR oh\nAre you to the point now where you just not worried about Chris Sale anymore he's only got a couple of starts niqab I've gone up and down about jeez this guy really going to be ready\nFor you know at this point if everything goes grade he might have to throw one twenty five thirty more innings de ... are you confident that he can lead it rare if he wants to\nKnow I'm not confident of that I I I think he's a he's not the same\nAs he was earlier in the year and you can see that as velocity even though it was on the uptick his last time out\nUm you know you can you can tell you it's a wall after a while you know he's not able to go seven eight innings you know maybe he will in this series as the adrenaline starts to flow a little bit but um I think to ask them to do that would be a little too much I'm not sure he can\nSo I'm you know you just have to take\nWhat you can get and hope that the uh five or six innings that you can pitch will be dominant innings wished they certainly have been so far\nAnd ah I think that's the most you can expect out and if you can never get seven or eight out of um how how bite my tongue on me but uh I just don't think that's going to happen\nWhen you look at David Price it just seems I I don't I don't even know how to describe it any more Nick disconnect or whatever you know it just it just ain't happening what they need this guy to pitch well he's saying all the right\nThings Nick but\nHe's a he's a smart guy like he's aware of everything around him I Can't help but think that some of the playoffs stuff now that the microscope and now that he's under the microscope excuse\nMe is maybe in his head\nWhat did you read and how do you rationalize what has happened to David Price in the postseason over the course of his career and now we're in the states couldn't be high\nYeah I think you hit it I think it is and has had a you know I I Can't to think it would be any anything else and and he is a very smart guy he might be the smartest guy on the team a but he uh he definitely maybe over things things sometimes\nAnd done certainly we know we as a Yankee phobia going on there you know and as this credit kimbrell for that matter and um you know I think the good news is that a crisis a pitch well against the Astros\nPitched well into storage so this year pitch well as a reliever last year against them six and two thirds scoreless innings [noise] um so at least maybe that's that part\nIs finally gone or where he doesn't have that Yankee thing going so maybe he'll he'll be good but you're correct I mean uh for this team to beat the disasters teen sale and price has to be\nYou know as good as they can be I mean this is what David and Brodsky planned on when he you know a assigned David Price to that massive contract and when he obtained Chris Sale you wanted to have that one two punch from the left side\nUm you know going deep into the season winning the world series with those two guys so you know we'll see if they can execute that ah that division\nNick how do you see Alex Cora managing second base third base capture are you expecting a lot of movement within the line up at those positions or you know at some point if somebody gets hot all horror just ride a hot hand\n[noise] well yeah I think he would rather hot and but I think you'll see a you know it was somewhat of a platoon at second base where\nKids were faces the or the left these are and that the Colts will face the right he's a you know it could also be that hold the moves over to first base or if uh I'm Mitch moral and can't to play you know and\nAnd they'll determined not to abide by noon tomorrow are they going to try to give it as long as possible\nSo um yeah and and he's also a candidate for third base so\nThink we'll see a lot of rock cold too even though he may not be a quote starter um I think cool warmed up seeing him on a lot and that's seven game series a at a at those various positions so I'm a he'll be a big part of it and um you know probably see a little bit of ... to them that depends on how new is does\nUh you know obviously he had a little bit of a\nInjury there toward the and the last play the game and do they say he's okay and you will be on the roster um so but we'll see if he holds up you know last year he ah he didn't hold up right he a knee buckled on his right at that and he was gone to the series so we'll have to see how that plays out\nNick how far do the Boston Globe national baseball writer here on the grass show on WNPR oh Mitt from afar it feels like the Astros are approaching this as if they're hunters\nThere playing with swagger it's almost like you know what we're going to validate what we did last year by attacking this year the way we did last season in terms of attitude and their intensity\nIs that too easy of a summary on my part or you catching that vibe from these Astros as well [noise]\n[noise] oh yeah they've given that vibe really for the last six weeks or so you know they you know for them they started out a fairly pedestrian uh they're they're often she wasn't a nearly as good as it was last year\nAnd then all of a sudden the fence\nBegan to click is guys started to get healthy you know there are still two very for a while he came back he's starting to hit their last spring or for a little bit he's starting to like you did\nAnd the Marlins Gonzales has always been a good coach a postseason type player he's he's on the only guy that's not really doing much as Korea that short stop and uh you know you hit a home run up taking his last at bat against Cleveland so maybe he's turned the corner but that pitching staff has just a really tough I mean\nA Berlin under and uh and cold at the top of it and and listen to the red Sox have had some success against rural and during the past so they\nYou know he he doesn't frighten them or anything like that ... is a great pitcher in cold the same way or the red Sox can hit Garrett toll but ah if he's on a you know that's going to be awfully tough so\nUm yeah they do have that's where I go and make sure that the defending champions they they won a hundred and three games and ah you know they ah they're a team that uh had to fight a little bit too you know they had to fight off the uh\nThe mariners there for a while and and uh and uh and so they are you know they they were in a fight they they just didn't run away with it uh this year\nOr next class thing for a a a who's got the better bullpen in this series begins a kind of feels like that both both pens are\nAt least a little bit of a mess I Know Houston tried to make some moves to to shore up their bullpen but they were staying away from certain guys toward the you know during the regular season how do you read both bullpen\nAccused as much better I I think you've got their act together are often over the past month or so um you know and and you know they wound up also using a couple of their extra stars when it's more colors junior and calling the queue and the bullpen and both worked out very well\nAnd uh Roberta was soon though you know we all thought that uh you would have trouble going from Toronto to Houston but\nYou know he's turned out to be fine and uh and uh you know so they get a\nYou know some good ah Tony's simple left the illegitimate left you can go up against another lefty um so I I like their ...\nAnd you know I think sooner uh right now it's been a better place than the correct kimbrell\nAt nic part I Want to give ... followed

basketball over there kind\nOf walk me through it tell me what you and your teammates were able to learn about each other and becoming a team when you took that trip over in August\nYeah that was a great experience for the team we came really close together that was a great for us we are plus which will meet every time we went to a different location and go into a lot about it illegal to sell\n'em just took a lotta on vacation like tours um lose relaxing and it was great bonding experience or we went on on the on the water um got some great views and it was just all around great trip\nTen minute I Know coach told me that you guys weren't going to practice over there you were going to see the world you were going to experience things and then just play games\nHow different was that for you to not you know have walked through search shooter rounds necessarily or anything like that where you were really able to take care of the culture but also get some basketball work done at the same time in a competitive situation\nI mean yeah I'm kind of left it up to us on how much work we wanted to put in outside of the a basketball court I'm obviously the leader that team me as a a oh we got we make sure you guys were still ready to go when we played with other teams whether that was getting on the treadmill\nGetting into steam room just getting some type of activity um\nBut
