All right so do they have a cold right\nThere are a couple of pickles on the board we got the jets and the Broncos and the Detroit Lions and the Green Bay Packers\nAren't going with both home teams and those matchups green base to banged up and Denver or something like one in nine on the road against the spread indeed Vance Joseph era so uh yeah coming up a short when he was terrible trend yup okay how bad the jets are all going to take them and they pick 'em spot there\nSo both Detroit and jets I like to pick 'em\nI'll take the Minnesota Vikings last three on the road at Philadelphia\nMinnesota had some extra time after that a game against around\nHouston minus three against Dallas and New Orleans minus six and a half against that a legit football team that they have going in Washington so again jets lions Vikings Texans and saints are the NFL Hicks does your and there you go back to ... while that's the stuff is up with\nA pack of pick from bags modern men right there yeah ... yeah\nI gave a Perry was all over me I get a college game euro gave him and I don't know if you like this or not it was you know I think I did hear what you do the mob Michigan against Maryland Michigan mine is Seventeen and a half at home again tomorrow\nYeah I Do not have that pick that was on the short list a I Believe that lost out to West Virginia against Kansas I just got on your own I'm looking at like ... nothing or something like that in that game I which means ah yeah the fighting Chuck ... or formerly will probably make a fool out of me but I don't care if he's really fat and uh\nBut Kansas ended on a great job I don't care how long has been coach there but I'm going to say is the Kansas is better of the problem is drawing from zero when something like one is an improvement for them\nYeah West Virginia really uh through the hammer down against a much superior Texas Tech team last week so no reason to think they can't do it against Kansas as well\nWill hurt or might be a New England patriots next year that I left that out yeah I can see a will Greer and the patriots being a match a\nLike an older guy married with the kid real dedicated to football\nHe his brothers are actually pretty famous I guess if you're into a YouTube personalities I'm not a big group brothers apparently are oh ... now they're the ones are letting that\nPop tart on fire and that commercial ... that looks like YouTube stars I don't really know what's going on yeah I don't know if that's a I don't know if that I mean I Know very few YouTube stars sly guy no the the Paul dude went over to Joanna yeah showed people were dying over there and what not and never will ... brothers are ah\nYeah for for June that stars final hour of the ... shall we go around the NFL next\nGrab align the comments section is always open with crash we request the pleasure of your company for a free exchange of ideas one eight hundred three two one W.

Miami yeah but that's still my point that you cited as the great success up there before I just think Jimmy Graham was never a tight end\nAnd agree and didn't start getting used as one until he left New Orleans now again\nIt's not like these other teams that have had Jimmy ... since he's left the saints have been lining up to ask them to block like our buddy Twain Allen route but they have been using him and more traditional packages in terms of he's a tight end and he's going to be are tight end and he'll be able to grow up for us\nI think you know I I don't know if it's injury situation or a scheme situation but to answer your question pretty much the second he left New Orleans it's been all downhill more or less for\nJimmy ... which is pretty amazing when you think about it a germ Michael Finley Jared Cook ... tell us Bennett yeah those are some of the guys over the past couple of years who have been playing there with Aaron Rodgers and again you would think the Jimmy grand\nWould be able to eat and eat big but not the case Smith Jacksonville like Kansas City arguably the game of the weekend rude shock Casey a course on feed it to everybody loves themselves some uh pacman homes right now\nI think Jacksonville is going to go in there and make it really difficult on them I can see this game coming down to a game winning feel go literally\nAs time expires and it's one of those where you know Jacksonville beat in England so do you want to Jacksonville don't win this game or do you want to Kansas City to win so New England gets the head to head against Kansas City yadda yadda yadda that's why I Want kids yeah we get into all those different tie breaker buddy Jacksonville is going to beat him up physically\nYeah I mean I don't know this is a great test in terms of camp Kansas City be beaten up physically and does it matter if you beat them up physically because I'm On the page uh with\nWith our friend out here where you know Jacksonville secondary is obviously or should obviously make things a little more difficult for patent homes them not previous opponents have made it\nBut you know we've learned whether it's deion Sanders or Darryl reverse it doesn't matter the cover corner and how quickly they are going to be elected in the hall of fame\nIf you want to quarterback scramble you make all those guys extremely ordinary mhm so as great as our Duvall friend Jay Lynn Ramsey is and the opera mentioned defensive backs in Jacksonville they are very good and they should put up a good fight but the second homes gets out of the pocket whether he's running it or just scrambling\nA you know all bets are off in terms of the defense of backed field and I think that's where there'll be able to get it over the top with hill and Kelsey and their variety of weapons Jacksonville as tough and I'm sure they'll try to impose their will\nBut I think like I sort of mentioned off the top I think it's sort of Utah and okay impose your will that will just get my home's outside of the pocket unless you injure him while he's out there and I like his chances of picking\nYou that is what I Wonder about uh Jacksonville is will they take a shot and will they do something that's borderline sort of rattled the cage ... homes that's the kind of team that I could see doing that and then them send their own Duvall doing their thing Denver is that the New York jets I Know you pick the jets earlier this one roots\nOr I even though it's the mountain time zone a I've never been a fan of teams coming East I'm also not a fan of teams coached by parents\nShows swells so here you're not a good football you always and you the better it's like to mention the west coast east coast oh team struggling west from the west coast time zone okay well that gender bumped into really is no edge there however there still is an edge not why I picked the game\nThere still is more noticeable edge for teams traveling from mountain time to east coast time again it is probably completely irrelevant ah but now I think\nIt is I think it's a real deal man I I look it's just like going to Denver and dealing with the elevator\nYou know there are certain things that can get into your head about it as well right whether they're real or not right and I just I I just don't trust them for a very I found out there to\nSkip the frantic for me at the end of the day or one of the other games or the weekend I think we'll be Atlanta at Pittsburgh there's a lot of focus on Pittsburgh right now to see a federal thing is going to come crumbling down\nAs the pet chewing skilled players continue to bicker at each other and sort of take jabs at most recently it was Antonio Brown are talking about how his relationship with better office burgers like intermittent working why phi\nWhich I thought it was a pretty interesting analogy\nBut two teams here who clearly need a when I Would say ... is more desperate than Pittsburgh going into this one\nYeah you're probably right but all going to go back to what I said about the Bengals in falcons what I said about the Bengals again earlier Pittsburgh loves to do a lot of ah they're passing game around the line of scrimmage we know guys like J. J. Smith Schuster Antonio Brown can beat you over the top\nBut guys like brown and whether it's Connor or the running back or Jesse James or Vance McDonald or they like to do a lot of horizontal passing or whether it's the screen game or what have you and again Atlanta struggles greatly with expect a lot of screens to Antonio Brown or on the line of scrimmage\nThe Atlanta defensive backs and their line back in court they cannot cover players out of the backfield whether they're running backs titans wide receivers it doesn't matter or that they just have a really big problem when it comes to stopping those types of plays\nAnd unfortunately for them those are the types of plays that Pittsburgh excels at running maybe more so in Libya on bells in line up but they still should be able to get enough of those places that I like their chances against\nThe falcons yeah I think it's going to turn into a game and the thirty ...\nThirty eight thirty five yeah and like that that neither of these teams can stop I picked up yeah I don't know if he did or not let's say a no he doesn't have that game\nAnd now now the giants are at Carolina or the this is your prototypical a Nineteen Thirteen game here this week\nWhich is funny 'cause the spread I Do believe it's six something funny ... is that Kim Newton is terrible coming off the by terrible against the spread and straight up coming out to buy you usually don't expect you expect everyone to be better off the by but not so much with the Carolina Panthers but a den York's New York giants are terrible\nBut as long as ... I'm Barkley puts up numbers that's all I care about about the New York giants you go and I think there are a lot of fancy players who were with me on that I speak for many many fantasy players and saying that just gets the Koran Barclay eighty yards in the end zone and all of us fantasy fans will be happy\nAll the rest of 'em want Barclay to get stuff for the giants fall behind by Twenty one so then sterling shepherd and oh del back um junior to the third can reach\nThe end he a hotel back um junior is going to be a big disappointment this year uh I unless it's garbage time you get the overall numbers up\nI just don't see him having like a hundred catch season in four o'clock games that four or five eastern Oakland is apt to LA\nThe LA Chargers that it should be a home game for the raiders and and here's the thing about the raiders Roach it seems like they're going to play a ton of games in the thirties and the forty F this'll be another one group is figuring out using their car and scoring points now in the modern day and that's really good idea yeah they'd just gotten ... now that\nNone whatsoever their second round pick of last year or two years ago over email and phone who they caught him we know they tried to kill him Mac\nIt's going to take some time before they can rebuild that defense but often somebody I think they're figuring out they can score or Minnesota in Philadelphia another big Markey game that one is going to be on Fox\nOr look being in Philadelphia I think it gives the advantage but this is this is rock 'em sock 'em robots twenty four twenty three something like that just written all over it or hard fought game but I like Minnesota to find a way to beat filling in\nAbsolutely so do I I think it's clear that the Vikings are the better team not some leaps and bounds rams versus everyone else\nA type of better team but I think Minnesota's better obviously\nYou know we don't like to use the word rematch with all the changes of the personnel and such but there are enough of those games that are going to have remembered that NFC championship game and want revenge yup and Philadelphia just haven't really looked at that good they're still dealing with injuries they're not they're full on health right now whether it's ... or ... lament the fact feels kind of a mess\nAnd yet ... whether it's falls or once they just have to look like\nThey really started clicking on our fence yet whereas Minnesota\nTroy Brown David pat and just trying to find some of those uh other names are funny name when they wrote to him or right I

earlier taking them out of school early\nSo there's a whole lot of of factors that go into this above and beyond whether or not we have buses that show up or not um and and then you add the the added stress or a of the students with special needs you know all students\nAre impacted by students with special needs are\nAdversely impacted to a more significant degree because there's a lot more services that are provided to them during the school day speech and language occupational therapy\nUm typical therapy counseling et cetera um then they may be missing 'em if they're not able to get to school\nAnd so Mary Beth collaborators on the line the Providence teachers union president listen I uh I I Know somebody in a different state that she worked on you know on the buses as a as an aid and with special needs and this is one of those situations where you can you hear in a lot in these last few days\nWe'll just get another bus put them on the ... ... there's a lot when it goes into this with with a lot more actually than to live with needs right\nCorrect and and we have a lot of uh what people don't understand is even though our public school system we have a lot of significant medically fragile students so cutthroat kids are school but I mean there are rip the bus\n... is not an answer or because the buses that that we have we also provide the cw childcare worker services we have school or you know are just as a\nTeacher assistants et cetera um art teacher assistants how they're coming to the school\nTo provide the sister at that school level to get students to do ... school and help them from the time that dropped off to the time they get picked up so you know where it is you know the the the comment it takes a village of corny but it's the truth\nYeah um and so we're we're trying to do the best that we can to shore that while they're in our care everyone is safe and they're getting all the services and the needs met that that that that are required in in terms of all students not just the the medically fragile\nBut it's not as simple as or um you know just throw them out of ... and um you know I I learned or you know it's like one of those for what happened at Central I we're we're we're\nWe're we're Central High school was that I get to their own or about you know handicapped accessibility there are I apparently there's over the border to vehicles equipped for handicapped I'm\nAccess in the city and all of them is not working right now properly and and so ... and we have over a thousand students that require that kind of transportation so it's it's a mess it'd be quite Frank\nNo understood and I'm a ... a gallon documented the absenteeism should out his strength started and it you know it's it's a tipping down and down the ... and then you get behind so what are the teacher saying how is it affecting the teachers the classrooms and the children\nSo our morale is already you know I mean all time low road I don't have to tell you that you know we we've talked I like I said to the mic who introduced me I'm On the phone you know I talk to you guys will that I talk about\nThe you know it's no secret that\nMorale is probably as low as it has there\nSince I started teaching and so to have and we had a very you know broken up month of September with um you know election a primary and uh we had a\nReligious holidays et cetera so we were we were just getting started you know and it just got our footing for starting school year with full week that are having full attendance and then you know this happened so it's it's a it's a struggle\nAnd um our our teachers are trying and and and we will continue to to work\nDo the best that we can or does that come up to us and we'll have to have to figure out a way to assist those students where they're able to recover and I'm hoping that that sooner rather than later you know to me are\nUm so that when those kids come back but they haven't missed such a significant saw that you know was not starting at ground zero whatever that day yeah\nWell you know and that's you know that's the thing I Know that they're going to fight over the money that whether it's pension whether it was four O. one K. in the meantime the kids are behind you if you have Seventy five percent attendance\nHow fast the teacher's push through when they know ... you know the other twenty five percent they're going to catch up so you're constantly in a backwards hamster wheel here yeah\nI but I think the Providence our our teachers are extremely adaptive differentiation so that when you're there will be ways for teachers to maintain where where they all are and differentiate for the students\nAnd that will be so very creative\nGrouping in ways to to get students to you know keep up and and ramp up if you will\nFor for last academic and structural part um but it's got to be a struggle and ... and I will take a while it's not going to happen overnight for sure and special education are going to require makeup services for definitely going to require the services\nThat the law that's already been like we're going to do that other good or for our hearts that the law\nThat required by law to have certain number of hours of special education services in whatever area of ... bills\nWhich would be what at the end of the school year which comes out of who's budget\nUm but that would probably come out of the special education budget ... money\nAnd that will have to be determined as to how how that is that it out you know that's a that's a district level decision on that those services for more than likely have to be made up\nAll right so uh most of the parents are I'm sure as frustrated as the teachers are what else um ... what can you do accept you try to hold it together right\nOr trying to hold it together the ... or you know it it wasn't the best they can you know it it's ... it's not easy there there was one of them and they they have the right thing and they need to work just like we need to work\nUm so you know everybody's let's face it we're very high rate what are you hearing there aren't any level is very high or we're just hoping to try to to have you know\nHow to get through this and have as little impact and I know\nIt doesn't seem like that's going to happen but that's little impact because students are as possible\nOrdinary ... president of the province teachers' union or you know I guess hang in there all we can say you've got your own battle going on with mayor all the way to end the contractor and now you're going to strike and we're in

comment but you know that's great to hand over there at this point\nI Know what you're saying mayor alerted came out and said I'll find them money somewhere in the city budget to try to keep them on the roads right\n[laughter] yeah yeah\nI mean they might have to get your own yeah\nYeah you can find it for that he could probably find it for us but you know\nI'm not a rocket scientist but I can draw a picture\nIn line [laughter] All right\nMary ... probably the teachers union president will catch up against you and good luck with everything\nI have a great day so they give you too

began [noise]\nOrigin it on [noise] we restore order in the gallery [noise]\nWith a final vote of fifty to forty eight Brett Kavanaugh becomes the ninth justice to the high court the five

immediately chief justice John Roberts will administer the constitutional out\nAnd retired associate justice Anthony Kennedy will administer de judicial out in a private ceremony at the Supreme Court a formal investor will take place at a later date for Kavanaugh me in case\nInvested in each yes that was you know ten years ago today it's not half a trillion it's three point four trillion dollars that investors have placed into ATF\nAnd that is exciting it shows that hey you're getting the message that's that's really fabulous you're paying attention to diversification you're paying attention to investment cost a and you're staying up to date with the investment opportunities which maybe aren't the same as you grow up with what you were familiar with\nBut you've accepted that need to adapt\nAnd stay current with the marketplace so I think that's a really very exciting\nOr is it\nIf we take a look at data that has just come out from a recent survey\nBack ten years ago to the credit crisis of two thousand eight you know it's great that ATF skyrocketed and in value from five hundred billion to three point four trillion you know part of that as market appreciation of course but a big part of it is your contributions into ATF as well\nBut not everybody's been\nTaking advantage of that and I'm not just saying that they're not taking advantage of vps themselves they're not taking advantage of investing at all ten years after the crisis we discover according to this latest survey research that twenty seven percent of Americans\nStopped saving for retirement they stopped contributing\nTo their four one K. entirely they were so spooked by two thousand eight they lost so much money so rapidly\nThat scared them out of the markets apparently for ever twenty seven percent one out of four Americans no longer saving for their future and fourteen percent have continued to save what they're doing so in\nCash oh my goodness so instead of\nWatching their investments triple and values since two thousand nine I mean that's what the stock market has done its tripled in value instead they've been earning less than one percent a year 'cause that's what you know bank accounts have been paying over the last ten years zero point nothing\nOnly ten percent of people in the survey said they invest more today than they were in two thousand eight two thirds are saving less today than they were and\nAlmost eighty percent say they can't explain what happened in the financial crisis they don't get it they don't understand what occurred\nAnd so it's no wonder that Seventy eight percent trust Wall Street less than they did in two thousand mate and only forty one percent say they feel\nFully recovered financially in the face of an economic expansion unraveled in American history with the stock market tripling and values since its depths of two thousand nine\nThe majority of Americans still say that they earn behind where they were ten years ago and you know what the biggest crisis is about all of that\nEverybody's ten years older everybody's ten years closer to retirement and that's the big problem and just permeates through out American society regardless of age group according to another survey forty six percent of millennials said\nThey believed that they need at least a thousand dollars to start investing Seventeen percent say they think they need at least ten thousand dollars\nTo start investing that's simply true anymore do the advanced technology you can invest you can open in account with the dollar not a thousand not ten thousand I'm not suggesting

talking in the last segment about the astonishing amount of money the parents are spending on their kids who are in their twenties and thirties\nAnd how it's impacting the parent's ability to save for their own retirement and how kids are now recognizing that they're struggling with their own personal finances but it's not just\nThe parents are damaging their own financial security for the benefit of their kids and that their kids are scared that they're not going to be able to accumulate enough money on their own\nThere's another survey that shows the reversal of this that it's going back up line\nSixty four percent of teenagers according to a new survey by junior achievement sixty four percent of teenagers are concerned about their parent's ability to retire\nSo in other words mom and dad you're doing a great job doing whatever it takes to support your children\nAnd you know what your children know it even to the point that your teenagers are worried about your financial future\nAnd what's really so fascinating about this whole thing is that even though sixty four percent of teens two thirds are worried about their parents preparedness for retirement\nSixty nine percent of teenagers say they know little or nothing about financial planning well actually I think they know a lot more than they realize if they're worried about their parent's ability to save for retirement and their parents ability to in fact retire in financial comfort in security\nWell that's what financial planning is all about and teenagers are looking at you mom and dad\nAnd they're worried about you first of all I think there's something a little bit wrong with our country of teenagers are worrying about their parents' financial security but that's a whole another conversation but here's the problem\nTeenagers in fact as we pointed out earlier on the program today they know very little about personal finance one third of teenagers according to the survey by junior achievement one third of teenagers I Hope you're sitting down for this\nAnd if you're driving the car you might want to pull over as I give you the sister\nOne third of teenagers believe they will need less than five thousand dollars\nIn order to retire [noise]\nOh my goodness gracious they think they're going to need five grand or less in order to retire\nOr a hello I'm so clearly kids have no reasonable conception of what life cost\nThey don't understand how expensive cars are warehouses or food or health insurance\nThey have no clue and you know why because mom and dad you haven't told them I think\nSo my recommendation my advice for you mom and dad is next time you sit down to pay your bills have your teenager stood alongside you have them write the checks on your behalf out of your checking account when you're balancing your checkbook let them participate\nIn gauge with them when you actually go talking about investments include them in the conversation\nKids are worried about this and maybe they don't need to be as worried you know kids are grown up with a lot of stress and stripes they've got challenges\nWith issues you and I never had to deal with when we were growing up school shootings and and massive drunk epidemics and uh oh my goodness gracious the whole political environment and yet the last thing we need to do is to pile on with them worried about your\nRetirement security so I think the time has come to eliminate that last taboo\nIn American society you know we're willing to talk politics with our kids ruined his talk religion with our kids were willing to talk sex with our kids\nIt's time we started talking about money with our kids as well\nHey let's go to our asks Rick segments as you know You're welcome to send me your questions in an audio file just use your smartphone to record your own voice send it to me by email to ask Rick\nAnd Rick Edelman dot com we had two questions this week on the very same subject which is kind of weird but here's the first one from caster you remember him he's from Brazil you call this a couple of weeks ago there was a castor has to say\nHi Ray cares Custer against from Brazil you seemed a little bit surprised was affects that your show was listening to all sorts of other us\nBut I think you really shouldn't because of course I don't pay much attention when they took about four to one case Ross IRAs and stuff like that because the roads here are totally different but\nI Do for her opinion when it comes to principals like financial responsibility a diversification et cetera location dollar cost averaging or or in my case ... and my question is about one of those general principles budget\nIf I'm not mistaken you said here as a shows that budgeting is not a very good use of so much time but the wealth take a look at my case for instance I have two daughters one is eight or ... years old the youngest one would go to a private school next year just like they do this\nSo far I've been able to save a little more literal both twenty percent of my income but was this extra expense you don't make kind of just ... I Want to be able to save as much and I'm going to be facing about tough as much of a lot on saving out\nAnd do a lot I'd like to avoid it with an ... an starting to walk on my budget for just south of Nineteen so I can see where it can cut the expense of my income is pretty much in study I Can't do much about it\nI Know there's not enough just to promise to myself how much I'm going to spend every most but it isn't a place to start some listeners may be facing a similar situation and it suggested for us make a budget turnout\nThanks first time\nWas that was cast her with a really good question about budgets Tim had the very same question let's listen to him\nHey Rick this is Tim from Santa Barbara California\nIt doesn't really matter Chet how you do it provided\nYou do it consistently in other words if you're going to receive a monthly check every December which you said you were doing fine go ahead and do that your dollar cost averaging and reverse you're making withdrawal every December and you'll do that for the rest of your life\nIf you want her to do it on a more frequent basis instead of one check once a year you take twelve checks once a month that's fine to do it however you wish just make sure that whatever you choose you maintain on a consistent basis that's how you will generate the best value\nFrom a reverse dollar cost averaging perspective this way you get the average cost of the withdrawals based on the values of the count at the time what I'm more concerned about\nIs not so much whether you do it once a year or once a month I I'm really not worried about that so much the difference isn't that huge the bigger concern I have\nIs whether you're doing it in conforming with the IRS rules as I mentioned if you don't do it correctly you could pay a fifty percent penalty\nAnd what do I mean by doing it correctly well if you have multiple retirement accounts which most people do they've got an IRA\nMaybe his name and other Iranian her name the guide retirement accounts from several multiple employers in the past\nThe IRS generally says we only care about the total dollar value of the accounts\nBut we separately care if any of those accounts were for a one case in other words you can't take money from an IRA that was meant to be withdrawn from a four O. one K. even though you might have taken the proper amount failing to take it from the proper account\nCreates the penalty problem here's another concern the IRS calculation is not based on the date of the withdraw\nThis is a big mistake that people often make especially if you're withdrawing the money once every month the IRS doesn't face the calculation on when you withdraw the money they base the calculation on the value of the account on the prior December thirty one\nSo based on that you might accidentally withdraw two little\nBased on last year's market values\nConversely you could accidentally withdraw too much more than is necessary causing you to pay taxes unnecessarily\nSo the calculations are complicated the rules are cumbersome and the penalties for ever are usually not only severe but they are and you bang meaning if you try to complain to the tax court\nYour love most likely going to lose that case\nSo we strongly encourage you to work with a financial advisor and attacks advisor\nNot only to make sure the calculations are correct but so that if there is a mistake you're advisor will alone that liability instead of you because you can hold your advisor responsible for negligence or errors or omissions\nAnd a reputable advisor will certainly stand behind their advice to say oh we told you to do it we were wrong we will make you whole not for the taxes you have to pay those but for any interest or penalties that you may incur\nSo be careful make sure you get it right don't mess around when it comes to withdrawals out of your account\nSo that sounds good reckon than we do only have two accounts and uh I Do coordinate with my account so good\nYou make sure they're not the amount is right I always take out an extra two dollars [laughter] very clever so chat I'm Glad you got it on the money I'm Glad you're on the ball there I Wish everybody else was too so thanks very much for your call\nWell You're welcome have a great day you to a that was Jeff from ah Charlotte Hi Marilyn if you have concerns or

the subject here I'm I'm broadcasting as I mentioned to you from San Francisco I'm excited to be here and guess what San Francisco is the home of the headquarters of\nFargo and so we can't have a edition of the show go by without talking about the latest of Wells Fargo\nTheir chief financial officer John ... said this past week that he expects business loans commercial real estate and commercial and industrial own stuff all\nTotal loans were down ... billion dollars compared to prior quarter\nWhy it looks like a lot of people are unwilling to do business with Wells Fargo can't say I blame us regulators have just now rejected Wells Fargo is planned to repay customers who were pushed into buying unnecessary auto insurance\nRegulators are saying the bank must do more to make sure to find every driver who was affected by this the consumer financial Protection Bureau to see if you be and the office of the comptroller of the currency the euro cc\nThey say they need more assurances for most Fargo that they're going to do everything they need to find and repay everyone who was overcharged\nWells Fargo was doing was saying to people who got car loans that in order to get the car loan you must buy auto insurance from us\nEven though people already had auto insurance elsewhere and then Wells Fargo gathered their bank accounts in order to get the payment when people couldn't pay the auto loans Wells Fargo in some cases charge overdraft fees damage their credit and even in some cases repossessed their vehicles\nAccording to the ... see this could involve six hundred thousand drivers\nLast year Wells Fargo said it would take sixty four million dollars to pay everybody back but lawyers representing the drivers say that's way\nToo low a number\nMeanwhile the Justice Department is probing whether employees committed fraud in Wells Fargo spanking you that they want to know the Justice Department if management prompted employees to improperly alter add information of people's accounts\nThe Justice Department wonders if there's a pattern of unethical and potentially fraudulent employee behavior tied\nTo management pressure\nWell along the way Wells Fargo has suspended two executives of federal probe in the purchase of low income housing tax credit is behind it a senior VP and another V. paid the Justice Department is investigating whether the bankers colluded with developers to submit low ball bids on tax credits\nWells Fargo by the way is the largest purchaser nine billion over the last five years of this tax credits and it's not just those two are VPs that have been suspended wells has fired or suspended a dozen other employees at Wells Fargo securities\nAlleging that these individuals charged meals to the company improperly we're talking nine analysts and others from New York San Francisco in Charlotte think about that New York San Francisco and Charlotte\nThree incredibly different locations geographically suggesting this is a system white issue not something isolated to a local office\nWell due to all the above Wells Fargo says they're going to cut staff ten percent over the next three years\nAnd is it any wonder that according to a new survey Wells Fargo staff or more miserable than at any time in the past three years employee satisfaction has weakened staff confidence in the firm's business outlook has dropped to the lowest level since twenty Fifteen\nAnd guess what it was twenty Fifteen before all of these scandals came to life\nYou're listening to the Rick Adelman show McKinsey global Institute has just come
