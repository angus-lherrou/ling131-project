P. R. O. so I Know there are people out there Mike river reported that the patriots were one of the teams chicken the tires on the cardinals in terms of Patrick Peterson at a potential trade he wants out\nA look you I've covered the patriots for a long time Bill Bill with jak doesn't really nearly throw away first round pick 'cause I mean even though they want to get a brand new cooks they turn around and replenished with another first round pick in this year's draft\nMy God what the way the league has changed a guy like Patrick Peterson has great value and I don't know about you but if there's one guy that the patriots should sacrifice for I think it would be him your thoughts on any of this potentially happening\nYeah you know look they have an extra second round pick in the draft that I have a little bit of capital up front\nPlay Ruth I'm sure they would prefer to over one and you have to wonder in terms of Arizona and the suitors who would be willing to give up that one I think\nI made some calls around the league they talk about Peterson as a as a very good teammate has a very good leader and the general consensus seems to be as one of those guys they could probably still play at a high level at corner or another three years is that worth it um\nYour parent him up with ... or ... ... I mean that's\nReally where everybody's throwing the ball or you're forty five times a game or to get an elite player not only is you know we play or is it is a corner but it was a return her\nI think it's something you have to you you really have to consider and if it's true it's a no brainer to on a on a conditional or to one another too I think you think about that too but I'm sure they'd love to hold on that one but when you're talking late first round um\nYou know I can see the best they could make that move\nYeah and it's interesting because Brian McFadden who apparently is Patrick Peterson's cousin which was a nugget that I didn't know\nHe works for a CBS Sports age to you I think it is he tweeted out earlier that the St seagulls when the patriots were in he also tweeted out then apparently Patrick Peterson's ideal trade destination is the saints\nAnd that was a cording to Patrick Peterson who told him that\nNow the issue there is may sacrifice to go get the kid from uh UT San Antonio last year to they don't have a first round paying\nSo that's where the patriots may have a leg up and Mike it's interesting that you mentioned why second round which is contractually it's advantageous to have a second round versus the first round pick and if you're going to be late first schram hey why not cheap you can get some second round currency is well I just I\nI don't know much about you but I think with all of the now dime sets that are becoming as a bomb didn't across the league teams playing Nicole I'm In corners like Patrick Peterson\nHave value like they've never had before and I think I just happen to think now that that guy ... seeing what's going on because more knows these planes three and four safety is way too much already\nYeah and again it's just a ... the the level of talent we're talking here and then you look at their core and look at it like the coroner's quite a bit of Jaycee Jackson but you know and crosses in other guys are trying to develop um but they were banking on Arab world and he can stay healthy and I I like the players just\nThe growing does not it's um once again you know it went out on them these three games comes up and he laughed a half and he's out I'm John Jones was it was a nice player\nPlant I'm On the inside but you can't exposes the outside stuff so ... and look they they've gotten some stuff out of Jason ... uh but I mean there's no comparison between the two played with them and you can somehow make that happen and indeed reworked\nIs deal to give yourself about five million on the cat now I'm at it but I Do a little bit more\nTo uh to make that Peterson straight out from a financial standpoint but if you've gotten this far I'm sure you could define an extra half million somewhere else\nDid the patriots my dodged a bullet with Sony Michel here\nYou know it feels like the guy just can't get any momentum going he get to go on and then he gets ... and hurt once again I Love the point where I think the kid is really going to be a key contributor health dependent obviously\nOr do you think Sony Michel is a star in the making if he can stay on the field\nYeah I mean I I I like them from from jump I didn't I you know I'm not one of those people that are running backs not understanding the argument you look at Karimov is the third round the that can be late in the world up a and he runs a sort of like the doesn't matter what often should put him in his room playing any offers that could start by like\nDoris Sony runs and I like a spin and I I'll tell you that you talked to people around the patriots and they love is a maturity in you know like you saw on those first couple of weeks like your show Neal I\nWas that other station there were harping on the fact by them soon it makes them look like a first round her I'm like you've got to give them a little on the justice need and get his vision girl and then all of a sudden there's a hundred and Ninety there's a hundred again and\nYou got better and every one of those games in my opinion he he may talk that he wasn't making earlier he was seeing things that he didn't he earlier so I I like to play a lot I just you\nKnow there was some red flags some themes in scratch them off the boar because me and then here we go again you already at the need rain but now you know the same it's twisted around and you\nKnow it could be could be a month that could be a little bit more depending on on our fault that new deal but well the thing it's not an ACL but still concerning for sure\nMy G. already of NFL Network with me for a few more minutes here on the ground show on WNPR oh\nI'm seven games in five into are they championship good relative to the rest of the leader or where if any where do you think ballot checked might be looking to improve this roster before next week trade deadline\nI think when you watch the football this year was always you know you start looking around and\nI think they are championship good I don't think there is that teams look the rams are electric bill that defunds actually hasn't been playing nearly subtle level especially when you consider the amount of money they've spent on it um they've struggled a lot of spots so is their talent there to get better in LA for sure but\nI don't think their head and shoulders above everyone else I like the same way that was a nice one for them to Baltimore yesterday Justin Tucker's this extra point or not it played well on the road and their their attacks with me and say see we know they have all the way to me often to the side kinda like you are\nAnd who do you trust the fixed it or get it passed up enough if he decides to weigh in the city or the patriots track record tells me I'm going to buy a dollar check for ground a way to make it a good enough to get out of that at a conference and then you know you get to the final game and\nThe hell knows what happens but I Do I Do I think they're\nThey're not a talented at some of the other teams but when you start comparing them we've seen in New England but when you compare him to other teams Ronald ... I don't think there's that much of a difference in round than\nThe rams are they are any one of those things you want to correct\nAnd Brady is playing magnificent football right now and it seems like the connection with Josh Gordon is grown and grown\nI I Would just say to you know like we made such a we we talk so much about him not being here and the off season I felt like\nIt was there's no way to measure up but I think he looked all that great and I know there was some different things going on to let them know that sort of trying to find your way often for someone who's outside threats but it feels like now we're starting to see him steadily to the last couple of weeks the quarterback\nThat we know we used in controlling there haven't been to many like oh what kind of know was that you know ... I mean maybe the one that doubling who's eight um but by and large I think you're playing once again I really high level and all that often the scary I don't know since ...\nOffers to blow up a lot of points of doing it right now you're you're talking for straight weeks of\nA high school basketball games when I got out of school and I remember coming back to this region Gretchen all of a sudden it was mandatory for about five to seven year period it was mandatory for all basketball players to wear mouth guards look and I and I never I've never worn about garden out never got my mouth injured or any teeth knocked out and now it's kind of a wimp anyway so that's probably it lends itself to that\nA lot you know physically mentally very strong physically there you go and not so much look a lot from strongly week like chicken yes exactly but ah yeah I Can't even imagine playing basketball regularly with the mouse guard a but I Know is is that you're still able to gather enough saliva to hawk a loop should the occasional ...\nYeah I Would uh I I guess I can go with that I just love it there on do punch\nChris Paul Chris Chris Paul has consistently been one of the dirtiest players in league for a long time well there you go he just gets away with it because he's got cool commercials any plays on the team scores a bunch of points she forget the fact that in the playoffs he is also a choking dog\nAnd I won't even get into James Harden who himself is a turn and then he gets well known my thoughts of the cigar store Indian from Syracuse a criminal and\nThat is correct and now they're Davis Brian is in the rearview safely uh you can go back to bashing the various Syracuse a ... do you like\nTo bet well I don't have to bash all of them ... months\nAgo yeah fair fair and you're\nThe Celtics it hits a half against Orlando itself TD Garden and right\nNow Orlando has a forty eight\nForty seven lead over the Celtics I'm sure the cells we'll just have a great fourth quarter and when this game of ... about ten you can hear that on AM seven Ninety reports indicate matrix running backs Sony Michel not seriously injured and yesterday thirty eight thirty one winded Chicago\nIt looks like Michelle may only be out a few weeks World Series game on tomorrow night Fenway Park Red Sox in the LA Dodgers Chris salient quite her shop and the Bruins play in Ottawa tomorrow as\nTheir trip through Canada to ten years if you missed\nA conversation with David Bryant lesson you will hear next but first eight thirty to revolution solved Washington center here's this ... bought [noise]\nBig rush think here's what's happening three people rushed to the hospital today one in critical condition for stealing and up and talk of the mill building being renovated collapses down to the basement officials trying to figure out exactly why it happened and if what's left of the building is still safe to work on\n... says it'll announced what it's learned about the killing of democracy will be tomorrow and congressional leaders say Saudi Arabia in particular words crown prince should pay a price for the ... death\nTurkey's announcement heightening hopes for some clarity in a case that it's been shrouded in mystery and Democrats expect to reopen the house investigation into Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election if they win the majority in the midterms\nAre California representative Adam Schiff says this party would have to ruthlessly prioritize the most important matters first he's the top Democrat on the house intel\nSees Christmas steak or whether center accuweather meteorologist Bob ... says increasing clubs night with a lower thirty nine valuable crowding us tomorrow in passing shower fifty nine ...

all of the uh all of the fall out there afterwards and uh Dave it's been an amazing postseason run for the red Sox they beat the Yankees then they go on to just when three straight against the ash Rosen three in their ballpark\nI Know that I mean it's gotta be tough for you write your call 'em all year long and then all of a sudden boom and it's like wait a minute it wears Dave O'Brien I Want to hear his thoughts on this postseason run so Dave you've seen at all what are your takeaways from what you've seen from the old town team and they're run to the world series\nWell you know it's been a tremendous accomplish what to do what they did you know to the beat the Yankees that's one thing it's a one hundred went team\nBut I thought the Astros were in a different class as far as Red Sox opponents in to go in there and frankly whip them three in a row of their own building with a very very comfortable and I think a lot of people thought that was with serious might turn in your favor I I think there's ... reaffirmed did he how good this ball club was all season long because\nThere was so much crying about the bullpen and so much crying about kimbrell and clearly he hasn't been the same guy get the post season\nStill they won those games and they won them the way that they've done them all season long break it up front of the other guy quickly and the starting pitching is pretty darn good and the bullpen spent better than anticipated so\nI you know I'm looking at the Dodgers series the Dodgers were placed team in September at one point and I think it's another opponent that on paper right now the red Sox absolutely out class going into the series\nAs you look at the twists and turns up the bullpen has there been anything day that has surprised you either in a player performance that you didn't expect or in the way our score has gone about managing the pieces that he has out of the bullpen\nThere's many reasons there is actually the the that is a different reason

think I compare name by you just like his own player he can do a little bit of everything um he just like a raw talent you know he's going to be really good player you know\nSo now that you have all these young guys underneath you and playing with you on the floor in such what's the what's the most common advice you give them every time you guys are out on the floor together\nI'm probably the same advice to give me it'd just be patient um let the game come to you you don't have to force anything ah one of the plays a big thing with them right now I'm just like basic stuff\nOkay All right and then finally and and I know coach knows I Know the answer to this but I'm going to ask the question anyway what are you looking forward to most of this year\nInto rings okay to rings too okay I

the\nFirst things first with Chris Carter on Fox Sports one going to be your host tomorrow correct\nYeah I'm excited to do that obviously Fox Sports one at Fox has been a a great partner with the Big East and I think we've ever merge together some short five years ago when the new alignment of the Big East occurred\nUm we kind of grown together and it's been a great marriage has been a great relationship and we hope we continue to have that relationship moving forward\nBut I think it's a time and I'll stop talking about college basketball you know they're in the swing with football in Alabama's dominating once again Clinton's dominating once again Michigan is making a push that school in the mid west that wants to be Providence called into the main you know I'm you know they're doing well but\nIt's about that time to stop talking college groups and uh when I have an opportunity tomorrow morning to do so with Nick and Chris and died an exciting time for Providence College they have that national exposure um to promote our school organization in our program\nIf you're wondering on that first one it's eight o'clock tomorrow morning right yeah but you got to be in the studio\nA [laughter]\nAnd they're pretty early but you know you all up your sleep and I'll have a couple a couple of uh you know\nRoll the DVR snow roll the DVR you'll be all set but I'm a good shot ivy yeah that's awesome\nIt's awesome it's it is good for Providence College is great for a programming is another opportunity to brand ourselves\nRight and of course so you have that are on EPA's one tomorrow and the Big East media day at Madison Square garden on Thursday I don't believe anybody will be surprised to find out the Villanova will be the preseason favorite as they are the defending national champs of course a couple of big time starters back I saw in the era exhibition on those those\nQuote unquote ... secrets you know scrimmage is that they're playing they played North Carolina

one basketball game occasionally where they've got two exhibitions to be played the season before the regular season tips off on November the sex they've already do knocked off the University of Bridgeport it was a Ninety six fifty seven final last friday night\nThe use of justice seven hundred yards down the road here are at the Dunkin donut center what did you learn about your team that you didn't already know last friday night\nOr a good question um I mean we know a lot what we're going to see\nA I don't think we would term the ball over to the level of which we did I thought we were really sloppy and I bought our guys played the score more so than trying to improve so that's something that we worked on in the last couple of practices um I liked our guys energy\nOr you know especially our young guys I thought that came with a lot of spirit a lot of a doozy awesome um I think those will be the two things that stood out to me [noise]\nThirty one turnovers is a lot but I Know that a lot of that was because you were experimenting with players combo version and probably you know ...\nThat was honestly that was bad at coaching I got to do a\nBetter job with that um should have called the ... time outs when I saw we had on two occasions we had a three turnovers him for possessions I'm I should have probably use the time out there but\nThat's an opportunity for you to see what your team can do on during the worst moments I'm right you got to let some stuff going these exhibition games that right normally go that's why you play um you know we were messing with a lot of different lineups\nAnd small big fast slow along\nYou know we have these exhibition games is not so much I think\nUh the most somebody played was twenty minutes because you want it to try to look at it a lot of different combinations on the floor or if you remember we always try to do things for casting moving forward like what you would just want it looks like against a literal minded but switch all these screens let's play a particular type of ball screen defense\nIt's almost like a controlled scrimmage and I know you guys have done that in these quote unquote ... secret scrimmage is against other division one teams but that's what you're doing those you basically set up situations and you try to match in union coaches get together and you work on certain things and this is just kind of doing it on the fly against the division two or three ...\nYeah and you know I mean it it it is our hope and now as we talked with the NC double a moving forward like we want to try to have an exhibition game uh hopefully in the near future against the elite high major team with were on the road or at home or where we use it eight to get better as a program but also to have like we have all these\nHurricane relief games that you guys around\nYou guys play the one game last year it gets you ...\nYou know there's so much relief we need you here in our city in our state we need to have relief for the people that are connected to us and we have great sympathy for everyone around the country that deals with the disasters of\nFlooding weather but there's disasters right here on our own backyard you know there's homelessness there's this food shelters that could be a be supported there's there's foster parents there's a lot of different things which we can get back to our community\nBy having one of those high major gains it'll probably be a sell out about the dumped so that's something that women will look to do a moving forward\nI I think that's an outstanding idea if you just call it like a charity and we're all proceeds get turned over to local charity or or charities I Can't understand why the NCW wouldn't you know go for that but then again I've had a hard time explaining the NC double a over a number of years here at\nAll I think the climate in college basketball right now you have this whole FBI prohibition is something that everybody should be talking about but that's not what\nAll of us do you know Ninety nine percent of the people in our business therefore the student athlete to see these kids graduate to get them to be you know men get them to say please get the mistake thank you open doors smiling and have gratitude\nBut if you're going to have these charity games this many charities right in our own communities that could use our help they need our help and again that's not to take away from the disasters yeah because everybody needs some support\nBut if I'm going to support something I Want to look in the mirror and say worked in that support being used by this and that is right in the community which we live every single day\nIt was such a great idea and yeah absolutely we should collector that which is an Oscar it's an awesome idea\nYou know getting together with teams in your backyard to like you know you play your conscience basically the Big East or you know reformed itself you guys what your opposite directions that's an outstanding idea could you use something like that maybe as a\nPrecursor to setting the table for maybe an eventual home and home series or something I've been on down the line not just what you competed you said with other high majors\nYeah that's something that we've been talking about Brian blaming does one of the best jobs in the country when it comes to scheduling\nAnd this is something that we've talked about with Bob just school we've talked about what the conference we talked about what the executive committee for the NC double a\nI'll be having another conversation with them because all communities could use that and right now I think college basketball needs goodwill and that's a great goodwill thing to get back to ... you know let's find out if they listen to you why not many people listen to me I can tell you that so\nLong as you're players do I don't think anybody cares\nYou know that while while I mean my kids or listen to what was that

P. R. O. followed bill on Twitter at bill Koch K. O. C. H. twenty five the numbers to fiber you can get all of his great reporting in a course everything broken down in the pro joke tomorrow with Billy and Kevin McNamara and crew all up at Fenway Park\nBill why is true Palmer rants on this World Series roster\nSimply to get another left and they're in the book and uh yeah you could ask the question why should Brandon worse than had been included on this roster are opposing hitters\nHad a Twenty one sixty nine O P s against him through history of parents are so far the playoffs I I Would imagine drew Palmer and even at its worst would be able to do better than that\nAh they've been encouraged by what they've seen lately a with him throwing on the side or in life batting practice against the parliament\nUm that I think it's just the not the fact that Los Angeles has some big thunder from the left hand side of white\nYou're looking at max months a year Josh ... or ... feet or ... or ... bell injure a you know guys who\nHave hit a ton of home runs the season from that side ... didn't allow a home run to a left handed hitter this year I'm so they're hoping that maybe in a in a six seventh eighth inning there was some sort of left left match up that he might be able to come up and get a key out for\nGetting the Dodgers cheap up often simply with the red Sox bill\nI think they can I I think if you look at their roster they do have a bit of an American league field to them um you know I look back at the previous designated hitters in Fenway Park against the red Sox the world series Colorado you Ryan ... billboards for two games so he was sort of a fourth outfield\nPinch hitter type a St Louis one of those years Marlin Anderson you had a six forty nine or ... at the time or the Dodgers have Matt camping line up as their designated hitter tonight in game one a guy who is Ben runner up in the MVP voting in the national league a multiple time all star or someone who is hit\nIn excess of twenty five home runs multiple times and he's not alone you you look at Peterson Muncie Ind Ballenger all on the bench uh there there's plenty of deaths in this line up uh especially here in an American league park\n[noise] know Todd's on the Providence Journal here on the ground show on WNPR oh they'll move hitting a one two oh five no homers three rabies in just a I was thirty nine and a post season at bats\nUm are those the struggles of a player getting his feet wet in the postseason you make anything of that at all\nWell he he has hit some balls hard right at people if you think back to Houston you probably have a two run double taken away by Josh rather kind of great play um he also hit a ball to the track at Yankee Stadium in center field again Severino on the first pitch of the game\nUm and that took seem to want something there are but also you know with that I think teams are being smart they realized that his damage is done to the pool side to left field and so their pitch and came away\nOr they're also working came upstairs with fast balls and and he jumped at a few of those um you know hasn't necessarily been\nAs consistent with his approach as he was during the regular season and I think he's being punished for it a little bit in that way um you know but this is a guy grad who really only need one or two games to get right back on track or you know and I really you'd be able to do it here facing some left handed pitching for the dot\n[noise] no conscious or the Providence Journal here on the ground showing WPRI all your bills follow on sort of built patch twenty five and read all their great coverage in the pro Joe tomorrow morning\nAnd want to get your thoughts on Mickey beds plane second base I Know algae Cora said the chance the bad sides there is very slim\nBut ... does it mean none what do you make of the possibilities that this could happen with moody moving up into the in field\nYeah he sounded a little more bullish about the possibility over the weekend and I think in the last couple of days as he's gone through meetings with his coaching staff with the front office they probably tried to talk him out of that a little bit or simply because ...\nIs the best defensive right fielder in baseball and you know if you put anybody else out there you're you're lessening what you get 'em and if you put him at second base you're inviting a few things in the play first you know how he's going to turn double play at the back\nA second how he's going to work in bunk coverages which is something he hasn't done all season\nUh you know and thirdly he's got to avoid a sliding in there and you know as we saw with us in petroleum and ... and I'm In and Machado last year\nYou don't want to invite contact on something like ... ... vets who makes so much of his living in baseball with his speed with his legs um it might not be worth taking the risk you simply move him to center field portrayed Martinez going right\nYou still have a very potent line up people without Jackie Bradley junior and I I think that's probably the direction that they'll do it more than ...\nAh [noise] as I see Yahoo CEO tweeting in right field in Fenway Park icy disaster do you\nPotentially it as you know ... difficult outfield to play a especially in the corner there are a lot of nooks and crannies out there whether it be down the right field line or or trying to play that wall in left field\nOr none of the bounces or are the same ... you look at Dodger Stadium and it's a symmetrical feel the same distance down both blind nice rounded gaps a you know very comfortable to play out there\nAre very different experience here at Fenway dodge haven't been hearing a little while and one of the first things that they did during the Monday Night workout was they put their outfielders in the corners and they were hitting balls deliberately off the wall just see how they would bounce\nAnd how they would feel about a week is a little bit of a wild card big strong graceful athlete someone who is probably better in the field than you would think if you just look at his side but he is prone to the decision from time to time and I would expect the red Sox test them particularly on balls it toward the line and into that corner\nHe reminds me willy ... paying you are the bad part can really moping [laughter] you got a bill last thing for you you\nYou have a mega millions ticket and if you win what sports fans to see would you live out with all of your riches\nOh my gosh you know I forgot to buy one today shame on me for sure um you know if it was up to me and I can fill\nAny sports fantasy that I have\nUm\nThe first thing on my bucket list the one event that I haven't gotten to that I Would love to go to would be the masters\nI I think I Would go to the masters every single year just you know the pageantry of Augusta National ... the unofficial start of spring I'm just that beautiful place in Georgia I I think that's probably the number one sporting event after tonight in game one of the world series that I'm going to want to cross off my pocketbook\nHe's missed first world series game for you in your career either going to a game recovering again\nI Know it's it's something entirely different uh you know and I think that's just because if you go to the ticket sites or whether it be you know take your ticket broker of choice I I don't know if you have a sponsor on the show of anyone so I won't ah\nOh no man that was given no we do and not so go ahead and ... them all out there because maybe they're listening [laughter] All right if\nIf you were going to be on a stick around ... ... or or anybody like that or you look at the numbers that ticket prices are going for a into the thousands in in sometimes tens of thousands or and you realize as a member of the media that you're actually being paid and the other direction to be here uh you know it's definitely\nSomething of a lifelong dream something that I always watch TV growing up when I was a kid uh and and it's certainly something that I Do not take Brent\nOh that's awesome well bill enjoy the hell out of it thank you for the time I appreciate it get built and
