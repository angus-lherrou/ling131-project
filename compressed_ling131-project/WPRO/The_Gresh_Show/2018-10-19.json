the road that David Price is going to Britain balls it up once again no I think he is who he is but he helped\nThe red Sox get to the world series and that's what we were all looking for and when you say total team effort that's what this team gave a total\nTeam effort and now you know normally I look at it and say well you got there let's just see what happens expectation is is that this team should\nWin the world series against either Milwaukee or the Dodgers it doesn't matter which one they play the red Sox are going to be maybe not the prohibitive favorite but they're\nGoing to be a solid favorite when it comes to but the the generosity and the betting lines in fact\nI had my friends the bow vow to send me today that in mind as well yeah if it's the red Sox Dodgers it's a Red Sox minus one thirty which means you about a hundred and thirty on the red Sox to win a hundred and they got the Dodgers as even it in a scenario where the red Sox play the\nBrewers the red Sox are an overwhelming favorite at minus two hundred compared to plus one sixty four Milwaukee so if it's the red Sox against the brewers you're betting true to win one and if it's against the Dodgers you're betting a dollar thirty cents to win one\nPretty simple and honestly it'd be great for played Milwaukee\nBecause then we wouldn't\nHave to deal with a eight nine o'clock starts on the west coast or harbor baseball would have to try to find a way to massage that\nYeah I think you're the only person outside the greater Wisconsin area that uh or actually or people that like to sleep I guess but there's no doubt about it that major league baseball wants Dodgers Red Sox\nAnd Russian you're exactly right name brands on them are key always sell Boston Elway absolutely I'm with you on that you have to get Magic Johnson out there that are out him around and I'm also thinking practically as well not only from a game time standpoint but also\nUh I think the red Sox beat the brewers in about five games and against the Dodgers a look\nCalling her shawl has the ability\nTo do what we've seen Madison Bumgarner do over the years for the San Francisco giants and that might be to take the ball three times and just be a witch and shut people down that guy scares the hell out of me\nBut we'll see let them battle it out the red Sox get some much needed rest they're going to get the rotation in order they're going to get the bullpen and order\nAnd I liked the native all coming out of that opened last night now I Know that's not going to happen very often I Am a little surprised the core winter kimbrell\nFor ah the ninth inning\nBut I you know it's the guys who got married and you're going to go to the dance with who you're wrong and\nOr who brought you there I Want to look at it I

about [laughter]\nWhat you're supposed to be watching football where they'll sworn even often\nYeah he probably was multi tasking that but that but yeah I mean I thought\nThere was a good chance I mean he was playing devil's advocate or just a you know playing logical person there but I was thinking the same thing when I saw that I was like\nI'd probably just let of all the go here but then you have the confidence issue with camera and and what comes along with all that you want to go into the world series fresh off a game where you're closer was snow before nasty NATO baldy that's probably not the best thing anyway and the and camera will probably listen to it a little later on but\nSeveral apologized scratch to the other fans of Boston for giving them all heart attacks for ah\nFor all

does he done really well under matinee\nThe good of it is using those athleticism to use a wide variety of ways ... than the with the field is much ... and some of the negative is\nKind of thrown into closed windows whether it be the first play the\nGame last week to Alan Robin surrounded by four guys so long throws across body where the receiver double covered and they're not winning\nPosition so he got to take some of those cats Throws Away and either eat it or try to use it scrambling ability to gain\nBut if you are out of it that makes sure that you safely go to the huddle the next play but\nThen he asked Matt nagging he doesn't want him to hold anything back he wants to go out there and play as much as he sees it so it is the vote of confidence from the head coach but it's always about the self coaching of the player how you play better throughout your career\nChicago Bears radio analyst Tom fair here on the ground show on WNPR oh you know I I Would just you're busy and I admit I thought okay he's had one really good year in college boys athletic ... gentle the trades you like but it's going to take a while for him to get to where I'm sure they want him to be\nHow different Tom easy from last year to this year\nHe's a completely different player because he's got a lot of different options off and you know office we speaking meals are really unimaginative often that he was stuck in last year they actually got nothing out of the tight and after that got hurt they had no profit from the wide receiver position and it was kind of one dimensional with Jordan Howard\nAnd now the one of the things that man that he preaches about weekend and week out as this is not a one man show [noise] weren't going to make use of every body throughout our our game planning and what we think is the vulnerabilities of our own it so that that's the great thing about it but\nYou know you you you know Mitch isn't such the infant stages out this off than if he's\nIn a same often in the same terminology with the same coaches in two and a half or three years from now that you're going to start seeing the quarterback development of the NFL if you have changes every year of office coordinators like we saw Cutler go through in the past\nIt's hard to get better and so that's that's that's the thing that we hope for is Mitch and I'm very negative stick together for years\nTom you were an offensive lineman when you look at coal you'll Mac what jumps out to you now that you get to see him and be around this guy you\nKnow number one is how hard he plays the run because if you have a guy that kind of a one dimensional on I I only want to rush rush the pastor\nYou really don't put a lot of stock into what he can do to you I'm first than tan or second short himself but he is physically has a great understanding of leverage against Iran so that's one of the things that helps them rushed the past or even better and then he's got a variety of move\nHe can come out of a to point stance and try to beat us hand placement he can come out of a three point ban in ... so\nHe he's got a wide variety moved it the the\nI think the best combination for well Mac is almost the fans you know\nBecause the fans yo allows his past refers to rush from anywhere he's not only going to face for the right tackle don't rush against the left tackle hill rush on the inside they all have different variations configurations of the fence along with stun so you know ... well he's got the talent to do it all and um\nIf he could spill over to a guy like Leonard Floyd in it you know I'm a little bit more\nJust work ethic and fun and and use the visibility I I think he could really do a lot to expand letter Floyd game also\nTom fair color analyst of the Chicago Bears with us here on the ground show on WNPR Owen Tom off of we'll Mack how being dumped busy ah what version of ... do you think we're going to see on Sunday\nI you know I'm not sure because you know even doing the Miami game last week I was more thinking of Miami was hit a ball out of their hands that they were doing a nice job of focusing their protection against ... and it was so hot down there you guys been down there it was still knock down there was hired to do anything positive so\nYou know I mean I Hope for the best to me if if the oil was injured in any way shape or form I'd rather not white him and let them be healthy for the long haul instead of being Seventy percent for eight or nine games because you're trying to play on a ankle spraying so\nUm I don't know you know it's unfortunate that not unfortunately we just don't have privy to that much medical information so if he's healthy\nI Hope he goes out there because they can Hicks is a better player with ... next to them than if it came Hicks does not have a ... next to him\nA Tom give us here in New England a guy whether it's on off and so we're defense who you think we'll slash and really show up well against our New England patriots is there a a a guy or two that you think has a chance to really have a nice day on Sunday\nYeah you know that they could really unique qualities of a guy like tree calling it was kinda dimensional because he can start in the backfield and he ... he can on any running way they have on the attack\nCounter plays we whatever you want to but if they take them out of the backfield and they put them up on on the line of scrimmage he's a really difficult match up and if you put a linebacker\nAgainst them you're not going to cover um if you put a safety against them some time is going to be able to run on the Gulf War those routes so why do\nYou know if it's true Cohn is the interesting guy and the you know the other surrounding guys Taylor Gabriel him straight burden such but I I think three kids really that difficult match you up for some game\nTom fair radio collar analyst for the Chicago Bears you're on the grants showing WPRI oh why let's flip it to what your train dies show you\nAbout what these New England patriots are all about Tom I Love asking people in other cities how they view the patriots and what they see when they watch them\nYou know for me the whole thing with the New England patriots is the greatness of ballot check his leadership is command of the entire room often ... special game is a ... as attention to detail his ability to change the office of philosophy for one week to the Mac\nHis ability to identify the vulnerabilities others opponents in all those things being said you also have to admire Brady commitment to the sport and Tom Brady his\nHis ability to play during the regular season or the process his commitment to the off season in order to be prepared every year physically is amazing so I I have so much respect for Tom Brady and what I've seen over the years\nUm you know I was looking at some stats are the last time that bears played in New England one Brady sports thirty one point I think in the second quarter alone fifty overall Heathrow eleven targets the brand and little style and completed all eleven\nAnd so you you you get out there and you think you're going to be able to identify cronk or the other receivers that just pick somebody else out and he'll go to battle with them all day\nYou know the other thing too Tom is that you mentioned Brandon little cell I think there's only been two Super Bowls where do you have the same starting off in some wine\nThat's the other thing that really gets me is that yeah Brady great but he's had all these different people shuffled in and out whether it's in front of member for him to throw the football too and they're just doesn't seem to be that drop off in production that everybody seems to predict every year for the patriots\nRight but you know what you look at look at look at the consistency what's your office supply coach I Know I he did retire for a year or two and then came back I Believe you know what I was really fortunate the bears they have the same office lined coach my whole career\nStarted seven straight even with with a five fame players in my office white coats was Dick Van Pelt who went on to become a hall of fame or\nHe's one of the greatest coach who have been around when I watch the tape of the New England patriots\nIt's one of the most well organized choreographed um you know time dolphins of lines I've seen up and down the board so\nI I give so much credit\nTo your office of wind codes that he um he really understand the ... the details for physical address of off the line quite get you're running game going and protect Brady so I I think that's the one constant in the office of line that you guys have had their\nUh Tom it would be remiss if I didn't ask you are you starting to think about the ah ... making it too\nThe college football playoff we know your ties to Notre Dame there also a great start have you allow your mind to start to go there yet or do you need a couple more weeks before you can get into that mindset\nYeah but I mean they got a couple of difficult game still coming up and they got to get through you know what us the USB is always a really good game because for no South Bend Indiana there are so many pre game distractions out there that you can't get caught up in all of this as a young guy\nOn a football team so it makes me go through the rest of the schedule what do you go into the coliseum and you see that\nRight now I've got a four packets tickets to give away for you to see the brown bears take gone pen next weekend over brown stadium calling free gets
