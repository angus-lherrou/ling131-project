the voice of the patriots with me here on the ground show on WNPR oh Bob\nLooking back to the Miami game\nHow important was not only the win\nBut to have that kind of performance I Know getting ready for a Thursday game everything gets compressed what were you able to catch up by the boy that one really mattered and maybe this team needed a win like that against Miami said kind of feel good about themselves [noise] yeah\nAnd I think it mattered and in a lot of different ways and\nWe talked about last week when I spoke to math Slater a again in the middle of the week about toughness establishing toughness as a football team and then he mentioned the tenets\nAnd they started with running the ball and stopping the run and the third for Bill Belichick has always been covering kick really believes that special teams is the heart and soul although football team really can develop it seems tough as well that was really less of a factor of the game against the dolphin but certainly those first two\nAspects were very prevalent in prominent the patriots wet they ran the balls Sony Michel over a hundred yards James White with a choice yard touchdown wrought they stopped the rock yards area and you know the dolphins got a lot of their yards and garbage time\nThink Seventy five hundred Seventy two yards while their final Dr game with Frank or running at rock ... quarterback so the patriots came out and they set the tone ... they gave up a big play on the first step twenty two yards and after that\nThere'll be a place for the nonsense that had been able to get a lot of big place they confuse tannahill really looked terrible frankly during the course of the game they didn't allow Miami to get any drives going they are certainly put the pressure on the dolphins\nOr whether it was you know taking control on a scrimmage from an offensive standpoint or really pushing back a lot of scrimmage on the defensive standpoint I think that kind of a when it was important because it was all three phases he was a team of establishing an identity\nYou hope will continue a beyond last Sunday and in through tomorrow night and I think that's important going forward for the football team especially with at city on the horizon in Green Bay and some of the other Markey match ups against us some high powered offices they're going to face in the near future\nBob ... I'm kind of a jags fan this week\nA way they made up the chiefs I mean you know you talk about catching a break\nBut patriots not only get two games at home but they get a Thursday night at home and then a Sunday night at home against the chiefs and the genes are going to play Jacksonville and we know Jacksonville one saying hey they may not win the game Bob but I think they're going to read 'em up and uh you know maybe the patriots end up catching a break\nIn terms of uh in terms of Kansas City pitching you mentioned the chiefs 'cause I mentioned it to people beforehand here that hey root for the jags this week to beat the snot out of them physically so you get a week in Kansas City teams on a rolling here next Sunday\n[noise] yeah and I don't think it can be overlooked outlook Kansas City is a relatively short flight from Denver as opposed to say with obvious reasons if the patriots were going up Denver to plant a short weight right\nBut that's a factor if you're coming off a Monday Night game a close tight game and as you mentioned they gotta go play a very good defense from Jacksonville team that plays with a lot of physicality\nOn you know I'm not sure what Jacksonville is going to have a fence of live with for that but are you talking about often but also can be very physical at times when he's out there so I think that she's you know it is a tough predicament to be an end the patriots do catch a great having a Thursday came at home having gone to Tampa Bay last year\nAnd see the patriots line through that game on Thursday night I I think the advantage can't be overstated a and I think it's been you know I was surprised to see the last couple of weeks Andy how well the ... team\nPlayed for the most part you know the Thursday night games because history it seems to me and the recent past is that the home team generally hold serve\nBob last thing for him and this is a you know listening to you and your partner have you seen Bambi Bob\nI'm Sorry have you seen brame B. if I've seen bounty\nDigging role that he ruled that out last week there will be damaged see the movie\nAnd a long time it's only been a long time and you know it um\nIt brings back a lot of bad memories or you know my kids haven't seen it either a six and eight year old um but ah I Love the last Bambi as a kid but you know I mean it's you know um [noise] yeah it's it's a it's an interesting description so used to try to\nTell the radio audience you know what happened when\nI was ... to ... yeah for a girl Paterson looked like uh-huh catching a screen passes for the second time in in a couple of weeks he toppling over backwards\nYou know Bob you and I are maybe the only two people on earth next to those winding through I called big mama who can relate to those kinds of moments\nFrom our boy just accept Bahraini asleep off the top of his head my favorite when he talks himself into or not and then you can't get himself out see it as it happened as much with you because it's not the long form\nBut you know like some day when the book is written like when they put him in the patriots hall of fame you are going to be able to spend a lot of tales is to some of the goofy things he is said on the fly over the course of years\n[laughter] why do you do the book has been written by guys do lack and just\nCome on you and I heard all those stories I don't I don't need to hear about that time the ban\nCoach toss them out for drawing a caricature of him or you know the uh the judge drawn a crust Palmer standing on step stool to have to use a urine on all that stuff I mean it's the stuff that you and I know and see like when he takes off in the middle of a broadcast right\nThat's the real story of working with Scott ...\nWhile you know I got to say that he's finally he he\nSure he's been at war with your own yeah has done that I carried all\nWhether or not he has a good thing we have a white boots and we have our for\nYour time yeah\nYeah but uh you know I put it this way nobody's coming into our food\nOr the way they used to when you guys went on the air in the studio at the ... the late twice in the disinfectant um you know that\nNow that is a very good call right there are guide Bob so see Bob have a great call tomorrow night we appreciated and we'll check in with your next week thank you\nI think I just talked myself in the corner and he basically get me out of it\nYou're good Bob there we go there goes the gray Bob's associate with is here on the ground showing WPRI\nNo one is more plugged into Rhode Island [noise] jeeze\nOf Providence man's sentence today to just under four years in prison if prime now the cruise admitted robbing ascent tender bank branch ...

I'm looking I Know\nI now coming off a ah well I I had both breeding emmer homes on one of my team so ah but ... going against that tough jaguars defense I think that this is going to be a rare spot where ... homes is outside the top five fantasy quarterbacks\nYou know it's interesting because last week I uh I started Drew Brees but I sat Jared gone and it ended up costing me and that's one of those deals where if you're an owner of ... homes you don't necessarily want to send them down but to your point rambling you know what I\nI guess if you've got like look if you have a jerk guy sitting on your bench like me that it's a no brainer but if it's a mid level quarterback you still go with someone like my homes even though it is on the road against the very tough jak decent\nI think you do I I feel like right it's all a you know who would you have actually one of my colleagues I have thought rivers are going against the raiders and I'm a homes and that to me is a tough call that that's right where it is right now I feel like a ... with\nA Mac Stafford going against the Packers um you know maybe Andy Dalton going against the dolphins you've got to find the opposite of going against the cowboys I mentioned going against the raiders and I even think it's a a decision to be made if you have Aaron Rodgers going against the the lions and the thing about the homes is\nYou know in many leagues that might lead but many league he wasn't one of the top Fifteen quarterbacks off the board so you very well might have some of those aforementioned guys a animal homes both on foster but uh you know right now I Would start homes this week over Aaron Rodgers\nI Would start in the homes overlap Stafford I'd start I'm over ... ...\nI Would lean toward the Sean Watson against the cowboys and Philip Rivers against the raiders if those are my ops instead of homes but anybody else you know I'm not I'm not starting a guy like her cousins or Carson wins in that eagles Vikings game over somebody like the homes\nNo he's going to throw shore yeah Senate in theory yeah in theory yes ... yeah but I'm just saying if there are other times are Gordon's open and he's outlook on his way that's all\nYeah well see I mean I can also be in theory true I think it's sort of goes back to if Adam and not in there like Adam and being in there is a good thing okay overall yeah what if you're sort of forced to come up with alternatives that can accelerate the relationship when I was not forced to find alternatives if guys back\nA bill in the car you back\n[noise] All right go ahead I Want to talk about what do you think about the middle [noise]\nYou know it's interesting because guys at his age that go down for pd suspensions typically are the same guy after the fact mhm and guys who are having ACL reconstruction in their thirties many times they're not the same guy after the fact he's got both of those things working against them\nBut in terms of the work ethic I'm not sure there's many players quite like Julian Edelman\nAnd that's the one thing that works in his favor so it's a wait and see\nI mean nobody knows the I don't know it certainly has had more recovery time in west welfare did you know west tore his it though the last game of the ninth evening without January ten and then came back you know same calendar year to play but I always think about that year and that was the only your that West was here than the average\nYou know fewer than ten yards a cat she was still good but he wasn't quite quite the same guy I'll be interested to see what it is without me because I don't mean like West was completely reliant as whole game was you know natural quickness and shipping it to know sudden movements in West didn't have quite the same person explosive ... when he first came back but elements had more time to recover\nWhich benefits him because that would also help right right well doctors will say that if you have\nFifteen sixteen months to recover from the ACL ... that's when you start to become yourself again right not the eight nine months or even shorter now some of the turnaround time zone that now for players is just nuts or as the you know the surgery advances and there's less and less\nYou know open moon's going on there it's very very close tight\nProcedure that goes on now and as you know surgical technology continues to get better and rehab continues to get better at a turnaround times and you know there's also that whatever biology is involved\nYou know guys are just coming back you know faster than ever better better living through chemistry\nOh absolutely I endorse or the fact that he's back now after so much time maybe maybe he's got factors that have just worked in his favor maybe at the end you'll be saying that pd suspension somehow was a plus I Will say this though he didn't have a great camp\nWell why is there is only admission by his own admission he wasn't the same guy\nHe was six one seven seven seven nine zero Ninety eight by my kids in the car he Mike\nHey what's going on guys they said well first time actually on our way of the game right on that you get a quick question for you is the game going to be more effective as a vice versa and is so she'll have as big as a as a game at a at last week\nA spy thoughts on that gets\nOkay Mike thank you could call a the questionnaires about Sony Michel can match what he did a week ago I think the answer is yes they've got to active running backs on the roster tonight\nAnd that means it's going to be basically him being the guy who's the main running back the other guy being James White who\nPatriots do not like to use for the most part in running situation so the workload\nIs there for Sony Michel by the way we just saw Steve grove and go by the broken read for you for those keeping track at home I don't know who that one that just went by will receive I'm just shouting out the the the rare ones the jerseys that stick out here today [noise] go ahead\nNo no yeah I mean I look I I think I think that they can do sort of either against the coal to colds have given up some big plays in the past and game I don't think that they didn't do linebacker plays good or the rookie dairies minor leads the NFL in in tackles I like Anthony walk her second year linebacker but I don't think there anything special up front\nSo I think you can run on them too and that's where the patriots have done in the past again indeed they normally come out and run however you know look different team personnel wise or different coaching staff here it's no more ... is Frank right in there so I\nThink you can look at it and really do sort of either one I Would lean maybe a little more towards the past because I think with Kenny more out and that's secondary is not anything special they their second in the NFL in Saks that the Colts are but I still think you can make big plays against you see it against the

something out of the punt returned game would be huge for them I think Cyrus Jones who sent a nice job I don't think he's done you know a tremendous job like a pro bowl guy but he hasn't hurt you at all he's gotten the yard or is that was there\nBut I don't mean is the best hunt return or specifically in the history of the franchise so to get him back there is a big how\nHe can secure the football writes Irish chosen that's that's a valuable piece with this theme because we've seen it when it's the Riley McCarron yeah the Chris Harper or that Chris harbors where you're saying yourself anyone just catch the ball\nHey we're just am I going to make sure they catch it it can turn to a game dining hall affair cats yeah you ... you can turn a game that way that could arrive biggest playing a game or a huge playing a game so\nHave a short headed guy back there I think we're going to see him on a par returned Chris I see I Wonder like what ya ya if you had any kind of pitch count are we going to look back and see that he played Ninety percent of the options now it's a good question that's my question\nYou know you have any sort of pitch count here coming back\nWell he has been fully\nOr you had a folk camp he's been you know evils I guess do whatever it is he wants to do including reports today that he was working out of the Celtics and\nWhile this was going on I also know that he was practicing if local fields Robin conviction was out there working with them there were paths at one point a couple of weeks ago I I you know for me my question about him is I Know he played in the pre season but\nWhen you're in a game against the other teams you know full roster of ones right and you start taking those real hits over the middle of the few like does he shake goes off quickly when you get back 'cause that's always sort of that\nJarring thing when you first get into it six one seven seven seven nine zero Ninety eight five uh we'd go to John who's in stone I John\nGood ah so Edelman he he was injured week three last yeah you want to talk about coming back from the the L I Know it doesn't matter the amount of time but he stepped plenty of time to come back\nAnd look at it wasn't it wasn't we three it was the ... well received their ... their preseason game so but yeah that that's not good for anybody I don't know I think that is not good for anybody you know whatever it was that was going on here [laughter]\nI'll tell you I Will get more more and and that's Dan in the car I dare\nYou guys are going good how are you you're not too bad I'm just getting your opinion on basically on the receiving end of the game and I I Know even if God does have the injury that it still does have\nA just being on the field as a threat along with Julian Josh court in throne James White in there I doubt that they normally do\nUh basically if this was that will be able to have enough men out to cover or different guys and then on top of that they throw in a padded send us to like that it's just the next guy out that attach a really neat that third down\nDan I'm with you I haven't Gronkowski on the field as a threat worth having out there\nYou have to be accounted for there's no question about it and look you look at Andy there to read it in a secondary right now I mean no no Kenny more milk when the Wilson there and a little bit of a tough spot and I don't think that secondaries that great to begin with\nStay connected during the biggest moments of every game with X. men in the Internet delivering reliably fast speeds even during peak hours

I mean you do so many different things and you're not really hanging the burden\nOn drunk and white to carry the off into the money down\nSide time out of time out time out we just had a blue late nineties bend coats walk by Jeff if you see any rare or different patriots jerseys walk by us here in front of what's they'll feel free to stop the segment and tell us what you seem to be doing it all pre game here on Patriot's preview from our little perch\nAnd patriot place just want to let you know that in fact Chris\nYeah I Know well there's ... no no no I lose\nYour your body you need you need to come up with something unique and we're just gonna point about August so I Want to ask you a job for a while and you know rubber and calculate obviously reports out there that he's going to play how big a factor do you think you'll be in this game you mentioned everything Adam and could be up around Seventy five percent of the ... where would you project wrong\nI'd be surprised I mean look if you're putting him out there you trust that he is pretty close to the full strength I mean just I don't have any inside information on this one it's always really tough to get the exact details of what's going on with the grunt injury\nBut just the ice is this thing started two weeks ago on a third two weeks ago today\nPopped up on the injury report was taken off the next day\nPractice on a limited basis in air quotes the following week and then pull themselves out of the game after I think nine yards catching the third quarter on Sunday\nThere was no lamp he walked down the stairs fight obviously he's not tapping out of the game but it was a blow out it was really no need to throw him back out there\nAnd then this week he doesn't practice the first few days the first one was a fake practice that didn't happen but you know it's also Colts week so you kind of want to read that that opponent a little bit more so you fit I'm On the Tuesday walk through and then you bring it back when the the curtains a closed on Wednesday so I think there is some gamesmanship\nAnd then just everything we've seen with our eyes tells us his injuries that that big of a deal\nBrady Michigan just went by first one of those we've seen tonight or let's talk about job scored and how much more to Josh Gordon do in a second\nI think he got a I mean what twice as many snaps maybe as he had in the first one pro Jim thirty if not getting married that's a reasonable number to look at and you need the work one takeaway I had on Sunday\nThe the way that he catches the ball with his hands those do passes especially the first one that was I mean that was a baby that things zip through the air there was a ton of spin on it\nAnd Gordon flash their hands right in front of his face masks that would have on the move yeah exactly in traffic on third down in the red zone everything about the catcher was high pressure if he dropped it I mean we look at it and we say well you know it's a tough one to catch but he made it look easy\nAnd then you know the second one it shows the athleticism the ability to break tackles you know there's a big play is coming from him even if just you know the majority of it snaps or are the important roles right now we're going to be slams and come back\n... when you look at what they did defensively last week the patriots last week on Sunday a couple of days ago how much of that do you think is sustainable and what did they do differently that put guys in a position to succeed or did they do anything differently and all and it was just guys\nJust played better yeah I think it was a lot that guy's just laid better um number one it was ... hours he ... his him being back and he wasn't\nOn yeah exactly you know flowers wasn't a one man Wrecking Crew by any stretch of the imagination I think you have like one pressure that I counted for all game but again he sort of it's like you're talking about bitten guys back into their suitable rolls on often flowers helps them do that\nOn defense I was talking to I wrote about flowers today and I was talking to ... hours like look at my making too much of it is it a coincidence that you guys like you to best defenses games when he's played wired wired he said no I mean everything that he does the amount of positions he plays he's the definition of the more you can do\nSo he's a big piece of the puzzle\nHe is a I mean we talked about a lot on Sunday he's not ... but the guy's damn good football player and he makes a lot of under the radar types of plays\nSo you know that is a a major boost right there\nThey've taken advantage of the two inferior all kinds of lines they played the you know weeks two or three hours they play better lines\nSo some of that you know they're not as good as they've been I think at their peak in terms of house arrest and they're certainly not as bad as they showed in weeks two and three and then you know part of it was there was a wakeup call the run seven it was subtle it wasn't like bench Malcolm brown or Alan Branch in years past or anything like ...\nIt was dark rivers and you know what they Davis but again that's a small message if you're not performing up your standards you're not going to react\nJeff how are the athletic is with us here on Patriot's preview I'm very surprised to read that Jacob pollsters out on the field or during pre game Morris right now he's missed the last two games with a chest injury I've heard that injury was not minor so I I don't think there's any chance place than I Do\nI think that's a reason to say that you will the active wow I'm surprised yeah I asked about that last night I got stonewall so I don't have any information but obviously ... ah has that that's their full tilt tonight I mean really their their vote is close to full strength as they could possibly be\nYeah the questions are sort of if ... you know ... playing what percentage of the right and I think we have similar questions about Josh Gordon what percentage of you've got to be added to going to be a full go to the number of snap so\nYou put all this together if these guys are all you know three four weeks down the line still healthy at that point you've got to think that\nThe patriots off that's gonna feel better about it that we have over maybe the first month\nI I think it'll be almost unrecognizable a month from now assuming they continue to Trent the other thing to their best player Tom Brady you know he was bad in Detroit he wasn't great on Sunday against the dolphins so he's going to continue to get better to get out of this mini funk that he's had that you know it was in total\nScott a character formerly in these he's a mosque or on Thursdays\nMark statistics in his career on Thursday night maybe it's just ... ... what he needed a cult game on a Thursday night yeah what I needed not bad on Sundays do yeah most of the most of them All right Jeff ... thank you Jeff how of the athletic follow him on

places we went out to victory highway west Greenwich\nYeah the other part of it is there's a lotta no good young quarterback from the game yeah we're sort of push him down the list is what it yeah I heard about him because he didn't play last year though that's the thing he came in and I haven't given up on him\nNo I haven't either but I don't think he's close to where he was I think his team stinks that's what I also like I'd like to see the roster terrible I'm not trying to put it all you have one good player to I Hope one day or what do you mean guilty city team right but it may not fit what I'm In LA with weapons he's fine\nYeah well fine but I still don't think he's the guy that he was five years ago\nWell we're going to find out I Know a lot of people\nMade a big deal about bringing in bra set for the Hail Mary yadda yadda yadda I don't really buy that\nI think Andrew Luck is progressing but he did go a long time without throwing a football there's an injury there there may be some limitations but I still think when it settled in and you get his weapons either back on the field with the oil and Hilton or add to it so he has some\nYou know competitive guys to work with\nI think he's going to be among the league leaders in passing in future years because I think he's just he's just too good with his head\nTo heal his head all make up for whatever little bit he's lost in the ...\nYeah I think he's great I just think that you know where he's at now not we're used to be and he may soon returned to that and and by the way on the throw that they brought her sat in for that just tells me what's the point what's the point of ... anything with Andrew law yeah you're right to do that just smart I give a cold right what credit what's the point that I\nPut everything into a throw when he could that could run the risk of aggravating every injuring something\nYeah I think a lot of people jumped to the conclusion oh they don't think you can get it to the end zone I think it's what you just said what's the point what's going to pick up throwing his arm out maybe doing some damage for you know a flip the coin hope\nRight you know you have a guy in the sideline was more than capable now the guy almost threw it out the back of the end zone it wasn't a great day he came I'm much was made a bet for no reason\nHe came into the league when the league was desperate for a new way out of young quarterbacks and I think that's why you know people are really penned a lot of hopes on him I think we all have because we don't want it to see the lead had that next crop of guys and he and our G. three came in at the same time we want to both of them to do well and right now it doesn't look like\nI'll just say that they're going to be thought if I think that's true but when I think Andrew Lock\nWas able to mask and disguise a lot of the construction flaws of the Colts team before when that team is making the playoffs like I don't think that they weren't as good as you know playing the patriots and an AFC Championship game and twenty four team but they had Andrew Luck and I think that he was able to sort of mask\nAbout the flaws in that team and now they're just at a point where it's like you know he's not capable of doing that because you coming out the injury and they're really sort of rebuilding the the I mean what kind of running back to what kind of offensive line the defense is very young they start five rookies in week one\nThis is a team that is trying to on the fly sort of renovate its roster and that puts a lot on the Andrew Luck\nYeah I still think the I I still think in the long run he is a\nYou know top ten top five type quarterback\nAnd you know he's done more in this league than some of these guys that are being anointed and I'm not saying these guys aren't good but you know I watch these shows and it's like a you know Doug more own saying that ... homes is playing the position better than anyone ever has and you know Baker Mayfield is that the red barber this era and it's like\nThree or four games in people want to annoy these guys and I don't really understand it I it makes me want to defend you Tony Maserati\nHe had something negative to say after some games Sony Michel and he was lambasted for it but if you go out and say something ridiculous like pat in the homes of playing the quarterback position better than

three man roster\nThis is a guy coming up an ACL I mean we have not seen Julian element in a real game a game or something on the line and ...\nCents Superbowl fifty one it's been a long time so how much rusted there for Julian Edelman and how is he physically because when we saw him in training camp he was admitted that he didn't have his legs underneath them Jeff how the athletic\nIs with us their full tilt and I I mean really there ... as they could possibly be\nYou know Robert how the obviously reports out there that he's going to play how big a factor do you think you'll be in this game you mentioned everything Edelman could be up around Seventy five percent of the south where would you project wrong [noise] I don't have any inside\nInformation on this one it's always really tough to get the exact details of what's going on with the wrong injury\nBut just the ice at everything we've seen with our eyes tells us his injuries that big of a deal any heart of treated football

of different options\nUh so you weren't talking about the gate a you know what we might as well but there are some of those who didn't want to talk about I Know not necessarily deflate gate but sort of this idea of there being any sort of rivalry between these two teams whether it goes back to that or what's happening more recently between the two teams and that is Josh McDaniel deciding to verbally maybe\nExcept the job in Indianapolis before backing out I'm not going\nI mean he hired a stat stat I mean there were guys like ready to move their families to Indianapolis they were going to go work for Josh analyses that yeah I'm not going\nSo I mean I Wonder if that was you know Chris Bell GM of the Colts gave that press conference I thought he pretty much took the high road but at the end and they said the rivalries back on you know or to backtrack on that this week though well because his team's not good enough you know\nSo and and what else it would be a bad look for him to start bringing that up again right now it would be when they're you know one and three potentially one in four yeah tonight\nI think I think he tried you speaking of backtracking he tried to be very diplomatic that entire press conference and then right at the end no one even asked him a question he was walking off the podium\nAnd his true emotions just leaked out you know I Would say the robbery back on so I mean I just think it's sort of interesting there's there's always in the background some sort of you know stop tax to what's going on with the patriots and the colds I mean it's the first time the colds way back you're you know sent that AFC Championship game that launched\nDeflate gate and there's obviously the male well with Josh McDaniel is in terms of they thought the organization was going to go in one direction and he made the choice to stay here with the patriots the crafts stepped up and they were able to convince them to stay and keep 'em and he got a big\nContract that is the highest paid you know coordinator in the Reagan and that's all good but he really that the cold in the lurch a little bit\nYeah and even if they are okay or they're they they like their new coach and Frank right\nHe's a waste of their time that he not\nYeah and you wonder if that's just sort of motivation for some of these guys like yeah you know you didn't think we were good enough we weren't good enough for you but yeah let's let's let's show which\nIs why not only wasting their time but they also stopped looking for a head cold yeah over the weeks that went by me and him agreeing to the point where he backed out after the super bowl yeah\nAnd again to to expand upon it I\nThink that a lot of people you know prefer we're here he tell you just really liked it here as family really liked it here I don't think that's the reason I don't either but they're you know there are some other factors but no matter how much you get the denial from everybody around here that there's no sort of you know wink wink nudge nudge deal that Josh is the next coach it's hard to believe\nThat he would re nag on that deal with the cold to be the coach without some sort of assurance that there's a had coaching job from somewhere\nIn the NFL well it's got to be harder for him to get hired Josh pretty\nMuch shot down the idea that it was family when he came into campus spoke this year yes right so he sort of shot that down he's also not ruling out\nA returning as a head coach in Canada in the coming seasons as it's been reported which would mean that\nIt's not about the family and it's not necessarily about you know not wanting to go to Indianapolis it's just that he probably had the way when I assume Robert ... went to him and had a conversation after the season at it and they\nGave him a lot more money and the only lucrative contract the steak yup that he thought to himself is the Colts job\nWorth missing out on a potential opportunity to be the next Patriots' head coach\nAnd his mind that answer was no and I would say probably right\nBut you know what they say though in that situation you know you never want to be the guy who replaces the guy and he replaces ballots act that's a lot to live up to a lot to live on you know and you're probably doing it without\nTom Brady right but if you're doing it with the support of the team that you're working for if you're doing it with the support of the owner and ownership yeah then that might you know\nMake you feel like you're in a spot that is good for you\nAnd then on top of your family get to live in Massachusetts that instead of having to go to Indianapolis Indianapolis is not that bad exactly it's plus it it was never about that it was never about that because if you're going to return to you know put yourself back in the pool head coach and candidates if bill doesn't leave and retire or do whatever it is going to do down the road\nThen no it wasn't about your family you move your family down the road because the patriots job is in your ...\nAnd the other thing for me that makes me believe he has to be you know sort of the coach and waiting to see the unannounced successor is just that it's not just the coolest job that he turned down now the way you turn it down as notable but you know the off season before the forty niners were interested in him to get to a certain point where some of these clubs to set you start to get painted with the brush\nOf this guy doesn't really want to leave New England\nYeah I'm not sure it's going to take him out of the running hurts told me that he thinks he's going to be right back in the game yeah it's possible if it was me if if he wants to be back in ... when you looked on him\nThat the football people in the league might say oh this doesn't matter to me but what about the owners what about the non football people you think they're not going to look into that you think they're not going to be a little curious about it\nI think that football owners will do whatever they think is in the interest of winning you got a desperate team that needs a good head coach and they feel he can be that guy then\nFor any sports franchise and they were in the world she really was nuts when I came back\nIn the first thing she said you know it was a summer house of my main Myra\nCraft ones are the only one angry the city of St Louis thought they had a football team to replace the cardinals who'd fled to Arizona seven years earlier Missouri in jeans Bush or wind had been expected to pluck the patriots from New England but it didn't work out much to the benefit of Jonathan craft and his family\nThey wanted to get or the wind out of town before the announcement was made because you know he was James Bush or wine and I think they wanted to get him out of St Louis before the announcement was made because most people that are thought to team was called me I Love going to be the most popular man in the world there for a while [noise]\nWe get we can say some season tickets area can\nWe had said that we bought the team if we'd leaked that the deal could be\nCanceled because the lawyer for St Louis who was advisor north one had to help build the\nPublicly finance stadium in St Louis\nWhere eventually the rams moved too but if we had leaked it or told everyone to deal could be cancelled and that's why will McDonnell who was\nYou know I think number one in the country for football reporting went on Don Imus that morning and said this is a new press conference will be announced that the pitchers are moving the St Louis\nYes said James ... made a handsome profit yes he did give us a few nervous moments one story after another warning of a move to his native St Louis but in the end with wind delivered on his promise to sell the team to local interests\nAnd that made us Robert Craft Boston businessman who pony up with the bank of Boston about a hundred and eighty million dollars to realize a personal dream and I bought crap is the reason the patriots have a new beginning\nSo would that all background I talk to the then governor that before and I said there's a chance I\nCarefully worded it so it was not to but if we can buy the steam you Schulman we can get a stadium dumb down town and we do things and our international business\nYou know over a hundred countries now we do it by verbal commitments and I was a short and it'd be the great thing and and if we could do a\nNew home for the patriots would be a problem for another day this was a time for celebration\nYou know for me this has been a boy or a dream and in a way I Hope all the people that have\nYoung men or women or shared a similar drinks or kids\nI Hope they'll share this with me vicarious way because uh the odds of it happening in a really long shots but I'm also mindful as thrilled as I Am today I'm mindful\nOf the responsibility that comes with it and I know ah maybe today people view this very positively but something's gonna happen and there'll be people out there that want to take us apart and I just hope\nTheir patient and they wait and see what happens over time and we're going to give it out that shot his\n... through and what I thought it was a very fair uh offer them a vote was the famous suffocated the way to proceed I think the families of those areas I observed from ah they one of deserve a ... he made it possible for us to do that\nMy objective from doing this his to help bring the championship to knowing month we didn't do this to be a doormat for any of the teams we do like to when we think everything is in place to make that happen\nSo I'm sitting there at the press conference ... to ... the wisdom what's called among the\nBus calmer and how the whole family behind me and it was a mum unbelievable unbelievable feeling sort of like the feeling the first game down in Miami in one way actually own even though we lost\nYou know drew Bledsoe went toe to toe with Dan merino\nBack to watch all second
