because I Will what happened to the left screaming\nAbout white males but based though is the is the new guy you know white males need do her own oh they just shut up yeah what happened to that well\nYou know this this gets into the whole conversation of\nOf where we are you know as a country right now we've seen you know the the the blame game especially from the left the last couple of days or not that his exclusive to the left but the vast majority on social social media and in the media in general\nIs the left attempting to blame Trump whether it's a synagogue shooting or whether it's the you know the the the mail bomb or a ... year I I mean the the piling on is just incredible I mean we live in a society where the left and I think it's very important you have to understand\nThat that they don't have anything else to go on\nPeople don't I I heard Bill Maher said that uh that uh people support the the Democrats and where they stand on friday I just saw the headline that's incorrect they don't if you look at the major tenants that the Democratic party supports\nThe American people do not the American people do not support sanctuary cities the American people do not support a open borders the American people do not support\nThe amount of gun control that the left would want a ... in in this nation they don't where they do have\nWhat they do have an advantage of by the way I I just love to just see that some of the Democrats are now coming out against the death mhm and you know that's that's beautiful except the fact that if you see the plans that they are putting in\nIf you if you see what ... Cory Booker and everybody is talking about free health care well forget about it you're never going to pay for it because you can't tax everything that the rich has to pay for everything that you want but it's interesting because we're bringing up the deficit and the debt and look you know like what Trump's on the debt and we've often\nSaid this\nFor a ... you and I've been doing the show for Thirteen Years so we were there for the last few years with the Bush administration ... where we had Democrats constantly calling St Bush were spending too much and we said well we hope you're here when Obama is is back in in in ... when Obama's in power and by the way we criticized Bush on his but yes we ... we\nAbsolutely did yes ah and we [laughter] we ... criticized one of the images of of Texas a conservatism Tom DeLay when he told\nA conservatives to shut up because we've got just about everything we can and the budget we said you're full of crap ... so we have no problem if you listen to the show you know we have no problem taking on\nA Republicans when they claimed to be conservative but they are not and so we invited all those people back then that should be between two thousand five and two thousand eight and we said look the Democrats takes it in two thousand eight we expect you to come back when they sky rocket the debt how many calls we have from Democrats in the eight years\n\nOn the debt on the deficit or ... years and my mom I Can't remember one zero\n\nSo I mean that's they they have no credibility of that and and people don't care that's the other thing too people don't care anymore Republicans used to screen the debt and they realize people don't care now the Democrats are screaming that people don't care they they they just don't I\nRun a couple of things over the weekend where people were saying you got to understand the country has and I think I mentioned this last friday to this country is really going or we're really going right we're really going right we're really going right\nIn some areas we are ... but fiscally were not\nNo not even close now on on economic issues we're moving to the left well and and the Republican Party is moving to the ... yeah and\nYou if you look at the uh the the the major threat from capital of the two capitalism and freedom more importantly a it is that debt or because if we're not going to if we don't care about it now than we're willing to let it go over the edge and at that point you can't turn back which means\nYou have government take over control of industry when industry goes south or if there's a program that goes south or you're going to have what\nAgain or imagine a scenario forget about cutting you know we talked about the whole hair cut thing you know to to present five percent ten percent but the problem was is that now you can't talk about a one percent\nCut you can't talk about a one percent increase snow you can't you can't live with your increase to one percent\nSo there's there's just no way you would have riots in the street remember in Europe\nWhen they were cutting or some of the social benefits and there were then and there were riots by young people you know they were they were talking about the especially the like retirement benefits and everything else and the young people were writing there were setting cars on fire how dare you take away all of our free stuff\nWell imagine you know an economy our size and we get to the point that we can't service that debt anymore\nI don't remember it was what open that door it was the jet I mind trick of Brock Obama as president but that's not a problem\nWell today the the economy isn't collapsing but it will and I compare it to saying well you're bedrooms on fire but you're in the kitchen and everything is fine\nOn on economics on on a tax cuts yeah the Republican Party is moving more conservative\nOn on spending uh on on the\nOn tariffs and we're not talking about China we're talking about the other ones and no we're moving in the Republican Party is moving in a more socialist right a a a a a position remembers we brought you friday the Commerce Department numbers and a half\nOf the increase we're talking about the increase in the GDP half of that increase is due to government spending mhm not not the private market booming now half of it is the private market and preventing and we agree with that\nBut we look at what's coming down the pike here with what Republicans have done and we're extremely concerned about where the economy is going to go\nBut to me when we talked about you know for example tariffs again and you've got as I said on friday have conservative lost their economic mind ...\nBecause you have people that are conservatives that would absolutely be against the increased a government causing the increase in prices in goods\nAnd services because the goods are going up and they're claiming that's a that's a good thing that will actually make an economy do better actually two responses on that on friday no no no no no tears makes the economy better know doesn't\nKnow we live in this and so people that were conservative I rent is delusional state of increasing of prices helps the economy it doesn't\nIt helps the ... the companies or the industry that has designed to protect beyond that no\nBut when we get to a minute we're talking about the blame game in the whole civility thing because on many issues out there we talked about civility when we talk about look you need to get along with everybody well let's talk about the issues you and I've taught gone down this road before and we've looked at what the left as promoting in this country right now and what they're promoting something that we can't compromise on there is no

yeah\nWe're going to force you to do this we knew it all along\nSo you look at freedom of the first amendment they don't believe in that anymore they don't believe in freedom of speech I don't believe in freedom of religion Second Amendment they want gone they believe is antiquated and as we as seen now and this comes from the identity politics ... created and nurtured by the Democrat Party\nAre there to the point now of as we saw during Cavanaugh a woman is always to be believed due process doesn't matter when a woman makes the allegation everybody knows that's total garbage\nEvery case is on the evidence if you came out and said you believe now there should be a presumption of innocence and we should have due process you were called every name in the book you were called a gang rape enabler and\n\nThat's where the political divide is in this country then we go even further\nWith the election of Trump and the ... and and what happened with cabinet\nThat now the left is promoting and we're seeing the beginning of this and it's and it's spreading now go to social media and see how many people on the left are picking it up well you know yeah the electro college is wrong and now so is the Senate\nThe Senate is wrong we shouldn't have a Senate anymore and we shouldn't have the electro college which again\nTo me there's no compromise on those issues why\nBecause I understand why they were created they were created to protect individual rights that the left used to care about we've often talked about the ignorance of the people in this country especially on the left when it comes to\nUnderstanding the constitution which they don't even want it seemed to understand what so ever but we live in a constitutional republic not a direct democracy and there was a reason for it\nIt was sold the majority could not rule over the minority\nIt was so individual rights could be protected but the majority could not rural your constitutional rights invalid that's why we live in a constitutional republic\nThey don't care and so now the political divide is not how much a government should provide to every body or how much the transfer of wealth should\nBe\nNow the left has moved into the political divide is bad and we don't believe in the United states we don't believe in individual rights we don't believe in the first amendment we don't believe in the second amendment we don't believe in due process\nUnder the law we only care about what we want and however we obtain it including tearing down the constitution of the United states if we had the power to do so\nWhere's the compromise if you sit in our streets where's the compromise on that\nWell there isn't any there isn't any so there's going to be a political divide and it's going to be fierce and it's going to be passionate\nWell and that's always going to be the case and and right now the reason that it is [noise] uh the the debate is so fears is because of the importance of those items\nThis is why you've seen the Republican Party has been jailed especially since the cabinet thing but I think the the Kavanaugh thing was was not just about the Kavanaugh process or the lack of respect for the process\nI think it was an eye opener for a lot of those that were in the middle I think it was an eye opener for Lindsey Graham\nBecause\nAnd I had a one time during a pre show meeting during all of that after it happened we were like I said wow who knew Lindsey Graham huh but you had Lindsey Graham actually say during that a passionate speech\nTalk about the process during Sotomayor and Elena Kagan's\nConfirmation\nThan what the discussion was about but I think for a lot of them they live inside the bubble they don't see it as we see it every single day\nFollow the rhetoric but they don't follow it like we do certainly they they hear things and they see things but now they were people were getting in their face\nNow it had come to their table\nRight there on the committee that they saw it with a Senate majority leader basically being chased down in an airport they saw it with with Ted Cruz and it wasn't just protester groups\nThat kind of behavior had reached the\nSenate chambers and I think it was an eye opener for them to put it on perspective and say well yeah\nOf course it was bound to reach our table it was bound to get here ultimately and it has and that was the real threat because forget about the the the the protesters and and and all of those who are shouting at the faces of people\nYou've had the endorsement of that behavior since Maxine Waters and even before that of others saying it's OK er Don Lemon saying oh it's it's comes with the territory\nYou should expect us but then they go further no we need more of this Michael Moore just the other day we need to wrap it up and he was talking in the context of the bombings or the attempted bombings the mail packages\nHe was saying we need to wrap it up well tell me how you wrap it up from where it was last week Mr Moore you mean actually bomb I don't know how you wrap it up what are you talking about you're talking about violence\nWhat is it where do you wrap it up from chasing someone down in an airport\nWhere do you wrap it up from someone being shouted out of a restaurant where do you wrap it up from the type of behavior that we saw from the Senate Judiciary committee the Democrats on that committee and their behavior how to wrap it up from there I I I don't know where you go\nThe marine [noise]\nAn important message for Medicare Hi Sarah hello dear I was just talking with Pamela\nDo

FM W. B. R. O. [noise]\n\nThey never follow the trouble to go to ... early and get what you must have fallen read I read what what somebody go the\nWe have these\nAre currently I'm Gary Mac emerge so just having a discussion on the political divide from our point of view and wide exist today and and it's just it's a reality of what we what we live with a we're not the first ones\nTo live the political divide in this country and we won't be the last the only difference in the political divide now is it's not a political divide anymore as I can see it\nBased on the fact that\nWe as a nation need to provide more to the people with a bigger federal government under the constitution but now it's a belief on the left that the laws and the constitution that we have to protect individual rights and the minority\nDon't matter anymore and so you know we we've talked about capping off the caravan also brings not just illegal immigration or into the forefront but it brings in the concept of sanctuary cities mhm and I still believe that the Republicans have failed miserably to capitalize on this\nBecause yeah such or you think about sanctuary cities just the belief that in a legal immigrant criminal\n\nAnd their freedom is more important than the rights and security of American citizens\nThat's the point that it's been brought up enough what you hear is sanctuary cities well we need to protect these people but what are you doing you're not protecting just illegal immigrant you're protecting the illegal immigrant criminal that's ... ... by the way that's actually why it's news\nYeah\nYeah it's it is not you know this is the you I think the the situation in California where you had a city's come out and and go after the state for sanctuary state policy\nAnd\nThe the concerns that were issued at those all those events surrounding that and it's still going on it'll be ... that will be an interesting legal battle by the way uh to watch in the coming years um\nBut that threat is is very real when you talk about your cities' leaders are you're counting or your state leaders saying we're not here to protect you\nI mean that goes beyond think about the empty political but the the political process the promises over the years we're going to be tough on\nCrime we're really going to work to improve things that some people actually were able to get it done\n\nBut those empty political promises people usually scoff at this is quite the opposite it's not just a political promise it's an in your face action by the government that says we\nAre not here to serve you and your safety interests were here to serve the safety interests of someone who doesn't belong here who was not a citizen\nAnd so I think it's important where the political debate has because many people are falling into the political debate has become the back and forth on social media every tweet let's analyze it back and forth who had the worst in Salt\nWho made who who who made a the the social media statement that can be perceived as a little bit more violent than the other person even though it really wasn't violent and even if they were kidding around and we're like let's talk about what really the political divide in this country is really about what is the substance of the political divide\nRight and I believe from my point of view\nThat's that's what I fear\nI fear a loss of liberty I fear last of the protection of the uh minorities\nIn this and and and I mean across the board I'm Talking about constitutionally speaking ... the the reason we live in a constitutional Republican not a direct democracy\nAnd that's why the call to get rid of the Senate and the call to get rid of\nOf of ah the electoral college even if it's not going anywhere it shows the intent of where the left wishes to do when you see sanctuary cities when you see open borders when you see their leaders promoting lawlessness\n\nPromoting it yeah that's when you get to the point of people saying\nI don't know where I can compromise how do I how do I deal with you how do I talk to you\nRight\nHow do I how do I get it how do I want to get across when when the cabinet thing goes on and you have the main stream of the Democrat Party the mainstream Democrat senators\nPromoting at a certain demographic always has to be believed in this case a woman\nThe ... and if the presumption of innocence doesn't matter and that's the person that the allegation is thrown against automatically is guilty when you had that exist when you have\nThe homeland were always there when

political divide that exist in the United states them today and analyzing it what it is let's head right back you would go to ray a in Birmingham, Alabama should me Randy Randy Hi you're on the Radio Welcome to the show Hi Randy\nThank you sir I my opinion as is that the last is trying to take us to take the United states to the point of failure and I believe that the United states falls that you know where's the rest of the world to understand\nWhere the where the savior of the world if it were not their face of problem happens in the world we are there what happens\nYou know you you make a a you make a great point and uh I remember when\nTrump first started running for president people wonder if you'd be an isolationist mhm he wants to back off he doesn't want to get involved he's been president United States now he probably has projected us power\nWithout you know any type of major war better than any president I've known yeah in in in my lifetime ... you know projecting it I guess maybe you can make a case for Reagan because of the the the the Cold War or a different thing\nReagan ... post Cold War say let's go post okay for sure but if it's I don't think it's unfair because I was totally different situation when you look at at the Cold War that exist there but post Cold War\nAh I I think he's actually he hasn't been an isolationist I think he understands that even though we don't want to get involved in everybody's business you've got to project American power and I believe that he has why they want to do what is an interesting case I Do think that you have\nFor example you have left us professors that are sitting there and they're think tanks and talking about how we need to be you know global citizens and how the United states needs to you know needs to go away and to become part of a Europe or whatever\nBut I think when it comes to comes down to the average person it's not that complicated I think they're not getting into theoretical political discussion leftist discussions\nI think it's about the fact that they get into the tunnel vision and say oh we didn't ... Kavanaugh's in we can't have Kevin I'll get rid of the Senate\nWell uh it's coverage\nTrump trials president tried to get rid of the presidency um get rid of the electoral college at ... we get rid of the electoral college we can't have a ... if we lose the electoral vote\nAnd win the popular vote we can't have that and and and it is pretty much the solution to everything from the lack of that didn't go away we'll get rid of that\nSo I don't I don't know if I don't believe that the average liberal running around who was outside of the university [laughter] or liberal think tank is going through that process of saying we wish to all be global citizens I Know that's promoted\nBut you see it and most of the do those kinds of comments mostly come from university\nAh type people I think it's the average\nLiberal politician out their sit there and says I Want to win the next election what can get it for me open borders well I really don't want to open borders but I Want as many illegal immigrants to come in 'cause if we claim that if we claim that we care about them than if they can get citizenship will get their vote well and that's it it\nIt's you know if we can it if we can uh posed as people as the side that cares the fact of the matter is is they only care about again their side the things that they want they want to completely do away\nWith the foundation of the nation they want to do away with this with the with anybody who disagrees with oh we want free speech but only free speech\nFor the things we agree with her uh [noise] well that's not what free speech is about [noise] free speech is about the stuff you don't typically\n[noise]\n\nAs soon as ... radio on Westwood One\n\nBe a part of the conversation by calling to shovel it sell a hotline at eight six six nine zero seven three three three nine red eye radio and shoveled tele what matters is inside\nI tend to an owner operators how you tired and chasing empty promises\nRSVP it looking for you to join their team offering a dollar Seventy\nFive per mile for some of the drivers or two dollars per mile for teams are asked me Pete he's all miles that hadn't back home or not in their vocabulary they're nuts Raymond rentals needed some secrets how our I think the today an owner Nate RSVP three six five that's a A R s me Pete three six five four apply\nOnline an RSP P.

Bush was he did you hear the way that he talks ...\nBut the fact was he was called everything in the book from a mental case\nTo Uncle Tom and he has to be by the ... if you ...\nFrom their point of view he has to be to hear how we ... started up ... ... yeah [laughter] ah you had the the group of a of a black Trump supporters last week hundreds of the meat ... now I don't know I don't know\nWhether he's got it you know whether the in the midterms\nYou'll get a cup more percentage of blacks blacks still overwhelmingly vote for Democrats we all know that but the fact is imagery the imagery and it's growing each and every day whether it's Kanye West coming out or\nUh some of the biggest conservatives supporters right now and Trump supporters in this country are blacks it may not be a world going to change at the moment\nBut the fact is they're getting media coverage\nAnd the more that comes out more the more blacks to stand up and say I like Trump and I don't believe he is a racist they can't have that on the left that is not permissible\nYou and I've always said on um you know\nProper racist how many years has anybody ever have an allegation of him being a racist\nIn business ever know\nAnybody who's ever worked for him personally you know you saw a number of people that were in fact he was at a resort or when he was campaigning twenty sixteen and you had people that stood up you know from all ethnic backgrounds that said he's critic boss to work for\n\nNo they they praised him until he became a threat in ... in until he started working you know for things how many\nHow many and see a a A N double ACP awards did he went right\nNow he was praised across the board the liberal left love Donald Trump up until the time he decided to run for president and promote things like tightening the border\nLowering taxes yeah no they loved him\nBut he was well and still lose on most everything that he's done these well within the mainstream of American politics as you pointed out many times but that doesn't that doesn't matter no he's an extremist and we must be labeled him as such\nThis will be the tactic for you know and hasn't been the tactic by the left or for many years on presidential candidates but it's going to be the ... it's the tactic by the left on on pretty much everything now and we address this last week\nI don't like a lot of Trump's rhetoric and I don't think it's needed I don't think it's needed to win but I Know it's part of his personality\nI hate to say it but as ... as the great conservative political pundit shots she said [laughter]\nRemember during the campaign or was it after the campaign there was after the campaign last messing with people's heads yeah we're from queens we messed with people right now I don't like it because I think that on so many issues he has the wind\n\nAnd he doesn't have to get personal well and ... in ... in a in a lot of the rhetoric right order in order to get the when we've talked about this in great depth last week got some complaints on it that's fine [laughter] welcome to talk radio but it's not needed mhm\nThe instant satisfaction of somebody on their side was mean so you can be mean back and you get that instant enjoyment stop but we don't need\nEspecially with the wins that this president is getting that the other Republicans haven't been able to get or weren't willing to take on in years right\nBut the wind do the talking\nBut I understand but I've come to realization of of who he is by the way I did see some I did uh some of the social media are posted well you can't no longer look at Trump and said that the rhetoric is acceptable because he has good policy\nWell no\nActually you can and you can also say for all of his rhetoric um\n[noise] look at the opposition mhm look what the choice was what was the choice mhm the angel Hillary yeah\nAngel death ... was it was gonna say [laughter] about Scott that rhetoric [laughter]\nGrim reaper [laughter] by the way she said she would like or to be president but she isn't going to run in two years on I saw that had went over the week yeah mainly because she knows that the the left is going to call her outlook they're done with her they're done with the establishment left or whatever you want to call it\nNo no no matter how much else it won't be long before possibly but it won't be long before they're done with a Casio Cortez and O'Rourke\nWithout work it's gonna be November seventh button [laughter] another said might be a little bit longer\nBut it's but this is they did this in Georgia sex remember\nYou know the the race there oh he's the next he's the face of the party okay for any of your Democrats without Googling it tell me who he was they don't because that's that's they move on they're done with you\nA tomorrow because you're going to be the oppressor tomorrow [noise] well I just got to be what's\nWrong with either nation to I did hear and he's a I heard him say no but I did I hear he was asked that question even when he loses taxes\nYou know move you run for president right in twenty twenty so overworked may still be around for a little bit yeah we'll see\nYou know run for president mhm who else who else is there did did a warrant\nKill her chances yeah she's done either way I what is it one of the DNA places I don't know whether they did this after that whole controversy but I keep seeing people who say\nI you know went to you know what's my DNA dot com whatever in a\nSenate my sample got it back and I'm Nineteen percent Native American mhm there's two different commercials I've seen where they're Native American I'm thinking to myself it's just a coincidence\nYeah\nIt's a total coincidence or did they make the ads after Elizabeth Warren my uh my wife and I both did ours and mine came back a dude you're a middle aged white guy of European descent did you really need to spend the Seventy bucks on this now have you done it\nYeah see I I have no

[noise]\n\n... book\nVery much and there is early radio candies are currently I'm hearing McNamara eight six six Ninety read\nI were talking about the political divide in this country we go to willy in Little Rock Arkansas Willie you're on Radio Welcome to the show\nOh thank you for having me Gehring Eric\n... go ahead you're on the air\nOh sure um thank you very much for me I just want to say that um\nI Want to tell you that um everyone on the left is not crazy um where your friendly neighborhood Democrats I personally don't want open borders no one does no one on the left wants open borders no one does\nAnd I think everything is getting so politicized the dope artist and things like Pittsburgh is happening things like bombs being mailed all\nOver the country the Democratic candidate nominating no I I ... I really need people that are rather willing in well you didn't you Willie ... we've\nHad crazy people in our society deranged an evil people in our society for quite some time\nThat's not sure it does so saying that it's getting to this point and that's the cause of what happened in Pittsburgh that the cause of the person mailing the the device just through usually it'll you just said\nWe're becoming hyper partisan you're against it and you become hyper person\n[noise] I don't mean to be hyper partisan and I don't mean by all I'm saying is LA we're we're not all ... on on the left buried reads about what were your brother I Want to your nails\nAll right I Want to address one thing that you said that nobody wants to open borders I Would disagree with that tell me one Democrat what their policy is in ... in any of that illegal immigration plan too\nSecure the border tell me any of them that had said\nThat this is our plan and we need to have border enforcement and we need a because you'll hear a lot of we need comprehensive immigration reform but they'll never get into the specifics of what should be included in that comprehensive immigration reform when it comes to border control\nWhat you had or what do you what you have a right now you think about this Trump is being blamed for the caravan\n\nLook you can be blamed the choir not being blamed for the game is being blamed that he doesn't care and the and the and the point is because he said we're going to stop and that the border and Democrats are saying no they all should be able to get through because they're only looking for the American dream and that's what's fair\nWell then at that point it nice rare but if you believe that as the mainstream now the Democrat Party believes you may be a liberal and you may say you disagree with it but it's what your party now endorses\nThey may not you ... they may not use the term open border but that's what they mean go ahead I'm Sorry go ahead\nIt is it is unfortunate that that\nPerception of the Democratic party has now collaborated but I I Would I Would venture to tell you that no president\nIn the past three or four administrations has deported more illegal immigrants ... he deported more immigrants than any President Trump Bush Clinton Reagan none of them\nOkay and look I I don't know why I Love to know what I hear leaning Democrat okay once open borders okay one day here's here's here's one here or there if we want safety here here's the point I Want\nI mean we we can debate the numbers some other time but let's say that's absolutely true that nobody deported more than President Obama then why is Trump being demonized for believing the same thing the Iraq Obama believed\n\nIf things are hyperbole ... has\nA little bit less than ... than Obama dead when it comes to his ...\nHis finance the way when you talk about the way he talks about it not want to see not what he wants to do nothing subtle people aren't against what he wants to do is that where you're trying to say\nOh I'm trying to say is that it seems to me or as someone who is your brother is your fellow American citizen and I love you don't have a ton of conservative friends Republican friends we're all brothers we're all brothers what I'm saying\nIs that\nIt seems to me that Trump and\nThe way he characterizes people who are in need\nAnd if you were in their position if you were in the same position you want the best for your family you want you wouldn't want the best for your friends you would you would want the best for yourself you want the best life it seems to me that\nLanguage and and okay but a lot is not the ... can you not where after that we're gestures guilty okay well let me we're shares we're using language to characterize right right well here's not ... it here's the point is ugly right now that people are dying in life and I'm I'm Sorry okay article or dying but as a result\nOf hatred and partisanship coming from both sides and I will tell you that the left is just as guilty\nIn your body and I would be our oh\nWe have many of these are currently and I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety\nRed eye or to the last caller we\nAh you know ... after your call and I'm sure we'll get more people saying this because they do every time both sides are responsible for creating the type of rhetoric that causes these shootings I Would disagree with that but are they ... what happens after we had the shooting\nAnd and I go back to O. wild when I first became a talk show host in the nineties there were\nA lot of the shootings that that happened I I Will say that that the ... from my experience sitting in my chair and I'm not going to say it's a dumb argument to get in well both sides do it well you know you'll be able to find both sides to do it you're going to ... when you have\nTens of millions of people in each political party yeah somebody from both sides are going to try to make political hay out of something\nBut what does the media\nWhat does the mainstream media and when you get to more official politicians and off of social media what happens when there's a shooting almost immediately the leapt comes on and starts talking about gun control\n\n... it happens I mean if it's right away they don't even have it in that he's not one day or two days it's the same it's at press conferences from local officials\nBefore we even know what happened in any incident is immediately politicized\nUm\nAnd then you will have from what I normally seen it could be exceptions to the rule but what I normally seen afterwards is then when the right gets involved\nAnd starts talking about the second amendment ... and then that debate goes on ah\nTo sit and discuss what rhetoric may dry but\n\nA mass shooter to do what they want it's I guess on your part it would be a gas on my part\nNone of us know you don't know\nWhat sets off people and so to say we need to ... we need to temper the rhetoric across the board\nA ... I think we should uh as conservatives because I think we can win every issue without doing so I understand why the left and I understand why some people on the right do it\nI disagree with it but I understand why they do it the leftist nothing else to go on the last caller I'm like I said it was really interesting he was talking about how you need to get rid of the hyper partisanship and\nThen he went into hyper partisanship\nWell and and in saying that he doesn't know anybody that's for open borders I don't know anybody that well the fact of the matter is is that there are there are people out there that are calling for open borders I think we sort of convince ... here's the thing I I\nThat's a huge ask those that use side with and I mean the people running for office or that are holding office right now\nAsk them what level of enforcement on the border do they believe that it's a very simple Russian uh\nBut we live in a nation with free speech we're not going to get rid of free speech the second amendment isn't going away free speech is going to stay\nA there is a party that was just to get rid of it ours is not that party\nAnd they're ... they're working very hard right now to to do that and and if you think to the last caller if I don't think that doesn't exist then go to talk to the people of California by the way you're using the wrong pronoun there is a penalty of up to a year in jail and that law for a reason\nWhen I say ours I mean conservative I said party I meant conservative because Republicans as you remember McCain was a Republican assigned McCain or that or a sponsor McCain fined gold and Bush signed saying that he knew parts of it were unconstitutional but hold up the courts deal with it and you and I were in serious when he did that so so there\nYou know if if you if you think that you know you you're the colored in describing well where are your brothers were you know we we are trying to paint every one is as someone who thinks is him\nOn the left that's not the case\nTell me it's not extreme in New York when they say if you used the wrong pronoun we can find you up to the point that it would shut your business down\nIn California [noise]\nIt's in the law [noise] they can put you in jail for using the wrong pro now [noise] now telling me that's not a ...

I come out and well there's a Toyota Prius falling in [laughter] the park you know a couple of spaces down from my truck and I'm just thinking ... I Wonder how the air [laughter] you know I live in a very liberal county are not very liberal county but it's a liberal county\nIt's a blue county and the town is\nLess blue but that's it's still you know gets it more and more is becoming ... and so you you just wonder I Wonder who that person is I Wonder what they think I almost want to stand out there with a microphone in and talk to them\nYou know or just do just to just know Mike flag nothing just so what are you thinking on election day\nYou know because it ... I'm always curious as to the people\nWho do participate especially an early voting it's not just you know conservatives um it's liberals but even in our state you know it's a red state but you see that participation on both sides so you wonder what they are thinking and and if I could have a conversation\nOh with a number of them just just a round table you have you have my mindset yesterday was such a nice day yeah I mean this is uh to me this is this is not work today\nIn the middle of a three day vacation ... I just happened to be doing this today ... because if it's supposed to be in the like eighty today in eighty tomorrow and then it's gone so I'm pretending this is like a long weekend and I just happened to come in here and want to chat with you ... I wanted to bring in some alcohol to pretend I was staying out real late in the morning and mhm\nRight so I took a long bike ride yesterday Fifteen mile bike ride\nAnd I did it all throughout my huge subdivision\nThat I live in ... and as I was driving around 'em or we're probably knows I'm riding around I'm looking for one crew sign one\nBecause I told you the other day I I didn't think I saw one why specifically when Fifteen miles around I live in a subdivision that probably has about three thousand thirty five hundred homes I think it is relatively new\nUh south south a ... a south west to Dallas a twenty five miles southwest of Dallas or right before you get to farmlands where I live you know there's like subdivision farmland ... but the big subdivision\nOr probably about two or three every block I Would go down every street two or three sides didn't see one crew sign in Fifteen miles driving through my subdivision and you and I asked the question\nIs that even an effective way to spend your campaign dollars\nMhm [noise] yeah I see a number of them are in my neighborhood uh there's there's a few but there's just as many Ted Cruz signs right now and yards in mind there\nYeah nine of totally couldn't couldn't find one yeah and and but I'm driving it I'm\nGoing violent man I Would love to talk to these people ... like if they were\nSitting out there and drive wages hey how ya doin' pull up my bike oh yeah riding the bike and then look at it or even ... even even if I had to not to be honest and tell us [laughter] well in ... and not just a volunteer information just go oh see a voting\nFor better why over Cruz no that's that's exactly the way I Would like to approach it especially at the polls just have like a ... just a roundtable discussion of people that are voting or just cast their vote a okay you know what do you think as you just cast your vote\nSo it would be you'd say what are you thinking not how you got yeah so you're exactly okay\nWhat are you like what is it that is you know because it is it different in every low college it's different in every precinct or it's different you know state to state or we do have\nYou know Democrats that that when I mean Beto has won his district I mean and and can if he wants to serve in the house he can he can stay in that district I think for a long long time if he wants to\n'em but there are you know\nAgain as you as you kind of wide now through the state I'm just curious as to what the the average everyday person\nIs thinking because clearly the act of voters so there's there's that um is it a routine kind of thing it almost is routine for me but I take it very seriously and it is a very thoughtful process because I Do take it seriously\nYeah but the routine there's nothing wrong with routine I mean just party ... is part of the culture that you grew up right All right but\nI Wonder are there is somebody that that have a routine and it's just based on you know this is the ideology and and this is it and it's not or not even a ideology there's just no way I can vote\nFor the other side I mean there's a number of questions that I Would have and I said it would probably take hours to sit around just a just a regular you know think of Frank launch and the stuff that he's done\nYou know Fox News of years I like Frank but I always think he asked the wrong questions you know why he doesn't ask the questions I Would ask ... exactly [laughter] and\nAnd I think in that setting too I mean these are these are people that I I Know just voted these are people that are active especially if you were to do it like in an early voting setting mhm you know it that that are active early and it's going to I Know it's going to be on\nBoth sides um I Would love to see what is it that's driving you and we'll we'll see some of that I think you know after a while a week from Wednesday we'll we'll learn what some of that was\nHere's a question I Would ask in Texas nobody is even talked about the governor's race\nYeah there's really not a race they can talk about [laughter] because Greg Abbott has a roughly ... point lead yeah over loop evolved as the Democratic yet by\nA former former sheriff of downtown ... ... and ... that's not even close you you don't hear anything about that so here's a question that I Would ask this is very interesting question you have\nProbably a couple of hundred thousand people maybe even more that are voting for Greg Abbott but will not vote for Ted Cruz ... there are people out there that are voting for Greg Abbott who will vote for better over why would be my question mhm\nRight because there's such a disparity if if there is and and right now or with the real clear politics or he's roughly up a a Ted Cruz roughly seven points they they moved it I think in our cp though as to now lean\nIt's not a close to ...

I've said that the the biggest challenge that we face today is talk show host is not debating the issues it's debating against ignorance people actually don't know what they're actually promoting to me that's the ... that if I go ahead go ahead\nYeah because if I asked my my African American person that that that dumped speaking with or Latino person you know I'm I asked them because I learned this from you guys what are you for what I mean I Know what you're a gift but what are you for\nAnd and put most of them they really can't articulate what they're for this particular with their gas\nAnd as a black person I have to stay so they have that my skin color doesn't dictate how I live my life it it informs me on\nIgnorant people buy vitamin but it does dictate to me how I think oh I live so therefore uh were you when you're saying right for them is the problem do really\n... and what is America racist\nOh you're talking about individual people go at it currently\nRight you have to go down that and I think that's what we you know battle against all the time because\nThere had been we've changed the definition of things or people labels certain things\nAnd we have to go back because you just displayed there ... James we have to go back and ask them okay what is it that you mean by that specifically what kind of actions are behavior you talking about when it comes to people that you believe or racist because we have to go back to every uh you know Republican\nA presidential candidate and Bill Maher said it\nYou know during the twenty six team a ... election season well the other guys Mitt Romney and\nUh you know George W.
