Peterson is the editor of the authors many or all of the explanations of the authors and what is\nFrom and what happened to them after many of these authors writing of the first World War became peace activists are pacifist or anti war voices some even became anti bomb voices living into the fifties or sixties or seventies some died as late as Nineteen eighties\nThese are spanning burst in the nineteenth century deaths in the middle to late twentieth century the\nBook is filled with surprises I was not surprised to find pieces from all quiet on the western front this is Eric Maria remark\nThe great German novelist who writes a story about young men were drafted early in the war in one by one go missing until there's none left but you feature Pete\nThe episode of finding and cooking the goose why\nWell because I mean you know I mean I think I felt that you know my read [laughter] you know occasionally needed a break and I you know I think that that's\nThat's part of the greatness of you know remarks book 'cause it's a mixture of of in a cruelty to Britain ... wall but these moments of great sort of being a male bonding and ten minutes or the friendship\nUm there's also you know the shoot 'em and I just thought that you know this was a wonderful scene I could've\nYou know I could have picked to many other scenes from the book so\nAre you ... you did include the famous dining room which is in the movie the ... I don't remember the goose being in the movie but the dynamism movie I think so\nIt's it's a wonderful see what simple enough our our our our two heroes or a steel goes from a amassed\nA dog who wants to kill them or stop them from stealing that goes but they get away and they spend on not cooking it or they enjoy it they eat their Phil and then they take what's left over to a friend of theirs right someone who's being held in in a garden\nAnd obviously we are he's he's delighted so but I mean it's so so what's what's wonderful is the description of the ...\nYou know they're having you know this wonderful Mayo which is something\nObviously that they've gone very often of late I'm certainly you know on the battlefield so you know it has all that sort of um you know had in this take pleasure\nOf a Shia good Mayo and that's I think that's what's great about the book is it going to change register so so rapidly and go from one to the other\nTwo stories or I'm going to mention here John ... where these the gifted\nAnd James Hand leaves I Surrender comrade are both are included here struck me Pete as\nStories that war and the war is not going to and they didn't know that at the time I understand that Goldsworthy believe that a generation had been wiped out not ... not necessarily just his generation alone because he was an older man when he went to the front\nI think he he was in his near fifty when he was there but the James handling piece of set the scene to men\nAre ... working class one Irishman one Englishman are in a shell hole and they're surrounded by a fog they don't know where they are they can't get out\nAnd suddenly a very young and frightened German soldier surrenders to them comrade and they grow angry with them and they grow enraged with him and they murder him in the course of the short story and it's a theme that could be on stage that's how I saw this as if it is a one act play\nA off Broadway in New York or in the east ... in London but the horror of it is that these men are driven Matt ...\nBy the fact that they're doomed and soon enough they die too and I felt like I was reading the first war the second war the Korean War the Vietnam War it felt timeless how did it to you when you first came on it the\nWell I mean obviously it it has a very sort of underground existence and it's you know it's been out of print it was it occasionally it's reprinted I found it in a very shocking and I mean to\nYou know I'm not surprised that\nYou know it it it hasn't been available um and it's something which you know given you know what we know about you know was today and soldiers and less raised and everything it's obviously but hey there which is unfortunately you know all too familiar\nRight was war is madness and the behavior is not is is Savage Savage says ... and and and the savagery itself is self despairing because it's aware that it if they have they have they have knowledge of that they've gone too far and they don't want to but they they don't want to die either it's awful\nBut there's also I mean there's a sort of you know ... like quality of life you know the dialogue it's very it's almost surreal um [noise]\nIt let many I'm\nJohn calls where they give it this is a dream he dreams that he's wondering in a landscape and there are men hang demand ghost hangs skeletons and young women with pale faces they're dancing around them I this is John Goldsworthy of the foresight Sacco who I'd always\nAlways regarded him as a nineteenth century Victorian class to class conscious a satirist and this is as ruling a read as I've ever had about war how did it strike you\nAs well I mean you know I agree with you obviously I wasn't you know it was a I mean you know I just read his writing I mean you know he did write\nQuite a lot on the wall and it was very very involved in you know campaigning against it off to it so [noise] you know I was interested to read it and\nIt did it feel like you had a a complete change of heart from the foresight saga there's nothing of this readiness to their\nYeah yeah no I agree but also I mean he obviously you know it was [noise]\nHe was you know cold top and the sort of you know hatred and we're the ocean you know at the time I mean I think [noise] you know it's it's difficult to sort of imagine you know the sort of passionate feelings that people had on either side of you know at the end of the war\nI Wonder if he had the weight to push back I don't know he died in Nineteen thirty two and then he won the Nobel Prize for literature Nineteen thirty two and he died soon afterwards but he was illiterate giant the time\nHe served very in in the war but he's an older person so he doesn't serve actively from his hospital orderly uh certainly worth reviewing your opinion of Goldsworthy when you read that piece the book is no man's land fiction from a World War Nineteen fourteen to Nineteen Eighteen\nThere are many other choices to go the good soldiers back the we've not touched on but it's a very famous book and I recommended will make you laugh uh Pete Erickson is the author I'm John that this is the John ... or so [noise]\nMy name is ...

fast talking points in time probably this news and weather from the revolution soft Washington New center on somebody\nArgue\nMore than you're\nTown believe he's being unfairly linked to the attempted assassination and has no plans to back off his verbal attacks on the media\nOne confidant adding there's no talking him out of that one day after calling for unity and condemning the taxes on American president changed course writing on Twitter that a very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media\nOfficials that Yosemite National park were investigating the deaths of a man and woman who fell from a popular overlook park's spokesperson says a visitor ones that are reported that two people have plans to their deaths that have to point which has an elevation of about Seventy five hundred feet so unclear where the pier fell and from what smart\nFrom Florida so that information is coming out there were mailed from ah from Florida I saw the story than that to a sources are saying that\nThe whole uh ISIS flag thing that authorities believe was to throw them off and they don't believe it had anything to do with a a a ISIS they belong there were the cable guy or alerted the cable guy right I think it was something just to to throw them off and so we're getting all these different stories and meanwhile all day yesterday my question is\nWhere they live bombs were they ready to go walk right not wise that makes that makes a difference if you're giving out all this other information all this other information is being leaked\nOut there why isn't anyone why ... why isn't any media outlet\nIn really insistent in asking\nThose questions for me it was quite frustrating yesterday and then uh was was busy a lot of the day uh yesterday in and went to sleep in and woke up late\nAnd when I woke up late that's the first thing and I felt like five hours I woke up right just about two hours ago and\nAnd this was I woke up I ... you know okay there's got to be the new story out there whether it was live bomb or not and the same thing right like wait a minute this is about four days since the first you know since the first bomb right you know what what is it why can't why can't we get a straight answer when you when you talk about Austin\nAustin a bomb went off ... so at that point you knew that they were lied bomb here no bomb has gone off to the question would rain just for public safety or public knowledge are the bombs lie or not and still referring to them as you know ...\nIt uh you know the devices potentially dangerous devices potentially dangerous devices that are you know that are dangerous mhm well why would they be dangerous does that mean because this will be the question I Would have\nDoes that mean that some contain gunpowder right et cetera and tainted an explosive device but there was no detonator and then right so they would be a potentially suspected of you know a bomb\nA with a you know explosive material but the explosive material wasn't going to go off and it wasn't a\nDanger to anybody unless you took a match and put it to the gunpowder right right\nYeah just simply by handling the package itself it wouldn't be necessarily a dangerous in the way that a live bomb would be but but but again\nAh you know that this is something where you know not not fearing at all ah it has been\nAnd and there's nothing wrong with an over abundance of caution by anyone in you know in this scenario except for the fact that you don't have something for I guess the the public if they were armed\nOr those bombs were ready to go off in transit that's something I think that would be warnings all over from authorities saying that you wherever you might be anyone could potentially and counter one of these devices\nAnd that kind of warning I'm not I'm not hearing\nSo and when you get to the press coverage of calling them bombs yeah which is it you know if the Saudis have not said that they were lied bombs why are we calling them bombs right what is the purpose of of doing that is that accurate reporting if they are not bombs were telling you in real time the frustration that we have right\nRight and we think it's important to point out the frustration unless there's a reason for you know unless there's eight investigative reason\nFor for doing so except the fact is the people that are the person or people that mail the bomb they know whether they were alive or not and they know the authorities are already know right so what what would be the investigative purpose for doing it is beyond\nIs is beyond me and so when I finally saw some frustration because it got to be a little frustrating yesterday when you're trying to figure it out or they like bombs or not and would they have gone off was it just some explosive material but they wouldn't have gone off right because that that one of the reasons the leaks are happening they give out information\nBecause you see it all over the place I saw the the the tweets people re tweeting it if you know anything about it and now here's some of the information some of the information we believe you know it's it's the authorities now are being directed to Florida well elites come out for a reason\nLeaks from investigative agencies come out for a reason\nSo why are all these other things leaking and being told that the public by the media but not the one question but I think most people would want to know with with with ... or they live where they live or would they not lied bomb right right so there's where we are so we'll get to that like a more of that coming up here\nI Chelsea Clinton I consider running for office\nMhm I just had to throw that in there yeah it's a friday why not anybody shocked no\nWell you know she has experience with NBC so\n[laughter] [noise] who was it\nWho wasn't on NBC I Can't remember who was the I think it was Brian Williams was it Brian Williams okay she's well traveled that's how he described her ... ... the\nYou mean she's been on a plane I that was the first daughter of course she's well traveled\nYou know when I Will never forget him that night we I Know we played it on the air yeah but that was just unbelievable yeah it was like gushing over the fact right the Chelsea Clinton was not working for NBC right and\nThe thing is that when when when uh George Bush's daughter went to work for NBC not so much that there are a couple of articles you know but yeah but but not no gushing now you're getting is what I was referring you did you did cause the news ... no that's why instead of it was like OK we'll let her in for now\n[laughter] I did a great job it's like Megan Kelly exits stage left but once the entire contract and I looked at you and I during an appreciable meeting and said and does it seem like that NBC went\nOh wait a minute oh we can make this cause it not Bayer up ... she's already making too much from she hasn't made that kind of money she hasn't pulled in that kind of revenue yeah or so this is an opportunity to get rid of her now\nRight well because the ratings I'm I'm guessing weren't stellar um and ... and [laughter] any good excuse right ah yeah we're going to let you go\nSo I'm Megan Kelly at ... and who knows will she be back on friday but it looks like she's going to be off the air for at least a while and she lost so here's here's how it went down she made the blackface comment I I don't know when that was Monday or Tuesday and then by Wednesday she had lost her\nAgent yes they parted ways\nAnd now it's basically it looks like there won't be any any you know coming back to to say goodbye or or sign off or anything else it looks like it's pretty much done and you wonder you you just wonder okay that's the old saying that escalated quickly\nUm she came out on\nWednesday\nAnd did some kind of apology and they said the audience you know that was their gave her a standing ovation\nI I'm not sure why an apology it deserves the tent no fishing [laughter] [laughter]\nIt's not like some kind of great performance that social side of the ... well yeah yeah uh but they gave her a standing ovation\nUh and then later on that day and just kind of went down from there and that's when the agency that she was with the talent agency I decided to part ways whether there was some celebrities that we're going to appear on the show that after the comments on black face they weren't going to appear and they decided you know the cancelled so uh\nBut that likely comes down to the fact that the ratings weren't great you know it's just the worst thing ... anybody has ever said\nAh no\nNo but ... but asked Roseanne Barr how much you have to say ... probably Roseanne Barr that situation was much more serious in terms of of how it was viewed in Hollywood than what Megan Kelly said I I don't know I my I don't know I my two my two conspiracy\nTheories and then once you know initially they weren't going to\nInitially they weren't going to fire that wasn't in their plans with initially just for that for what she said they weren't going to do it\nAs you said in our personal meaning you figured out that suspended until after Halloween yeah ... come back after Halloween but but then they went on wait a minute hold it she's not producing yeah oh wait a minute rating we can get out of his contract we can we wow one of the lawyers said you know this could be caused and if we get it for cause we don't have to pay off her contract\nThat's one side of it the other side of it as\nMy of the conspiracy theory is making Kelly was thinking I don't want to be doing this is just totally sucks but I don't want to be able to collect my contract let me say something that's maybe a little bit controversial but not far enough for them to justifiably fire me for\nCause [laughter] well I mean and if they try I can still collect here's the difference Megan Kelly's saying that on her old show on Fox\nNews would have just been another night of making Kelly\nYou wouldn't have heard complaints may be I mean on social media you would've yes but it wouldn't have been treated the same\nI mean she may have had to follow up and say you know hey that's not what I meant it's not okay or whatever but it wouldn't have been what it is that NBC for a morning show there's a big difference and and and the type of\nA audience that you have there so who knows what will happen but ah yeah maybe maybe it was amicable\nParties also coming up Chuck Grassley referring

Fox News so I just wanted to throw that Katherine Harris wrote that with explosive material and so that's another thing that we have heard right which is and we mentioned this uh in the last segment\nThat we've heard explosive material and we heard\nA pipe bomb potentially wrote dangerous potentially explosive devices are but we haven't heard actually lied bombs and so we're we're that's the question that we\nAre asking that would they have it all from what we know all ten of the explosive devices and\nUh went to the u._s. postal system right which means they were handle so it wasn't us a question that it wasn't touching it ... or in in any way that it seems would have shut off the bomb so were they timers and would they have gone off at any time or where they just\n... did you have some explosive materials but they would have never detonated unless they might have been in a fire right uh and so those are the questions to understand the motivation of the person who is sending it that's why you like to get to that point but now four days into this\nAnd we still don't know whether they were lied bombs are not authorities have been set and so you ask the question why but postal markings on those packages sent\nA two prominent Democrats have helped federal investigators were find their focus of your investigation with Florida described as a region of interest to sources told Fox News\nOn Thursday the investigators have not said whether they believe the suspect or suspects are in Florida or called the packages were mailed from the state New York and Maryland are also in focus Fox learned a government official noted\nWhat appeared to be thick dark electricians tape on the pipe bomb sent\nTo former CIA director John Brennan now that's where they used the term pipe bomb there\nMhm so Fox uses the term pipe bomb was it a pipe bomb right because what's the definition of a bomb bomb is something that will go walk\nMhm right\nYou have a detonator in it which is going to set it off one way or another number be various ways to set it up so was it a pipe bomb or nobody said it was allied pipe bomb at this moment right or the officials said investigators are hopeful that the black tape capture DNA fibers and fingerprints\nOn the mock ISIS style logo on the one mailing to government officials sudden investigators believed it was designed

Radio Welcome to the show Hi Mike\nHow you doing very good\nYeah my my outlook is about the mail bombs that also in a way how it relates in an odd way to the concept of like\nInto the stock will that mean there's the where the people on the left say there's all different status of the victims well we've always known that if someone on the right it's ended by someone on the lap while it's not nearly as important as the other way around but now we know it's also not nearly as important as if someone on the left\nUp here it's like they might have been injured you know by the oil every all the water was told me about her life but nobody really knows and so I guess ... in the colleges they could start teaching something like that that law by victims data so they can help straighten us all out and were you\nOn that [laughter] well you know my hair Eric you were talking about what the tweet\nWas a Donald Trump junior the put it out earlier yeah Donald Trump junior making some a very good points on social media or yesterday Thursday and and I think on Wednesday as well saying well where was the call for civility when someone sent fake rice and to his residence and and\nIt was you know they've got a ultimately close to to his wife it was intended for him Donald Trump junior and the same thing happened to his brother he was asking a I forget who was he was asking\nUh in in that tweet or he was responding to somebody else's tweet um but that's that's the whole thing is that there was no call for civility when that happened I mean you see a number of things have happened um that and with any president or presidential family but especially this one\nYou've had how much you know that has happened and been sad\nUm and we have to point out\nBecause Gary laid it out a and

I don't think so what is it specifically\nSaying that how might Hillary Clinton harming the gallon campaign anything [noise]\nCredit [noise] bad ... bad crap picker don't trust her\n... I I the reality is I I voted for her [noise] um I supported her but she does things that um [noise] she kept so for herself and I'm ... ... big mistakes eloquent so there you go [noise]\nSo what you're saying is she believe shouldn't\nRun in twenty [laughter] forget about Gillum we're clear on that what about twenty twenty\nYou know because here's the thing you know the bubble that the Clintons have always lived in but many people living inside the beltway or inside of the ... beltway um\nThe ... they they when they when they go on the\nYou know a speech tour or or you know um if they if they go out and just do some rallies right\nOr it is the case for any of them right or left that those rallies are filled with Friendly's for the most part I mean except for outside on the sidewalk they're filled with friendly\nIn other words the Clintons have been surrounded by people who have been telling them they're the greatest for a long long time\nWhen you step outside that you step away from it a bit I think Hillary got some of this even when she was running and twenty sixteen remember the reporters that approached her during the campaign season\nAnd started asking questions about bill\nThen they had to pretty much at that point Debbie Wasserman Schultz was hiding Hillary [laughter]\nWhere's Hillary was the question and you ... the ... they had to create that while they had to build a wall around Hillary so that they you know she was not approachable\nSo she's been told by a lot of people oh you should run again you should run again you should run again but it really will be their own internal that will tell them you know our millennials on board\nNow that's a very different question as to whether or not she should go on and endorse or she could she helped Gillum or any other candidate right now in the left\nIt is a very different question in terms of what she run or or should she run or would you vote for her and twenty twenty many of those same people that just criticized for maybe a few of them might vote for her\nBut I don't know that for sure because by the time we get to twenty twenty I don't know that you're millennials going to look at that and go yeah she's just not the ... and we need somebody you knew and fresher gentleman besides her\nJust you know because I was actually watching the the the video over here so you didn't have access you weren't looking at the video but the woman who said\nThat she should be there just for fundraising and she was older I'm gonna get she yeah she was fifty plus I write about Jesse she was the same woman or who said we don't trust her right that she's not trustworthy and that's interesting because that somebody who is experience Hillary Clinton\nThe other two were younger there they were probably in their thirties so they probably don't go all the way back to\nAs many of us do Hillary Clinton and Hillary care way back when\nWhen uh you know she was in charge of of putting together a you know some type of single payer health care system in America in the early nineties\nUh so I thought that was really interesting yeah she can raise money but then we don't want to hear from or we don't want her image around we don't want her people don't people don't trust her and what she means as Democrats don't trust her she didn't trust her\nRight and I when I found that just to be I I found that\nTo be really really really interesting one other point that I Want to make here because we hear this all the time and we've addressed it before but it came up again the media this week is at Trump's rallies when they talked about Hillary in lock her up but that is\nIt that's it you know instability that that is look you're talking about a political rally and you're also talking about you know why why are they saying lock her up you have to go back to you know what's it about just because she exist\nAnd she opposed you lock her up no that goes back to what that goes back to the whole email scandal where people can identify what the crime was you could look at the law and say this is a crime that she broke and many other people who did this anybody else who did this\nAny normal person who allowed top secrets you know to be so accessible and broke the law and she did would end up in jail that's what that's based on it's not just based on the\nOn what the left is attempting to portray as just\nPure instability they don't like her so they want to put her in jail no it's based\nOn her behavior what she did and the fact that Republicans have looked at it and said ... and many have looked at it even not just Republicans conservatives with other libertarians and say well actually broke the law right she put the server and her house that's breaking the law she knew\nThat people were going to have you know at that at that level as secretary of state that every foreign government is every\nAh unfriendly and probably friendly foreign government is looking to tap into anything they possibly tend to find out what you're doing as secretary of the state by you doing that\nOn Friendly's where we were able to get into some of our top secret you knew it and you did it\nSo you could hide emails from the freedom of Information Act that's a crime yup there's two crimes they're the Espionage Act and trying to avoid the freedom of Information Act that's what it's about now you might say well but she never went to court it doesn't take away the fact that nobody disagrees\nWith what the law is or what she actually did well it's\nDifferent than the chant by Rosie O'Donnell\nOn the white or in front of the White House you know that is based on nothing it's based on false it's you know saying that this the current president is an agent of the of of Russia a and that and you know again implying\nOr that and saying in some cases that he got there or to the White House illegally\nIn the in the case of lock her up it's based on a crime but nobody debates was broken by her\n... that was a law that was broken by her a crime that was committed we know it we can point to it now again it is rhetoric but it's it's the people what they're what the point that they're making is she should be in jail she's not above\nThe law right and it's also the fact that the system you know lock her up is also an attack of the system and the and the department of justice at that time for not following the law right\nSo that isn't that isn't a a again\nThe same as in any way justifying\nViolence site and that's what\nIs being portrayed I just wanted to hit that 'cause we'd hit that before when when the uh the you know they were being criticized at the rallies were saying that\nAnd when you would read the articles that would say it was horrible they they didn't even understand what the point was that even know why the people were saying it right they didn't even address that particular point so if you just sheer lock her up lock her up and you have no clue\nAs the majority of Americans don't understand the constitution if you have no clue what happened in twenty sixteen and its millennial said we don't even care about that right anymore well then you look at it and so yeah it's unfair what they're saying about it was not unfair\nNo if you want to if you want to get in we do have a line open your calls in common\nI mean up eight six six Ninety ...\nTips

responsible is completely on known the whole false flag thing okay one possibility\nThat's one possibility also possible that it is somebody who just flat out hates Democrats and is is a wants to make a a wants to send a message and make a point about all of the people who hate Trump\nWe have no idea yet and won't know that until that person is known if ever\nIt and and both sides are involved in my narrative just you know my narrative is what justifies the conclusion we saw it on social media yesterday you and I talked about that in our pre show meeting\nAnd that you see well Trump needs were apologize because we know it's somebody that you know who supports him who did this and then we saw the false flag it's still falls flight thing you saw the means out they're Democrats are now sending bombs to themselves and everything else on social media\nAnd nobody knows but this is a nation that we live in and and that's part of the discussion that we had last hour we've had a significant discussion on it the ... this week we want to believe the narrative before we even know what the truth was you and I dealt with this also because we talk of other instances of last hour that we dealt with this we dealt with adult with Trayvon Martin\n... to this day I've no idea what happens now because you have that you have that time span of I forgot the exact types between two and four minutes where nobody knows what happened right\nWe don't know what happened nobody and people were taking sides on that we criticized former President Obama for taking sides remember the beer summit he had no idea the ... the former president when it came to police officers are involved in suspects shootings always took the side of\nThe alleged victim not knowing whether the alleged victim was actually a victim or not that's wrong to do so\nWe set it and purchased and it was wrong for the president and the former attorney general Eric Holder to take sides in that\nAnd they took sides early on\nAnd then hold his own Justice Department found out that the whole hands up don't shoot was ally when the FBI did the investigation or are there and they talked about the conspiracy in the neighborhood to keep the truth from coming out hands up don't shoot is still used today mhm\nWhen either side doesn't it's wrong we should be basing our opinions on facts not speculation but we don't do that there is something I don't know what it is maybe it's social media where people believe that okay I have an audience now\nAnd so just like the media there's this third that I'm going to be first\nAnd if I get the right conspiracy theory if I can guess what happened before the facts comes out somehow that gives me some type of journalistic legitimacy\n[noise] yeah it's um you know it it because it would be one thing if you had sources right\nAnd you were putting together a puzzle but then that's not what this is the speculation pure speculation pure speculation based on zero evidence based on nothing you know if a Catherine heritage\nOr says look it's possible based on the leaks that are coming out a that it is but that somebody who would put pieces of a puzzle together a think she's done some cell or work on a number of stories or over the years but what are you doing you're going to people\nThat have something for you and then ultimately you see if that peace but send to the puzzle or how the narrative starts to build out or how the how the truth I guess starts to come together that's all that is it's called journalists for those under sixty journalism\nWas very important you choose to go to our nation and its rarely practice true journalism today\nBecause what you have is people wanting to 'em and they believe they're right in doing so have an opinion and have their work justify their opinion\nOr their behavior their words they believe that they're right we talked about this earlier this week about how the the biased media you know operates because they believe they're right they don't believe that they're biased they believe it's the right thing to do\nActivism in place of journalism\nIs what we see today more often than not and you when you look at a story especially one like this and still unfolding and and the public we don't we simply don't know all we know is what has been found that's it they have no idea\nAnd were aligned it and and what the mode and we're still not sure what has been found\nAnd we're still not sure what the nature of what's been foundered\n\nLet's how do you go to George in New York George welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show I George\nHey how's it going guys good show um yeah I was calling about um\n[noise] it seems like there's a lot of uh [noise] that are are going around about um [noise] that that was sleeping in terms of the last I heard it from Newt Gingrich I think it was a report I charge you for it I got\nIt I guess I'd have had some network I don't know which [noise] saying that the Democrats had two or three chance of winning the house and it turns out I'm just wondering if\nThere's a bill that this gateway independent voters no maybe not as serious gambling but it's hard and then there were just say well it's the law so why\nAre you saying that's why I knew it using that is why Newt Gingrich did that\nFor sure I'm not sure about hence the Quakers but in general I mean I think a policy was first\nOf all why or how do you know that that would scare independence from voting if independence right now are leaning more conservative as the polls sense that they do that would actually encourage independents who leave conservative to me to actually go out and vote\nMaybe well that can be at a point to maybe that was\nAs you point 'cause I look I when when you're talking about political operatives who you know you'd have to ask them what their motivation was and they'd probably be more willing to tell you\nAfter election you know why they why they did what they what they did ... and again we have looked at some of the polls out there and we of question you don't need silver for example we still question you know how how legitimate you know how you can look at all these house races and make these determinations we still have a ton\nOf of questions but when you look at it overall I think the consensus is more that the republic or the Democrats have a chance of taking back the house and a greater chance than Republicans keeping it but in the Senate I think you almost have universal agreement that the Senate is going to stay with with republic\nYeah in fact I saw something today uh that that basically just had you know that everyone all but it was it was the headline was directed more on the Republican candidates in those races or republic Republicans in in general believing\nThat they were going to keep the Senate or where the houses going I think that's still up in the air because there are some things that we can't misery even through pools but if you do it strictly by the polls right now than there is a better than decent chance that the Democrats would take the house that would not be shocking\nOr when you talk about a first term president are often that first midterm is is something where the that shift of power happens that happened with a rock Obama and a two thousand ten\nRight and so you could look at at at history that dictates has now do we look at all anomalies that didn't exist before yeah trend and that tree had yeah Trump yet cabinet and that's\nWhat I was saying about the polls have you go by the polls in history then then you could look out and go okay about Democrats take the house and and the Republicans keep the Senate\nAnd then you look at Nineteen Ninety four ... may I did that happen\nRight I was only a talk show

you know and nobody can figure out whether these rely bombs or not\nThe frustration there is already exceeded by the frustration of what in the world is going on with President Trump the inspector general the department of justice and what they were going to release\nUh about the the uh classified information and as we know the declassified sign of the ... application which is to get the secret worn on Carter Page and the communications between the FBI and the department of justice\nThat we were I've been told by Republicans is information that the American public needs to see\nWhich at the last minute the president decided not to release and give it to the inspector general of the department of justice\nWho's only job is to look at irregularities and corruption in the department of justice why has that story died everywhere even in conservative media is a non story well\nBecause I mean you look at that you know leaks nothing nothing on that story now it's it's unlikely from you know from a Horwitz we would see\nAny kind of leaks as to what's going on in the investigation right right but we would hear leaks from the other side not being the White House and why they insisted on handing that over to the ice sheet\nAnd ... women everything else is leap from the White House\nWhat would stop this because it would be\nIf we think it's ... just assume that it is beneficial to the president potentially that would be a good ... let me backtrack that many things have leaked from the White House [laughter] on say every so many things when you look at the nature of something that if if the White House believed it was going to help or\nIt wouldn't be the position of the chief of staff and advisors to the president that book hand this over to the guy gee allow him to do what he does and don't say well\nThe everybody's speculating and the media everybody mhm\nUh about the bombs and then what the motivation is ...\nNeither speculating ... nobody's even nobody's speculate nobody's analyzing nobody's saying what I haven't seen one story\nAnywhere maybe one existed I haven't seen I Would love to see mhm where somebody has made the same points that we have oh wow\nWhy did you give it to the inspector general there's only ... the whole thing was trained the story was initially framed that uh we had foreign allies that didn't want us to release this information\nOr we heard one story said it was the British Government because of Christopher Steele and we said well wait a minute why would you pay attention to them they don't know what the top secret information is I don't know what the president had I don't know what you have they don't know what's in the Pfizer warned so why would you pay attention to them\nAnd if you're going to not release it because things were top secret\nYou would have gone to probably your secretary of state who would be dealing with those governments and and there's also an ex director of the CIA and you'd be going to damn coach your own director of national intelligence you wouldn't be giving it to the inspector general\nWho only looks for one thing and that's corruption and therefore once it was declassified\nAnd people saw what was declassified in the White House they looked and said there are probably possible crimes here\nAnd before we released is we need to first given to the inspector general of the United states to go after the corruption that we see how come nobody has written that story right and if somebody has I haven't seen it I've not seen any major publication right the possibility of that story and why\nThis all went to the inspector general why would you give it to the inspector general you saw something that you believe warranted his offices action\nAnd what his office deals with is corruption so you're giving him the only the only path that you can go down is you're giving him evidence of corruption in the FBI and the department of justice there's no other path to go down right\nAnd nothing on the story right\nBecause if you didn't believe if if the president looked at that and didn't\nBelieve there was some kind of wrongdoing\nThan there would be no reason to contact or was it would be only if you believe if you saw it and said wow this looks like there's a possible wrongdoing within the department of justice\nThat's up to ... to write the report was handed over because that's what the inspector general does\n... and by the way we'd be bringing this up and thanks to many of our listeners who I get a few a week ... people running the emails saying what's going on right\nWhich would you guys walking around saying do you hear anything I mean we haven't seen any stories on it either of what's going on I mean that should be one of the biggest stories right now and and who should be reporting this big ... story who should be encouraging it Republicans are they no\nNo no no\nAnd I would think that that the media would be curious I Would think\nThat uh Katherine heritage or or someone else like that would be curious you know anyone that that is a not in the mainstream media but ... but you know someone who has done some really great work in all ... I Would think\nKatherine heritage Fox News would be on a consistently I Would think the wall Street Journal would be on it\nConsistently I Would think the Daily Caller would bionic consistently mhm Valerie things that are I Would think that Andrew McCarthy that's one of the you know and we're cars running other articles\nI really ... and we've been paying attention to it I really haven't seen him right any type of in depth article on that at all and he's been covering it in a separate cars there are a Carter right and and I just wonder why is everybody quiet on it\n\nAnd you're telling me there's no leaks on this one at all zero\nWhen everything else it seems like in the world has been linked to al ... and how many important\nItems politically would be late\nWell it and so there's there's a I guess a couple of possibilities they looked at it and said well there's a a chance that what was done here was illegal was ah was someone ... acted outside of their their uh their legal bounds\nWithin the department of justice in this process but we're not sure handed to Horowitz so in that case you don't lick it because of Horwitz comes back and says no wrongdoing was found then you look bad by leaking that information and you cook burned you know your connection to me\nI\nI don't sense because of the nature of what you know how it happened and and frankly how quickly that kind of happened\nAnd the fact that it went that direction to begin with tells me they see that and say there's there's a great\nChance here that that this is wrongdoing and that's exactly ... and ... and Democrats were completely quiet yes and the other part of that violence from the Democrats when it went to the inspector general there was really nothing the other side of that of handing it over to Horowitz is that\nHorror which doesn't have to ask anyone for documents at the department of justice through an investigation but ... the ... office can walk in and can obtain those documents and no one can stop them\nWhy has doing why hasn't the conservative media from the very beginning talk about the fact of why this went to the inspector general right that the inspector general because we were still we were both on them for the first twenty four hours not understand what is going to inspector jumped doesn't make any sense doesn't right\nAnd all of a sudden one day on the air ... is one that I think it was the day after or whatever we said oh wait a minute 'cause we're we're we're we're like baffled ... because they were making the explanation as if we can't do this because it could be due dead do damaging\nSome of the top secret store allies and therefore we're giving it to the inspector general more like why why would you give it the inspector general if\nYour word oh wait a minute\nSponsored by the Rhode Island Army National guard feared by the Rhode Island broadcasters association at this station [noise]\nHi this is Kelsey grammar every parent wants to their child to reach the fullest potential that's why I Try and hospitals for children is dedicated to helping kids do what they otherwise couldn't especially pediatric care for orthopedic conditions burns spinal cord injuries quest live in politics provided no charge\nTrainers hospitals innovative research now standing teaching programs to help and hope for even more call one eight hundred to three Seventy five zero five five for morning from a trainer's hospitals for helping kids to find the U.S\nMight check one big pose that come when you say have case and I got to do with my friends now my family's in putting my hand and he said\nHey yo what happened to my scene makes\nMe laugh [laughter]\nThere'll be\nOppose her care more it will be an asterisk dot com brought you buy ad council and the U.S Olympic Committee\nSocial Security is with you through life's journey to get to know what's that Social Security dot a\nWe're their day one baby names and the gift that last a lifetime we're there as you grow protecting you and those you love\nWe are there when you get your first job in helping you to stay for the future we are there when you marry your sweetheart to help secure your new life together\nWe are there if the unexpected happened in to help you see life from a new perspective\nWe are there when you start your next chapter to make sure you get off to a great start and we are there when you lose your soul mate to help make sure you will be All right we are with through life's journey Social Security securing today\nAnd tomorrow we'll get to know us and see what you can do online Social Security dot Gov produced us ...\nShop thousands of trucking accessories on line that I was eighty dot com or call one eight six six for Iowa eighty where you're free catalog\nAnd I'm here with a unit royal truck tires engineer to talk about the unit royal LD ten drive to\nYes the long lasting L.
