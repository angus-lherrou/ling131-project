years and you think that\nFinally when he passed on but it was too late to say goodbye to him because she disowned him all those years before it ever personal reasons so one has to think that

I Can't remember the head of the CIA guy um if we don't prosecute these people for the crimes that they did a widow\nBetter than a third world or the third world country we're letting these people get away with what was wrong illegal unconstitutional and basically all those things make a make I'm an American\nAnd the if if we don't take people who commit treason\nAnd prosecuted for that then they're going to keep their little following that they're going to walk around you got plenty of people out there that are saying that well you know ... evidently it wasn't that bad they did break the law they didn't do anything that was so evil and um it it's [noise]\nI I just think that something needs to be done to show them and along with all that you know freezer assets because they're ill got games in the Clinton Foundation\nAnd I mean if we're going to go all out or go all lead on Kavanaugh for thirty five years ago I I'm sure we can find plenty of people at the evidence for what Bill did back in the eighties\nSo I mean why can't we go that route\nYou can and although someone challenged me and said what about the civil war right they committed the certainly are illegal acts at the time and yet we were generous and you know we we didn't Lincoln didn't want to do that kind of stuff\nBut then this is a wartime assistant wartime decisions\nPeople who actually are saying that the people who did who fought on the side of the confederacy were fighting the this is I have a different view on on the civil war them some people do I mean I I I understand that\nFor some it was about slavery but for most it was about a overreach the federal government and civil disobedience and states' rights that's where that's where the bases\nThere were a lot of scientists were fighting that okay go ahead no no you know I was living in such good\nOkay now but I mean that's so that that's where I mean to me the rebel flag that the rebel and actually it's not even really the rebel flag it was a a a battle flag from a particular state it took on a representation of\nStates' rights to me that represents states' rights over slavery and when I talked to people and I've actually talked to people who have\nFlown that flag where I've had that symbol on their truck or whatever that's what I asked him I said okay now what does that represent to you and nine times out of ten it does have to do with you know states' rights and overreached from the federal government\nAnd the people that uh take the other avenue as far as slavery and white supremacists and stuff like that then I just you know okay what makes you better than anybody else why why or why are you better than that person what gives you the right to enslave another human being so and I think this is also the difference between\nAn old dove tail here the difference between conservatives and liberals I won't go party wise here because parties are\nEvidently irrelevant at this point and that is\nWe engage in conversation we engage in discourse\nDefend your defend your principles defend what your argument is they just want to shout you doubt that want to call you names now that is not everybody in the Democratic party that is why I I don't associate that with the Democratic party these are the left wing way out there which\nComes to who I Would actually have coffee with ... there's nobody really on the left politically that I could sit down and have coffee ... however I have met George Clooney and he's a really nice guy and very humble and I I could sit down and have a beer at a cigar with him or something that would be cool [noise]\nYeah well I appreciate your answering an hour I'd the guys are not following rules yeah yeah\nWell ... well it's okay well there's there's nobody on the political left I wouldn't want to sit down and have except for ... somebody said Lieberman I I Would love to sit down and talk to labor of it as far as people who I Would like to see yeah I\nI don't know how you set a oh who's who's running [noise] yeah [noise] well you well I I Know that there's somebody who's actually\nDiscussed running or did you get used to be a rising star who uh no longer I think it is a viable candidate that'd be Jerry Brown I'd love to see\nHim run 'em really who actually is moon's oh I'd love I'd love oh I'd love to see him run oh I don't think there's anybody out there that's going to be able to beat Trump I really don't and I think he's because he's got one a\nCampaign under his belt for the presidency he he knows a lot more one thing you can say about him he learns and uh I I think he's learned a lot of valuable lessons and I don't think he's got to be it was a little\nI don't say soft but he wasn't he didn't play hardball the way other people that and I think this time he would really\nTry to be a little bit more aggressive in the way he would uh addressed anybody who comes against him on the left I'd love to see Cory Booker go up there because I think each I think you'd shredding the same thing with Elizabeth Warren\nI think anybody from the left it gets out there he's got to pretty much ...\nI certainly agree with you he's gotten much more comfortable in the job he really has become much more presidential and I think that's what you're saying he's really grown into the job and I Oh absolutely\nAnd and he does is he's been doing really good on everybody's watching what the right hands doing\nActually I should say left him because he is science with those right everybody's watching what the left dance doing it with his right hand these just signing stuff sided sign of mine and he's getting a lot done why everybody's talking about the rhetoric and looking at the ball bat sticking and um\nMy my my fiance and I have been attracted by several people that we went to school with and suffer because you can't talk politics with him is er liberals they don't want to they can't defend their arguments they they don't want to talk about a policy\nIt's just Trump pay since this is like ... where where do you see that have ... well he just talks about\nMe examples because all the hate that ice is coming out of the left\nAll the people that I used to talking about hate or over here on this side that are represented the Democratic party and when somebody on the white quote right or the Republican Party that comes out spewing hate the Republican Party shouts them down\nAnd says no you don't represent the Republican Party David Duke there have been many many uh examples of people who have come out on the quote unquote right\nWho spew forth hatred and racism and and that kind of stuff and we won't have it at our party however they\nThey will have to you I got to let you go but you've been terrific and you gave me an idea for

gonna be like you know Booker or Senator Warren odd\nBut I just don't want us to make things that Democrats they want to jump to win the Republican primary but they\nWere so sure that they could be\nSo when I'm when I look at it I really want to win a hundred percent on an effort that but I always think about it like well there's always a chance he's not going to win and if you don't know

including one still being felt by police have been charged in connection with the fatal shooting of Georgia a police officer when it county sergeant Jake Smith said officer Anton Tony was responding to this vicious vehicle call when the shooting went down\nAs Oscar Tony and one of the officer approached that shots rang out from inside the vehicle out through the black one of those shots struck officer county\nPresident Trump said at a rally in Elkhart Nevada that he will pull the United states from the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty with Russia\nWe're not going to let them violate a nuclear agreement I go out as your weapons were not allowed to wear the ones that have stayed in the agreement and we bonded him very much for Russia has not unfortunately hounded they very much so we're going to terminate brave and we're going to pull out\nYou know I'm not going to have you much use for you I don't care that you speak well that's not what's important to me\nWas much more important is what your policies are so I think you're comparing apples to oranges there between Trump and Obama we didn't like him because of his policies not because of his race not because of the way he sounded muffled because of what he didn't\nYeah I'm not saying that Republicans are going to vote for Republicans the garlic of holding the president if you had a Democrat or Republican is going to vote Republican and Democrat\nDo is let me let me say what I think a clarified for you\nThe base you're right about that both sides have a base that was never a million years Republican vote for Democrats nor Democrats voted for Republican but I Know I have a couple of times voted for the Democratic or Republican are so bad or as an example I couldn't stand Arnold Schwarzenegger so I didn't vote for him I figured out who he was what a phony\nWas and he was in it for himself so there have been times that I have not voted\nFor the Republican candidate but you write in general that's what you choose your party 'cause you agree with them for the most part I don't blame people for that what I Do blame\nIs for the incredible hatred for Donald Trump and the fact of tonight's topic which is you disown someone because you disagree with their politics that doesn't make sense to me that's over the top\n... you're right because like I said it Donald Trump is not a bad job you get\nThe Korea issue your career is the first time and you know my act yet we got him debate and um the the climate rate is doing a really good job of\nWhat the reason people don't like the way you speak if he was more for your ... probably was way more ... way but\nI think he is but I think he is becoming more presidents I got a question for you are you going to vote for next time\nI don't know it's so frustrated with politics like I didn't vote for him to break down I Would I Would never going to vote for Hillary but I\nI like what you're doing and let me tell you that I worked for the government so you know a real happy at what he's doing you know I'm a government employee\nSo you're a good man Anthony I appreciate you\nAnd I'm hanging in there and I I just got to save your way to live longer and you say some good stuff and you ought to vote for him in a twenty twenty thanks for the call appreciate it very much and let's go to um yeah Teresa in fair play Missouri through so you're on with mark\nIt intimidating martyr good morning and I wanted to say that\nAnd I was raised aircraft I mean my whole family with Democrat lot of them have family still a Democrat and most of my my dad kings parties and during the Reagan Era and kind of took all those kids with things you know 'cause he had he had let them very sisters [noise] and\nAnd\nRecently Leon named Mike has gotten kind of the ... in Facebook and one and then\nJust completely everything was negative everything was made that Trump or you know they put up there and and and I would make some remarks and that you know on his ... and then my other cousin came out and speak\nSpoke with one night my\nOne cousin came down and then apologized to me he goes family more important than politics [noise] and I thought that was really really big I mean I think so much more willing him coming out and we talk on you know on messenger for quite a long time\nNow my other cousin I I had to delete him because everything he had was this negative negative negative you know\nEverything he put it on faith up the public political that um I my question is is you know I Can't\nVote for something that I Am morally you know against the now ... Martian or you know all these people coming up here it's not the nominee against and ration that they need to be legal and\nI just can't I think a lot of the red great comes from the news because they are so negative I mean new agree with me 'cause I I I think it changed a lot of people's mind\nYou're absolutely right you make a great point thinking Theresa and the media has changed the name of the game and used to be that there there was a lot of honest journalism and you didn't even know where a lot of them stood now they've become advocates\nFor their point of view and that's maybe they learn than journalism school\nBut that's not what they're supposed to do that just spoke to the present the news and what's going on and we get to make our own decision\nBut that's totally changed and they influenced people especially young people\nWho don't listen to that much and and I'm not big on the young people that is true of older people too and I think of it you know they're watching the nightly news or whatever they watch and they get a little glimpse of it and half the time they don't even know you know what's really happening so I agree the media has a big play in this\nAnd it's a pretty discouraging to see what an influence they do have\nAnd you know if you go out and interview people you is very discouraging to see how little Leno right they can name the vice president they

[noise] um you know what they did it was terrible book you know ... you know even if there was something small that's all right but it's such a big making such a big uproar about it on I mean you know I'm sure that they they have Saudi Arabia you know it doesn't have the cleanest record\nKing Solomon does for sure [noise] um and I mean generally get involved in things abroad when it\nWhen it's in our interest you know when when we could prevent you know bigger a human rights you know you know crisis or [noise] or you know to expand our power abroad you know to protect us you know as you know offensive is different but in this case I mean she wasn't a US citizen\nI'm here to green card\nUm you know if they did it in it isn't our best interest to just you know the big player in the middle east for us you know to protect us against Iran so like well you know they they helped us out why um what's the big uproar you know they've\nDone things like this in the past that we've known about you know just I guess it wasn't so publicly you know he I mean this king Solomon he's locked elect all ... you know the princes in a hotel for a few months to get to make them the ransom saying he's not he's not exactly a moderate you know\nIt's not your regular guys like um it's the you know it's trying to understand that\nWell let me see if I can add something to your thoughts about him\nLook it's ... it's always been a difficult a jigsaw puzzle out there in the middle east and write the Israel's our basic friend and we can count on them but the other players or you know like Saudi Arabia the war more anti Israel than they are now they both have the one side of interest in terms of Iran trying to stop Iran\nBut I got to tell you I just thought of it maybe it's a visceral reaction the idea that this guy goes in there and I'm not trying to save and great about him because\nHe was a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood and you know ... they're just they're enemies of ours are as they weren't in Egypt so I'm not a big fan of what he believes in in that sense what to do when someone or be lured into an embassy which is you know he's supposed to have\nA special status when a country has an embassy in another country that if there is in their territory their land you lord in there and and then you shop 'em up and you assassinate him and\nI it just so revolting to people I I think that's what was going on and you're right it's a complicated situation as we need their oil and we need them to find Iran it's very difficult situation for President Trump but just the thought I I must have been it got to me too I I felt badly from even though I'm ... I think I wouldn't agree with him probably many as\n... yeah but that's you know agree with him but getting getting killed like that is horrible I'm\nYeah I mean so yeah\nIt even though there should be you know definitely should be an uproar and they should be condemned for it but I mean though that they really want to large scale it seems like a large scale you know cutting off you know businesses and\nAnd things happening I mean I I don't know if it's in America's Best interest to do that like just you know for the even though it's it is a horrible incident but for this alone I don't think you know\nI'm In the bigger picture you know ... such yeah\nYeah I I I I cringe when you said cutting off business that's bad and the and the story\nBut um you're right we we need that we need them badly and that's why I say President Trump ... isn't a very difficult situation and there are people like Lindsey Graham who is terrific on in the Kavanaugh hearings now saying hey yeah I'm never going there again while in this guys and the princes and power and this and then Marco Rubio a ... there are people on our side saying\nWe we can't allow this to happen you ... you know as as crazy as it sounds you have to have some civility in this crazy world right you don't want the president was assassinated you don't take out food and even if you can\nYou don't do stuff like that that's why the the Kennedy thing John F. Kennedy thing was was so outrageous to this day I'm One of the few talk show host I should say now\nThat does think there was a conspiracy I a little kid but uh I I've followed this stuff and um I you just don't do that you just you know what I'm saying I don't know if the Russians were involved the mafia was involved I don't know for sure I I'm not saying Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't involved\nBut you know this there's something about you don't take out people and that's why by the way he ... he was so outrageous by a Obama\nUh because uh he was becoming our friend\nA very difficult to yeah so you you get it and it was right it didn't he writes for the Washington Post and stuff do you know I don't want all the different countries in assassinating them go ahead\nI Know I but I I Do feel I mean my my impression is that let's say Russia you know they just recently had a story you know in in England with the X. box um I'm sure you know it's probably known you know in Washington is probably like you know known that a lot of many countries you know Russia I'm sure Putin takes out you know yes\nPeople going down his political opponents you know here and there it's not it's not really um [noise] it's not uncommon you know so it's just interesting the reaction I guess because it just became a place like public public no you know the story\nAnd he ... he goes he yeah he goes in there and it wasn't his girlfriend waiting outside and you say you know if I don't come out and you know here's what you do\nAnd and he just disappeared and they made it worse no we always say that the the it's the not even the crime itself but the cover up and they said something they were never in you know they weren't involved then they came up the story that was\nA wad of interrogation that ah got got went badly yeah uh that that that's that's a little trays are well yeah it does show they're\nPretty sure they're pretty bad [laughter]\nYou ... yeah this wasn't a by the way I was mentioned my produced last night this wasn't a job interview that he was going in for that that would that would be a job interview that went badly you know the incredible hulk I think people even on our side are
