I really am kind of stunned that he looked as Christmas he did after again not playing the Superbowl it'd be one yeah finding them in sitting down and the\nYeah you know on on the third down pick up like that one so Julian Edelman his back and that means Julian Edelman was after the game at the podium\nA year is by the way he was dressed in a ... a Celtics Jersey\nWith number eleven on it and that'll but on the back and he's got his Edelman beard and he's wearing black patriots that and he could've blended in any tailgate in the Gillette Stadium park as scary\nAs I tweeted he looked like every guy at any dunks in July yeah located on it yeah yeah I Need a large uh what are you guys live near a nice coffee right now let me get\nMake sure you melt into sugar bank you write that that could have been in that could've been am I here years after the game though Julian Edelman on is richer\nJews are going to preface this by saying I Know that you would rather be playing to be suspended but is it possible that the four weeks that you had to work out to just couldn't do it gives off a condition made you a stronger player entering the season right now than you would have been [noise]\nUh [noise] I mean I I definitely take advantage of the time coming off an injury [noise] uh [noise] you know I had a good routine going [noise] uh Brian from the edge and ... out there a Harvard\nWas very generous of let me use their facilities Boston College\nRivers academy socks for all I mean\nIt was it was pretty cool to see all the support from all of these people and these organizations in\nPlaces so uh definitely took advantage of it [noise] but I still can get better [noise]\nAs you were in a Celtics Jersey where there's a report out there that you worked out with the Celtics is that true\nWorked out and bright and some tall guys so I'll leave it at that\nAnd tell Gordon [noise] easy on the ping pong talk he's got a special paddle\nReally he's got a special pat on and bring my paddled with this facility so believe it at that how was it connecting with Tom Brady and he's great um you know uh there's some things that obviously we have to work on a I think it was good to get out there and catch rocks and go out and make some plays in\nAnd be with the fellows um and I was a [noise]\nI haven't played football in part I think it was like four or five days or something like that so it was good to be out there in front of the crowd there are a rock and there are some uh [noise] you know seeing all then was was amazing so I'm just great to be back\nTo how how close did you feel to being the players that you've always been that didn't seem to I think people anticipated maybe a little bit more of a gap between who your word who your work and I looked it looked pretty good I feel like I'm On\nThe best me right now so living my best life\nTom [noise]\nJoe Millionaire when when you came out on the fields just the full sprint and then the emotion what was that moment like for you just right at that moment I mean [noise]\nThat's a [noise] you know some I guess we\nFired up and and he had to share with people that come out and support you uh you know get round up and you know I remember when I told my CEO and you\nKnow I was sitting back and you know during the rehab you're just sitting there and\nCan we run out that tunnel so maybe it was great I'm too good to be able to play the fellows was awesome to get a team win a obviously we can do a lot more better bud anytime you go and be the team in the conference it's uh it's always great especially the pope's um so [noise]\nYou know leave it at that [noise] like I said\nHey treats receiver Julian Edelman back at it than I with the patriots he was working out right in the Boston Celtics at times in recent days a week\nAnd he's living as a man going so of course he's learned stuff\nOf course the Bengals beat the dolphins on Sunday the patriots are back in first place in the American uh the\nAFC sees that baseball in the American football he said division in the late\n... real quick holding me had to add typewriter over the top of the Miami I had an epiphany the night watching this game beetle and I've been on the radio way too many hours today by the way well in case anyone is note it is a there weren't many what gives a damn this speaks to what you were talking about in the pre game with a with Gasper\nWhich is I did at first the epiphany was yeah I Know like\nThe color rush uniforms I hated them before tonight for whatever reason on her own Anya yup they were to Captain America the and now I like him and then we were talking a lot about\nDifferent uniforms you kept spotting in the pre game do you go there's a blue riskier now you know we're doing here because you see yes but there was a sea of people out here pre game\nYeah oh no I still I like to do that too oh a compliment when you have a guy that would come to what is now the defunct CBS scenes you see something and in a way I mean there was a captain Moyer jurors I Love that guy yeah\nSimply because he wore catching more Jersey and you don't see too many of those no I like yeah I like a like a road Ninety six Keith buyers forty one\nI didn't oh oh you're speaking my language there Murray that if something maybe maybe if you're lucky is Super Bowl thirty one patch on the other\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull or physical errors and I think they had I had him for six last week and so the first half was sort of a continuation of that um you know leading twenty four to three ah but the second half I mean essentially they gave up two hundred Ninety eight yards\nUm I don't care what the circumstances are but when you get better and and I like Andrew Luck I think he's good I don't think he's\nOff like you guys do I think he's pretty close I think it's just he's thrown up hot garbage but you give up that many yards to cope team that's without TY Hilton without the left tackle without their second best tight and um and and they already had a poor off into line uh I'm back to being a little bit concerned\nWhy do you think it is that they have them according seems to be getting smoked in coverage you mentioned the tide and he brought tonight with over a hundred yards he seems to be chasing a little bit is it just because of where he's playing in the deep\n... a a little bit I mean I Do think that you know I think that it's proved out over his career that Devon\nDevon spend his best and we'll just exclude his rookie cornerback because they just don't run that same\nSystem anymore and he's not as they don't ... you can't please don't cornerback once they moved demand the man\nIs best position in the defense has been the free safety where he basically locks everything down make sure there aren't any big plays one sidelined the sidelines breaks up a few here and there but ever since they decided to go to the three man\nSafety package with you know drawing harming comes in and plays the free safety role and then that that moves Devon down into a lot of times these ... coverage\nI think that back to exposing his limitations but I also think you could make a point\nYou know you could make the argument that he has lost a step and I talk to them about a one on one after the game tonight I asked him about those two and a half touched down so they gave up and I said you know is there anything that you could have done\nA lot more done better on those place and he's like yeah not give up touchdown so he I mean he wasn't he's not thrilled with himself either\nWho else had you concerned defensively Greg 'cause we were talking earlier how there was just a lack of pass rush again and to me it looked like the Gilmore is also facing a for breakfast\nI just thought in general you know ... and ... will have to watch the film back 'cause I mean I I got to admit I mean twenty four to three I kind of tuned out for you know where it started writing a little bit at one point there um but\nI saw a lot of guys running wide open in the secondary guys the danger reluctant even throw too and um I thought Jonathan Jones had a tough time I mean I ... I talked to a bunch of the defenders one on one after the game sort of\nYou know to get their take their pulse on it like you know should I be alarmed should I not like what two hundred Ninety a yard says a lot and you know all of them Devon said you know which they had trouble where it was basically a two minute situation whole second half um\nYou know he put he put a lot of it on that\nUm you know Carl van noisy was okay with it um with what happened the land and Roberts was okay with it um I you know I just thought\nI thought I think at the end of the day once you watch the film back I think the past rush was a lot better\nThan it look like on the field um but I think the Andrew Luck and made some place and I thought that the secondary had a tough time they were playing a lot of single single high man coverage and Andrew Luck kept a few plays alive in that kind of it's hard to keep coverage for that long\nGreg what did you think of the touchdown by Josh Gordon tonight\n[noise] ah I thought it was good I'm I'm not ready to invoke the name of Randy Moss or hang on\nThank you entering that was basically increase Gasper an Irish are arguing about this I said that was basically the ... the who the players the court and was going against was basically the patriots equivalent of key on crossing innate Abner with all the injuries but the cult of hat and those guys didn't even make a play on a ball or jump up for the ball um\nYeah it wasn't a good play was a good off script sand lot awesome\nYes but I mean look he's just going like six foot three he should he should make that play and I just think it's I think it's more of it's been so long since the patriots have seen a receiver make a play down field like that\nThat uh it's almost like a a cold drink of water after walking through the desert type of thing\nWill Julian Edelman also returns and it's like he never left are you surprised at just how could he looks easy money in and he was August game yeah\nI mean you know I ... the Julian this this Julie and that we saw tonight was actually better than the one I saw in training camp in pre season and I know he talked about needing to get his legs under him and stuff like that obviously he was working a lot\nUm while he was a way I saw him on Saturday after he worked out at a facility near the\nNear the stadium when we talked a little bit but um\nI thought he was I thought he was exceptional tonight you just you see what just having that safety valve means to Brady in this off and just having that back\nAnd I ... the thing that stood out for me the most were just its quirks we're back and he looked like pre injury Julian Edelman the man you know even on I wasn't crazy about him being back returning punch but\nYou know even in those circumstances he was showing a lot of his jitterbug move set at that we've known for so long\n[noise] All right Greg appreciate the time looking forward to your coverage this week on the Boston sports

like\nSix Seventy five yards yeah\nWorking on a story that's pretty good and I know it's\nA story I'd go but I just wonder what the severity of it is because there was times didn't look like he was coming out of his breaks lucky normally does he just doesn't look like a full grown the last couple of weeks like whatever that is what does that go with nagging him well here he is talking about it and so\nWhat does it take for you to get out because she was like oh yeah uh I mean there's got to do what you got to do about the week after week like that\nI just got a pair of you've got to get your body right or\nYou just got to study the place so when we come out here are like tonight we're ready to go with that I hadn't really exactly what it is oh it was great to have joined\nBack he's been bringing the juice since Monday and uh it just helps the office of the time I mean the way he can just move underneath the coverages get open or get yards get first downs it's just awesome to have him back\nWhat ... what happened during that low here we are a couple of just moving the ball you know\nI mean we have is basically the third quarter I mean we just weren't doing their jobs I mean that one now that I that I got the interception are full of that in my hands and I just got to bring that in a mistakes like that\nAre definitely a put you down but often it's down and give give the other one chance so just got to correct those mistakes and class\nLecture your relatives in this time or just to get a little bit get yourself a little bit\nOf a serious I mean whenever you get some extra days off I mean you got to take advantage of it now and ah got an extra ten days now it's got to get the body healthy I mean hey you got bumps and bruises all over the place especially with like two games in five days so just got relax get right man and get back at it next week Rob this is the first\nAll is is you know when I'm On the field\nOf levels are looking around for\n... yeah I mean you can take us away from each other for ten years and we'll come back and will be will be the same we'll be right back out it was probably knock off the rush for a couple of prices but\nUh it just shows that we've been we've been together as three for a long time we all understand each other and we all understand how we play which is great to have the comfort level with ... with us for that\nTeam are you guys do you feel like you're on the displaced so\nYes I mean if I if I like that from beginning of the year I mean you have your ups and downs and just stay positive and you just gotta keep working\nOn it gets warmer five hundred he also feels as seven to ... just your thoughts about player what is this a surreal\nOr what he's doing is is how we feel is a just a work ethic he has how he brings that every practice every game and he just doesn't stop so it's just an honor to be out there on the field with them and be catching passes and thought sounds from Robin

Deborah will not even that my favorite way and that was the kind of get screwed on the penalty itself third and Seventeen or they're down in late in the fourth quarter\nAnd he has a strike you know down to like it might have been healthy or a collie either way he makes a great throw beer and week after week so far\nIn the season you see it with with my home she's legit\nNow yes fourteen touchdown passes to this point Jeremy picks yes\nOr no right now and has been thrown a single interception points to pleading sixty five point two percent of his throne for twelve hundred yards to this point that comes up three hundred again even round numbers figured out that yeah\nWell look at the weapons used to go to Travis tells the story to Cory ... sent me walk adult I Am not you always feel like he's got a Spencer we're pretty good as the backup back on like like their speed on top of speed up and down that Ross Perot offensively so\nYou know there are some things you know we can you talk about the lack of a path roast tonight so you are Devin corny chasing you might be like the fall of ... how do you play tonight are going after practice Kelsey next week I'd also maybe patch on gets that assignment there's things some things they're going to clean up your between now and then the good thing is there's ten days between tonight's game in that game\nYeah you're right Greg regards sort of playing more strong safety rule on this team and you've got 'em in a position where he's he's been matched up on titan actually cover these diagrams and exposed a little bit the way things switched around with three safety is on the field\nThey've got to figure that out before this game as much as I like to brag on Kelsey for not being ... he's ... he's still the next best thing yeah so he's still something to get done with school can require really doesn't know what he's talking about is Kelsey better like rocky why don't\nWe don't have to argue that but well the good thing is going to get this part of it sorted out because they can't I'm telling you a hundred hundred and five tonight's Eric bronze you've never done that and it's new for him yeah you can't have a career type a night for someone like\nYou know the good thing is is ah their defenses garbage or just looking at this stinks teams that their Swiss cheese thirty to thirty two team defense they're given a four hundred and sixty\nOne point ... yards per game that's gone off yeah uh so they didn't have much of a pass rush you know the other thing is I've been able to see him most people have been on TV as they have whether it's high time games the game against San Francisco a couple of weeks back worker Rob Lowe gets hurt so you you\nCan't learn a little bit here watching the steam blast to watch it often simply but man they are civil defense so I Would think I think like most people yeah they'll be obvious this would be a shootout when this happens ten days patriots will have\nThe next three days off so they've got some time off year that was given to them by the team and buy a coach Bill Belichick jak so\nI'm the advantage that they will have over the chiefs will be in that their coaches are already probably going going to work it's physically there'll be a better place than that she would you have to play their game and will play what I expect to be a physical game when they take on Jacksonville this weekend\nYeah there are some trash talk between jailing Ramsey or getting ready to do is take a shot so it was a child I ... I saw that earlier today calling him a kicker churn hotter I see I Love traveling Ramsey\nWhen he was doing today let's get some more of your calls here on the shark star market patriots most game show or we go to Sean in Springfield like Shawn\nGood you know there sure are\nThose are the older and uh\nHe is still the mantle and the whole the whole yeah plus a still a Holden right that's really been a lot of ... [laughter]\nGo get more ridiculous I mean you might have meant Julian Edelman Chris oh maybe\nIt was Chris organ has basically been a a nearest erodes the excuse me can I Would have been\nLess than instrumental yeah it's like rainy season he's wide open and still refuses to throw the ball to him but [noise] but to his great he's a big part of the team camaraderie camaraderie instrumental like wouldn't blocks like though the bottom of the barrel of the instruments\n[laughter] it's like you know in the later we go into the night and into the early morning or you get the more ridiculous names here to like the spike king you never when he gets so fucking\nHere and I'm very sorry that you have to listen to every single job board it's been calling you thank God that is the most part are you guys will take the day off and it's Columbus Day if you got a little for a vacation coming out\nWho's taking them are off I'm going to take an immoral off gyms not take it tomorrow off\nWith no days off and doing an overweight at one got three days off coming up according to Bill Bill jak but that's what it is it what it is\nA new day Josh ... great game that I thought that touchdown he looked great on wherever called earlier I heard that our earlier saying\nOh you know it was an easy touchdown and\nTwo times around him call it that way political you look great I thought you might\nAlso too much so you're a coupon often Kansas City at ten days it look\nGood is it written erase\nWeight on often what are they that'll do you think it's a city they should a lot to Denver and I am agreeing with you guys jak coming into their house that's another crazy game that you have to go against the crazy goes up to go against right there\nOkay spiking it is set in the way they should have lost the Denver by the way of tastes great to Mary's Thomas there in the final minute of the game Denver wins maybe missed them asking things\nLike I mean this is we're done it because you know what her just exist so you argue with people but complete nonsense but that was on Keenan thank you you know there was one pharmacy slowed up keen of snakes you kind of hit um\nKansas City shuttle was that game that was the color of their large piece of validation for Minnesota for moving on for about ... he didn't like the three days off just a mattress on me but I think you know considering injuries like the rock is dealing with right now\nOr that they were on a short we play with like I like that they have days off year three days off in a row I think it's good for the steam getting ready for what's going to be the Republican Bill Maher\nSaid Rocco ... is that is that what you're going by said Rocco Rhode Island\nYes how's it going gentlemen\nFor better [laughter] where do you got there fed\nHey great in a awesome practice I Would say uh Gordon what was that you get your yard touchdown not much um I mean that in a lot of pressure off of other people but uh overall ... game you see in a Sony now will be happy with what happened and I\nOkay I think it's time we take a timeout Jim what do you think yeah I'm into yeah just for the overall camaraderie of the show yeah\nYeah [laughter] me right around the point we need to do that [laughter] so what's through that and we'll be right back you're on the [laughter] the safety insurance Ninety eight five sports a patriots radio network\n\nI

and and\nThere was another story in the in the wall Street Journal that the you know the GOP right now is a is really upbeat about the confirmation process they you know they it's a if you look at it that the the talk right now\nIs that they're confident\nOr so you get through a a culture which will happen sometime during the day on friday as you mentioned Gary the process will start mid morning um but then the actual vote may not happen until later in the afternoon\nWhen by the time to get through the procedure one with the actual vote take place and then there were the third and they've already our lives the clocks stop starts at that point yet\nUp and they can take up to thirty hours it may not take thirty hours they could end the debate before thirty hours but assuming they'll use the entire thirty\nHours and they might ah especially on a Saturday the media might give them the the news media cable news might give them you know all the time of the world\nAre so you look at the the so called hopefuls for twenty twenty your usual suspects I'm a warrant and all of them looking to get camera time or the debate might you know go on the full thirty\nJust assume that it will they'll that's that's why you've got the rule assume that it will so that puts it late into Saturday Night as you mentioned earlier Gary\nDepending on where they landed on the uh the the clock lands on the cultural wrote maybe into early Sunday Morning\nBut that gives them there's the I guess the wiggle room or the enough room for senator Danes to get you know home from the wedding I guess or or back to work for the wedding\nAnd uh as daughter's wedding and we wish your daughter and her\nSoon to be husband all the best uh but they'll he'll get back he's saying he'll get back in time to devote so that tells us is probably going to be a late Saturday Night well\nYou know I I I think about all the and you know I'm just sitting here just contemplating and thinking of all the\nAll the protests the violence the civil disobedience when certain things you know a a when Trump was elected to you know the the women's march show all all of these things that go on\nAnd if you look over the last eight years and the number of protest remember Occupy Wall street you\nKnow all all that that that the that went on all the the\nThe occupying of city properties and everything else that went on what you're seeing now\nAnd you have a party that constantly does that\nYou have another party that really doesn't do that at All right you see now the getting into the faces of people which can be\nQuite intimidating but here's the question is it effective for them right has it been effective in and you go all the way back like I said we go let's go back to the Obama administration\nI mean you can look at you can look at the uh you can look at the uh the Tea Party but the Tea Party was completely and totally non non violent did not know know riots no tear gas nothing like that Mm So you look at it and you get into the Occupy Wall Street right right where you're actually trespassing\nAnd you know taking over and wanting to camp out and you know there were riots in certain cities that that happened\nWhen the police tried to push them off but at this is almost the exclusive domain\nAll the left and there for\nThe Democrats sure yeah and you think about the run that they have had since all of this you know really I'll I'll look at Occupy Wall street\nAs just the beginning of of this portion of it has it been effective for them when it comes to the vote do people actually respond to it or do they believe that the intimidation\nTactics will actually work and change for example they're not you know you you you could see if they might be a you know threatening\nA just a a you know the the senators that are on you know a lot of you know I'm On the edge right now right okay on the margins but they're not they're going after everybody ... here whether it's Grassley\nDoesn't care whether McConnell what do they really think that that's affected or is it the fact that when you are just so full of rage\nBecause that's what it is it's just insane\nRange that they're filled with right now just anger and ... and and rage isn't just a desperation tactic or do they actually believe that is affected by just I'm really wondering [laughter] and I was thinking to myself here before I started talking about this I'd love to sit down and talk with them all that wouldn't be possible\n[laughter] so I'm never going to find out because I'm never going to be able to sit down and say you don't tell us what's your strategy is that right well I I I think\nAfter the ... like a thing I think they feel empowered to some extent they feel that it is effective to some extent but I think it's\nProbably a lot of I was going to say a little of both I think it's a lot of both\nActually that they believe after confronting mansion and after you know the behavior in restaurants and everything else and shaming people out of restaurants I mean think about that Gary that youre not protesters in a restaurant\nYou work there it's your job\nAnd you refuse in one case to do it\nFor because Sarah Huckabee Sanders is eating the food you're going to prepare and serve can you imagine that can you imagine being in that mentality no if I worked in a restaurant I don't care what I was doing in that restaurant\nAnd bar rock Obama and his family came in the last\nThing that I Would do is refused to do my job me not doing my job is not going to change his politics or change anything that I disagreed with that he did\nAnd that's the mentality but that's where they that's where they live ... we go back to the one restaurant where you\nHad a man happened to be African American wearing a make America great again hat\nAnd the staff was shaming him at a stable to the point that his companion I don't know if it was his girlfriend and his wife was in tears\nAnd they kept it up they kept it up they kept it up I Can't imagine I cannot imagine\nI wouldn't be able to face my friends and family if I did something so despicable\nJust shameful just shameful if you want to talk about getting a picket going out on the steps the SCOTUS\nAs long as you're not trespassing are breaking the law I encourage that I don't care what you believe I don't care what you're promoting are protesting for or against and I remember it\nWas about you know we've talked about it before is probably about the seven years ago when um and and you know the person that I'm Talking about and\nAnd it was really you know somebody who I considered it a casual friend ... you know ... do the more professionally and and and uh they were in a conversation and it was a ... a black man who was a huge fan of my show\nNow I sort of knew her politics were more of\nThe liberal bent but she went absolutely insane we know we haven't talked since that point and she completely rejected me as a friend because in a conversation a black man said he loved our show right think about that and that was really my first taste of that type of sanity\nBecause that person you refer to as you described it before I went from\nZero to you know basically right or just just a small talk we do have good to see a a thanks for stopping by that kind of thing to all of a sudden over the top rage right with

with the boats like she going to take McConnell and put 'em in put him in contempt of court yeah and they have somebody come and arrest McConnell\nYeah because uh a ... a ... from what I understand the story Merkley had had gone to the courts before this and what do you hope what are you trying to do is get ... that's why they've scheduled a hearing on Wednesday buddy that was I think a move\nWhere they filed either last week or early earlier this week\nAnd then when it looked inevitable and it did of course it was inevitable or as a Wednesday afternoon or that there was going to be a vote a this weekend that's when Merkley said well no no no no no because we haven't had you know our our day in court with the Trump Administration\nThe Trump Administration the executive branch does not set when the Senate is going to vote\nThis is really weak I mean is this is the Hail Mary I mean that this is what you just don't but here's the thing\nYou're not gonna want to miss work

and make sure it's connected because\nIt's only going to ramp up between now and the final vote on Saturday or early Sunday when whenever\nIt happens this is ... because you're right a couple of things here again the legislative branch doesn't have the power to stop\nI I'm Sorry the judicial branch doesn't have the power to stop the legislative branch process right\nThey don't get to say you know what their schedule is now if they go through and again enact a law signed a law a bill into a a ... the president signs it into law they can come in and then challenged the effect of the process\nBut then outside of that as you point out Gary it's two separate branches that are working here your suit your lawsuit should be against the Senate it's not it's against the executive branch who has no say so over the timeline of the vote on the Senate\nWell I bought but he's still but he wouldn't have there he knows there's no chance that he could go to the court and said let's stop the process because I disagree with the majority right because that that's not going to go anywhere so what he's trying to make\nIs that there's a debate going on between the executive branch and the Senate ... ad because in the executive branch's interfering with the Senate where you can't make that point because the Senate which is the leadership of the Senate which is the Republicans\nHave said we've got everything we want from the executive branch in the FBI we're moving forward and he's trying to say that the\nExecutive branch is holding things up and not giving them the information well you don't get to make that call it's a minority member you don't get to go to the courts to try to override the majority in the Senate\nI you know this is like there is like it's it's like I decided to get it in the ring with a an advantage or Holyfield right\nAnd realize quickly that I'm greatly overpowered so I called and Mike Tyson to do my fight for me I mean this is the uh this this is like because it's basically you have a Democrat who's not getting his way\nAnd his only claim is that they're not getting documents the Senate's not getting the documents the Judiciary Committee chairman\nIs the one who rules that part of it in any vetting process and you know that this is the process but since you're not getting your way\nYou're trying to call mommy and daddy in to stop me no Trump or the meat all Republicans because you disagree with it it's not going to change your vote it's going to delay the process\nBut it it won't even do that now as well because it's it's it's not going to happen yeah uh but but I was in a first thought I had was anybody who wonder stands separation of power\nOh wait a minute that's very few people are very few people understand the
