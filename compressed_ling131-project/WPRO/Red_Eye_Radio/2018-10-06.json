and one Apollo it was was of course the first mission to go to another planet right at one of those ... act that planet the Christmas week of Christmas Eve actually\nOf Nineteen sixty eight they witnessed\nThe first human beings to witness and Arthur eyes and they took a bill Anders took the first color picture Frank Borman took the first black and white and that was ... some of the most important pictures have taken and so I'm\nA bill to tell who is the author and a dentist and a good friend he put together a website called celebrate Earth Day he's trying to convince Congress\nEarth rise make Earth Day got Christmas Eve\nOr thrives day to celebrate the taking of this photograph he put together really spectacular website which I really liked because he you know includes aspects of genesis there including excerpts from the new audio book um\nAnd and so that's what this is about is trying to celebrate that first view of the earth from space by human beings as it rises above the ah from behind the loan so that's what that is John and of course this is a great Nineteen sixty eight\nThe Apollo and mission not only that when the space race with the Soviet Union but it was a great American achievement this is what America stood for them to show the world we could do things better\nAnd we did something to remember\nA space sacks said no space X said no to the U.S government money for Falcon Heavy is this a good decision by\nWell this is a long time ago this was in there was a presentation given by one of the chief executive engineers and he in the presentation on prompted pointed out he was talking about\nFalcon Heavy and some of the history and how we got there and he said Falcon Heavy we did not take any government money in fact we turned it down there will government agencies isn't say watch who are willing to offer us money to help develop the Falcon Heavy\nAnd we basically said no we're going to do it ourselves when it's done you can buy it when it's ready or we'll charge you for the service\nAnd he pointed out how that's important position to take because if you take the government like they're going to start telling you what to do and he they wanted to be the free position to make it for themselves as they wish to do it and I think this is something that all private companies should take law to space\nSections model is the right model don't don't become\nA captured by the government builds your product sell it to the government but then you'll have a better product you can sell to others the government's not allow you to do

switched to the stress to the research component um well the the Tucson southern Arizona area is put together a business roundtable space business roundtable\nIts monthly I was invited to come and join it and so I went to the first one this week and they were talking about a recent a consulting report that the at the University of Arizona as well as local government\nAnd several venture capitals had paid for this consulting report on what are the communities Tucson to grow in the space industry\nAnd they talked about it so that was a lot of opportunities for the southern Arizona area to grow what struck me most about this isn't reflects the world if they're reaching across the United states and the world that are doing exactly the same thing aggressively because they all see the space industry growing in leaps and bounds in the coming two decades and they're doing\nEveryone wants to get in on it and I think everyone should want to get in on it there's lot of money going to be made here and the next few decades shot and that was a reflection of that and I was very impressed by it and I wrote it up for behind the black or give my impression is is\nA NASA has some discouraging news about deep space travel do you follow it so\nI this is a this is what I consider to be a garbage studied to be very out if there's some truth to it but it's not a national study scientists paid for by NASA scientists say that traveling in the face will cause cancer and destroy your ... your intestines and they did a study stimulating the radiation that would happen\nA over a short period of time making believe it was a long period of time and they did it on rats and they said oh the rats suffered greatly so therefore we have we have to do spent lots of money for space

impression that Graham was referring\nTo the doctor for right\nOr as so liberals and journalists on Twitter else will spread tweets giving the false impression that the trailer park quote was from Graham only some deleted their tweets and apologize\nA gram um and then they go through the entire thing and finally a Yahoo did come out and said that they had deleted the tweet correct\nRight but they didn't correct in the tweet that incorrect no to say why they deleted it or why was incorrect\nThey it and here's the the I guess if you call them the corruption but a a tweet that came later after they deleted it\nWe'd deleted a tweet that did not accurately reflect the context context of Lindsey Graham's quote in the ... video clip and that's all they put a I I bet\nYou that\nMonth from now\nI'll hear of that we will get depending on you know what happens with the kind of thing but I bet you we will get\nEmails and commute different communications from people on the left that will say yeah but Lindsey Graham said this because once it's out there and yeah spreads on social media it doesn't matter whether there was a ...\nAction in the store which which actually are there actually is not a clear it's not a correction they just\nPosted the video again instead we deleted a tweet that wasn't accurate well exactly how was that not accurate explain that well they can't bring themselves to defend Lindsey Graham that's the problem\nAre coming up on the show today by the way or the breaking news here in the last uh about our in twenty minutes report from the White House the background check on Kavanaugh\nA which they said it will see a tomorrow no cooperation of sexual misconduct allegations or into the report from being the source report by the way by the way somebody wrote me the other day and it was really great they said what do you mean when you say source report\nAnd that's a legit question I'm Glad that that they not an official statement from you know whatever it's done in British or right it's not it's not a person and and I explained to him and say sources say and it means nobody will go on the record and tell you what it is so they used the source\nOf it that's what a source story is where you don't have a name you just simply say sources in the White House say\nUh but uh they report a again a Wall Street journal had it was where I saw a purse or that uh the uh a background check on cabin on no cooperation\nOf sexual misconduct allegations is a culture both still are set for friday\nOkay except for friday or they could have a now some report saying a a a a broad vote could come as soon as Saturday but I think uh at least a couple\nOf organizations were reporting that ah it's more likely that it would have either late Saturday or Sunday they could actually do a vote on Sunday I'm guessing they're going to want to get this done as soon as possible so\nI Would look if I were if [laughter] if I were Chuck Todd I Would not miss work on Saturday [laughter]\nSo the the entire ah I I think this entire thing it's it's interesting because if the confirmation happens the cloture vote will on friday will tell them\nEssentially the headcount will tell them if they've got the fifty and with fifty they can the vice president could be the the fifty one to break the tie if they've got fifty on friday they're not going to wait a moment I think if they get to that fifty or plus I think they're going to do that vote on Saturday\nSo we'll we'll see if that happens but if you've got the headcount you don't wait for another elevator doors open [laughter] [laughter] [laughter]\nShut down the elevated us down the letters signed off those stairs [laughter] speaking of which they have ramped up security\nOn Capitol Hill greatly over the last few\nDays as you can possibly imagine the ... you know right now the protestors are very active which there's enough itself that's not a problem\nPeaceful protests hey I encourage that whatever it is you may be wrong\nBut that's your right to go out and peacefully protest as long as you're not a trespassing a and you're you know legally in that place than it's okay for you to carry on a good sign but that's not the concern that concern is that people are talking and and there's a lot of chatter on social media\nYou know about again the whole get in your face or as they call it going direct approach\nAnd you you can't you can't have that\nIf you want to have a group if you want to go out and protest if you want to have a voice no problem but running up to senators in a hallway right now is likely not going to be tolerated by Capitol Hill security\n\nUh you know that I was telling you are in our pre show meeting about uh ice or that the uh the uh apparently it's the the union mhm the ice union is asking the mayor of Portland, Oregon to give up control the city's police department\nSent letters Wednesday morning requesting federal and state investigations over his handling of the Occupy ice protests\nUh this uh summer you remember that lasted for weeks for sea ice office in the city\nTo shut down the national ice council union that represents ice officers says the mayor fueled the confrontations by expressing support for the protesters and in public and private statements made clear to police it they were to stand down\nIgnoring some nine one one calls from agency employees being managed by protesters\nCouncil told attorney general Jeff Sessions that Mr wheelers directives violated those employees civil rights\nLeaving them without protections he is required to provide in separate letter to the Oregon attorney general the ice council attorneys for the mayor broke state laws against official misconduct by telling police to ignore ongoing crimes among the protestors\nSo I mean that's that's the point where it's getting you know right now mhm that ... you know that the the belief is ice believes in\nAnd and they're going to have to you know the uh of course ... you know make their point solve it I mean they're asking ah the the the the mayor to uh to do it we'll see you you know we'll see where this this whole thing goes\nBut that's what they believe is happening that now you got politicians stating well look if you disagree with me on us at a particular issue\nWell then we're not going to protect you\nWere going to remove right the police were going to tell the police to stand down we're going to tell them no you protect those protesters you don't protect these protesters were going to protect your you're going to protect those protesters and those people that are actually committing crimes against other government entities\nAnd are in in in timid dating and the assaulting\nA about people's trespassing doing the wrong thing and we're going to tell them to stand down and we're going to tell them not to do their job you ask where it's going that's where it's going next yes\nSo we'll get to that and a more plus your calls and comments got a great show I I had a what is coming up next a we just told you the cloture vote to a set of well it's supposed to happen on a friday we'll see what happens tomorrow it's going to be a crazy day we're being told that the ads\nBeing reported I should say that that the Senate or has the three of his and it's going over them as we speak um we keep in mind this is all behind closed doors we won't see the thrill to well the reports\nRemember you don't ... nobody really I don't think anybody gets a cop you know\nWhy they they don't get an electronic copy they get a paper ...\nBut they're not supposed to ... when I read the staff is supposed to see it only the members of\nYes only Senate members yet only the Senate they're ... they're going over that right now the committee are also has it but really well committed by the end it's not it's it's not going to effectively it's\nIt's not going to do all that well the entire point is is is to make sure there's not a leak bought\nA here's the question if you don't leak it out if you don't make it public do you end up handing it right or another great opportunity for the Democrats to say you're hiding from the people whether the normal process is to keep it quiet as we all\nKnow out and I was at the rules are on the three oh too because it because that's an official form and so and and I really don't know if is there any kind of penalty for releasing something any information that is directly from a three oh two\nThat would be a good point because if that is the case then we'll never see it and the the ... you're right the Democrats complained just writing a story at that at our CPA about look this could help Democrats or Republicans in November either way that it goes\nSo you know the if the Democrats get their when where there is no nomination or it's not no confirmation then let's keep the momentum going and then they're Republicans of course would you know with let's

that's when the rules create so\nYou you take from that basically and it could be that the majority leader comes in and says okay we'll give you guys three hours as a team and we'll take three hours\nThat could be the case because if it's Thursday that's really the only I guess I'm proceeds not that the Senate doesn't have other things to do but I'm On this issue it's the only thing item on their plate because the cloture vote is not going to happen in ...\nFriday and then you know the uh the wide vote over the weekend sometime they think but so that's I don't know that we're going to uh I I he may change you may allow more time he can he can do that but I'm In allowing more time that doesn't mean he's going to make more ...\n... it's important to note that none of the staff is allowed in only the senators themselves no staff and the look I still believe it's going to be leaked and and I believe that a ... and it may not be in in in the best\nInterest if uh you know what we saw from ah the wall Street Journal earlier that the uh sources tell them that the White House has said you know they've looked at the background check and there's nothing there just like before there's not there is no cooperation\nA ... you know ... whatsoever and therefore it's the same as it was last week at this time after the the FBI did it which means\nWhich means if you know if that's accurate that we get from Wall Street Journal that means ... there's nothing right because remember they talked to were mirrors are also because she had not yet had you know she didn't have testimony before\nA you know a Congress so that came out earlier this week that you know she had been she had been taught to invade contacted a by the FBI so if we hear that there is no cooperation that would I guess it would also mean no cooperation from Ramirez\nUh unless the source was talking to the wall Street Journal were just referring to Ford right and I'm saying that because I don't know I'm not making any assumptions\nOr a ... on this but I just I have this look I just have a feeling that Democrats are going to come out and they're going to lead part of it that\nOr they're going to say things that are that put the pressure yeah on the Republicans them to change this rural or forget about this rule in this particular case because I don't think look if there is no cooperation Democrats don't want 'em to release it\nI think they'd rather have the Republicans say no this is this is a rule that the Democrats came up with yeah and we are bound to stick with it for this ... ah you know you know this nominee and other nominees as we've done across the board and the Democrats will use it against them\nBecause it's the only thing that they've got if that's the case they have nothing else except to do use innuendo and force the Republicans than a too you know break the the rules of a background check and release all of it I just have a feeling that's what's going on because you you weren't going to have I mean I\nI [noise] you know who knows what the Democrats have up their sleeves now me nothing really has stuck to this week we're we're the Thursday now nothing else really has suck that has come out nothing right so it's Ford and that's it\nThere's nothing else out there right and so we've got today and then friday is a cloture vote\nAnd so the Democrats are I guarantee they are scrambling their up right now listening or listen to us on WBAI male right now\nBecause they're up trying to come up with another way to delay this and they will look for any way to delay it and so I just don't see I I I again I Would be surprised that the Democrats said nothing about it\nA\nI'd be very surprised I have a feeling that you're gonna have leaks or they're going to give their opinion maybe not to the point of a leak but to say there's evidence in there that shows that you know ... there is cooperation and the Republicans are just wrong which means you're going to have to release\nYeah because remember cooperation is the fact that she said\nAh that ah she told other people mhm and she told her therapist mhm that's their cooperation but they won't get specific on it won't but that's not cooperation at the crime actually happened that's not a witness said stating know these people were here that's just cooperation that she at one point\nTalked to somebody about an incident that happened yes but they won't be specific on it which will force a Democrat or the Republicans I think probably to release release it ...\nYou know there's where we stand right now but it's important to know\nUh what they actually do a in this and it's very important and I'm so glad you brought it up to let people know that uh it is the Democrat Senate that came up with this rule ... in two thousand nine riots there rule right\nAnd that and that rule being essentially this memorandum of understanding from two thousand nine that that that it it really kind of added to the process there was there was this understanding our\nOr or a rule another rule in place before the two thousand nine rule uh that talked about how they were going to proceed with\nThe vetting and information found during the vetting process of any given nominate but what the two thousand nine rule did or memorandum of understanding which is adding to the rule it was\nSecuring it in the modern age essentially because\nYou know you've got yourself on your smartphone you can take a picture or you can you can email you can create now you can since two thousand nine you're going to a lot more they may have to up to update that memorandum again but I mean you can create PBS and and actually copy a it's it's really more of a photo\nOr or scan documents with your phone\nYou know I mean they it so it really if you look at at the procedure it should be because\nThe the deal was even though this one has been very very very public the deal was is that it's up for the senators to decide ultimately\nAnd there may be some things in the background checks but don't pertain at all let's just say you know something that happened in high school\nThat somebody just claims without anything to back it up you know that doesn't relate at all to their experience as a judge but the the entire background check process has always been\nSomething that was again respected on both sides well well that changed that likely changed long before Kavanaugh started to change but if you had any doubts before this one\n\nThan those those should all be put to sleep well I I just I unfortunately think since it's going to\nCome out any way I think that we should say our sources say that the spit wad controversy in from seventh grade yeah ah probably will be released\nWell I mean again you look at it and someone making a claim\nAnd and the problem is is that the ... claim they can't find anything to back it up the left screams for an FBI investigation well that wasn't going to happen but at\nA supplemental background check the president agreed to that you know I was watching a Sarah Huckabee Sanders part of the um press conference on Wednesday\nYou know and they were wanting her to basically say the president was wrong for mocking you know Dr Ford but then one of the last question actually I think it was the last question from a female reporter well why is it that the president came out and spoke against the abuse and the Catholic Church\nAnd those those who were claiming that they were abused were men but yet he won't defend any women\nI'm paraphrasing but I'm pretty damn close that was the question and she said Sarah Huckabee Sanders answers oh wait a minute he\nHe's the one who actually ordered the supplemental background check he's been more than accommodating in this entire process\nSo his comments at the rally or were factual based but he believes that there's nothing to back up the claims\nYou know why\nThere's nothing to back up the claims the left at once again has created their own little fantasy that these are credible claims but sorry in this setting they're not if you can't find anyone to back it up\nEight six six Ninety\nSponsored

smart dot com by freight monitor\nUh All right so the report is out of the White House said the FBI background check is done uh the supplemental background check which makes seven background checks or in the history of of uh of of Brett Kavanaugh and\nUh nothing a is cooperated any of the allegations and this would be Ford\nAnd apparently I'm guessing ... too because they talk to her ... ... but all we know is that the the at least we know without question with Ford because that was the main focus of it but we also the FBI talked to were mirrors\nA and so I'm assuming that they\nTried to find that there was any cooperation there and as we pointed out to earlier now they all get to see the document there's only a it's a thrill to college so\nUh it's a document that uh it it will be just a piece of paper that the Democrats have to go into a room and look at they can't bring any staff members and they can take notes but they cannot walk out with the notes right\nAnd this was the protocol and rules regulations that were set by the Democrat majority in Congress back in two thousand nine they came up with the rural and had the majority to do this rule back in two thousand nine which is very important because you're going to hear cries\nFrom members of the Democrat Party that are now in the leadership position that were members of the Democratic party back then and we're a part of making the rules who now want to check that rule aside that would be called checking the rule or protocol aside that would be called the new Feinstein rural\nYes ah interesting note of the way it is

a great deal of power\n[laughter] the power companies corrupting [laughter]\nOh I'm only halfway joking and then later they're going to throw it into a fiery volcano um the uh ... it's interesting to know because you know do we talk about the Senate rule that prohibits them from leaking information to the media about this\nUh now it would be content or or details\nOr from the three oh two and I don't have that rule in front of me but but let's assume that it's a it's specific details right you wouldn't like that\nIt's there's likely [laughter] this is going to be the understatement of the century [laughter] it's like ... we're going to see some in the Senate I'll let you guess which side\nThat will live in that gray area of that rule and not necessarily new you hit on this first a little while ago a few minutes ago\nBut but really I mean the approach would likely be you because I could see a a rural being enforced is breaking the rules and and it is punishable I don't know what that punishment is um but certainly\nYou don't ah you you've got to be careful I guess which way you go keep in mind in the house things may be working for Democrats according to the polls maybe right now but in the Senate there's a lot of close races and there's no one\nNo talking about a blue wave in the Senate so you have to assume that McConnell still going to be in place uh in the new year but the point being\nA Democrat doesn't want to go out and blatantly violate that rule\nAh because they know internally that's going to create a lot of problems for them going forward\nI'm not saying they won't do it but but uh there's a huge disincentive for them to to to do that but you probably could see them saying look\n... and it it's going to be that it's already this from the liberal media or NBC News on on Wednesday while there are dozens of people dozens of people I think they said over forty people\nThat have said that that have ah have information at potentially they could be witnesses that's one of the words they use to potentially and their story or that that could help substantiate all these claims and blah blah blah\nThat's not how this works they don't get to control that but

Perkins ... I'm Sorry worked at fusion GPS so you have so you have fear this this again this loop being closed further by this story\nNow that the FBI council meeting with ...\nA further down on the story from the the hill from his allegation of what his sources told him they then writes Baker was interviewed by lawmakers behind closed doors on Wednesday sources declined to divulge his testimony others\nOther than to say it confirmed other evidence about the contact between ... and the FBI the sources also said bakers interview broke new ground\nBoth about the FBI's use of the news media in twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen to further the Trump case and about deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein conversation in spring of twenty Seventeen regarding possible use of a body wired to record from\nThe interviewer was one of the most productive we had and it opened up many\nNew investigative leads one source said\nSo Baker cannot answer some questions about the FBI media contacts citing an on going investigation by the department of justice inspector general into alleged illegal leaks during and after the election\nAbout the Trump collusion probe and other matters these revelations illustrate a new how much the FBI and Justice Department of withheld from the public about their collaboration in collusion with clearly partisan elements of the Clinton campaign and the DNC\nFusion and steel that they were trying to defeat Trump\nThe growing body of evidence that the FBI used mostly politically motivated on verified intelligence from an opponent to justify spine\nOn the geo piece nominate campaign just weeks before an election has prompted a growing number of Republicans as President Trump to declassify the rest of the FBI's main documents and the Russian collusion case\nUh and uh as we know now that they were declassified but the president's sent those to the inspector General Michael Horowitz which one we saw that we went\nAll the ... we know that they said that there were foreign allies and we heard that the sources that that the mother news publications we have seen I've said that it was Great Britain that uh they didn't want the the thing that the\nInformation to be released the redacted information I don't know why how they would know what was it it to begin with that'd be a ... why would they object what how would they know what was that it right to begin with I don't\nMean adbusters action if if you know something damaging ism in it\nAnd and so a Trump said he was going to send it to the inspector general which made us question wait a minute inspector general's office doesn't look to see but there's something should be released or on redacted or whether it has too high of a security clearance they only look for corruption in the department of justice right\nSo the only reason that we could think that the that Trump the administration said okay we're not going to release this yet we're going to give it to the inspector general is because whatever unprotected information is in there\nThey must believe that the inspector general confined corruption in the department of justice concerning the procedure over the Pfizer orange\nYeah\nYeah that's if you're listening for the first time I know that this is all calculus I think most people that have listening for a while to the show understand where we are going\nWell it it it ultimately when you when you look at that especially with the I.

I. M. W. B. R. O. [noise]\n\nVery rarely get reminded him\nOn the radio\nAnd he's currently I'm Gary maximum are eight six six Ninety red eyes so the process is now a by the way he's our computer so now the process or is that to all the senators will get to look\nAt the actual background check report from the FBI\nOr there is only a single copy that will be provided that they must look at in their room they can look at it over the next uh a couple of days before the cloture vote or if they take notes in the room they cannot remove their notes\nUh with them none of their age are able to look at the actual a document and will sue the where that goes from there whether they'll actually uh be called to ah you know make public\nOr the report as you add talked about earlier Arab from doing research or this was passed by this rule that it's supposed to be kept\nA private um was a rule that the Democrat majority Senate put into effect in two thousand nine this actually as a Democrat majority rule right\nWell and by the way the nature of that rule and the process by which that\nCame about\nLikely had something to do with exactly this type of scenario so imagine that it got out that you know I mean it could have been any of them that someone claimed a soda my or did this while in college but it was just somebody claiming that\nKnowing the potential of a story like that going wide without being backed up\nCould do damage that's the whole idea you look at that and say okay but is there anything to it you mean like as has happened exactly that's my whole point is that\nIt likely has to do with this very kind of scenario where well the police went to his house after they were called by a neighbor\nOr the or someone claimed that the she did something depending on who the nominee is but there's nothing else to substantiate that which is exactly what we have here because you get that out into the media and it's a story really that doesn't\n... it should not be binding as everyone on on the right right now is is saying about Kavanaugh this shouldn't be binding if you can't back it up\nOr because remember background checks simply simply talks to people right somebody could say well ah yeah I heard he had\nFriend of mine told me that another friend told me that he hit a guy back or when he was in college right well that's double here say yep and so I think that it\nWould be in the report right because it won't read said during the process\nBut for a story to go on like that it could have the media can take that and they can they can run with it or any any other politician on Capitol Hill could take that and try and use that to their advantage in order to undermine the the integrity of the process which is exactly where we are today ...\nOr so we'll see what happens today the cloture vote has been set for friday and a general vote could happen as early as a as Saturday as I said I Wish you and I could go home right now just repeat the rest of the show so we could be up all day\nBecause it will be interesting to see it's not over now procedurally it's it it's not going to it's not going to be over what the Democrats attempt to do to solve this\nAh procedurally basically the petition or to invoke a for cloture or that has happened that happened when stay late Wednesday by Senate majority leader ah they basically Thursday is a\nJust a kind of a blank day although it will be about reviewing the documents and friday they will move forward or to move with a cloture vote ... been closure for those that may not know\nIs basically just ending the debate and discussion on it and and saying okay now it's\nReady for a vote so that vote would happen I'm assuming if\nAnd don't know the headcount there on the cloture vote will tell them you know ...
