where I'm pleased to be on site with the entire cast his own houses erupt production on this their fortieth season and all this talk of home remodeling has you thinking about your next project you can call in your home improvement question now to eat and eat money the present by home advisor dot com well the heart of every home\nIs the kitchen and that's where meals get prepared and homework is done and guess always loved to hang out and the Canada tree in this kitchen was made by the craftsman plane and fancy custom camera tree\nAnd Brian you're on I was looking at your website and I sounded pretty interesting that you guys make every single cabinet by hand is that true that is absolutely true just in the heart of Pennsylvania yeah it's a it's the work you're just spectacular so what's the last us like I mean\nObviously cat that's coming standard sizes but you guys basically cut the parts and put them all together by hand in the lunar kind of supervise no possible way ...\nUh we make cabinets that plane and fancy to the sixteenth of a niche there is no real standard so for us uh we make our own doors in drawers we make all of our cabinet tree whether it be European ... governments or\nTraditional framed in ...\nI think a lot of folks don't realize how mass produce most kitchen cabinets and ... and there's a lot of trade offs in that process that\nThat is true or we are what I like to call a local customs cabinet shop on steroids and we do some production minded work but we're also very cost them a lot of hands on work we do a lot of custom cat in the tree for any room of the house that a lot of other companies really don't want to touch\nAll right so let's say you're hearing this program you're thinking about redoing your kitchen you blank slate um how do you tell folks get started with that process\nOr basically we have a network of professional kitchen about designers across the United states of America or they can go to our designers and they will talk to them about colors woods style maritime prairie traditional whatever it is and try to narrow down what their goal is for their project\nSo that's really the place to start once that's done we're the manufacturer we take those plans and create an order and bills that exactly to their specifications what's unique about the kitchen that you know here in the gyms on how well it's quite unique were using the transitional door style is actually the name of it\nAnd it's done in very precise equal sized panels\nThat would be the maple white painted part of the kitchen a lot of the rest of the temperature in the house is a rift ... which is one of the hottest what's going right now right in in the custom market we have done some blue legroom kept in the tree and we also did the all the vanities in the house\nSo it was very good design very easy for us to make it to fit right on and make it look like the customer wanted\nSo we're we're very proud of it looks interesting\nYeah it looks it looks it looks really great so what are some of the mistakes that folks make you think when they start to plan a kitchen where people go wrong and then moved to her credit for many years well I guess\nYeah I think a lot of times um people tend to get caught up in trends are so they will pick something trendy and then they'll find themselves five ten years down the road still living in the same house with no plans to move or thinking about doing it again yeah I think a lot of times people tend to uh get wrapped up in counter tops\nAnd appliances takes a lot of their budget and they end up spending money they should for the quality of Kevin the need to less than a lifetime and a lot of times they do have buyer's regret\nNot case so careful planning working with designers you're going to be the kitchen for many many years I'm Sorry you're on from playing advance a cat is thank you so much for stopping by the money they've created vice thank you for having me you've been listening

Pittsburgh synagogue shootings that left eleven people dead faith is twenty nine counts including hate crime charges the community came together Saturday evening to remember the victims\nMore than a thousand people held candles and sang at a vigil\nHonoring those who were killed that of Pittsburgh synagogue after a gunman barged in an open fire the city's public safety director called it a horrific crime scene federal authorities planned to file hate crime and other charges against the gunmen who had expressed anti Semitic views on social media\nAnd who was wounded in a shootout with police President Trump called the shooting a wicked active mass murder they just pure evil adding anti Semitism must be confronted anywhere and everywhere it appears ... Pittsburgh\nLaw enforcement agencies around the U.S deployed extra officers had sent a God and Jewish centers in response to the shooting massacre they claimed eleven lives improper coup sack\nUh the powder was harmless and but when you read the actual Associated Press story and you and I are looking at each other's said man you've got a parks everything these days yeah you've got to be very careful could be it says the powder the outer right will Souder along with the bomb right\nThat was in it it was a ... there's ... there's nowhere in the ... story or any other source that we've seen that says that authorities say that the or any stores says that the a suspicious package that was sent there the explosive device potentially explosive device\nWas was harmless ... it's just the powder the powder according to a source\n... right in and early in the day the NYPD had bad that the um\nUh that the uh the ... there was the the the suspected pipe bomb and another powder right mhm which was you know whether whether it would be you know I I don't know rice would they suspected it might be right center you know who knows ...\nUm but it that that turned out to be harmless National Review has the story that both the bomb and the powder are harmless were harmless and we looked at\nYou know who they source for that which was Associated Press and Associated Press nowhere in their says yeah that the that their sources that the bomb was was harmless but we don't know whether the bottom was harmless or not because\nFrom what I've seen and what I have read the FBI has not come out and said these were bomb no no these were lied bombs ready to go ...\nIn nature um and and so you know potentially harmful devices these are the phrase is they've been\nIt's been using because the ... what does the media do inevitably they bring on as they're covering this live they bring on you know somebody who was an explosives expert and then they look at it except they're not on site looking at it they have no idea what they're looking at really except for what it appears to be\nAnd and so the the the point being is that we have no idea what's going on here so I suppose it is somebody that supports the president and the Republicans well\nDo you just heard the side that you support if that's if that's found out we have no idea what it is but if that's the case in that somebody who just write ... less than two weeks before a major election you just hurt their chances\nAnd and by the end and so when you you look at it as we said I mean this is a ... and we've said this all along but there was a rush rushing collusion or a case like this we look at it from the investigator's point of view and if you're an investigator and you're looking at something like this ah and you know some of the questions that you're thinking of\nA based on the fact that you have a lack of information and nobody has said that these were actually live bombs where you say okay\nUh when we find out if they were you know live bombs ... well then you know that without question was an attempt to kill these people that would end so right you go from you go from it from that point of view trying to figure that out if it was\nThey find out that none of the bombs were active that none of the bombs had any potential of going off\nThen you look you would be looking I Believe that two different things or if you're looking at it from an investigator's point of view which would be All right this was a scare tactic to either scare these people\nOr it was political in nature ... it was meant just a couple of weeks before an election to help drive which is again something that you would have to look at it was to help drive the the motivation here was to help\nDrive an election to a a certain side mhm and at that point you would look at it and say well it's if they did this to help Trump did to help Trump and then you would look at it from the other side which was okay\nAh this was to set up Trump and make it look suspicious because of the things that Trump has said the provocative things he has said and help change the the uh public discourse to blaming Trump as that's at like I said it has that started already without any\nEvidence whatsoever but that's the most incredible thing with the media starts talking about whether it's you know soccer whatever yesterday from CNN it going after the you know going after the president going after the right talking about the divisive\nComments out there will nothing could ... be more divisive than accusing another side or a person blaming them for something\nWhere there is a complete lack of evidence as to the motivation of the person or persons who did\nA particular deed mhm now see I'm not jumping in China and assigning to something nothing could be nothing could be more divisive so as they sit there on their high horse screaming that your devices they had committed the ultimate sins and divisiveness anyway not\nWell Hillary comes out and says we must be more civil just days after saying there's no way to be civil with the other side that it's not possible she shut the door on that just days ago\nWell look this this is we're we we have the conversation but it's ridiculous and I say it's ridiculous for for this reason uh after Steve Sebelius was shot and you had a man who was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nWho's goal was to assassinate and kill and he uh he did not succeed in doing it thank thank goodness to the Capitol police but his goal was to kill as many Republican members of Congress as possible\nWould you say that that has brought down the divisive rhetoric on the left over the last year and\nNo no no and\nNone of it's going to all of this has to get a political advantage one way or another what you're hearing yesterday is about getting a political advantage because you cannot debate the point that we just made\nThat the most divisive you have these people sitting in their ivory towers the media elite ivory towers claiming that they care about civility and they are anti divisive\nThat's what they're about and they have the divisiveness that exist today and then they commit the ultimate sin of divisiveness and that is to blame somebody\nFor potentially you know a a terrorist attack would they complete lack of evidence to back up their claim there was no evidence of either way there's no evidence\nAnd we may not have it for a long time\nAnd the fact is they don't see that no they don't they don't see that they don't and it's obvious anybody who is a political hack\nUnderstands how obvious it is\nSo not really much more to talk about I mean it it's we either there's a will there's a again\nA we've said this many times on topics that we are ignorant about which means topics that we don't have the facts on mhm not much you can say the only\nThing we can report or the few facts that we do have a total rewrite seven yeah now suspicious packages according to the FBI or they were sent to you know prominent members or or or or or backers of the Democrats and so\nThat's all we can say that's it that's all we know about it\nAnd as soon as they release it more information will you know will pass that along when we know the whole story if we ever know the whole story that we can talk about it\nBut right now that without knowing the motivation unless that person comes forward and tells us what the motivation was\nWe can't assign it to anything we have no idea absolutely no idea\nNo idea and\nSo that that's where we stand right when we find out more information we'll give you more information\nBut speculation on these things is useless but the thing is that's the kind of nation that we live in ... we're short started right away you know and I was thinking too that you know the media getting on their high horse you know that ... that you know hey we don't ever cause any type of device of rise right in and all I have to say is Ferguson\nMhm built on a lie mhm\nCompletely built an ally CNN and MSNBC all over that mhm enabling\nThe the uh\nUh as in in my opinion enabling the range that existed uh attacking law enforcement you and I remember\nWhich Jake Tapper writing and writing temper can you believe this police are there in ... has been riots for the last few days of course they're going to stage police in riot gear ... they were they kept pushing the narrative\nThat the you know that the police rotted control hands up don't shoot you remember it right\nThey they they were part of of pushing and amplifying the divisiveness that was based on a lie mhm so CNN don't sit up there on your high horse as it were just the end is worthy innocent arbiters of the news\nWell there was a ... is soccer calling out his own Don Lemon\nFor the other night

her voice yet saying I approve this message right so I'm not one of those crazed Democrat one of those dating right I'm not one of those crazy Democrats\n... now I ... it's it's I think it's horrible in what it is trying to do you know what I'm saying I it's not effective in what they're trying to get done from the ad because it's well it's it's just bizarre it's contrived\nThe only thing that that I can think of is that there are internal polling is showing that independence or leaning hall he's way and one of the reasons is because remember she uses these specific word crazy Democrats will they didn't write or some kind of ... and there's a reason that you there's a reason that you do that\nThere's ... and and the reason that you do that is because there is a segment of those undecided voters that you're going after\nThat in your internal polling you have found out they\nSteve and and I don't know why because I didn't do I I was in pretty to the polling could be Kavanaugh could be\nA you know everything that has gone on it it'd be you know the the going into restaurants disturbing yeah Republicans whatever\nBut in order to use that term and words are very important especially words that will alienate your own party in a political ad means OK I'm Still safe from the base\nThe base Democrats or I don't have to worry about them I Need to get those independents and they're leaning Holly's way we believe and one of the reasons is they believe that the Democrat Party and a significant portion of those that represent the Democratic party in Congress\nAre crazy that can be the only reason you don't do that in an ad I mean could you imagine remember\nThis isn't even a you can't even say well this is just a house race in a particular area there's just a state of Missouri and this is a Senate\nRace mhm\nSo inside her campaign which means not just in her campaign but other campaigns across the country this is something that\nDemocrats which ... who wish to promote themselves and pretend to be moderate what they're facing is a significant portion of independence who believe that the Democratic party and members of the Democratic party are crazy\n\nWhen I went in which shows that everything that has happened in the cabinet thing in going into restaurants and is having an effect on independence otherwise they wouldn't run the ad\nI think there's I I still think there's an end someone must have and and the research the the voters or whoever was you know being a part of the I I guess group that was being polled must have use those words specifically otherwise it's horrible writing because I think a an\nAd by a Claire McCaskill or could could or for Claire McCaskill could do the same again we're just talking the politics of it\nBy saying you know look we know that there are there are extremes on both sides and right now that I I'm not proud of some of the things that are going on in my ... with within my own party and people that are clearly supporting my own party\n... I Want you to know that I Am not that person am I right\nDoes it but that that's the point and that's the great point right there yeah it was specifically using the term crazy Democrats on one hand it will have used that in a Democrat [laughter] some someone\nHad to have used that in some kind of feedback\nThat they were getting that feedback that it was crazy Democrats not extreme right I'm not part of the extreme of my partying because he used that\nDid why the term crazy Democrats because that's the feedback you been getting back right in your own internal polling\nBecause extreme means that you've gone full on one side in in one direction and and to a a further extent well no that's not what's going on\nIt it is crazy and and that's the perception what you're trying to you're trying to target with those words the very perception as someone who has given that feedback to you with those words\nThat's the only way that happens that's the only way those words end up in an ad like that\n\nThey because someone must have made that that's that's where the the word crazy must've appeared in feedback and unlikely multiple times\nAnd they're in their internal\nWrong and you know you're talking about tens of millions of dollars to run a Senate race yeah which means they are doing every type of of polling an analytical research you can get in front of you get down to this point here and you see the desperation of using that in an ad that means you are trying to fight the perception\nOf crazy Democrats in your election in Missouri\nAnd it is the one thing\nThat is killing your chances of winning yeah it is the one thing because it is if you think about the build up to you know if you listen to that there is a buildup\nThat word is is is one of those hot button words that you don't expect to hear but it was placed in the ads strategically at a certain place right as you are listening to something and all of a sudden boom she's not one of those crazy Democrats because and there's another thing too\nIt's a poor attempt I think at recreating a conversation that\nPeople were you know having out there but it's not that's not the conversation they're actually having the conversation they're having is if it were really I think accurate and and and portraying what's going on with some of the Democrats or independents interstate it would be two guys going man\nThose Democrats are crazy I don't know that I can vote for Democrats anymore including McCaskill\nThat's the actual conversation so you have to have you ever countered with this contrived and and again I think it's a it's a it's a poor attempt but that's the only thing you can do you're not going to get Claire McCaskill coming out going hey I'm not one of those crazy Democrats\nOr the other thing I thought was interesting you know and and I'm not you know very familiar with Josh Hawley who's running against an attorney general against\nClaire McCaskill I'm I'm a I'm not you know we live in we live in Texas and that's one of the tough things is\nIt's it's tough for anybody ... ... and I mean it's tough for anybody on the national stage to really have a key understanding of what's going on for example in in Missouri raised in many congressional races it's it's really tough because\nA lot of times it can be local and if you're not living there you don't see the stories that are pounded at you\nOr the ... each and every day but you and I both looked at each other we haven't discussed as but we looked at each other the part where well and it's claimed that\nThat Holly as attorney general made wine runs and went to the gym ... during work hours ... with\nAll the heated rhetoric yeah an ad use that show you only thing they can make right up your own and that was that's what you use and put an ad of desperation well here's the thing\nIt's the same thing oh wait a minute I Wonder if you could pick me up some wine next time he goes because\nPeople go to the gym during the day all the time well what's what's the people people run errands all the time just assume okay just assume right that it's it's it's on company time and it's it's well the the the state time in this case\nAnd it's um it's being done outside of his lunch hour it's not on his time\nThat's the worst she got well I'm assuming most attorney general's don't work eight to five I'm guessing\nThere's fewer hours ... I'm assuming there's meetings there's speeches there's everything else that goes wind meetings as to why aren't they going to be a part part of a job but it but I I again I don't know the specifics\nBehind it but I just went ... and ... and that but from an outsider you've heard that you went that's a pretty weak well for an ad of desperation that's pretty weak ... ... ... I Would have I Would\nI Would have stayed against ... strategically this is the only thing we're talking about here strategy I Would have stayed on wait a minute he hasn't tried one case\nYeah the guy just doesn't have the experience he doesn't have the experience of attorney general for our state he certainly doesn't have experience to serve in the Senate the war he went and bought some wine and went to the gym on on a while on the clock that's that's what you got by the way one is an attorney general not on the clock that\nExactly eight six six Ninety red eye\nFrom Jay Jay Keller and associates incorporated on customer service getting pulled over for inspection by law enforcement personnel is not a moment that drivers look forward to not only Kennan inspections set a driver back in their schedule the results of the ...\nAction could mean serious issues for both the driver and the company the potential for a truck being stopped to undergo an inspection always exists here are some tips to help ensure the process goes more smoothly\nThis station suggests I was pregnant and you're going to\nCool to frankly general ... like ... and lead plaintiff virtuous train right have a quarter\nOf ... you are not trying to orange world so what did you do well my parents sent me to the forest the real for a while I was running down this was an actual path\nThen I saw this real life right it was all like reading and I saw an hour or two then I played in it's amazing stream water around my [noise] like white water\nThan me and my sister and my parents sat around a campfire and ... all night long oh that's pretty cool here\nThis weekend on slug getting closer to nature that you closer to your family to find the forest near you you go to discover the forest [noise] dot org ... by the U.S Forest Service and the\nSoldiers returning the traumatic brain injuries or other serious battle news opposite in recent months at a VA hospital rather rehab facility DVD batches collecting DVDs and portable players were distribution in our community and\nNationwide many of us take for granted or access to everyday enjoyment and DVDs were vets need your help and giving the injured soldiers and diversion from the monotony of a hospital stay during Rick I'm ready to do and I knew or use DVDs or to learn more about this because leave go to W.

overnight and then I'm Amazed that we haven't gotten an email sounded may rise we addressed it to start the\nThe the the show a off with but the national review and it's being picked up by you know I'm a social media uh uh some uh different a conservative website said\nHave picked it up and this is where National Review a wrote the article that said the pipe bomb or and powder delivered to CNN were harmless this is an article that came out\nA at nine o nine PM from jak crow at National Review\nThe reference that he gives is the Associated Press story right is a link to that right they link is right so we linked to the story\nAnd said okay because we didn't see that anywhere else and we said what does the Associated Press story says you know what what does it say and it's funny because during our pre show meeting when I read it I said oh it's saying it then I read in the second time I said well no it's not seen it\nBecause what it says is a law enforcement officials such tests have determined that a holder found inside an envelope delivered to CNN along with a pipe bomb was harmless right\nRoute or you know your heart and was referring to the power that it that's the indication as the it refers to the powder not a pipe bomb now there is no indication as we've stated to start to show off\nThe FBI has not we have not seen the words these raw acted\nLied bombs that could have gone off we obscene what but uh\nQuote potentially destructive devices and we've asked the question what is potentially destructive devices mean\nWe've seen suspicious packages I'm looking at the last time I checked Fox News about twenty minutes ago they still have the headline suspicious packages\nUh we talked about the the Wall Street journal though\nActually are calling them mail bombs but not having a quote\nYou know from the FBI stating that they were mail bombs these little things and and again we're just two idiots overnight but these are the the little things that are picked up in different websites are not picking it up just quoting the national review story and not linking to the Associated Press story\nThat you know that the that you know that the a package\nSent a to CNN was harmless we don't know whether it was or not\nWe don't know if the the uh the the suspicious package separate from the powder in the envelope was harmless there's like there's nothing in the a P story according to their source that says that\nRight and that's what National Review has referenced right and they're headline pipe bomb and powder delivered to CNN were harmless and other websites for picking that up we don't know outside that Associated Press story that doesn't say that right if you read the sand yeah that's that's the point\nIs that right the the the story that their referencing doesn't actually say that they could turn out to be the case and maybe National Review has sources of their own but they're not sourcing they're not eating those ... from the a P right\nYou know so it's just because the problem is is with with if you're going to you know that if that are in the echo chamber of social media especially if that false information misleading information is going to be out there\nThan it is you know it it starts to become or build a narrative in the wrong direction if you start on the wrong premise everything that follows a may sound logical but it still is built on that false premise so\nYou know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review yeah they've been split it was an oversight fear in my opinion because that's not what the associated\nPress story all I can understand that because when I read it the first time mhm that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading here says the ... and then I read it again I went oh that's not what the scent\nWhat Washington Post on there headline had it right there headline habit that the powder that was sent along with the words harm you know a along with the suspicious package was harmless and and so the the point being is that\nThat the narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not past that\nAnd you don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now people are going by their trust of National Review you know based on the headline\nWhich which National Review to me is extremely credible look at the time I I don't know maybe it's too late night mistake whatever or like I said when I first

behind\nA\nStill a toss up but she's still behind that she needs to use the term crazy\nYeah I'm not like one of those crazy Democrats ... and it was ... and I just have to come upon this article here and I was doing some scanning here a few moments ago\nFrom A Douglas shown who was the ... the former Democratic pollster who's on Fox News all the time right and just you know and and uh again since he's been a democratic pollster and he's identified a throughout his life as a as as a Democrat he says the Democrats have a problem or a serious problem\nBut one that they have yet to acknowledge fully or frankly at all what's the problem here it is Democrats Abou ...\nThe Republicans have attacks on them for being an extremist and too far in the clutches of they're tired out of touch leadership have been working in\nThe Republican campaign is now simple just focus on how far left the Democrats are and how beholden its candidates particularly congressional candidates are to the unpopular democratic leadership in both the house and the Senate\nI've argued here and elsewhere the Democrats need new leadership I've also suggested that those candidates were rejected their leadership are likely to do better than those who remain quiet take the money and stuff with the political consequences\nBut right now as we head into the final two weeks of the election campaign it appears that both the Senate and potentially the house races are tightening and it appears that Donald Trump's attacks on the Democratic party for being out of touch with the electorate and too confrontational as well as led by two failed leaders of the past are working\nRest assured the Republicans have failed to take advantage of what has been their principal opportunity which is to run on the economy\nAnd get credit for something that voters themselves the is improving and beneficial you what I've said the exact same thing the Republicans still and even the administration focus on

in in that story but it's gone viral because the the National Review again unless National Review knows something that we don't but they don't state that understory they're sourcing\nStrictly here the a P story but the reason that it's important is because as you see something like this go viral\nInformation is is incorrect or any information is incorrect and the discussions are surrounding this event clearly look there's the political aspect of this can't be ignored but\nThe discussion is important because you can't discuss anything without knowing the complete facts you can't discuss much\nWithout knowing the complete facts we've discussed the reaction by the media by uh the the uh Democrats and and what that has been we know very little\nAbout this well on its way and and that's why we had a set to uh a mystery soccer over at the CNN or or whether it was close to your Schumer and their their comments\nOr you know going after and you know and in essence blaming the president's first provocative statements claiming that they're against divisiveness it's interesting that the people that claim that we need to stop device of this are the ones that have accused somebody of responsibility of an incident where nobody has any idea no one\nHas any idea who the person might be who would have done this we don't know whether the bombs were lied bombs and would have gone off or not there is so much we don't know yet they are assessing blame that the ones who claimed that they are against divisiveness are\nCommitting the the one of the biggest tens of divisive this and that is what blaming somebody when you don't have the facts behind you right\nRight and so as we've said we've discussed is a little bit and and gone through the different questions or as others have yesterday and and we we've asked the question that if it was it if they are life if they were alive bombs\nAnd and they would have gone off\nA then you have to look at that in a different way that if clearly none of them were alive bombs mhm that it would have either been an attempt to scare the war and attempt a possibility of an attempt to uh\nYou know look at major\nFigures in the Democratic party that are not like ... well by members of the right in this country\nAnd you know try to you know give the tried to send the message that they're out to get them\n... or that you know ... if if it was you know if it was it was a real bombing that's but if it was a big bomb it would be was it sent by somebody on the left to try to blame the right there's a whole bunch of different scenarios and questions you would ask is an investigator based on whether\nThe bombs were actually live or whether they were fake bombs right\n[noise] yeah and we can only ... will only know that if and when they find the person who or persons who are response\nRight and that could be never\nSo at the you can bet right now they have a number of great leads especially with the fact the nature of of how males sorted or by the secret service uh in in terms of the the Clintons when you look at and and the Obamas when you look at that situation\nUm that I think you have to\nTake into consideration what they already know about that you know patterns of behavior by people who do such a thing\nAnd and the resources are there are probably on to some pretty solid leads right now then add to that of course cameras being everywhere\n\nSo you will you know as soon as we get information we can start having that discussion but we want to point that out that you're seeing that story from National Review go viral it's important to have the discussion based on facts based on what we know right and there is a difference and we may learn\nThat uh the authorities and and authorities will tell us or might tell us at some point that those devices were effectively harmless because they weren't set to go off but that is not what you're seeing here and the a P report that was the source of the national review article\nWhich again just looking at social media overnight is gone it has gone viral that see there was if we don't know that yet and rice Associated Press story does not state that\nAnd it's important that you know facts were brought up I was reading the daily wire story where they they talked about the\nA reporter for CNN and the ... Martha ... who was interviewing one of a one of the bomb experts right and this bomb expert gave out all the possibilities who said look could be somebody from the right ... you said it could be a you know it could be but you know a foreign state\nThat is trying to destroy don't leave you know this trying to disrupt the election or as you said it could be a false flag from somebody on the left mhm so what the CNN reporter pulled out was only the response from this expert of\nThat it was somebody on the left and left out when this expert said it can be somebody from the right ... it can be a foreign actor or it could be a false flag from somebody on the left because the election is just two weeks away where I brought up all the possibilities and investigator would bring out\nAnd what did the CNN reporter to weed out just deport their report that apparently media matters poured out which is a leftist leaning or or you know media organization media\nA truth organization where they only put out just his opinion\nYou know on the left as if that's who he blamed\nAnd Martha McCalla might oh yeah Oh absolutely yeah are fascinating in something like that she should have responded they all believe it's somebody for fake news will know the fake news is the actual fact checking of the news you didn't include the entire statement right\n\nAnd which is our point on this entire thing with the national review and the difference between the story that they used as their stores it's important we give a lot of credibility to the national review and have for a long long time but\nIt's important that as you as you you've got twelve days here before the election this is all going to be in terms of the discussion not the investigation but the discussion about it in social media is all politically driven and has been from the start\n\nYou don't win anything by repeating false information\n\nNow you don't win anything by now you know media matters [laughter] by putting out incomplete information which indeed is false if you don't include the entire statement\n\nThat's what we deal I mean that's the world to really deal with you and I taught I have talked about this many times that ... we spend much more of our time just trying to disseminate what the truth is out there right and arguing the truth versus the\nConspiracy theories that have troops that are out there and and it does become frustrating at times now I Will admit that the story that you know the national review story that when we read the Associated Press ... when I read it off and say you when I read it the first I said while Eric look they're saying that the bomb and I read the first sentence\nAnd then I re read it again and went on it's not what they're saying right now that wasn't on the air to see a\nRight and it was like no they're not saying that what they're saying is it's the powder that came with the the the bomb they're not saying that both were harmless right they're saying the powder was harmless you know that that's what the source said the powder was harmless they didn't even mention about\nThe suspected potentially explosive package they didn't say that either way\nRight on that one so uh again that's you know that's what we deal with and\nYou know we saw yesterday but you saw it again you saw from CNN you saw it from the the the Democrats are you know we're picking were well you really couldn't pick and choose the facts but she didn't have any\nVery few very few when do we know these devices were sent we know who they were sent to we know what the authorities have
