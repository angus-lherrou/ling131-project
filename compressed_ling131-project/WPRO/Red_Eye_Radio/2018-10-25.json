ten\nTo seven or visit that advice dot org this is a public service campaigns for the NFL\n\n\nIs the voice of some of the New England talk fast talking force it's\nTime for the latest news trying to think and weather from the revolution soft Washington center on\nCumulus has\nMy friends are one of the ride to the mail room limited Time Warner center building which how the CNN's New York bureau clearly\nIs an error not package was addressed to former CIA director John Brennan he blamed the recent political rhetoric [noise]\nI and others are being targeted because we're speaking out and we're living up to a a responsibilities as citizens I think that's again as a very unfortunate turn of events\nAuthorities are asking the public to stay alert because there could be more divided in New York on ...\nNo wonder for the big Powerball prize ones that I saw the estimated jak part now grows to seven hundred fifty million dollars that the fourth largest lottery jackpot in us history so I think that's kind of small given all the attention when I was on the one point five billion dollar mega millions jak pot of water still hasn't come forward\n[noise] uh the powder was harmless and but\nWhen you read the actual Associated Press story and you and I are looking each other's said man you've got a parks everything these days yeah you got to be very careful to be it says the powder the outer right will Souter\nAlong with the bomb right that was and it it was a ... there's ... there's nowhere in the story or any other source that we've seen that says that authorities say that the or any stores says that the a suspicious package that was sent there the explosive device potentially explosive device\nWas was harmless ... it's just the powder the powder according to a source\nRight at an early in the day the NYPD had bad\nThat the um ah that the uh the ... there was the the the suspected\nPipe bomb and another powder right mhm which was you know whether whether it would be you know I I don't know rice would they suspected it might be right center you know who knows ... um\nBut it that that turned out to be harmless National Review has the story that both the bomb and the powder are harmless were harmless and we looked at you know who they source for that which was Associated Press and Associated Press nowhere in their says yeah that the that their source says that the bomb was was harmless but we don't know whether the bottom was harmless or not because\nFrom what I've seen and what I read the FBI has not come out and said these were bombed no no these were lied bombs ready to go ...\nIn nature um and and so you know potentially harmful devices these are the phrase is they've been using\nThe authorities have been using but the media's been using because the ... what does the media do inevitably they bring on as they're covering this live they bring on you know somebody who was an explosives expert and then they look at it except they're not on site looking at it they have no idea what they're looking at really except for what it appears to be\nAnd and so the the the point being is that we have no idea what's going on here ... suppose it is somebody that supports the president and the Republicans while you just heard the side that you support\nIf ... if that found out we have no idea what it is but if that's the case and that somebody who just write a less than two weeks before a major election\nYou just hurt their chances and and by the end and so when you you look at it as we said I mean this is a ... and we've said this all along but there was a rush rush in collusion or a case like this we look at it from the investigator's point of view and if you're an investigator and you're looking at something\nLike this ah and you know some of the questions that you're thinking of\nA based on the fact that you have a lack of information and nobody has said that these were actually live bombs where you say okay\nUh when we find out if they were\nYou know lie bombs ... well then you know that without question was an attempt to kill these people that would end so right you go from it from you go from it from that point of view trying to figure that out if it was\nThey find out that none of the bombs were active\nThat none of the bombs had any potential of going off\nThen you look you would be looking I Believe that two different things you if you're looking at it from an investigator's point of view which would be All right this was a scare tactic to either scare these people or it was political in nature mhm it was meant just a couple of weeks before an election\nTo help drive which is again something that you would have to look at it was to help drive the\nThe motivation here was to help drive an election to a a certain side mhm and at that point you would look at it and say well it says if they did this to help Trump did to help Trump\nAnd then you would look at it from the other side which was okay\nAh this was to set up Trump and make it look suspicious because of the things that Trump has said the provocative things he has said and help change the the uh public discourse to blaming Trump as that's at like I said it has that started already without any\nEvidence whatsoever but that's the most incredible thing with the media starts talking about whether it's you know soccer whatever yesterday from CNN it going after the you know going after the president going after the right talking about the divisive comments out there will nothing could ... be more divisive\nThan accusing another side or a person blaming them for something\nWhere there is a complete lack of evidence says to the motivation of the person or persons who did a particular deed mhm\nNow see I'm not jumping out of China and the signing on to something nothing could be nothing could be more device them so as they sit there on their high horse screaming that your devices they had committed the ultimate sins and divisiveness anyway not\nWell Hillary comes out and says we must be more civil just days after saying there's no way to be civil what's the other side that it's not possible she shut the door on that just days ago well look this this is\nWhere we we have the conversation but it's ridiculous and I say it's ridiculous for for this reason uh after steep skull east was shot and you had a man who was a Bernie Sanders supporter who's\nGoal was to assassinate and kill and he uh he did not succeed in doing it thank thank goodness to the Capitol police but his goal was to kill as many Republican members of Congress as possible\nWould you say that that has brought down the divisive rhetoric on the left over the last year and\nNo no no and\nNone of it's going to all of this has to get a political advantage one way or another what you're hearing yesterday is about getting a political advantage because you cannot debate the point that we've just made\nThat the most divisive you have these people sitting in their ivory towers the media elite ivory towers claiming that they care about\nCivility and they are anti divisive that's what they're about and they hate the divisiveness that exist today and then they commit the ultimate sin of divisiveness and that is to blame somebody for potentially you know a a terrorist attack\nWould they complete lack of evidence to back up their claim there is no evidence of either way there's no evidence\nAnd we may not have it for a long time\nAnd the fact is they don't see that no they don't they don't see that they don't and it's obvious anybody who is a political hack\nUnderstands how obvious it is so not really much more to talk about I mean it it's we either there's a will there's a again\nA we've said this many times on topics that we are ignorant about which means topics that we don't have the facts on mhm not much you\nCan say the only thing we can report or the the few facts that we do have a total rewrite seven yeah now suspicious packages according to the FBI or they were sent to you know prominent members ah or or uh or backers of the Democrats and so that's all we can\nSay that's it that's all we know about it\nAnd as soon as they release it more information will you know will pass that along when we know the whole story if we ever know the whole story that we can talk about it\nBut right now about without knowing the motivation unless that person comes forward and tells us what the motivation was\nWe can't assign it to anything we have no idea absolutely no idea no idea\nAnd\nSo that that's where we stand right when we find out more information we'll give you more information\nBut speculation on these things is useless but the thing is that's the kind of nation that we live in ... well sure it started right away and I was thinking too that you know the media getting on their high horse you know that ... that you know hey we don't ever cause any type of device rise right in and all I have to say is ...\n... built on a lot mhm\nCompletely built an ally CNN and MSNBC all over that mhm enabling\nThe the uh\nUh as in in my opinion enabling the range that existed uh attacking\nLaw enforcement you and I remember\n\nJake Tapper writing and writing tapper can you believe this police are there in ... has been riots for the last few days of course they're going to stage police in riot gear ... they were they kept pushing the narrative that the you know that the police rotted control hands up don't shoot you remember it\nRight they they they were part of of pushing and amplifying the divisiveness that was based on a lie mhm\nSo CNN don't set up there on your high horse as if we're just the Ines worthy innocent Arbor tours of the news well\nThere was a ... is soccer calling out his own Don

B. R. O.\nThey never followed jumbled ... early and get back tomorrow on TALK Radio's\nAndy he's earned hunting I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety of road I\nAh you know one of the reasons that you know you and I do the kind of show that we've always done is and and and talk about the issues of whether we talk about the issues and talked about the substance of the ideas is because we believe that we couldn't explain them easy and the majority of Americans will agree with us\nWe have fun at times we sort of fake name call a tough times you know and and the worst we ever call anybody who's an idiot because we call ourselves idiots\n[laughter] and and that's really about the the ... the worst that we um we do we get passionate at at times\nBut that's one of the reasons we've always set for any Republican out there you don't need to use any type of of rhetoric\nThat the opposition can ever used against you in any way it's part of the discussion that we've had over the last couple of days for Republicans and and the president and general take the wind and move on\nTake ... take the ... that's the goal the goal is to win the goal is not to get in a better rhetorical mean shot across the ... that gives you a temporary satisfaction\nThe satisfaction for me is getting the political when moving the country in the direction that I Wish to move it getting temporary satisfaction out of calling Eric\nOr a ... job it ridiculous study it\nMay be true in satisfy ... may be true in satisfy me for a moment but it doesn't it doesn't really work I haven't convinced anybody have by that my opinion is right over Arabs because I did that did I\nKnow everybody in the control room raised their hand [laughter] that's not funny guy\nAnd and so that's you know that's why we have to you you take\nThe whole goal\nTo is to make it that that you you when ... ... ... it's part of an and I I Will tell you this came from my dad\nAnd and you and I talked about this a book before just didn't you know different negotiations we've had in in the business together and that my dad always had a sane\nAnd it's in business be one hundred percent right one hundred percent of the time and the first time my

single debate at times that might mean you have to say look I'm not sure I'll get back to you on that one it's one of the reasons why we really we ask questions on many issues but we don't speculate is fact\nNow we don't speculate to the point of conclusion right I'm On things that we don't have all the facts on 'em and and that's what it comes down to for me is that uh you the\nFrustration I think right now is that with me at least is the fact that for the first time in a long time\nThe Republican Party is motivated by a president\nWho on many economic things and national things can get things done mhm focus on those but beyond that build the momentum forward and you know I've got a couple of emails from yesterday's show you know in talking about well you think the people who are really going to be turned off by the horse race thing and\nBlah blah blah blah blah blah you know these people are with them they\nHold on a second you missed part of the conversation\nWe're not talking about the people that are already on board we're talking about the people in the middle\nThat win elections for you right that's true you need to convince you've got to go sell the brand essentially\nTo put it in the president's ah you know we'll house to to new customers\nBy the by the way I don't know I I I answered the the one email from the one woman who wrote that\nThe the the one that because it sounds like that's when you're relating yeah mine was from a guy but but I'll go to my mind and in the end and it was the same thing and and I answered you know and I answer back I said look I'm Talking about you arrive yeah this is going to change it I'm not talking about my I wasn't talking about my opinion I was talking about right somebody else who told me\nWho is a supporter and we were talking about the possibilities of what could harm and move independence one way or another and the argument was it's not going to change me or anybody that I Know well I Know that's not the point that it's not you're not you're\nNot part of that you're you're already in the restaurant eating you need you need to build a business out this is this is exactly what the president can do\nAnd this is unique to this president by the way because the Republicans we'd been screaming for years can't get their message across and if they could get it across if they could go out there and promote that message a very simple message then they could get that out and they could they could gain more seats\nInstead of losing seats and this was back then not thoroughly now we're talking about getting a message across to people who have not been fully convinced yet if you've been fully convinced\nFor instance what they're going to stick to its fullest chickens to blow the

said by somebody else why well couldn't say that her\nThing is that this isn't pac money this isn't something this this here is\nThe campaign this was her ad yes as her she you do hear her voice saying I approve this message right so I'm not one of those crazy Democrat one of those dating right I'm not one of those\nCrazy Democrats ... now I ... it's it's I think it's horrible in what it is trying to do you know what I'm saying I it's not effective in what they're trying to get done from the ad because it's well it's it's just bizarre it's contrived\nThe only thing that that I can think of is that their internal polling is showing that independence or leaning Holly's way and one of the reasons is because remember she uses these specific word crazy Democrats will they did it right or some kind of there's there's a reason that you there's a reason that you do that\nThere's ... and and the reason that you do that is because there is a segment of those undecided voters that you're going after that in your internal polling you have found out they\nEve and and I don't know why because I didn't do I I was in ... to the polling could be Kavanaugh could be a you know everything that has gone on it it'd be you know the the going into restaurants disturbing yeah Republicans whatever but in order to use\nThat term and words are very important especially words that will alienate your own party in a political ad\nMeans OK I'm Still safe from the base the the base Democrats or I don't have to worry about them I Need to get those independence and they're leaning Holly's way we believe\nAnd one of the reasons is they believe that the Democrat Party and a significant portion of those that represent the Democratic party in Congress\nAre crazy that can be the only reason you don't do that in an ad I mean could you imagine remember this isn't even a\nYou can't even say well this is just a house race in a particular area this is the state of Missouri and this is a Senate race mhm\nAnd so inside her campaign which means not just in her campaign but other campaigns across the country this is something that\nDemocrats which ... who wish to promote themselves and pretend to be moderate what they're facing is a significant portion of independence who believe that the Democratic party and members of the Democratic party are crazy\nBut I mean which shows that everything that has happened in the cabinet thing in going into restaurants and is having an effect on independence otherwise they would run the ad\nI think there's I I still think there's an end someone must have and and the research the the voters or whoever was you know being a the part of the I I guess group that was being polled\nMust have used those words specifically otherwise it's horrible writing because I think a an ad by a Claire McCaskill a could could or for Claire McCaskill could do the same again we're just talking the politics of it\nBy saying you know look we know that there are there are extremes on both sides and right now that I'm not proud of some of the things that are going on in my ... with with within my own party and people that are clearly supporting my own party\n... I Want you to know that I Am not that person ...\nDoes it but that that's the point and that's the great point right there yeah it was specifically using the term\nCrazy Democrats on one hand he reviews that any Democrat some someone had to have used that in some kind of feedback\nThat they were getting that\nFeedback that it was crazy Democrats not extreme right I'm not part of the extreme of my party because he used that why did why the term crazy Democrats because that's the feedback you been getting back right in your own internal polling\nBecause extreme means that you've gone full on one side and in one direction and and to a a further extent\nWell no that's not what's going on it it is crazy and and that's the perception what you're trying to you're trying to target with those words the very perception as someone who has given that feedback to you with those words\nThat's the only way that happens that's the only way those words end up in an ad like that\n\nThey because someone must have made that that's that's where the the word crazy\n\nMust've appeared in feedback and unlikely multiple times\n\nAnd they're in their internal going in\nYou know you're talking about tens of millions of dollars to run a Senate race ... which means they are doing every type of of polling an analytical research you can get in front of you get down to this point here\nAnd you see the desperation of using that in an ad that means you are trying to fight the perception of crazy Democrats in your election in Missouri and\nIt is the one thing that is killing your chances of winning yeah it is the one thing because it is if you think about the build up to you know if you listen to that there is a buildup\nThat word is is is one of those hot button words that you don't expect to hear but it was placed in the ad strategically at a certain place right as you are listening to something and all of a sudden boom she's not one of those crazy Democrats because and there's another thing too\nIt's a poor attempt I think\nAt recreating a conversation that people are you know having out there but it's not that's not the conversation they're actually having the conversation they're having is if it were really I think accurate and and and portraying what's going on with some of the Democrats or independents interstate it would be two guys going man\nThose Democrats are crazy I don't know but I can vote for Democrats anymore including McCaskill that the actual conversation so you have to have you have to countered with this contrived and and again I think it's ... it's a it's a poor attempt\nBut that's the only thing you can do you're not going to get Claire McCaskill coming out going hey I'm not one of those crazy Democrats\nOr the other thing I thought was interesting you know and and I'm not you know very familiar with Josh Hawley who's running against the attorney general against\nClaire McCaskill I'm I'm a I'm not you know we live in we live in Texas and that's one of the things is\nIt's it's tough for anybody ... ... and I mean it's tough for anybody on the national stage to really have a key understanding of what's going on for example in ... in Missouri race in many congressional races it's it's really tough because\nA lot of times it can be local and if you're not living there you don't see the stories that are pounded that you\nAre in each and every day but you and I both looked at each other we haven't discussed us but we looked at each other the part where well and it's claimed that\nBut Holly as attorney general made wine runs and went to the gym ... during work hours which with\nAll the heated rhetoric yeah an ad use that show the only thing they can make up your own and that was that's what you use and put an ad of desperation well here's the thing\nIt's ... I was thinking oh wait a minute I Wonder if he could pick me up some wine next time he goes because\nPeople go to the gym during the day all the time well what's what's people people run errands all the time just assume OK just to sing right that it's if it's on company time and it's it's well the the the state time in this case\nAnd it's um it's being done outside of his lunch hour it's not on his time that's the worst she got well I'm assuming most attorney general's don't work eight to five I'm guessing\nThere's fewer hours ... I'm assuming there's meetings there's speeches there's everything else that goes line meetings as to why aren't they they don't get a part of a job [laughter] but I I again I don't know the specifics behind it but I just went and and may and that's\nBut from an outsider you've heard that and you went that's a pretty weak well for an out of desperation that's pretty weak what it is I Would have I Would I Would have said\nAgainst ... strategically this is the only thing we're talking about here strategy I Would have stayed on the wait a minute he hasn't tried one case\nYeah the guy just doesn't have the experience he doesn't have the experience of attorney general for our state he certainly doesn't have experience to serve in the Senate the ... ... he went and bought some wine and went to the gym on on a while on the clock that's that's what you got\nBy the way when as an attorney general not on the clock that exactly\nEight six six Ninety\nEye tips from Jay Jay Keller and associates incorporated on customer service getting pulled over for inspection by law enforcement personnel is not a moment that drivers look forward to not only Kennan inspections set a driver back in their schedule\nAlso the inspection could mean serious issues for both the driver and the company the potential for a truck being stopped to undergo an inspection always exists here are some tips to help ensure the process goes more smoothly\nSponsored by the Rhode Island Army National guard feared by the Rhode Island broadcasters association at this station\nHome foreclosure can be a nightmare\nA couple of missed house payments and before you know at your house is being sold right from underneath\nYou don't know where you or your family are going to live or even where you're going to spend the night I don't think it can happen to you or anyone you know think again you don't have to face this alone certified housing counselors from the national foundation for credit counseling or available to work with you and your lender and the service is completely free\nThe sooner you call the better your options well eight six six six eight seven six three to two or visit mortgage now dot org request a free consumer education DVD called avoiding foreclosure working with a certified and FCC housing counseling this nightmare does not have to happen to you\nThat number again [noise] eight six six six eight seven six three to sue or visit mortgage help now dot org\nThis has been a public service message from the national foundation for credit counseling [noise]\nHere that that's the sound of safety and the sound of your family's belongings staying where they belong in times like these it's important to know how to protect your home your family and your valuables\nA good strong lock on the ... for him could make a huge difference most burglars will spend no longer than a minute trying to break in that's only as long as this radio announcement remember to lock your doors and windows even the best locks can't protect you unless you use them\nInstalled bright outdoor lighting if you have an alarm system use it and posts signs that say your home has an alarm ... bushes and trees or your house is clearly visible to your neighbors and your street if you ever returned home to find that someone has broken in do not enter\nCalled the police immediately to learn more on how to keep your home and family safe visit NC PC dot org that NC PC dot org let's all work together to keep our home safe\nAnd sound a message from the U.S department of justice national crime prevention council and the\nDrivers won an apt to reserve a hot shower see real time parking have begun more get the my pilot from pilots flying J you wanted we got\nA great product says there's a great look housed liver caters introducing their new logo on their new labels houses more than just their diesel treat anti jail they have a\nFull family of great products from house meaner powered leader of the top of the line diesel injector leader and lubricate the soup house multi purpose liberator and penetrating oil an alcohol free products with over one thousand one uses so much for the new logo and all the great house five bucks on the market how's lubricate or a\nFamily company with a family of products that you can trust\nI tend to an owner operators how do you tired and chasing empty promises are I think he is looking for you to join Thirteen offering a dollar Seventy five per mile for drivers or two dollars per month for teens\nAre ethnic ... that had an back home or not in their vocabulary they're no treatment rentals Nina and I know some secrets are I think today at a new Nate RSVP three six five that's a A R s me Pete three six five four apply online and R.

that we have gotten an email sounded may rise we addressed it to start the\nThe the the show a off with but a National Review and it's being picked up by you know of a social media uh uh uh some uh different a conservative website said\nHave picked it up and this is where National Review a wrote the article that said the pipe bomb\nOr and powder delivered to CNN were harmless this is an article that came out a at nine nine PM from jak crow at National Review and the reference that he gives is the Associated Press story right into a link to that right they link is right so we linked to the story\nAnd said okay because we didn't see that anywhere else and we said what does the Associated Press story says you know what what does it say and it's funny 'cause during our pre shall meet him when I read it I said oh it's saying it then I read it a second time I said well no it's not saying it because what it says is a law enforcement officials such tests have determined\nThat they hold her found inside an envelope delivered the CNN along with a pipe bomb was harmless right\nRoute out your harmless referring to the power that it that's the indication as the it refers to the powder not a pipe bomb now there is no indication as we've stayed to start to show off\nThe FBI has not we have not seen the words these raw act applied bombs that could have gone off ... we have seen what but the protests\nSilly quote potentially destructive devices and we've asked the question what is potentially destructive devices mean we've seen suspicious packages I'm looking at the last time I checked Fox News about twenty minutes ago they still have the headline suspicious packages\nUh we talked about the the Wall Street journal though actually are calling them mail bombs but not having a quote\nYou know from the FBI stating that they were mail bombs these are the little things and and again we're just two idiots overnight but these are the the little things that are picked up in different websites are not picking it up just quoting the national review story and not linked him to the Associated Press story\nThat you know that the that you know that the a package sent a to CNN was harmless we don't know whether it was or not\nWe don't know if the the uh the the suspicious package separate from the powder in the envelope was harmless there's like there's nothing in the a P story according to their source that says that\nRight and that's what National Review has referenced right and they're headline pipe bomb and powder delivered to CNN were harmless and other websites for picking that up we don't know outside that Associated Press story that doesn't say that right if you read the said yeah that's that's the point\nIs that right the the the story that their referencing doesn't actually say that they it could turn out to be the case it may be National Review has sources of their own but they're not sourcing they're not eating those sorts ... from the AP right you know so it it's just\nBecause the problem is is with with if\nYou're going to you know that if that are in the echo chamber of social media especially if that false information misleading information is going to be out there\nThan it is you know it it starts to become or build a narrative in the wrong direction if you start on the wrong premise everything that follows a may sound logical but it still is built on that false premise so\nYou know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review yeah they're doing but it was an oversight here in my opinion because that's not what the Associated Press story all\nI can understand it because when I read it the first time mhm that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading here just about and then I read it again I went oh that's not what the setting\nWas the Washington Post on there headline had it right there headline habit that the powder that was sent along with up the doors harm you know a along with the suspicious\nPackage was harmless and and so the the point being is that\nThat the narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not past that and you don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now\nPeople are going by their trust of National Review you know based on the headline\nWhich which National Review to me is extremely credible move at the time I I don't know maybe it's too late by mistake whatever or like I said when I first read it and that's what I told you as an earth they're saying the bomb was harmless right this is in our ... not on the air\nInformational women are actually never force flawed these videos international

were angering the news from a set of the CNN New York bureau and talking about the explosive devices tend to Iraq Obama and Hillary Clinton\nExcuse me that sounds like a fire alarm here will keep you posted on that but\nThe bomb squad another emergency services units rushed to the time Warner said during eventually removed a pipe bomb from the mail room that was addressed a director John Brennan

New Yorkers\nNow not the powder and the pipe bomb right right\nSo that's what they're that's what they're talking about again here in in that story but it's gone viral because the the National Review again unless National Review know something that we don't but they don't state that understory they're sourcing\nStrictly here the a P story but the reason that it's important is because as you see something like this go viral\nInformation is is incorrect or any information is incorrect and the discussions are surrounding this event clearly look there's the political aspect of this can't be ignored\nBut the discussion is important because you can't discuss anything without knowing the complete facts you can't discuss much\nWithout knowing the complete facts we've discussed\nThe reaction by the media by uh the the Democrats and and what that has been we know very\nLittle about this well into ... and that's why we had a set to uh a mystery soccer over at the CNN or or whether it was close to your Schumer and their their comments\nOr you know going after and you know and in essence blaming the president's first provocative statements claiming that they're against divisiveness it's interesting that the people that claim that we need to stop divisiveness are the ones that have accused somebody of responsibility of an incident where nobody has any idea\nNo one has any idea who the person might be who would have done this we don't know whether the bombs were lie bombs and would have gone off or not there is so much we don't know yet they are assessing blame the the ones who claimed that they are against divisiveness are committing the the\nOne of the biggest sins of divisive this and that is what blaming somebody\nWhen you don't have the facts behind you right\nRight\nAnd so as we've said we've discussed is a little bit and and gone through the different questions or as others have yesterday and and we we've asked a question that if it was it if they are life if they were alive bombs\nAnd and they would have gone off and then you have to look at that in a different way that if\nClearly none of them were alive bombs mhm that it would it be there'd been an attempt to scare or\nAn attempt a possibility of an attempt to uh you know look at manger figures in the Democratic party that are not liked well by members of the right in this country\nAnd you know try to you know give the tried to send the message that they're out to get them ... or that you know ... if if it was you know if it was it was a real bombing that's but if it was a big bomb it would be wasn't sent by somebody on the left\nTo try to blame the right there's a whole bunch of different scenarios and questions you would ask is an investigator based on whether the bombs were actually live or whether they were fake bombs right\n[noise] yeah and we can only ... will only know that if and when they find the person who or persons who are response\nRight and that could be never\nSo at the you can bet right now they have a number of great leads especially with the fact the nature of of how males sorted or by the secret service\nOr in in terms of the the Clintons when you look at and and the Obamas when you look at that situation um that I think you have to take into consideration\nWhat they already know about the patterns of behavior by people who do such a thing and and the resources are there are probably on to some pretty solid leads right now then add to that of course cameras being everywhere\nSo you will you know as soon as we get information we can start having that discussion but we want to point that out that you're seeing that story from National Review go viral it's important to have the discussion based on facts based on what we know right and there is a difference\nAnd we may learn that uh the authorities and and authorities will tell us or might tell us at some point that those devices were effectively harmless because they weren't set to go off\nBut that is not what you're seeing here and there's a pie report that was the source of the national review article\nWhich again just looking at social media overnight it has gone it has gone viral that see there was if we don't know that yet and rice Associated Press story does not state that\nAnd it's important that you know facts were brought up I was reading the daily wire story where they they talked about the a reporter for CNN and that looked at Martha ... who was interviewing\nOne of a one of the bomb experts right and this bomb expert gave out all the possibilities who said look could be somebody from the right and he said it could be a you know it could be but you know a foreign state that is trying to just ... you know this trying to disrupt the election or\nAs you said it could be a false flag from somebody on the left mhm so what the CNN reporter pulled out was only their response\nFrom this expert of that it was somebody on the left and left out when this expert said it could be somebody from the right ... it could be a foreign actor or it could be a false flag from somebody on the left because the election is just two weeks away when I brought up all the possibilities and investigator would bring out\nAnd what did the CNN reporter to weed out just deport the report that apparently media matters poured out which is a left leaning a or you know media organization media\nA truth organization where they only put out just his opinion\nYou know on the left as if that's who he blamed and Martha mckell I'm like oh yeah Oh absolutely yeah are fascinating and something like that and see citizen responded they all believe in somebody for fake news will know the fake news is the actual fact checking of the news you\nDidn't include the entire statement right\nAnd which is our point on this entire thing with the national review and the difference between the story that they used as their stores\nIt's important we give a lot of credibility to the national review and have for a long long time but it's important\nThat as you as you you've got twelve days here before the election this is all going to be in terms of the discussion not the investigation but the discussion about it in social media is all politically driven and has been from the start\n\nYou don't win anything by repeating false information\n\nNow you don't win anything by a you know as media matters [laughter] by putting out incomplete\nInformation which indeed his fault if you don't include the entire statement\n\nThat's what we deal I mean that's the world to really deal with you and I taught of talked about this many times that much we spend much more of our time just trying to disseminate what the truth is out there right\nAnd arguing the truth versus the conspiracy theories the half truths that are out there and and it does become frustrating at times\nNow I Will admit that the story that you know the national review story that when we read the Associated Press ... when I read it on so you when I read it the first I said wow Eric what they're saying that the bottom and I read the first sentence\nAnd then I re read it again and went on and it's not what they're saying right now that wasn't on the air to see a right and it was like no they're not saying that what they're saying is it's the powder that came with the the the ... they're not saying I both were harmless right\nThey're saying the powder was harmless you know that that's what the source said the powder was harmless they didn't even mention about the suspected potentially explosive package they didn't say that either way\nRight on that one so uh again that's you know that's what we deal with and\nYou know we saw yesterday but you saw it again you saw from CNN you saw it from the the Democrats are you know we're picking were well you really couldn't pick and choose the facts because you didn't have any\nVery few very few when do we know these
