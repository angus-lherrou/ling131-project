{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WPRO", "content": "The other part that's in the room and telegram is that the Germans are going to begin unrestricted ... that the unrestricted warfare was always part of a German plan of aggression to intimidate the Americans that's critical because there was a war party and an anti war party in the Congress the anti war party is very suspicious this telegram\nSuits the purposes of white hall of the British Empire of law at George David lord George the new prime minister out of money out of time\nThey know the the British are are desperate and probably should be seeking piece terms or some armistice in fact the president at Christmas Nineteen sixteen into January Nineteen Seventeen what the president a Wilson was often in the headlines\nLeading a a peace idea an arbitration idea with himself as a referee so all of a sudden the referee is compromise but not yet the president is not ready to go to war he's holding back\nOne of the tests that they go through in order to convince Congress that the Germans are aggression aggressive\nAnd that the British did not concoct is is they want demonstration\nThat the Americans had the ability to solve this code this is one of the scenes I Love more than any other than your book Thomas when a degrade knowledge of the great the crypt analysis expert in room forty who actually did part of the decoding of his name and telegram\nTakes an American named bell into the ... office in the ... office and allows bell or participates in belle translating that they had to demonstrate that the Americans had the ability to translate it it was a theater piece Thomas it was a fiction but haul got away with hearts\nYes it was as far as you're absolutely right what happened was you know when the Taliban was published on march first there's a debate in Congress and\nTo many um you know many many representatives and senators skeptical and say well ... where it was actually coming from\nAnd says suspicion was that this was given by Great Britain to the United states in order to bring the United states in the war and this is actually a voice in this congressional debate and this was\n... absolutely true I'm now the Wilson Administration um then as you said I'm I'm a Vietnam ranges for um a Mr bell from the American embassy in London\nUm along with whole tooth decay crip this telegram\nUm the evidence is that ... actually is unable to do so and and degrade takes over and do that for him\nBut then the American the American administration can truthfully say\nThis was captured the crypt ... by an American I'm a so they wouldn't have to lie to Congress and say ah you know this this is what it actually true in in in in a in a shallow fence um but the greater truth of course was\nIt yeah what they did either British it's called the ... of the third time they answered the question they asked the wrong question very and very detailed\nSo I'll ask the right question in Iraq and in fact hall had constructed the ... of the telegram when it got to Mexico City\nOr intercepting it so that they could do the code on code that and present that is if they'd interrupted the Mexican\nOr the Mexican reception of the a telegram what's critical here is that there was an agent network stringing between Berlin and London and New York and Washington on the Mexico City and you solve all this Thomas in one of the joys of reading your book\nLet's go to march second the ... the roundtable dining club in New York\nOut the guest of honor that night as a man named captain guy going around and around him are a lot of pro war big deals including of course the former ambassador to a U.S ambassador to Britain Joseph ... chose\nAnd a captain gone rolling his challenge is this a fraud\nDid you do this is this your scheme and captain gone does not tell them the truth Thomas it's a joy to see him mislead the war party to their satisfaction people want to be convinced but gone reports to haul the Nineteen out of twenty American gentleman believe this is a fraud\nThat's right I mean that that that is that is very doubtful if if that was actually true to me it seems that\nWhen does telecommuting she published in March first Nineteen Seventy and uh the the debate is more well is\nCan we take this seriously you know this this is so outrageous um um is this something to be taken seriously and you mentioned the round table um um dinner um how how easily these these ... this is American ... pro war party is convinced and he goes to show 'em the telegram\nVery quickly becomes a political tool in the United states it's really not so much about\nIt is a veritable threat I don't think many people believed that Germany makes equal you know were physically capable of invading the United states and just men bring it um but for the pro war party it becomes you know yet another tool in their push for war\nBut then you also have the anti war party that dismisses this telegram as something ridiculous this can't be taken seriously this is just a\nA this is this is this is just a sign of how desperate the Germans are so um it is often has often been said that the telegram was sort of the Pearl harbor of World War one\nAnd my argument is no no it really wasn't it was not it was um if anything\nIt prove divisive because it reinforced pro war sentiment were already exist that um but even after the publication of the telegrams you have a very strong um hum peace movement I'm antiwar sentiment in the United states\nAnd telegrams is not unlike Pearl Harbor able to to rally the public behind 'em ... American ... going to war and when America does enter the war in April Nineteen Seventy my thesis is it is a much more divided country than for instance Germany France and Britain were in Nineteen fourteen and you can see evidence of that after the war\nWhen a America does not signed the peace treaty of Versailles retreat into isolationism and really comes out of it only when Pearl Harbor all cursed\nUm sold his him and telegram Dutch play a role in American domestic politics in Nineteen Seventeen but not in the sense that it unites the American public um for intervention\nDid not unite in fact you a stylish the fact that the anti war faction\nWas determined to believe that America has been tricked regardless of the ... men telegram and at the end result is a hundred thousand American casualties\n... did not match the ah the gym and telegram or the the so called threat of the Germans the Mexicans and the Japanese that was fantastic and it was used as a as a ... but that was the illegitimate that's what they believe even in Nineteen Eighteen is that correct\nThat is correct of course in ... in a narrow ... almost true it was not a fraud and there were not people who were saying was the front of the same time but the suspicion at the time I'm by by isolationist or non interventionist senators and and newspapers was\nThat this was play to the American right by the British with the goal of getting Americans to the war and this is of course exactly\nUh what had happened and it's the facts the matter solved by Thomas Bogart their mentality Graham intelligence diplomacy and America's entry into World War one it's important to know how it all started on John ...\nMany call him to find that ... are they are a lot of the other lady didn't know that Sinatra

on\nLimitation gar what the FBI\nCan do I've actually been told multiple senators have reached out to the White House who's in college in particular was in counsel patience with the White House\nAbout making sure that there were limits on what the FBI can do now it's worth noting when the discussions were had on friday about the scope of the investigation the focus was really on the first two accusers not the third accused of the one represented by Michael I have a lot of white\nHouse has issued new guidelines for the investigation clearing FBI agents that interview anyone they want to change coming after Democrats question the narrow scope of the investigation of the city of Las Vegas came together Monday to mark the one year anniversary of the deadliest shooting a murder in us history by dedicating a memorial garden to the people killed and the roads were\nBut I think this is what the president was getting at you know so many things have changed in this entire thing you could look at the claims and depending on what is set to the FBI in these interviews\nYou could be looking at perjury for Dr Ford and I think this is what her attorneys\nAre worried about I think it's why\nThey were so anxious over the weekend remember they said over the weekend we've contacted the FBI trying to set up the interview and as a Sunday they were saying you know no interview yet they haven't talked to her well why would you want to do it so soon after testimony because you want to keep her on track you don't want to change in their story\nNow the FBI is not going to do anything against her and I don't know that there would be any action against her except for the fact that she was under oath last Thursday so whatever she said then\nHer comments to the FBI are part of the process in betting Kavanaugh and if they differ from her testimony there will be questions\nAnd so the the left is coming out and this is why I think they're also going for perjury or for Kavanaugh they keep making up these bogus perjury things that\nAren't going anywhere are and all of them have to do with the amount of alcohol that he's drinking and he was never very ... they had he said well listen I was very clear to only have a four four ounces of\n[laughter] which I Am telling your dad okay for those under the age of Seventy Ritchie Cunningham was a a character\nIn a show called happy happy\n... yeah yeah right but it was on all through the eighties all but I Want to read it was ... and now Ritchie Cunningham as a as a as a liberal a director but his brother\nYes it's a concern that's right and so he at Ron Howard who were\n... anyway so you just ask them well because that I you know I just had you know as these tiny little drinks well how many did you have Seventy [laughter]\nI Love that episode it was great I'll I'll never forget a you know the you know looking at it that\nRitchie says because he actually Ron Howard ... trunk fuck man that's good acting but if if Kavanaugh would come out and made certain points by was clear to only have one drink at any function he didn't say that in fact at the time in my mind when I was watching it\nI was almost critical of him and I thought no actually this is exactly how judges are they're very forthcoming especially about anything that they have done in their past or to this extent\nThere's just not criminal behavior to the\nOf throwing the was the exactly throwing the ice at a bar you might according to one make all these report he might have thrown ice right yes yeah and he never says he threw eyes\nBut in the police report someone claims they threw eyes and the guy's ear was bleeding what people's ears bleed altogether deer ears leaving was not from the [laughter] that was from the other person's throwing the out of here big big block I'm\nPaying attention to this because damage I Need to know now I hate I had no\nAll matters is that it was listed as an assault and somebody was bleeding\nSo you've got to think like a liberal updated so this is but\nThis is the the ... in my sanity by the way you know I'm laughing huh I was a club DJ for years yeah I saw a massive bar fights and why is it hard when ice in my time and and and all the\nOil field workers in the ... are probably asleep right now but uh out in West Texas or screaming the guy got to leave the bar with his ear intact oh [laughter] well the recall that a good day\nSo here's the thing I'm [laughter] actually comes from a real scenario um but ... ... ... the entire equation has to be distorted and there has to be this distraction\nRight and now it's about what did he know when did he know what about the claims right because the text messages now show well that that he knew about the Ramirez claim ahead of time before it got to the media\nWell okay here's the here's the concern I think for the Democrats is that the president has essentially directed the FBI to talk to anybody and everybody who might be relevant to the situation will that includes\nPeople who were supposed to have corroborated if they've got the FBI agent sitting in front of them they're going to be nervous they're going to ... and and I wonder how the story is going to change and again if it does\nI Wonder where this thing go while\nJust it just as you're talking about the justice we're talking about this this comes across\nA from our news feed from uh from Westwood One book at our company guy so Westwood One is Eric Swalwell ... the the us representative from California Tucker Carlson before this guy's a piece of work yeah and it just comes across as you're talking there just I didn't mean to interrupt you but it's ... it's\nA Swalwell Senate Kavanaugh lies or just qualifying and I went well what are the lies a buyout right apparently\nI've ... I've not listen to this audio cup and I'm going to play it here okay a but it's just a former college costs would have brought Kavanaugh says the Supreme Court nominee was not truthful about is drained game mhm here we go All right let's play this\nTypically this would not be disqualified for any Supreme Court nominee the fact that they drank in college like most people in college too however it is disqualify him because he has painted himself as a choir boy who never engaged in any of his behavior wrong and I'll\nSay wrong he lie wrong there's ... mind that the whole point of lying disqualify you from the Supreme Court then you need to step down from office\n[laughter]\nWe'll say we'll say it again CNN did the interview over the weekend with one of capitals former classmates I Would have stayed on the sideline if he had said I drink to excess in high school I drank too obsessed in college I did some stupid things but never sexually assaulted anybody\nHis actual comments I drank beer with my friends sometimes I had too many beers sometimes other ... I like beer I still like beer but I didn't drink beer to the point of blacking out and I never sexually assaulted anyone\nWhere's your way there [laughter] and that's it the leftist rambling so hard right now frankly I hear ... here's thank God gave me that Eric Swalwell well in this this entire thing as a gift to the Republicans if you're a Democrat right\nNow you should be worried about this at this behavior right now by your party this should concern you greatly because here's the difference\nThe blue wave may happen in the house Nancy Pelosi I'm going to be speaker again\nI'm don't grab the keys just yet Nancy even if you do when\nIn the Senate\nYou and I you were going over some polls are some recent polls are some that had Thursday included but\nNot just Thursday and that's that's important because of it right the hearing\nBut if you look at these polls in the Senate they're very close right now and if you get a a a a couple of other seats a couple of more seats for the Republicans in the Senate they can afford\nTo lose the columns on the next Supreme Court nominee I mean I you you look at it I mean we were looking at uh the the New Jersey Senate mhm uh hugging versus a Mendez Robert Menendez come at the Democratic incumbent right and and it says if you look at the real clear politics open ended up\nBy for well the Quinnipiac poll in August with registered voters had him up by six the Stockton University poll that goes to the twenty seven to last Thursday of likely voters that's more accurate\nOr a has a Menendez only up by two yeah and that's the margin of error for points rate\nWhile again this is not over and you're a\nDemocrat you should be absolutely worried about this because I've I've never in my lifetime in my adult lifetime I don't remember the Republicans being this health\nOr an motivate Kramer over high camp just out from the seventeenth or NBC valley news from the Seventeen to twenty seven there's just a a came out alright six hundred and fifty likely voters he breaks the fifty one percent he's fifty one to forty one over Heidi Heitkamp\nYeah now that goes to the twenty seventh or Donnelly in a in ... in Indiana\nOr the Fox news poll a but that goes to the that's the latest one ah just 'til the eleventh of September but still a his uh his ah were Republican I'm\nA\nOpposition Braun is up by two now that was before any of this you know ... eleven that was really before we got an any of this and and so I just wonder really what the polls are going to say that are going to be coming out the latter part of this

friday when Jeff Flake is confronted in the elevator and then those who\nConfronted him later that day said this is why we go direct\nWhat it did was to justify and attempt to legitimize the shouting\nOf Ted Cruz out of a restaurant even though that same restaurant is not hired security guards it is they see it as well it worked\nAnd this is why we're going direct this is why we will keep doing this because they believe again they're going to get the same reaction that they got out of Jeff Flake well\nNews flash he admitted in the sixty minutes interview if he were up for reelection that would've never happened you never would have gotten him together with Coons that agreement to delay this thing and have an FBI background check this week\nWould never have happened he admitted it he doesn't care what the people of Arizona think he doesn't care what the people think he only cares what the people think if it serves him him\nAnd so this entire equation\nUm ...\nIs is the what they see is the momentum now here's the problem the party has and by the way to the party we need to repeat these people don't care about you either they don't they don't care that Jeff Flake had disdain\nAs a Republican for Donald Trump after he got was tunes and they came up with this agreement to do this FBI background check they started screaming if not enough and so they don't care about

started off the show with us and when you look at what the uh for example the the the uh uh a Yale\nI'm of the first went to Yale with a glass half another classmates and you know and she came across instead of if you will or you'd said this and then you look at his testimony will he did say that they're actually to the point now where the liberals this is how bad is you're asking will they ever get off the brink but we are to the point\nWhere they're making an accusation he's lying really yes he should've said this when we did see he's line no but you said if he said this wouldn't be lying nobody's line but he said that\nI mean that's where we are right media carries ... ...\nIt's an immediate gives it life because here's here's the difference if you look at the case of the New York times talking about\nThe the ah\nThe accusations made in the New Yorker piece\nThey this is what they wanted to do they want to do their their their tactic on this story this claim was to go find an interview as many people as possible to see if they had first hand knowledge of this happening they couldn't find one\nNBC goes out and says well we couldn't find anybody to back it up but we're going to put her on anyway ... classmate\nActually makes a statement that parallels what Kavanaugh said and said if he had said this then I wouldn't have a problem\n\nBut still the media carries the story because what you're looking to do is it if I were writing that story if it were my work to put that story into print or put it on TV or anywhere else\nIt would be my approach to say ah this is going to be torn to shreds because what she said and I need to go back over to this is what I Would do I would get the transcript\nAnd I would read it and read it again\nBecause she's claiming the classmate is claiming he didn't say something when he did it's an all out lie but if you're in the media and you're taking that story to print a TV to whatever you're part of the lie\nBecause it took another media organization to tear it down and say well I'm actually he did say that\nOr does it ever feel like that and\nAnd and this does not come from arrogance whatsoever because you know that we're further ourselves as a to idiots overnight\nBut does anyone ever get the feeling and this is a doesn't include just you and me are but everybody listening right there does it ever get to the point where you just think to yourself dealing with the Democrats right now the mainstream Democrats\nIs like dealing with our children yes any excuses the children will give yeah and I'm not saying that ... out of meanness I'm Talking about the arguments that they are making you know you and I said this\nUh last week\nSaid the American people when you basically they understand due process\nAnd if you talk about the due process and what the Democrats are doing here and not you know the belief and you know that you're innocent until proven guilty the the the fact of what they used to claim they cared about ... you know that's what the liberals are to care about and in fact they do and I said but if you keep pushing it the majority of Americans do believe in that\nEven Democrats that said they won't vote for Kavanaugh they still view this as a cheap shot against him yes they view it as if you if you get them alone and you asked them they'll tell you that oh by the way one of the uh\nUh people that I Know on social media\nThat uh doesn't talk much used to talk more as a liberal and has been quiet over the last year came out in favor of Kavanaugh wow and ended in a very subtle way and I was like wow but if you actually talk to Democrats run out they're not happy with the way that the ... the the this is actually going\nOr they won't come out publicly and criticize their party for what they're doing but they feel very uncomfortable they understand there is no evidence here they understand it and they see this just rolling and ... and that's the whole point that many Republicans look at this and go wow you're kidding me they're going down this path\nAnd now they're they're just taking anonymous sources and throwing it out I mean this is just so slimy and so dirty yeah or against Kavanaugh because there is no cooperating evidence there is no evidence\nAnd look people aren't stupid they will sit there and say this really stinks well and that's that's it because it does that they'll look at the forward and say\nAll these Gulf on me accounts and other now of what a million or over a million dollars what are the world's going on here the lawyers were pro bono you're talking about an airplane flight ... all this money being a rate it looks dirty yes\nIt all looks dirty and the American public and that's why when you bring it up about the cooperation and when people actually look into it and you when you started earlier to me ah off the air\nYou said this is really liked the experience that we have\nWith ... if you will have no idea that kept regular it's about free speech sure why aren't you watch the new well look I'm not angry it's just I don't prefer to watch it because of and you explain what he actually did and you explained the pig socks every single\nPerson that supported Kaepernick had no that that I've talked to and it's in the hundreds over the last year ... had no idea about the cop pigs sucks right once you bring that up to go it's a good point they had no idea about Michael Bennet ... no idea that Michael Bennett who was the catalyst one of the catalysts last\nYear and just become one of the leaders\nOf the movement who was also you know in the locker room yesterday for Philly mhm got famous and became the poster person last year mhm to continue with because he lied about the Las Vegas police every single person that was supporting Kaepernick did know about that either\nAnd they went oh oh okay yeah that is bad and I'll leave it at that I won't judge them and but you can tell they know when you bring up things that are common sense to people when you bring up something like fairness\nAnd the\nPreponderance of evidence before finding somebody guilty that it has to exist somewhere there's a reason that NBC wouldn't run Mitchell's report why wouldn't they run it\nBecause they know that he'd been there a few listeners there doesn't listeners viewers that that are left even if they're liberal would say\nYeah not not good right and\nWhy do you do that to adults why don't you want adults to know the truth right why we don't hide anything on the show there's nothing I Would hide\nAny news item I could care less I'll bring up anything that's going on out there why won't pay right why will they hide things that are important\nTo a story and even if they disagree with it analyze it right but they they as we've talked about before we talked last week about lying through omission ... in a lot of stories out there now right but if you live through omission we just won't include parts of it\nAnd if and while they'll give an interview to somebody who's making claims that they as a news organization couldn't even corroborate right they will ignore\nA key piece to the actual an official piece of the actual\nProcedure the actual process in place\nThey ignore it completely but when you give Americans when you start telling Americans will look here's what's going on with this case and you lay it out to them that's why all of a sudden you go to\nYou know sixty percent say oh or fifty seven percent say oh we didn't know okay yeah that that's that's wrong if there is no cooperation well and if the FBI finds out there is no one sixty percent of Americans believe that that's almost all of independence and\nYeah and that's what you're looking for that's what you're looking for in any election and we always get this and we talked about the administration and said look you could have more success is if you have a consistent solid message day in and day out because well you never convince the liberals that's not\nYour goal that'll not your goal and and you know it's like Jeff Flake saying\nYou know what I'm saying when I went to Coons I I was just I was telling them this is

it's the United states Canada and Mexico it's still North America ... so it's so uh\nThere has to be more North American which uh content which is going to raise the cost then the the um a salary requirements that he put on Mexico\nThan Mexico must you know raised it doesn't affect Mexico would actually affords General Motors and Ford remembered the companies are talking about are all American companies\nAnd if you noticed none of the American automobile manufacturers are saying this is a great deal for them they don't like the deal the deal will make it so Ford and General Motors cells fewer cars in North America\nAnd because you've raised the cost of automobiles\nIn North America more expensive to manufacture what the president said he wanted which was to send more vehicles to manufacture them\nUnited States and send them overseas is now going to be tougher to do because you've raised the cost of manufacturing of cars in the United states in Mexico and Canada\nView the consumer will pay for it and that is what the president viewed as the greatest victory in this\n... and so as I you know we only got one email on at the one guy said to you know you and I said well wait a minute or there's some parts of it we like but the big part of it the president promoted is wrong and as I and I you know invited him to argue more than debate more than just the rhetoric\nOf it makes America great\nTo what does it actually do when you raise prices but we limit it we live in a look we live in a day and age and I understand that we live in a day and age where nobody wants to talk about ... when you look at these specific sub of what's going on with Kavanaugh\nNobody wants to focus in and say okay what's the actual thing here everybody's off into a different tangent the same on on on the economics and trade everybody picks their own little corner and they stick with it instead of saying okay what is a result when you raise prices overall\nAnd that's what the president has done in the free trade agreement and our trade negotiators have done he has made cars more expensive to buy in Mexico in the United states and in Canada were all in it together\nYeah the cost of buying a car in the United states Canada and Mexico will go up in price at a time as you mentioned yesterday Eric\nYou mentioned it yesterday I don't know why I focused and said Eric ... uh but as you said yesterday a ... and you and I've been doing some some uh uh reading an analysis on this is that her prices are going up people can't afford to buy cars they run out of ways to finance them and so what are people looking to do the looking to buy\nUsed vehicles yes and that that's driving right market right now which when there was a greater demand for that group of vehicles the used vehicles and the price goes up\nAnd so for some people out there they believe this is ... none of it's personal solve economics how does it work I Can't tell you how the president things because of president or even in this trade deal has done some good things and done some bad things and that's one of the bad things is automobile now it could have been a lot worse from what he was promoting before\nBut the fact is it didn't affect\nProbably Ninety eight percent of the free trade between the countries and that's a good thing as we said would happen we've had predicted look who's going to be all this hype all the soup ... and what we're going to basically get\nIs the same kind of deal a little bit of nuances here or there they get a little victory on timber we get a little victory on dairy\nThe big problem with it is what the president and what the trade negotiators did on raising the cost of all cars manufactured in the United states in Canada and Mexico that you that consumers are going to have to pay and it means we are less likely to ship\nCars from the United states anywhere else\nAnd the president's use that as a great victory for the United states but doesn't explain why it's a great victory\nRight yeah and I I think if you look here's where the tell will be\nYou'll see certain industries that the reason the automobile industry is his key to the economy is because you look at the the the how often now\nPeople purchase vehicles right I'm more and more they're holding on to their cars so that hurts the ... because well they want the stuff off the assembly line to be salt\nYou make that more expensive you start hurting it industry you start seeing layoffs as a result of that then and then also make the used cars by default more expensive and you're going to see not just the automobile industry but of course all the dealerships\nAnd all of the uh if if you look at the finance arms of those companies they're all going to suffer as a result of that\nBecause people will choose as they're doing now to hold onto their car for longer periods of time because that's the cost of government that's not the cost of anything else\nWe're not talking about well whether it's steel and aluminum or the parts going into the car or electronics or anything else we're not saying that this stuff is scarce\nThat it's hard to come by age that a small group of people have decided to get together and determine\nHow expensive it's going to be for us that's the difference\nAnd we view it as a victory and as we've said nobody can explain to us why\nThat's a victory now as we said the other things when you look at the dairy you know again that's that's moving in and in some of the agriculture stuff where we do have more free trade now because of it and we had in Canada was able to knock down some of the barriers that's fine\nBut it's almost as if we make the victory over there and but then we shoot ourselves in the foot on automobiles now the other good thing is\nCanada will like this would be was mentioned with the timber\nThat the president in all likelihood will be lifting the terror if they put on timber and now that has to go to a panel to decide whether a candidate is subsidizing it not the president to make the decision on his own which should sheep and construction in the United states because that timber will be coming over\nAnd that was a fear of builders that housing prices were going to skyrocket another construction from the use of of would because of the Canadian timber and hopefully in the next year that will bring those prices down so there's wins and there was lost his across the board but but overall if the president is dating\nThat the threat of tariffs on Canada and the and and and Mexico and the steel tariffs on the aluminum terrorists made it worthwhile for this he's going to have to show me the numbers on it\nWell and that's that's again it's it's it's the second largest purchase that people make and if people are homeowners it's the first largest purchase on on vehicles\nAnd you start seeing that slide you start seeing the economy slide and that will be your tell this is what the the Bush administration saw steel terrorists they saw companies leaving the country\nAnd they said this can't stand we cannot keep this going you can't we cannot do this because the the job loss will be well who knows what it would have been had they not ended those still terrorists uh prematurely\nBut overall the vast majority of products unchanged right and so uh you know the president which was called a victory fine we just do the analysis on the reality of economic\nSlump he gives me when you get ... he's got my support if if we're going to stand strong against China there's ... then ... and by the way political you can get away with that all day long to it's going it is going to hurt but if they're not going to play by the world Trade Organization rules\nThen not only the U.S but all of our allies and other trade partners with China need to get in line and putting the pressure on them that's a very real strategy in it is going it it has to be effective because\nI don't know how you can put a cost on on

let Obama appointed ... at least ... we might not even being in a situation where cabinet can\nLocate lunch break this down then like All right let's All right well let's break it down let's break it down now let's break it down okay that's where you may you may hear what you're saying is uh the Republicans put themselves in this particular situation okay let's say that they did because Merrick Garland was not\nYou know given a given given a chance it yeah yeah yeah and you know why they didn't want to I'm we understand both on the way we understand let me speak let me respond okay what you are stadium\nThen is that in a republic the\nRepresentatives said get elected and the party that gets more representatives elected\nBy the people\nThey get to make the rules and regulations of that particular body yours dating since the Republicans won ...\nAnd could\nThat body which means control that nomination because in public\nIt is the majority representatives of that party they get to make the decisions that since they make a decision that you disagree with its oh hey did defame somebody's reputation\nNo I'm not saying that what I'm saying is this first of all that's a lifetime for this and so\nThey get to go over your whole life when you and your mom wall if you did something wrong at that point or someone witnessed it that's part of your life twinkle with your whole life not

it but no it goes back to what we originally said that the if you were in power you get to make the rules\nMhm right well keep in mind that position was nothing new uh on\nThe Senate for back in the day the Democrats held the same position because it was just as much out of respect for Hillary Clinton as it was for\nDonald Trump remember that scenario was that the new president should should pick their nominee right and I ... and that did not that was not there was not a given at that point that Trump was going to win\nWell no the the end but the point is that this is like dealing with the woman that was on CNN last week was the the guy makes a statement we say well this is what you're saying and it's exactly what he said when he goes no that's not what I'm saying well of course that's what you're saying because why Harry Reid decided to\nChange the rules of the Senate when he was the head of the Senate when it came to federal nominations therefore when he did that\nUh you had Mitch McConnell come in and say okay you change those rules were going to change those ... these rules for the Supreme Court justice yeah the people in power we get some ... these aren't laws\nWere not changing laws were simply changing rules the Senate that we have the ability to do constitutionally you may not like it but hey when elections has what Harry Reid said\nRight and Mitch McConnell came in and said the exact same thing that's the reality of it and what you're saying that it's it's okay to defame somebody's ah what is it the fame somebody's character because\nThat's the reality of how a Democratic Republic constitutional republic works\nUh and then you got into the point that we now have to go back into the womb when you have a life time yeah positions that are at anybody agree with them that we need to go back to the moon I'm all Supreme Court justices we need to go back to the boom\nWell at least they do with how often did you pick your mother that domestic abuse\nYes\nI'm

into the show\nGood morning I Wonder if some sixteen year old tonight posted something on\nTwitter or Instagram that'll keep them from becoming a judge forty five years from now but my point is that Senator Flake man actually ... the Republican Party\nBy calling ... you're a senator in a a purple shall we say state or a state where your reelection is a tough one a year now and say hey look I was kind of go towards not voting for the man or I was leaning towards voted for him I wasn't sure I sat through the hearings\nAnd like so many Americans I couldn't make up by my only cold than the FBI did a whole invested in any reasonable person would say that there's no real conclusion after that investigation I'm going to vote for him so I think this is just to give kids some cover to uh\nWho may have been afraid to alienate some of their email or voters and then gives them a little political cover to vote yes well\nThere there's only works if they if the polls since Thursday which will start rolling in over the next couple of days that by the ... by the end of the week those polls show that the American people are not with them but the but more importantly those senators in those states especially where it's close\nA are not getting the support of their voters and they're staged a and ultimately it only works if the vote is to confirm Kavanaugh because it doesn't work for the Republicans if he does not get confirmed or it becomes still a very very much so an uphill battle\nOr even in November even though I Do believe that this whether he's confirmed or not will work for them politically I don't know too what effect in November at the mid term\nAnd I think the Democrats plant is it doesn't really matter what happens with Ford anymore it's let's get at whatever other allegations that we have to try to delaying that's yet they want yeah\nYeah they want further delay they're going to want Ramirez to have a hearing or\nYou know there will be a coal somewhere along the way when they know the boat is inevitable and the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell saying on Monday that there will be a vote this week and so we don't know when that's going to be I'm assuming Saturday there could be a vote on the floor but we don't know\nUm he said it's time for delays I haven't heard his day yeah so they could\nDo that Sunday and get a capital seated on a by

supposed to take the shot and I'm sitting at the government said no this is a fireball I Want it to be around for well I wouldn't say I want to\nBecause if it's something new I Need to taste it first so I'm going to drink a slow anyway right I don't want to just do a shot and they go or what was that\nYeah yeah well it it's funny 'cause I I often think about it that if I was young again and you go you know you go into a liquor store today and you see the you know\nIt's like wow I was there last December no no but I wouldn't I wouldn't even be thinking about the alcohol there's so many flavors of you know and yeah I was gonna say I was like wow we had\nA we had company coming in and so I just went to get something just one thing\nBut it was like okay\nShould I call her and tell her there's

yeah so that's where we are now I mean it's we're we're taught high school now seriously where the high school is the next thing junior high know the next thing\nIs that your hair when they were when they were six months old you know they threw rice on another child\nAlthough it very quickly I just want to throw this story and I don't think that the court's gonna knock this thing down but I just want to bring it up real quick and then we'll get back to your calls ... a lot of people I'm Talking about Brett Kavanaugh but governor Jerry Brown on Sunday signed a bill into law that makes California the first state to require corporate boards of directors to include women\nYeah\nSaying that despite potentially fatal legal problems in the measure it's time to force action of course it's unconstitutional you cannot dictate dog corporation who they can put on the board and what the makeup passed to be right what if it's a man who identifies as a woman and and so just by saying it\n\nBut this is this is the insanity of the left that that links appearance at because this has to control and and what his next accompany must have so many are women in certain positions\nOr management executives executive VP whatever it might be\nThat there must be a certain ratio\nWell that's again there it is\nI you know I really wonder I mean especially with California liberals do you really think you're on to something oh they know they think they're here I mean you really think that sure I I Would love to ask that quote you know that sit down my it can happen huh\nWhy what well because I can be just like the Georgetown professor\nMhm\nSo I'd like to sit down and talk with them or you know they're not going to happen they don't want to talk like I'd like to sit down and talk to that Georgetown professor\nWell it's not only because it's it's no longer about not wanting to have the debate it's about I'll be so loud and obnoxious that no one will have want to have the debate with me\nDo they really think they're saving the world yes they do absolutely they think they're saving the world\nThey think they're changing things because there's and there's the difference well so what is Governor Brown wonder if it's a wonder if it's a gay male that has to give up his seat on the board because that ...\nBecause the board is no longer made up and does not uh the makeup of the
