have been at for me I I Would have that would have\nBecause their heads would have just exploded and they were ready they were there they were near exploding\n... uh but uh you know we got the typical thing that you know uh what was a set on Don Lemon show quote token negro ... is it ended up quote a is um is what the Kanye West\nWas well here's here's my question on that does anyone believe that\n... is being coerced to do this like Trump has something on ... and if he doesn't do you know if you don't show up with a White House to say good things about me I'm going to tell everybody I mean ... there because Kanye wants to be there so you know the whole token\nThing I ... I was talking because the cameras were were on prom yet\nConyers doing this because the cameras will be on ... as long as he's doing this but they don't get it\nWell the uh the the the token or a comment let me just to get them through here some of the the different uh headlines of salt on our White House that came from MSNBC [noise]\nYeah that I I Will tell you that I did like uh I did like a ... that one ... um\nThat the Trump is a\nExploiting a mentally ill person\n[noise]\nThat also came out yesterday\nUm and what was the the uh the and the other one you know that you've basically who's being controlled by\nYou know white supremacy ... the white supremacy that is controlling you basically you have the master and slave missed what you have that analogy was also made a a a yesterday the one thing the left can tap\nIs somebody of the status of Kanye West in popular culture not endorse everything that they do yeah uh uh as I said tiny West is not a\nA a Walter Williams or a or a Mia Love or even explaining things the way that you know ...\nUm he's a rap star ... he's going to be all over the place has he has been a has been all over the place and his politics that's not the point it's not the point is not what the point is not dissecting\nThe uh the ... the\nLegitimacy or accuracy\nOf the specific economic and political ideology of Kanye West ... it's the fact that he's in a room with Trump complimenting them and it ends there\nAnd so at that particular point and we said this for the longest time before a lot of other shows were saying it\nAnd that the\nUh the liberal elite and the liberal black leadership in this country or believes in the bigoted and racist idea that all blacks must think alike and\nIf you don't think alike you are not truly black\nYeah that's it yeah\nThey don't have to go much further than that and that's what you were seen uh a yesterday\n... look I'm [laughter]\nAnd the more attention you give a Kanye West ... he's he's always out for publicity he's making the headlines and it's not even about a tour or a song\nWhen does he not made headlines the ... the whole point is is that's why he does kid rock was an afterthought mhm\nHe was there yesterday apparently they asked him a question right yeah reported it and didn't like the answer\nWell and at some point what where do you what age do you drop\nKid [laughter] I I'm just asking questions I like the guy\nBut you can't call them rock because we already have raw [laughter] see [laughter]\nIt started out I never thought about that when I was a kid [laughter] starts out well meaning and then how do I have a career at\nSixty yes exactly\nYou know kid rock ... not so much anymore\nOr so it it it it it it could be has a kid rock\nI'm not sure if you have you on the air one time you know I was in when he first ran almost like oh come on in the nineties ... and then I uh\nI uh\nWas behind the music to the biography of his life mhm and you see how hard he worked to get where he got ... that he had nothing right as you see how hard and I went oh you know I have a completely different opinion of him and it was just you know you're sort of prejudices you every kid rock\n... having a kid and is it uh but uh\nFor um you know yesterday again this is not I'm not going to spend five hours\nAre going over the economic and political philosophy of Kanye West hold on let me tell staff had guys or cancel all that stuff that I wrote down for the next ... yeah exactly uh but because because you don't need to go that far all you need to do is he likes Trump\nTherefore to the left he's not a black he's not truly black ... while the other about me alive so not meal yeah you know and and that's\nBut that's the backward thinking that's that's that's right that's the bigotry\nAnd in tolerance of the left today it's the racist mindset\n\nTo the point where you know coming up with the analogy the Trump is the master and Tanya is the slave ... you're going to really try to convince America of that you're gonna you're going to try to convince a millennials\nThat you're right\nThat was on the west in his mind views himself as a slave really now\nBut this is this is the what's great is that they're actually proving comedy a write in there from their behavior this is Ben and it\nSo maybe we will spend some time talking to both the accuracy of the ideology of God yeah he was an amazing you know in the past talking\nAbout you know why can't someone just a decide they you know or or for whatever reason a you know they why can't they think this way\nDoes it matter who they are we've been saying that for no ages and it doesn't matter who they are we we talk about um Hollywood conservatives\nAnd you and I both know some that and I haven't seen where they've come out you know and you know on back in the day on Jay Leno or or whatever over the years um uh and and claim to be a conservative some have\n[noise]\nBut I I Know a a couple that that are have not uh as far as I Know and so I'm not going to you know I'm I'm not going to talk about who they are in it that really doesn't mean anything or it's just the fact that they know James Woods has set it that's why he better just\nTo hang it up yet you hung a and and and\nRetire and go play some poker if he's pretty good at that but um and and be able to issue his opinion than to have to walk on eggshells around people 'cause he wasn't going to get hired you know he knows that that more and more you're not going to get hired\nUm Kelsey grammar talked about it openly on the Tonight Show one time\nJust said look I mean you can be a conservative in Hollywood and expect you were going to be treated the same I'm paraphrasing but that that was his message on that night and it's true well why is that\nThe side that preaches tolerance has none no\nAnd that's that's what you saw yesterday so we'll get to more of that coming up your latest election polls are Arnold apologizes for using the phrase girly man\nYeah listen I we still talk about Caitlin 'cause I don't know where you're going with this I just want everyone to know that I'm Sorry about that I Do a double sided lots of groping

J. play ... and uh you know as\nAs I've always said OJ was one of my boyhood heroes ... was um and uh I never saw anybody accelerate like O. J. but\nI don't think I've ever seen anybody have the kind of moves that Barry Sanders had when he played for Detroit but\nHis his career was a a a limited Gail Sayers also was just a a superb running back there's been a ton of good running backs out there I don't think anybody had the power what what differentiated Jim Brown was\nHe just had the power go back and watch some of the old films of Jim Brown I mean walking over ... over linebackers bigger than him mhm and and just having incredibly now idiot power but he had great balance\nDidn't have the speed I don't believe or the acceleration of an OJ or very Sanders and but he had the power nobody I don't think anybody ever came close to the power that he had but\nThat being said Jim rounds old Jim Brown is not a part of popular culture today\nA you ask the average uh a a thirty year old if they know who Jim Brown is bearing on what you're talking about that the the the old guy that you know they might remember the fact that you know he has worked with gangs before mhm uh you know Jim Brown comes into\nThe substance issue huge for anybody who is paid attention over the last Thirty years as to what he's been involved with a Jim Brown is not part of popular culture today with the youth and millennials like Kanye West is the left is scared to death of Kanye West because he smack in the middle\nOf the the culture that is expected by the elite liberals to be a liberal supporter mhm he cannot\nHave a different opinion and if he does have a different opinion than Trump is exploiting the mental issues\nThe Kanye West had nobody was talking about mental issues economy was when he when you know he was up the award show where they know on the ... no no no uh nobody in all up was talking about his ah you know his mental state when I he said that uh George Bush a hates all black people because of Katrina didn't seem right\nAll the transportation nation dot coms trucking shows and videos on demand so you can watch whenever you want\nOh you have to do starting up and start watching plus three that perfect I'm going to go check out transportation nation dot com right now\nIf you're a parent to listen closely to the voices of meningitis\nOn Tuesday that he was sick ... she was gone\nI was there for my son's first press and his last name section spread so fast David got it when he was there was only Feiler last hangers kitten Lucy needs so fast in\nMy life 'cause I thought it was in my life and how it was an out and not just a single day she was on my son did not have to die the role of a parent is to protect parents need to know and you know reaching and genes are at greater and talk to your child's health care provider and we are the voices of meningitis\nJoined school nurses and families nationwide by adding your voice miniature taco meningitis may be rare but it's often devastating you can help prevent him get pre teens and teen vaccinated\nThe national association of school nurses or does you to talk to your child's school nurse or health care provider and visit voices have meningitis dot org\nOn Tuesday thank you my sick on Wednesday she was gone\nI went there and my son's first breath and his last the infection spread so fast David got it when he was there\nWas only finance new to now there is something they can do ... and ... are at greater ranch\nSchool nurses nationwide urge you to listen to the voices of meningitis get pre teens and teen vaccinated against this rare but serious disease\nTo learn more voices have meningitis dot org\nI'm In the car next to you on the highway I sit in front of you on a bus I'm One out of every six Americans and I'm struggling with hunger\nThis isn't an uncontrollable epidemic\nThere's enough food in this country to feed every hungry person\nPlease visit Feeding America dot org today and find your local food bank\nEvery dollar you donate helps provide seven meals for those around you quietly struggling with hunger together we're Feeding America\n...

... point out the fact that nobody is talking about the fact that Kanye West is from Chicago which is a one of the places that in Iran very poorly by the Democrats right now\nAnd that may be a motivation or its point of view um I also want to make the point that I think they're upset with the fact that I'm like you said he's irrelevant figure in today's society with the younger crowd yeah especially those\nIn the range that they cannot reach which are those people that are right at the age\nOf being able to vote but don't care enough to pay attention to the politics or the man show was real dark out right yeah well um is able to reach these people in ways that they will listen to you they will too\nLike you guys are talking about his lyrics I'm a young African American man and I'm I've grown up around a lot of African American people who\nHave grown up with the mentality that Democrats are good and Republicans are bad\nAnd um myself I like to take things from whatever point of view I see as right I Know the difference between right and wrong for me that's the boss logical way to go and I think that it's the same thing with Kanye West teach these things that I write it's these things that are wrong\nAnd he's able to articulate it in ways that people who are not listening are going to pay attention to this these socialist who are on social media constantly\nI got to pay attention to that so uh the leftist just upset because\nTrump is when\nAh you know thanks so much I think you bring up some really great points yeah you're talking about a ... one of the things that is terrifying to the the Democrats and uh again you know there we've said this before they believe that the people to both of them are stupid mhm that they don't pay attention to the issues Jonathan Gruber set it on health care\nWell so the whole Taylor Swift story early ... earlier this week\nThe left basically promoting the daylights out of that we know it was on a ... and Fox News and everything else but really the left\nLoves that kind of behavior when someone you know like a Taylor Swift comes out and tells people to vote Democrat but that's further proof that unique Taylor Swift to tell you how to vote and\nIf she had said Trump [noise] they would have shredded her [noise]\nOh yeah and so that's you know that's what this if if if you say the other side there is something

... in it or you look at the dynamics of of that situation where you have producers here in the U.S or that\nHave their cost their their raw materials costs going up a PG for example but then of course the cells that are lost in the exports\nAre from the retaliatory tariffs from\nThe other side and and then the dynamics of the pricing\nSo you want the the product from wherever it is outside

fifty billion dollar trade deficit right that this ... this isn't going to do it there were little winds here or there\nThe problem with the the new trade deal as we said that will be a long term problem is and the president used it as a victory is raising the cost or to buy a car in Mexico the United states\nAnd Canada making it more expensive to produce the car\nTherefore making it more expensive to buy a car and making it\nLess likely that the president one of the president's number one goal which is to be able to produce products here and sell them overseas has just been flushed down the toilet because\nIt's going to be more expensive to manufacture vehicles here which is exactly the opposite if you wish to sell them overseas right it's\nThe one thing they're ... they're a couple of things but it's really the one major thing where I had no idea where the president stands on it\nAs we know he has changed his mind on he'll change his mind on on trade in a week they'll go from as he did one for me in a complete protection is just sounded like a total free trader I've no idea where he really stands I Do know though that\nIn this in the the uh trade deal formerly known as NAFTA that he viewed what he did to raise the price of buying a car and producing a car in North America\nHe put that as as his number one victory mhm which we have said that's what drives us crazy that's why we're tariffs babies [laughter]\nThe original ... the original Tara babies as the president said now you know something we you know we laughed at it I Wonder how many farmers were laughing at\nThat comment so well because the ... you know he talks about protecting the farmers in the move on ethanol which was not a mandate and likely will have little if any impact because the the the the the fuel producers don't don't want it they don't want the higher blend\nThe it it may sound like a good deal to be able to uh sell a Fifteen in the summer first of all here comes the lawsuit here comes a lawsuit here comes a lawsuit um but it will the but even because at the refinery level you don't have to do the special summer blend but when there's no market for it\nThan there would be a ... a glut of the product\nAnd for the consumer that temporarily my might be a good thing but the point is we're not going to get to eat Fifteen with out a mandate and he knows politically outside of the corn belt you can't get that done it too so but\nAppeasing farmers and and using that politically on on the ah on the tariffs\nAnd then they came back and said well we're going to give you billions of dollars to help you which you just admitted it's hurting them to that extent and they came back and said that's a tiny number compared to what we're what we're losing\nAnd the fact that we're losing the ability to be in that supply chain in once we lose that and we're not dependable in that world supply chain they're going to go somewhere else so it's not just well the tariffs hurt us until they were lifted it's the fact that we may never get back in those markets again because\nThese countries don't know when you'll use national emergency or trade deal\nYou know or or the the the fact of of ah the we need to get a you know a new trade deal or whatever\nTo to uh to to terrify\nYou're not an double anymore you're not a consistent supply chain exactly and that is a problem that the you have but ah you know we noticed that you know it was obvious the president used the greatest victory and that's the weird thing on trade to begin with countries always talk about their trade victories\nAnd their trade victories were always when their citizens have to pay more money for goods and services but we don't know how that's a victory\nRight we can't figure that one out here's one thing or to media asked that question\nMhm\nYeah I mean bands at when when you look at it and you know you you talk about the supply chain Canada saying you know or Mexico saying they're going to go to Canada and work out a deal you know for pork whereas we call it Canadian Bacon and the when they set up that supply chain if they're happy with that agreement why do they go back to us for\n\nWhat would they are with any of those products from a domestic producer if you believe that the government is going to step in and disrupt that process then you're going to make another long term deal elsewhere with someone else but we said this during the you know\nThe um during the permit tore them after the uh ... when when the Gulf spill happened\nThe BP thing that\nThat whole thing where you had companies the producers from uh the U.S saying well we can you know go somewhere else if we're going to do offshore drilling and you're not going to give us our permit back you know we can go somewhere else you don't just make that decision\nShort term right\nAnd so you're you're going to have to make long term plans because you can't deal with you know the the shift in policy or you know on a ... at the staff of finger\nAnd and frankly the\nEthanol thing has become you know the for the ethanol farmers that's one thing but you look at the entire farming community and I'm Talking to political you know support if they're hurt going into and and this is what we haven't been able to gauge\nYou go to Iowa\nI mean and for those people that the New York times I'm listening when you go to Iowa let me describe before Iowa is is the state in the middle of the country\n\nBut when you go there it is all connected to farming just like Texas' oil directly or indirectly I mean that is\nThe driver there when you go to the to the the farm belt\nThat's everything what's the impact right now of terrorists politically votes for Republicans and in twenty twenty ... at the mid term this year and in twenty twenty for the president and his reelection because keep in mind\nThey may support Republicans who aren't on board for terrorists this time and twenty Eighteen at the midterms are they going to support the president who owns it completely if it's still ongoing in twenty twenty\nSurprised by what happened the last couple of days you know you and I've talked about it but and we said look the big terrorists were hit\nTwenty eight mhm so I'm not surprised that when you look at you know steel and aluminum and how they have skyrocketed since the beginning of the year right and we said look eventually it's going to be a point where the market's going to say look you're raising prices too ... too much and when the terrorists went into effect on September twenty

taking a look at the uh overnight a markets and a globally and it looks like a against being a down too as well around the around the world how long lived\nIs that it is the president's a trip as he announced on a Thursday morning it was going to try and go into China\nMhm right so how long is a I guess this going to to last that the market you what you're looking at his earnings reports PV jeez ten percent drop was based on what happened to them and the third quarter in that situation has not changed at this point\nOr because they they talked about three dynamics there and that's raw materials a freight uh and and the and oil costs\nUm\nIf the president gets to China they get a deal done on terrorists\nI was just a it was just\nSomething it at Business Insider talking about the uh what is going on right now with a you know with trying to their exports to the U.S continue\nFor the most part even with the terrorists in place they said they're still moderately strong well it doesn't change the the trade deficit\nRight a scenario is is not likely to change it wasn't going to change with the new NAFTA you know so that that thing is kind of off the table\nBut with China you have a couple of concerns the the very valid concern is the intellectual property consider mhm that's the real thing that the president asked to address I mean the terrorists\nBeing is going to have to be remedied but\nIt's going to they're going to have to there's going to have to be and it's not just pressure from the U.S when the ... when the president announced that he was going to or it was announced that the\nPresident would be going to China to sit down with a she in China well that's we need everybody at that table on our side of the table the rest of the world needs to be in China's face saying\nThis can't happen anymore you got to play by the rules they\nBecause of the ... if you look at the the steel and aluminum tariffs if those are in place\nLong term you're going to see\nYou're going to see an adjustment on the stock market the stock market is the least of your concerns ... the reason it's adjusting as because\nThings are becoming more expensive like you mentioned uh the fed with interest rates are the the you know I agree or disagree the sanctions on Iran is is causing a lot of the global uh oil prices to to go up\nOn the Saudis have some play in that to us and we'll see if they ramp up production and and and aren't able and change that and it is an incentive\nUh uh again because it makes it more profitable for American producer yes and and were eventually going to get to that point I Believe\nI well it depends on who's in Washington but I Believe we will get to the point of self sufficiency where you know we can produce for the United states and export at the same time which is which would be a great point a to a to get to we're not there yet but as we\nThe ... really one of the most under reported stories\nOf the entire year ...

Medicare for all ... well then you're going to destroy the system for old people oh sure yeah I went whoa\nI mean that was a group that was a great political response all the ... primary product from

up for them\nOr not for not not for the rest of America it was set up specifically for them you do it you heard old people walk that was well and I thought that was a great political\nAge I think it's a great response remember when when they were talking about slowing the rate of ...\nThis was Paul Ryan slowing the rate of growth of Medicare they were ah they depicted him and ads as wanting to kill old people but which side is it that says oh people should go home and die\nWe're not gonna you know afford all the technology and medications were going to send you home so you can die that was Robert rice ... almost verbatim what he told Berkeley years ago and the former president Brock Obama again saying the same thing\nThey don't care about the fact that\nElderly people will suffer if you if you give Medicare for all first of all you can't pay for it but I imagine you could pay for even part\nOr half of it again pure fantasy\nBut what would happen ultimately because you can't afford it it is going to affect the benefits of the ...\nAnd\nThere's ... there's no way to debate that the question is does elect care about field\nWell Brock Obama and and Robert Reich ... one of his advisors a and a labor secretary for Clinton\nKnow old people should go home and die\n\nThat's the way they thought so maybe they don't care I don't think they do but a Schumer needs to say it right\nWe we found out that civility is something that the mainstream now the Democratic party has rejected ...\nHow did you see the bad track from Eric Holder yesterday on Twitter right well obviously that's not what I meant oh he just got blasted then why did you say why did why did you put it that why did you say kick\nWhat's the difference to drink kick and punch you don't use the language if you don't mean it oh it was I'm telling you it was just beautiful we found that out the other thing we found out this week what did we learn from the left we're doomed ... from the un we're doomed\nBecause of climate change we're doomed told you some of the response\nThis from the Daily Caller does University of St Thomas thermal science professor John Abraham actually believe Florida Panhandle residents deserve to get hit by the catastrophic hurricane for electing climate deniers\nVictims of hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers read the headline an article by Abraham published in the guardian on Thursday elections have consequences denying sciences consequences where reaping what we saw Saddam had re reads\nAll right so we've heard that we've heard because you've elected Republicans and you've or like the Trump that these hurricanes are happening\n\nOr Los Angeles times wrote this quote the report of the un report serves as a stark reminder of President Trump's status\nA global outlier in terms of climate change Trump has rejected the twenty Fifteen Paris Agreement signed by a hundred and Ninety five nations to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions exposing skepticism about human caused climate change and vowed to increase coal burning end up quote\nBut\nAs the more rights in an op ed piece of the New York post who is the political party who is the country and who under what President\nHas reduced greenhouse gas emissions but most when it comes to the substance who has actually reduced greenhouse gas emissions who is number one was a candidate nope no nope Germany nope Australia nope France no\nThe one country that pulled out of the phony Paris climate accord reduces carbon emissions by half a percent the most of all major countries in the world so the rest of the ah the rest of the countries are joining groups\nUnited States has now we're not going to join the groups because they're signing up there because there's going to there's they're signing things were actually doing things and why what's the main reason why the United states has done it fracking\nRacking fracking fracking fracking cracking fracking fracking fracking\nSo the people that actually voted in a way\nTo get the substance of how we go after our energy that actually voted\nCalled the policies that made it so we can produce energy\nWith lower greenhouse gas emissions which has nothing to do was signing the international agreement but everybody is cheating on and not getting to the levels that they say they're going to get to in fact the United states blows them away\nThe people that actually do the job and get the job done that\nAre viewed as the people that are destroying the world where all the scientific evidence shows you that they are not\n\nThat's where we're at today\nBy the way the number two nation in the world and not a a big nation but the number two nation in terms of reducing uh they're they're a greenhouse gases and ah and such Venezuela\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter] [laughter]\nSo there you go and um it's a it is but but that really is the insanity here's here's what I Wonder\nAre they are they getting through to the generations beyond this we know that the loudest of the left or the far left and the in your face left\nOr the um the protest or the go direct approach by the left we know that they're you know not only buying the hype helping create the hype but I mean\nOn on all these issues that the left has been trying to sell\nLike global warming the generation behind them\nAre ... you see sometimes indications that they're greater critical thinkers anecdotally mhm my my granddaughter's\nUm and and I I Try and step back and take my bias away you know and look at the facts you know in that situation as I assessed their generation the oldest of which\nIs a is Thirteen um and then there I have to twelve year olds as well so you know those those early teens that's when you start forming right opinions but you are very curious about how the world works and all of that\nAnd and so I I asked them questions about their friends you know it just about behavior okay so you know I like social media is not is very different for them\nTwitter and Facebook not even on the radar not even but also how things are presented to them you know one one of my granddaughters a few years ago it was\nA it was ... they were they were showing a video on nine eleven\nAnd they had put sad music to it\nAnd then she asked me that following week and when she was at the house but what do you think of that and I said well I don't know she goes to have you ever heard the song and she named the song they were using and I said yeah yeah yeah she said I said she goes I don't know why they did that and I said well why do you think they did that she goes to manipulate my feelings\n\nAnd something that was already set\nThat just one observation again forget the fact that it's my granddaughter ... it was a ... or critical thinking but it was critical thinking about manipulation and and the left has been all about manipulation and politically both sides are\nBut is that next generation and we've

I don't know if there will be a bigger issue\nThat that will come out in the in in the next few weeks in popular culture that will reach everybody Kanye West ah [laughter] I'm Sorry just throw that out\nI I I just I don't know uh you know the the the president the president tweeting and the president coming out with outrageous comments to me doesn't drive anything anymore\nI don't I don't think it it I don't think it\nIn flames anybody knew or pleases anybody new\nIt's going to and find the same people and it's going to make the people that love when he when he does that\nStill love him but it's not going to change what's it think about it who can in this day and age how can tend to twelve percent possibly be undecided and ... and and most definitely be going to the polls in November\nYeah it's really it's only when you think about that here's something else interesting looking at the end and it's just\nOne small indicator it's a small movement but I find it interesting looking at our sci fi and the map for the house race or the house races\nSo Republicans took one from the Democrats\nI haven't figured out which one it is but it was at two o five Democrats\nIn other words likely very likely Democrats and one Ninety eight for Republicans it's now too old for for Democrats one Ninety nine for Republicans and the center of the toss up\nDistrict still remains at thirty two to yes\nI Would love to see what's district that was that that that that shifted and I and again not from toss up\nBut from the Democrats so I'll go back and look at it I I have no idea um but it is interesting so you but you do look at those started to keep in mind to Eighteen is the number the magic number a for a majority right so right now\nDrew I finally got around their VP round and the the\nWay that was my own age\nFinally earning round envy piece takes the termination so getting into college I've got what he said so to you\nKnow how to go that far from them we should be doing right now to the camera college faculty staff now had gone by the American Council on education foundation at cancer [noise]\nNews talk six thirty and Ninety nine seven FM W. B. R. O. [noise]\n\nInternet radio he is currently and an Jerry ... eight six six Ninety red eyes let us go to Tom in Washington Tom welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show\nIs rose how how's it going out they're fantastic how are you\nAll right yeah the direction to go and what I go to the water where would I go to vote is going to be the restoration of some show some some semblance of due process and the court of public opinion there's got to have to be arraigned in show no\nAnd I think that's the Republican direction yeah\nThat's a great read by though yeah\nNo I think it's a great point is that you say that you know the the the court of public opinion or isn't the final determination of of uh of of anything and and the court of public opinion we're talking about on the left side of of of a public opinion and it has to be it has to be due process that's ... that's a\nYou know that that that's a great point that comes from the capital here it's\nYeah I I think it is and and people apply it uh\nIt based on their their own life you know our ... our audience a and a ... and new sounds and and and people who do we do we're we're in the thick of it we're always immersed in it\nBut most people the average American is not but if they're still politically active in terms of voting they look at it and say okay\nThis this is you know insanity the fact that it went this way they don't uh apply the left believes that they apply their feelings directly to it in their feelings sleep that is the case for some\nBut most Americans look at it practically speaking and going you know this is a big deal to vote to be able to vote is a big deal and if they are to the point where they are you know in that likely voter category this is why those poll start to shape up the way they do and that's why you're likely voter gives you a better read but\nThey look at that and go you know it's a big deal on election day to get up and go cast my vote you know I Know people show up and they're driven by\nYou know a slogan they're driven by whatever imagery but we can't forget the people that take it very serious they consider things they may not be immersed in it every day like we are for whatever reason\nBut they will show up and they make an informed decision and often it is a reaction Chuck Todd on a ... and and Chuck Todd was saying well why do people get it wrong and and say twenty sixteen was a referendum on Trump but it really was a referendum on Hillary\nThat was a small part of it what what Chuck Todd as we're getting here because they are discussing the polls in the mid term is is about you know the house in the sand\nAnd not a presidential election and his point what he was implying that Hillary's not here to be the the bad guy right\nWell what\nChuck is forgetting is the real facts of how the Republicans in districts all over America\nOutperformed Trump and that it wasn't a referendum on Hillary it was a referendum on the left ... you know that that's a great point of the other point brought by the color of their ... and I think you can't underestimate this is that Americans may not know the three branches of government right\nOr you know and and that's what the polls show Seventy five percent of Americans roughly could not tell you all three branches of government they might know one or two or they do zero but they couldn't tell you all three as you said you need to know all three to understand how the government actually works they may not be able to tell you the freedoms in the first amendment but think about when it comes to due process\nThink about since Perry Mason let's go through all the lawyer shows that have been that had been on TV and Donald salt [laughter] well a lot of well I'll Try I'll drop Perry Mason I'll throw matlock I'll throw

is enough\nIf you actually ask them off the record if they believe that they would tell you know why that is that is just think about that in not just in the courtroom if you've ever been in a jury but it is they're completely in our popular culture shots from the greater does on ... and it's\nGreat point because you don't have to get into the details of how legislation worked for no the three branches of government help but in pop culture we got we got those and yes they are simple lessons for the simple lesson can be enough to recognize when the process\nIs being distorted for they

S. P. S. that has not publicly disclosed\nAmazon declined to comment on the price hikes and the postal service declined to answer questions\nAny potential impact on the company the increases for partial select were steeper than in previous previous years us the best of the new rates are result of a regular review process and are set to take effect on January twenty seven subject to approval from the postal Regulatory Commission alright\nA Trump has repeatedly allege that Amazon is to blame for the postal services financial woes\nAnd accuses the e commerce giant ripping off the agency and treating it like a delivery boy the president created a special task force in April to examine the postal services business model sparking speculation that he would use it to raise shipping rates on Amazon ...\nA Trump equates Amazon with the Washington Post which is owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and as a target of Trump's anger about media coverage\nThere you go from this is from political but uh\nThen again they have a long term deal with them they're not affected by it\n[noise] [noise] right if that if that you know the pricing deal is in place and and look at what these us has done not ah I I mean just in general if you talk about his a\nSupply chain his delivery ... a chain a from a to B a to Z I guess it was clear that that when he\nStarted making large purchases on his freight company that he was going to be doing more of his own delivery and so\nWhile he can't do it all up because you have I don't know I don't know what\nThe even what the numbers in terms of overall numbers of sellers on Amazon\nThe point being is that there are things coming from all over the world that are sold on Amazon and so it would be impossible for although ... has done other things [laughter] that people didn't see coming uh I don't think any time soon he will have he will control completely has on his own ...\nUh but he is doing that more and more and that was to shut out more and more of the the the um FedEx and UPS\nDelivery that was costing him more and more the costing the consumer more and more\nAnd he said this is not about shutting out the little guy if in fact is about creating more opportunity for the little guy and now they they you can go out and get your own local delivery uh buy your own local delivery a set up for a for Amazon and by the vans and everything else\nAnd be a part of that and and there's opportunity there it was about creating a ah basically the ... the ability or more and more to control pricing to keep prices low on Amazon according to ... he\nThe U.
