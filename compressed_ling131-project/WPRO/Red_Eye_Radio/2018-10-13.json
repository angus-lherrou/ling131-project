eight that was then this is now we worry about ... the my favorite robot and Bob has a book university near about ... but was in these last days it's going to say smoke can you update us by\nYeah I should point out that the universe in the mirror\nIs now available in a book and it's you know it has an update includes the are the two thousand nine repair and I predicted this kind of stuff happening that book um NASA today released an update on their effort to bring up a lot of safe mode of back into full operation the key here is that they have a gyroscope\nThat their water and backup gyroscope they've lost by transcripts of the last six seven years since last repair mission that down to four gyroscope so\nThey they were down to four gyroscope say last one\nAnd so the backup gyroscope is going to bring be brought up into line if you have three gyroscope she got three dimension no control and you can point the telescope precisely will they brought up the back back up and it didn't function properly so that leaves them only to working a charter school they're trying to figure out what's wrong with that one bad gyroscope\nThough the backup gyroscope but here's the bottom line they still don't have an answer to that but if they cannot get that job if they can get it fixed just a a Hubble is now they've said they got to go back to full operations as before but if they can't get that fixed they're going to drop down to one gyroscope load\nWhich means they will be able to do science\nBut they will not be able to take the same kind of sharp pictures they've been doing for\n'em twenty five years we will basically have lost ... capability and we will no longer be able to see the sky with sharp vision as we have for the last twenty five years it's going to go back to what it was like\nBefore Hubble when we actually were blind to strongest by now I Know strongest talk about it that the optics and these new big giant telescopes but they can't do what Hubble does and they will we have limitations\nHigher mood so good news here ... is a enjoying itself in orbit around ... and what his mascot\nWell OK mascot was one of those in any land hopper bounces they sent down last week mascot was his that was a German French designed mostly German it was just it was all box set down hits the ground bounces a bunch of times once it's settled that has a little robot arm that allows it to push it up and\nA jump a few more times it only had batteries for about sixteen hours function at work that Seventeen hours it takes three hops and to and this week they released images showing where it traveled on the surface I got that posted on behind the black sea can see where traveled took a lot of close up images and the bottom line is that what it found\nIs that this surface is crazy than expected there is absolutely no flat spot on the surface everything is apples and rocks\nAnd that might tell us why this week the high a boost that team announced that they are to blame the landing in the pie a boost to until January they were going to do it later this month that the laying into later January and they said the reason is because the surface of the\nOf our youth group is so Boulder strewn that they don't have any flat spots anyway and they don't want to take a risk and so what they're going to do is spend more time doing observations from a audit\nAnd uh to do a much closer to study the surface to try to figure out if they can get down to a spot that will have less risks that that's what we\nAnd right now Bush or John\nQuickly Bob a sign updated anything irregular in this in the ... were headed towards minimal anything Iraq you know\nWe are in minimum child and that may be the entire irregular story here because we're not really supposed to didn't minimum for at least another year and we're in minimum there's no doubt about minimum began about ... months ago and is the the number of sunspots is\nHis place enough in men about we are at in ... in the middle of the points you know the point where it's absolute lowest but we're in minimum right now and this means that this was a very short but we sell a cycle that just ended and that is unusual they usually if that week they are\nUm that long and this one was weak and short\nAnd uh once again in a less soul a sunspot activity usually is associated with colder climates on the earth and lo and behold we had colder climates the last decade or so or the so called hiatus and they call the warming is pronounced and real and there's no question to that\nAnd so uh that's what we stand right now what is going to happen in the future you don't know for ... for ... this is really\nAbout the next cycle will bring us is pretty exciting because it might be a ... a ... or not the solar minimum that is not big put pegs Athens or we could be ... a a grab minimum and if we enter a grand minimum this will be really an exciting thing\nFor ... for scientists all the science and they've seen what what the kind of insurance you got space right now\nAt this is that what we don't really understand why these things happen we understand vaguely what causes them but why they vary and change and why the sun has a cycle is not\nReally understood ... how the dynamo on this on the magnetic field really produces this stuff why it changes so having a grand minimum here would really

the polls have shown that\nDemocrats may they just wish to ignore it because what they want now is more important than anything it is about their day to day politics\nAnd so I think it's just important just a little nit picking their and then I Move on food goes ... do you mean you never happy with anything no men were maybe ... maybe we're a little bit more content but we understand because we've been doing this for such a long time is just one battle and it's not over the next battles in a couple of weeks well it's a couple\nOf things the um the the whole idea of of this there are two parts of this the political part of it and the question is is a greater motivator a greater motivator for the right or greater motivator for the Web or a greater motivator for the center\nYou know the left a you know says there are since Saturday evening while we're more motor ... motivated now well that's what the press will have you believe we'll see about that\nUm will look at early voter turnout as we always do\nBut really even with the right I Know I Know the motivation on the right is there we know that so that's not going to go away\nOr the motivation in the middle that's the question that's where you win the election and so you look at the undecideds and how many of the key races right now are undecided or have a great number\nUndecided or certainly to the extent that they can throw that election one way or the other that group going one way or the other end turnout is is is the key so beyond that the win at the highest court remains to be seen\nBecause we have to go back to chief justice Roberts twice ... rewriting Obamacare for the from the bench it is a victory and that the left did not get their way and their attempt to destroy the process I'm certainly\nThey\nThey distorted the process will see what happens to it next time there is a a an opening on the high court and if this president is still president ah how that goes but ultimately\nNow you're going to have to wait and see what what Kavanaugh's does on the bench what effect the ultimately has and that won't be seen for years and so the when there is that\nIt's an odds game as we have been saying for for many years going back to Andrew Breitbart ... and his comments to us during the twenty twelve race and\nTalking about how important the Supreme Court was when we asked the question why should we support or should conservative support\nA moderate like Romney at the time for for president and his answer was SCOTUS Andrew Breitbart censor was very clear and it is an odds game because you can support a John Roberts uh Neil Gorsuch\nOr Brett Kavanaugh and through all of it you still may not get those decisions you think you're going to get its always intriguing but sometimes it's disappointing and how they decide and we'll again we won't be able to see that effect\nOr if that's going to happen or for many years ultimately on the court there there will be cases where his decision will be key in those cases but we'll see how he decides them and and what his thinking is in those opinions as they come across\nRight I mean if what what it's about ... if you look at his judicial history I Would say that\nAre most likely I'll agree with eighty percent of what he may be eighty five to Ninety I don't know ... between eighty and Ninety percent all agree\nI'm a ... with him you know we we talk about a true construction as some and by the way when we talk about ... what was that the or was it the location device\nWas at the location of ice on the cars are about ... what\nWas the case that everybody has a cell tower case was ... there for everybody where everybody said we're we're especially the never Trump first came out and said see you didn't you see he sided with all the liberals [noise] excuse me you didn't get your judge mhm\nAnd then we had to point out as many other people did no uh actually on that particular case it was the liberals on the court uh and and the Gorsuch that actually used the Scalia ruling\nA you know Scalia was probably the true with the the most construction as judge of of my lifetime paying attention to what the Supreme Court\nHas a has a has has done\nClarence Thomas always is not always the construction it right\nClarence Thomas will a judge based on at times based on what he views as a conservative win for the day right that's not what I'm looking for I'm never looked for that I Want that's up for the legislature to decide to me is these are all constitutional issues I Want judges look at the Constitution's say does it say that\nNo well that's not up to me to put that in\nDon't bend the constitution or straight from the constitution in order to fit your political agenda\nRight so I'd say ... I'd say if I look at a a a a Clarence Thomas he's probably ... ah Scalia was almost Ninety nine probably Ninety nine percent\nJust doing it off the top of my head Clarence Thomas probably somewhere between Ninety and Ninety five percent ... depending on depending on the year [laughter] yeah and and what I'm hoping is that you have a\nA you know you have a cabin on that ah would get to the Ninety percent level at least ah for me on on the on on the important cases I'll be very pleased if it's greater than that but again nobody expected Roberts to rewrite Obamacare right do you\n... and and then you look at some of his other cases you're like Oh absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right so\nI'm a again this to me was about\nThe greatest thing that came out of this besides getting a ... Supreme Court justice that isn't\nA a roof gator ... Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the fact that you and I talked about that the left has made it very clear what they want\nA but I don't think that the Republican Party or I think a lot of\nConservatives knew this was this was a a part of who they were I don't think a lot of the moderates in the Republican Party fought they they were\nA and I will say some of the moderates that were never Trump or some of the conservatives that were never Trump hers but to see it in action and to see\nThem look to see the debate points that they were bringing up\nTo see what they want it done to see that they rejected the mindset of due process the mindset of a a presumption of innocence this stereotyping\nBut if they're convenience all women are to believe unless you're there was those type of woman over there and by the way to one of the stories I saw is that now Democrats are starting to blame white women for cabinet are being put in well wait a minute I thought women were always right\nRight and then I then they started a blaming of Eddie and the case if he well wait a minute\nThought the woman was women were always right right yeah yeah but that case of too many holes well that's the whole point that the\n... the so now we're just in a comparison of holes in a case right you are stating that and so they're all over the place and when it comes down to is\nThey're just trying to fit in argument to fit their narrative at the moment in order to get the judge in that will fulfill their liberal desires and a judge that will legislate for them they're all over the place on their opinions\nYes\nTheir opinions don't and their opinions on their goal post move all over the place right so to me it was the fact that you were able to see the left\nAnd them and not just the far left\nWhat you saw because we normally get calls where people will say well that's not the mainstream of the Democratic party what you saw\nOver the last two weeks was the main stream of the Democratic party in Washington DC the leadership of the Democratic party that reject due process under the law\nReject a presumption of innocence\nAnd we'll slander and the fame somebody's character\nWithout evidence to do so yeah\nI think a lot of I'll tell you I had a conversation with independent Bob yesterday boy he was renting he was the burn in my ear\nAh because ah as you said you know and and I talked about independent Bob for years and used to vote for Democrats he's sort of tell me how I can ever vote for democratic at ... however when I'm being told what white males thanks as always Ron and white men are always evil and women are always to be bullied because everybody knows that's not true right\n\nBut that's where they are so we'll get to that or by the way last year it was getting rid of the electoral college by the left we told you the next thing would be getting rid of the Senate they got there because of all this now ...

I. M. W. B. R. O.\n[noise] so\nThere you go read I radio [noise]\nAnd he is hurting hunting and I'm very McNamara eight six six Ninety or right I just want to note here ... uh and and let me point out something that that I just you know I I look at conservative media and I just say stop it\nAnd whether it was the you know in a drudge you know we know he's conservative but you basically just lift things but\nHe had the Taylor Swift story as the number one story half the day yesterday yeah and it's the number one story right now on Fox yeah All right nobody cares what she thinks no ... nobody cared a Taylor Swift things why do the editors at Fox News\nBelieve that she deserves the Taylor Swift comes out in support of tendency Democrats who cares ... before she said she won't speak on ... not ... who cares somebody gr nobody cares what she thinks\nThere's so many things that we can be doing as a as as as a media that are important and I'm not saying you don't put the you don't have the story somewhere ...\nYou know 'cause you could you get your story but it's been the number one story now for a few hours sitting there on as we go to a Monday with everything that's going on right right Taylor Swift as a story that they they put up there\nEven though ... story and you know him supporting Donald Trump is a Side Story it's notable and the different because you have\nA a mega hip hop star supporting Republican president who was aided by pretty much everybody else in his community and in in his profession so that's notable because it's not\nWhat a what he respects unique you know that the news just things that are unique and different right ... and ...\nAnd the thing is is that ultimately though the the endorsement\nDoesn't really do anything now sometimes you'll see a you know these mega endorsements come on come on board for an Obama but that wasn't what\nGot Obama to the White House the endorsements don't do anything except show that those celebrities are getting on the bandwagon\nA most often but you're not it doesn't matter who the celebrity is\nThat's not the influence with the with the people that's not the the real influence with real Americans they really don't care what celebrities have to say politically unless those celebrities are getting involved in politics and they're going to run for office that's that's the difference\nBut I just just a that was just a side comment there yeah so I just saw it in a way of saying okay let me when I woke up well you know it's funny when I when I went to sleep last night it was there when I when I woke up to come in the show\nIs there and I'm like All right enough\nIn our pre show meeting we were talking about it because Sunday we always I always measure of the day by the number of over the top\nBreaking news headlines that sometimes it's breaking news on an event on something that happened and it's actual breaking as often as breaking news breaking news Trump tweet that no that's not breaking news\nThe\nThe number of stories on Sunday dwindled down to just nothing I mean it was it was really well\nIt was down to Taylor Swift endorses Democrats that's what it was down to because here's what happened Saturday you had your vote Kavanaugh confirmed\nThe left is going to whine about it they're going to whine about it a little more on Sunday Morning and then as we predicted or as we told you it's really not a prediction\nBecause they are too predictable on the left\nAll the protestors go home and it's over you know you you still have some talking members of the house talking about in ...

sure you'll have some radicals on the left on Capitol Hill that will keep talking about it but it's not going to happen for a reason because there's nothing there it's the reason the confirmation vote went through and he was ultimately confirmed\nYou're not going to have them well we can move and we can do this it's those stories are given the same credibility that the Van Jones story was given when when when Van Jones is rolling up his sleeves and working in a grassroots effort to change their mind to elect tours no\nThat didn't happen in fact Hillary\nHad a net loss of life doors and Trump had a net gain after the election after the election\nBecause these people don't live in reality they don't look at the facts and anything they don't they don't care about the process they want you to believe that that the process is that they slap on their Superman tape and they're going to be a hero in a moment\nAnd it doesn't happen that way you had a situation in the cabinet confirmation

Ferguson case isn't\nWhen you had a when you had a a Eric Holder and you had the president giving their opinion on it when they didn't know what happened right and we said you can't be doing that just shows you don't believe in due process under the law you can't be indicted unless you know\nYou've got to take each case individually if you're not\nThen you don't believe in due process well we've seen this year the mindset of due process because what you did have her was a political trial yes uh it wasn't a civil trial it was in day it wasn't a a a a criminal trial by\nMany aspects of a real trial were there you are under oh mhm and you can be you can go to jail it was a legal setting it was illegal it's it's a legal maybe a political legal setting might not be a criminal\nOur lower civil trial but it was a trial where many of the enforcement of a trial a ... like when you testify if you commit perjury you can go to jail for that\nAnd they didn't believe in due process or under under the law they didn't believe in a presumption of innocence none of that matter to them\nThen we got to trumpeting the presidency and they didn't believe in the electoral college anymore now this one when you have a ... and this is this is going to pick up now because the oh wow we forgot the Senate\nOr that are now that the the the Senate has and we told you this was coming if you've been listening to show the last couple of years we told you the next thing they were going to try to get rid of wasn't the Senate\nWell if you don't want the Senate if you don't want the electoral college if you believe that the Supreme Court is a legislative branch and should be making up law when that was not their intent when you don't believe in the first amendment\nWhen you don't believe in the second amendment when you don't believe in due process under the law when you don't believe with a ... and the presumption\nOf innocence\nYou really don't believe in this country right you have no idea what the country's about and\nWe understand now on the show we believe that that the majority of our audience and the majority of conservatives understands the separation of powers we've talked about that a lot we've talked about how the majority of America though ... close to Seventy five percent does not\nBut if you understand the concept of the hour by camera legislature you understand why we have a house of representatives you understand why we have a set it you understand why Great Britain as a house of lords of the house of commons\nYou understand that the founding fathers of the United states they wanted a separation of powers the thing that they were most\nScared of was that a ... take care of their group a particular group of ... a a person a small\nGroup of people a particular kind of a legislature or a court or presidency\nThey were scared to death that power could be concentrated in one of those areas and they ... they were trying to avoid that more than anything because they had looked\nThe history of the world and seen\nHow authoritarianism works and they didn't want it and the by camera legislature was a compromise made by the Congress and when you look at it the house of representatives uh you have I think fifty three house members in California\nOnly one in Wyoming why bigger population and California fewer people in a ... in Wyoming\nBoth of two senators a that was done for a reason that was done sold the house would more represent the United states by population and by region but the Senate\nAnd Ellen ... and by the way the the reason that are you a are elected for two years so you're closer to the people in more accountable to the people if they wanted they believe that the\nHouse of representatives would be closer to mob rule than a Senate [laughter] [laughter] and but so they they but they wanted it they wanted the the the\nCongress to be closer to the people small areas you know of the country where you represented you know that area of the country and you had more power the state because if you had more population and a bigger state you were more representation in the house\nBut they also wanted in every state wanted the ability to have\nSome kind of equal employed so the big states could not rule over the little state\nYeah that was the reason right the reason the bill of rights exist the reason that we are and constitutional Republican not a direct democracy is why separation of powers and also protection of individual rights and protection of states' rights\nAnd that's why it was done and do things move slower yes\nBut founding fathers were worried so much about legislation moving slowly through\nThey preferred that then mob rule\nThe reason the electoral college that exist today is so you can't have Marlboro or you can have the big states not knowing what the future was going to be in this country where the big states would totally dominate in the executive branch mhm\nIt was all it was all thought up not to have the separation of powers so power cannot congregate in one area and as we said when it comes to the by camera legislature to give them to give the people one body which is the house\nAnd then the Senate which is to per state which is six years so they could be more long term looking at a country where they weren't voted in every single or every two years\nAnd the senators were more likely to look at what was best for the country and not just the region that the congressional membership\nOr represents I'm most\nRoom of I daresay that the vast majority of the left have no idea of\nI think most people I listen to our show do and understand you know everything that I said but I don't believe that the left understands that at all or cares to understand\nI don't think they care about it because what they want is again a and as they often engage in and fantasy they create in their mind a fantasy of what the nation should be\nI mean they create a in their mind a fantasy of what the what the government should be giving you every day so the makeup of that government needs to change to fit that fantasy most often they're okay with doing that they don't understand the process they don't care to understand the process\nThey don't care why it was set up this way and you know it's interesting\nBecause you look at what happened after Trump was elected and you had people on the left you know then that at at that point start talking about well we want our guns because not all but some on the left we want our guns because ah of the possibility of a tyrannical government\nHey welcome to the second amendment\nNow they're excuse ... pointed of course directly to this president but it was about the same idea basic idea of the second amendment and it's\nOften too little too late for the left they called for something something changes well we didn't know it was going to be that just one small example was Obamacare not that it was small but much smaller than of course changed through your way with the Senate completely we didn't know we were going to happen but we thought someone else was going to pay for it\nYeah well lesson learnt you start coming in and you start changing the very foundation of the constitution and they do believe this is this is really been the game all along\nYou know the the the whole um changing of the first amendment\nIsn't just about protecting their free speech because of the things they want to say and doing away with yours and we've talked about that battle but it's also doing away with the freedom of religion because your religion is bigoted\nIt it needs to go away completely because we disagree with it freedom of speech while we protect that when it's us it's our group talking\nWant you to be

I Know when the Republican base is motivate\n'em and they are quite motivated right now I I don't know\n... they're they're motivated and their unified when when I saw that what George W. Bush how many times and he called Collins and he called her numerous times during this whole process is George W. Bush ... to push for a Trump\nNominee mhm for for the Supreme Court decision not at everybody and I think one of the reasons that you not everybody is look we dealt with Trump for the last two years the people in the Republican Party that just can't stand and all of a sudden the last three weeks I woke up and went hoops\nHe is really not our enemy is really not our political enemy there may be some things that we don't like we don't like his tone way to like this we don't like it'd be exaggerates\nWe don't like when he doesn't tell the truth at times but he's a lot better than these insane people on the other side I Believe that that's what a lot of never Trump ... maybe not all but I think it's a ... well it's just that everybody except Bill Kristol\n[laughter] well [laughter] it's interesting [laughter] and that's not going to happen and possibly George Will uh but they're [laughter]\nWhat the the the the the idea\nYou look at it and I I find it kind of a interesting that the George W. Bush the same president who said well finding campaign finance law\nI Know parts of this are unconstitutional but I'll let the courts work it out [noise] called columns to make sure that the court gets it right um but but [laughter]\nThat I just the way it right by the way great observation I miss yeah well I I just uh you know but but certainly anyone from the Bush family doing anything to support a a Trump nominee is is definitely notable but it also goes beyond what we are ... well it goes right to what we will set and goes beyond the\nThe political aspect of this and removes it from the current White House because\nIt is about the long term makeup of the court and George W. Bush of course recognizing that I'm certain um as many of us do and it is also recognizing a indirectly and while we haven't and I would love to hear from the former president on this or asking the question\nOr if if it is the case with him we have pointed out it is the work that the president does now we can go back and forth on the comments made a the end the communication errors and and things even on the issues that we disagree with uh we we are the original tariffs babies [laughter] and then\nHave those discussions but we said from the beginning\nIt is the reason that you from the beginning so you know ultimately with your vote that it becomes well as it always is that buying their decision and then along the way regardless of whether or not and I saw somebody in my neighborhood with for Ted Cruz signs in their yard\nI thought you know not one not too\nBut a total of four they're really really voting for a group and so our time for science I'm ... and and I thought I thought to myself you know okay that's that's a that kind of enthusiasm\nUm even if we were to show that uh we don't do when we don't do endorsements because again as we mentioned earlier I don't believe they really do anything and tells it it might tell your audience which way you're going but there are the the point is is that we have the discussion\nOn the ideas and we believe that our audience and the rest of the country is smart enough to make their own decisions they may be willfully ignorant not our listeners but others may be willfully ignorant along the way they can make their decision\nOr you know or are there still capable of finding the information whether they choose to or not but ultimately it is about ah when that person is elected if I\nIf I'm campaigning for them if I'm doing a a volunteer work for them if I donate to their campaign I'm skills from day one going to watch them on on the issues on their work you judge them on the work and then of course the head of that work\nYou are back them in order to you know uh to to\nHave them do that work to keep them in place to do that work and you see a George W.

are we know that uh the left is very good at that but that's\nThat's why you can't find for a lot of them you really can't ... it's hard to I identify with them and and for most Americans that is\nYou know again the idea of a peaceful protest and standing up for what you believe people are quick to you know speak out in that if there is a pollster that calls whether it's kneeling in the NFL or any other as you know I Believe people should you know have the right to be heard\nBut how many people actually do it are active in protest most people are not the overwhelming majority or not and in fact if you didn't have a you know a Soros organization or any or the organization or that I mean we can go back to Ferguson\nYou know Ferguson they authorities they they told they were equipped to tell you look we've got people that aren't even from the state that have come here from a long ways away and that was clearly organized so when it comes down to how many people are actually willing to get out there to the extent that are driven\nAnd motivated to the extent that they would get out there if not part of some kind of organization\nI'm well we're we're the Facebook crowd opposed recalls oh yeah yeah we'll answer the poll a Facebook posts a day or a one click the like and we might share it we might read tweeted but the fact of the matter is is\nWhat is it I guess the question is what is it that really drives most Americans it's the everyday things in our lives and when we go back to the point that you brought up earlier we we talked about last week\nThat the majority of Americans it was somewhere around sixty percent that said well if there was nothing to cooperate the claims from this additional background check on Kavanaugh we that sixty percent saying he should be confirmed\nWell that's a big deal now it's not eighty percent it's not Ninety percent of sixty percent will win you a fuel elections and the point being is that we stepped\nBack from the insanity and the display the show that's being put on by the left here\nAnd the behavior by the left I mean I'm not saying it's not real I'm not saying people aren't going to react to it\nOr you know cirrhosis can can back whatever he wants to and people can act the way they want to and even on the Senate Judiciary committee they can say the most insane things if they believe it's going to give them political points well it just might in your state of Hawaii or California\nBut if you believe it's going to win the argument with the people of America you're flat out wrong\nAnd and that's why I think ... and and again this is a not a ... analysis of facts like this is just\nMy my gut feeling from\nWhat I what I've seen what I've heard the personal response that I just generally talk to people over the last uh a couple of weeks were more independent or non political who have paid attention to this and even though they do sympathize\nAnd because this is one of the things would just really ticked off a ton of people including a ton of women that I Know and that are that are more ... a more conservative was if you didn't believe her\nThan your for rape ...\nIf you don't believe in the rape if you don't believe in the rape allegation\nAlone without cooperating evidence if you don't absolutely believe the allegation\nThen you're as much a rapist yourself because you're enabling raping our society right well that ticked off a ton of women that I Know who just went wait a minute and I and I gave you the example two of my my buddy independent Bob\nWho said what what what's the thing that you always believed the woman you don't believe anything but evidence\nAnd to me that's where the Democrats jump the shark\nIs most of most Americans which is why you see the sixty percent and I bet you that sixty percent I bet you that other forty percent that said we don't want to confirm Kavanaugh had nothing to do was just the fact that they'd rather have a more liberal judge or if Trump pick somebody they don't want him but I guarantee\nYou that the majority of Americans looked at that process and said no you don't always believe the woman you have to have evidence you don't believe always believe the man you don't always believe a woman you don't always believe anybody gets the evidence that you make the judgment on\nAnd yeah the senators are accusing him of being a rapist

starts with the fact that the first case\nWas not credible yes so\nIf we're mirrors would have come out first that might've been the first one and the boards would have been viewed as not credible because\nShe couldn't remember the majority of the incident from that night except that was one hundred percent Brett Kavanaugh well and and I think\nThat's you you look at that are like the the and again it and the court of public opinion when when we're forming opinions but it is often foreign through information that as\nA given to us by the media and and the people that represent anyone making the claims but if you look at the winds team cases right mhm what do we we started everything started to be corroborated through through\nUh the well not just the number of people coming forward\nAnd others who said that they were aware of this kind of activity pretend ultimately his own from\nThat essentially had to pay schedule find schedule based on this kind of behavior if he were to be caught and and so\nThere were things where again if if if Ford made the claims and couldn't get anything to substantiate those planes that were nothing there and then Ramirez came forward and their war and then the third accuser came forward and she had things to back up her claim\nThat case would have been hard for the president or capital now to deny those cases collectively as one big situation that Kavanaugh would have been face\nBut that didn't happen\n... were we and the only ones that the only reason the Ford came out as because it was late yes ... and so that that it would not it was an all likelihood would have never come out if it had gone through the proper a judiciary a of\nWay if a probably a bright find something would have taken it immediately and taken into Grassley then they would have gone to the FBI to do a background check but everything would have been anonymous said what\nAnd what the what you just heard too was the failure to recognize how Ford's story changed\nYou know and and they talk about how the ... story change how the sweat story changed but look at how the Ford story change but but the point was on the political picture of being believable the scenario that was that was their\nStarted with a he said or she said he said\n\nWell then are we developing a pattern with the second and third no they fell apart and then we look back at the first one and realized it also changed and was falling apart\nWhat they what they were trying to point out here was\nShe could have been the victim the one person to centrally if she were to give him a Dr Ford or to have given her testimony and nothing else happened she could have been the one and it could have been at least plate or spend with out the evidence to back it up in a way that might have influenced votes\nBut because of the behavior and they mentioned\nCollins making the or the you know talking about having these role in her speech but it does that happen all of that happened because of what because of the left made it happen because the people sitting on this panel helped make it happen\nWhile you're in you're thinking about it too because of the narrative that every woman must be believed mhm and after Ford\nAnd again her story was like ... the story itself is incredible yet right being told that was our major talking point you've got to believe that the the alleged victim the alleged victim if a woman alleged victim must be believe we've seen the science we know it\nMust be ... and then you get a second and third\nThat also are not credible then you start destroying that narrative at that point right and I believe that's what they're probably saying even though they are the ones that plane you need to believe all the women all the time and they help even that you know they're they're yeah they're just you know even Chuck Todd is making the point well that really isn't true yeah\nWhat is the this is the version of a right after the twenty sixteen election or we need to go to the heartland and listen to their voices huh yeah that's basically what you see except for the fact\nThat it had greater substance en route and relevance to it I mean they ... they were right by the way uh in in in November twenty sixteen when they said that but there was no expectation that we're going to do just that in this case they're looking back on it and and recognizing\nAnd again they were part of carrying that narrative\nHelping to form those narratives along the way and then saying yeah well we shouldn't have played it that way it shouldn't have been played that way\nYou when when you look at well I have an anti a stormy Daniels' case that\nAnd no one\nAbsolutely no one is shocked that a playboy billionaire had an affair\nNo and\nAgain not shocked not surprised and also not politically motivated either way by it but the left creates these narratives they give out and out of the the the ability to introduce the credibility if you will from their perspective not ours to introduce the sweating to claim\nIt must be because he's got a legitimate claim and legal claim against Trump now there must be something that he's got was sweating it must be legit\nIt's if it's against Trump Trump so it would have to come out because there there must be some legitimacy to it even if there is that like I said the the only other point that I'd like to make is because this is what I Wonder and again this is a completely totally unfounded allegation without anything to back it up whatsoever but everybody will understand my point\nWhat is Joe Manchin have on Schumer [laughter] and if Einstein in and what does he ever had a Democrat leadership nobody's calling for a primary challenger to him in the next\nElection nobody has criticizing Joe mansion from the left at All right he's a Democrat wired their screams that he should be kicked out of the party where is that\nRight exactly how come all the Republicans are taking the flack from the the the left but the one Democrat who voted for Kavanaugh\nNot saying you know nothing nothing like that go back to West Virginia just\nYeah I mean because because the reality of it I mean you know they they I I saw somebody liberals on\nOn a social media late a while as late friday and also into you know Saturday continue on college we need to find somebody who as

I'm Sorry I get my uh my accusers mixed up um but if you look at a law that\nThey need the New Yorker broke the Romero story which meant on that and Sunday and the tweet came out first from from you at the evidence ...\nUh the in fact the claim the official claim didn't come forward until the following Thursday after when New Yorker story which was on a Sunday\nYes so we're just talking about who might be right leibel and we said the New Yorker for the for the uh uh uh sweating it straight and we met New Yorker for the ... right right right so if\nYou look at at I guess any any ah it if judge mark judge wanted to pursue a the uh any lawsuits are I guess anybody or that he says slandered\nUh then he would if you look at the Ford case and the way that that played out\nPursuing that it it's likely it's not going to happen I'm guessing it's not going to happen but in pursuing that if they pursue the Ford case alone\n\nIt's possible we would learn who leaked it I don't know if we would or not the media doesn't have to divulge that but if you're going after let's say in the forties or if you're naming a\nPeople um like uh the well would you\nWould you go after the attorneys because it's been brought up that her attorneys leak it you know the question that are attorneys like it's most likely that it was either a a member of the house or Dianne Feinstein and and and\nHer staff and others that I Believe is Lindsey Graham it went through it and said yeah you know she said ... was not her or her attorneys\n... that she didn't leak it right or no she well she didn't write about Bush but again we knew all the time what we what we've been told it seem that she never wanted it late right\nThat she wanted it done as an anonymous ... this is again I'm just saying I don't know what to believe right right yeah 'cause but but we also were told that she was afraid to fly right she she said that she said that um\nUh she didn't want it ... or the you know you want to remain or not right to Feinstein and and and then it was eventually done so\nI'm a ... you know again I'm who would have\nThere's ... either had to be her her lawyers or or either\nThe ... Congress from his office or well congresswoman and her office of December her name at the moment more Dianne Feinstein and his or her and her staff right to be one that's only who could be an and they seem to throw the blame at her\nDirt right well and during the hearing you heard Dianne Feinstein are addressing a chairman Grassley and saying I don't ... you know basically I don't know about my staff because I haven't actually asked them directly I don't believe\nThey did it but I have not asked them if they did directly\nLet's go to Gary in sparks Nevada Gary urine rather radio walk into the show\n[laughter] Hi how are you cut or got his um\nThe Republicans they came for complaining about all the things that the Democrats do but they never a press charges against anybody is like for for perjury or Hillary Clinton or a guy in finance head and so on it's like telling a bank robber I complaining about it\nThough well we're not going to have oh whoa whoa where's the perjury Audi approved the perjury\nHow do you prove that perjury prime well you know ... if you don't want to take that one like Diane Feinstein\nOkay well I Know how my ... well my point is legal point by point by what you alleged they should do so you're blowing out your first point you don't go after Ford so then who do you charge next than on if you're not going to charge poured who's the next one\nOkay Dianne Feinstein with would share this fire a at a chauffeur\nWell I Believe that there should be an investigation do I believe that yes of course\nRight I I I Believe there should be investigation they are not so I Would agree with you on that and I believe they and I'm not hearing their promise their their ... I Believe they are promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make that charge very kind of Hillary Clinton's emails there's\nWell that one that ... that that Russia's I'd followed everybody to that wasn't Republicans fault no\nThat was the only guy that was combing who clearly was politically driven and and that's something you couldn't control in that moment right\nWell do you expect the the Democrats just stop doing any of", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "13"}
