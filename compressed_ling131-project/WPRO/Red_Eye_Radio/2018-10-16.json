famous American one hundred years ago his name is Eddie reckon block or the new book is enduring courage\nAce pilot any written bunker but also a Trump trailer at a record bacher after the war celebrated toasted he marries Adelaide who finally gets her divorce from the Bruce will direct\nHowever and he's going to go through a bad patch year up to the point that he's drinking heavily and almost killed himself in a car crash in Nineteen twenty\nHe repairs himself thanks rattling district is it really is an extraordinary story [noise]\nYou know they adopt too but Adelaide becomes the reason he lives through the second one I Know if you had to get control of eastern airline thanks to General Motors selling it to him for three and a half million dollars\nAnd he is not a natural educated businessmen but he has a driving me to succeed he has a vision for aircraft he fights the ... the new deal why well\nAfter you got to remember right now so we're looking at a time when the civilian airline system\nIs just being invented their art airfields that will support that the American public as a little questionable about whether they want to get in and pay for a seat because it's still kind of dangerous so Eddie and a bunch of these one trip and a bunch of others or creating\nThe infrastructure and the whole idea of civilian airlines that we live with now an FDR and wanted to kind of get a little bit according to al ... a little bit more federal\nRegulation to end the Eddie felt was warranted and and even had FDR said well you know I'm going to have these ah\nYou know army or air Arnie flyers fly you know these planes and maybe not civilians and uh they started dying and Eddie was a little outspoken about that so he and FDR kind of ...\nTo Nineteen thirties that he got through the Nineteen twenties the flapper era the ... the great depression hits America the Nineteen thirties the the recovery is very slow it tastes good editor take control of eastern airlines\nAnd through the Nineteen thirties the operates it effectively become a money maker once it was free of the automobile industry there was always the\nAutomobile industry contributing casually\nAviation commercial aviation but then at commercial aviation becomes viable you need to get to the moment that is the most unbelievable in the whole story which is an epilogue almost to your book\nEddie in Nineteen forty four forty three forty three out\nIs asked by Marshall and the commanders at the Pentagon to get out to a MacArthur in disciplining and he knows MacArthur as one of the heroes of the first four and had he was one of the ... the first war so he gets on a be Seventy Seventeen and he takes off out of why is that correct\nThis eight man crew Eddie and seven others uh lose their bearings and a run out miss their little refueling stop on a tiny island in\nThe sun and he's got a three years old and one of those famous men and all of the United states of America\nAbsolutely and he is going down to is a medal of honor winner and he's going down to chastise a fellow medal of honor winner from the president to say stop you know do you know so they they're flying they have to ditch in the middle of the central Pacific\nAnd they're not taking care to know where they are or where they were headed so the ... the the ... was too much they're\nOff course they're off course they've made some mistakes and ah you can just see how this against amount it's really creepy to watch it and they are two thousand miles from any continental land masses are a couple of islands here and their\nChances are they're going to run into Japanese to read X. or two and a half there are three it was two and a half rash when they're small raft and these rafts or about the size of the bath tub three guys any flying on top of you\nDidn't take the food stuffs or the water out of the aircraft they forgot\nThat this was before an eddy would see that this would change later but they also weren't given they weren't you know a life raft didn't have water and food and it only a couple of cardinals a couple of things that made some Thurman says it because they knew they were going to go down of coffee and sandwiches and they forgot those I think the pilot talked to a few oranges and his death\nThey were with no food and water and nobody knew where they were in the middle of the war floating\nAnd sharks we're on the bottom of the ... the average IQ if you are making all this stuff so there's the immediate problem this command\nIn ... absolutely so you've got the captain was kind of wanted to natural but then another guy's a colonel so we are ranks Eddie during the war is decided they said you can be a brigadier general and he said no\nThe um I just want to be civilian they paid him a dollar a year to go around talking to various groups at the you know the war effort he was a hero and he went and talked to people\nSo it wasn't clear he was the only civilian that who was the leader and as things got worse and worse they shed John that as you know they shed a lot of them it shut their\nBathroom like a hundred and Ninety yes yes it was their living on a few things that can catch yeah and I think there was a bird that right well\nThat's an incredible story a you know it's the eighth day and they're sitting in a stupor because the sun has burn them and then the open source and then burn them again the salt water comes they're kept talk 'cause they're so dry and they're at their wits at eight days of just no food or water\nAnd Eddie has just had has a door that Adelaide given them any feel something on his head a pressure and he knows all the other eyes are looking at him and he knows that there is a bird ... he reaches his hands up graphs that that was at his age\nAnd lo and behold they chew on this raw saying but most importantly they took the intestines and they uh they had a\nCouple of fish trucks and they were able to catch a couple of fish and that moved them over to the next uh the the days are out there are several weeks yes twenty three days a day are dying slowly one guy's one\nDies or add some injury and he was drinking a lot of water the water and egos mad and his kidneys fail and he they push him off and you know and the\nFight for survival doesn't hang on any although he has the survival skills out there now writing to the rescue is Adelaide how so\nEr what a wonderful story so after two weeks Adelaide they've they've nobody has heard of that right so after two weeks secretary maybe says okay writes a letter to add a light saying you know nice nice and they had a nice way she sang or call it off the search\nAdelaide doesn't want anything to do with that so she goes out of Washington DC or just right into the office and says you cannot\nStop looking\nFor this like on this American Idol I call right and the guy says well to the middle of the war in middle of a sitter and she says I don't care you do something about it and she probably was salty whether language that too so they extend the search for another week on the last day\nOf that last week at an steady and flyer finds these big drag old half dead men and save and he'd\nWritten about her back and get one more shot in the book is indoor encourage John Ross is the author has five ... oh my pleasure I'm John Bass or this is John ...

smoke\nRun until I met up with the guys I learned something that night in fact every time I tried to quit\nAnd there were more than a few I learned a little more about what worked and what didn't work for me\nAnd when I realized that I wasn't alone that most people don't quit on their first or second attempt\nI'm an ex smoker\nMy only advice is to never ever give up trying to quit\nIf you are

American lung association we support the glittering new at clearing you dot org [noise]\nSomebody's voice of some of the New England was talking and talking points in time for the latest news from the revolution soft washing news where do you\nLook\nJournalist or bombers\nThis was a botched a kind of kidnapping attempted color rendition when somebody is extra territorially abducted and take him to another question for investigation you know\nThe U.S has a long history of that with blackface on during the Bush administration um we've us at the end in that practice but it's still practice in many countries around the world and in particular Saudi Arabia\nOnce you turn lobbying for them is told Saudi Arabia you will no longer represent the kingdom as pressure builds over the disappearance of ... go for ... group has been providing the Saudi embassy with government relations and communications counsel for the fee of one hundred fifty thousand dollars a month\nTo win it was fifty fifty I think the weekend before and then I'm just thinking about it allowed the Democrats are always there's been in their playbook I said that last night they saved this thing against him that he'd gone to some kind of ... you say if you knew Bruce ... such an innocent guy\nHe didn't go there for anything to do with sex or anything like that it was just a place they were going up in fact he was going all I can say this 'cause it came out with one of the hosts said at KBC where I used to host\nAnd a seven Ninety KBC and it was just like I said oh you want to go here Bruce and he said yes and it was meant to spring on him the last weekend sound familiar with Diane Feinstein or to try to show conservative voters oh look what he was willing to do to go to a unseemly nightclubs put it that way\nSo yeah I just thought of that now they've always sooner playbook nothing's new\nBut anyway uh he lost that we can and one of the reasons people said he loss was because if you remember a George ... a a H Bush had pulled out of California I think in that election that he lost\nUm to Clinton and he pulled out all those funds and then they use all of that to make sure box one but it's fifty fifty before that we can and they pull those dirty tricks\nBut he's a brilliant man and I wanted to ask Bruce her since and by the way he worked for Richard Nixon and I I think he said this on the air so I kept saying he was one of the few that said don't don't do resigned don't give this thing up\nYou you remember some people think Nixon was impeached wasn't impeach the he withdrew for the sake of the country even though a lot of people thought Richard Nixon was was pretty bad but Bruce that I went with him there and I I tried to convince not resign but he said no we're going to do for the sake of the country anyway ... Bruce once who must be Barbara Boxer\nFor the U.S Senate from California if he\nGod was involved in the founding of our country Bruce always taught me something whenever he was on and he answered of course did you ever think how young the founders were and how they got almost everything right\nAnd it was it also Providence I Would ask myself so we got George Washington when we needed them so badly remember they wanted to make him king if you know your history and he turned it down and you know set up I'm going to retire and president says okay that's enough and Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan when we needed the most\nYou wouldn't get any argument for me about gods involvement\nAnd now I think you're going to ... I think I'm Crazy we got Donald Trump with all those personal shortcomings when the country needed him most as long as I say you know Providence I don't know but I wouldn't you wouldn't get any argument for me [noise]\nYes he won and I was a strong supporter of his during the general election of course that doesn't say much either considering who he was running against right\nAnd I remember many of us thought we would be very satisfied if President Trump would just nominate conservative judges that that was enough especially if the Supreme Court we all are a lot of people I knew thought hey that would work for me that's that's enough right there and I think a lot of people across the country felt that way\nSo I thought we were way ahead of the game when he appointed a Judge Gorsuch to the U.S Supreme Court but it didn't stop there and I'll just mentioned some of them are things he's done a ... a bit much better lists last night and then the bomb a care mandate\nOpening up the Keystone Pipeline remember Obama wouldn't do it and an war reserves in countless regulations hurting the economy and the proof is how well the economy is doing\nA significant tax cuts lowering our taxes and simplifying the tax forms by the way it was ... and the same one I mentioned who years before his time say we should be able to fill out or a tax returns on a postcard and then everybody copied them years later and ah that that is eventually the where they want to go with us\nMoving of the U.S embassy to Jerusalem\nGetting us out of the Paris Peace accords withdrawing from the disastrous\nIranian deal I didn't talk much about that last night can imagine we paid them hundreds of billions of dollars under fifty billion under Obama that gave them secret cash in a plane which he denied\nPay them off for what they're our biggest enemy do you know what do you feel like I Do that you live that I live on a different planet I mean don't you we'll always of our biggest enemies or at least the ones killing our soldiers right now we give them money to eat them to hurt us and hurt our people\nThat alone I mean is incredible eight six six nine to read I Want to know what you think about the Iranian deal is incredible\nEight six six same number nine o seven thirty three thirty nine meeting with Kim all young to possibly reduce the denuclearization of the ... and then Sheila getting American remains return from North Korea making sure our borders means something I admit that hasn't been solved yet\nWe're gonna talk we didn't last night about the the Marshall people from Honduras opt to request asylum that's going to be a winning a situation for him to deal with and I'm saying that obviously sarcastically\nAppointing countless conservative justice it's lower court's not\nRight you watch federal judges and ah you know the ninth district which is a crazy district or gets overturned the most\nSaying things like a you know he is prompting the president can't do is you can't do that it's a Muslim ban and all this kinda stuff and they've taken power and their own hands well some porn that he points these lower court judges a federal judges to and of course the naming now\nOf a second Supreme Court choice another conservative break out on the list goes on and on and the American people love that he's not politically correct\nThe American people are tired of all those politicians who spin and spin and spin and are afraid to see what they really think he's so maybe he does too much but at least you you get people love is honesty or at least he says what he means you can never say\nThat about President Trump that he doesn't say what it means he may say to watch but he never says two little I came up with that one he's one of the most conservative presidents in my lifetime he's done a great job\nAnd most the American people get it but it doesn't matter to the left or to Democrats or the comrades in the media\nI'm afraid to tell the left the Democrats and liberal listeners all the call and they let me know what you think and I said last night I just said softly if the presidential election were held today President Trump would easily be reelected\nHe's kept most of his promises and the American people appreciate that and he is resonating with the American people more than ever\nAnd I don't know if you feel the same way I think each day he's becoming more and more presidential he's growing into the job if you remember Harry Truman to replace the FDR and people set off a thing I teach government history too so I Know some of the stuff and they said oh he's going to be awful terrible but they said she grew into the job also\nYou were dreaming by the way if you think he's going to be defeated I just want it tells you cut out there on the other side you failed to get rid of him but not from lack of trying you start in the day he won that it's so obvious now\nActually we can go they started the resistance against him much before election day but it was election day can they couldn't believe that this ... so called bumbling fools had one\nAll right he was so bumbling but he's still one right no matter what the upper lead or of the FBI and the Justice Department may have guaranteed right where we've seen the text me doing page and struck and all that stuff\nHe won I don't know about you but I was teaching at that time at night and I was almost in tears when I heard he won Pennsylvania which was always seems to me like Republicans ... goal you know we're going to wait at this time going to win Pennsylvania we got it down\nAnd not only did he win but despite their best efforts he won he is still here and he's going to be here for six and a half more years no matter the Mahler persecution a okay\nProsecutors so persecution to me no matter the hostile media media no matter the never Trump hers which I can never understand them no matter all the elites in the swamp President Trump is still here\nWhich never should have happened according to them and despite their best efforts to destroy him including getting a special prosecutor appointed I fault attorney general sessions for that I'm going to talk about that more later he should never have recused himself he played into the Democrats hands\nPoliticians typically talked our officers that's not a big deal I don't really talk then you've talked to the Russians including a bomb and you remember Obama promising off Mike the things will be better when he got re elected not to get you know make more stuff happened\nI've been a big supporter sessions when he was a senator but I'm disappointed in his jobs attorney general and disappointed his lack of oversight Rosenstein but more of that later\nSession should've made amends by fire Rosenstein especially if he threatened ... did you hear that he threatened them as they helped their bosses conduct oversight\nAnd just as disappointed by the way is the new FBI direct to almost nonchalant attitude about corruption and his agency that amazes me this is all gotten way out of hand and it was clear to many people by now that Mueller's investigation is a witch hunt in search of a crime\nIf anything there was a soft coup to get rid of President Trump perpetrated by the highest the lawns of our government at the Justice Department and at the FBI and I'm not sure until all the dust settles and this is my prediction if we won't find President Obama's fingerprints all over the you wait and see\nWe're we're never supposed to find out about the subterfuge because Hillary was supposed to win\nRight her champagne and our celebration there was a big boats celebration is supposed to happen in New York City there were waiting for her match the only one thing it never happened Donald Trump crashed that party and they're never going to forgive him for that\nAnd all of it would have been swept under the rug but she didn't win and that's where this tyranny and this resistance started if not sooner\nThe swamp must be drained by President Trump and this must never be allowed to happen again\nIt's time to free President Trump from this distraction I Want to know you think it's time to free the American people from this distraction it is time to free all the defendant smaller so far named in this witch hunt like Michael Flynn that never should have happened he didn't even know he was being under invests\nIf there was a hall of fame for garage doors garage headquartered would get my vote\nToday and I knew that drew a barbecue I burn everything [noise] and then we play catch I

dollars we gave to Iran\nTrump could go on the bandstand and say we could've built Detroit we could have put millions of black Americans back to work and train them with that a hundred and fifty billion dollars I think you should say that over and over and over again\nTo let the American people though at the bottom industry just fritter that money away and why they gave it to him I don't have a clue\nWell I I have a clue and he didn't feel the way we do about a who your enemies are and who your friends are writing was mean to our friends in in ... a really nice to some of our enemies I'd like your idea I think it's a great idea measure if he went around and you say in the country and the campaign stump saying he because people get a feeling\nYou know they hear a hundred and fifty billion or whatever you know it doesn't they don't relate to say hey we get are rebuilt Detroit we gotta rebuilt the you know she she caught with the the violence well we could have done here and done there people can relate to that but they they gave them money away to our enemy\nYou're right I I like your idea very much mark\nThank you thank you\nThank you and now let's go to a piece in Hebron

we're nothing but a budget blind mice we deplorable [laughter] and then when the truth of the matter is there's nothing to that at all that could be further from the truth\nThe truth of the matter is that and I wonder why people like Hillary Clinton and and that all the so called a ... bad actors that they refer to know why they haven't been handed out subpoenas and why haven't they got to the judicial process the justice system\nAnd I have to wonder that\nUh well I'm way later probably well I'm very disappointed in Jeff Sessions he showed no guts no no I'm ... ... what am I thinking of you know he's been so weak in in his position\nHe I was for him when he was named them but I've been very disappointed in him and by the way just to your point about Hillary civility that even the very I

I talk about illegal immigration all the time and they say oh you know you can't do that you can't build the wall but they live behind gated houses right yeah so what's good for them is not good for us right is it is a double standard that so I like your ... and yeah you don't have to weigh in writing personal checks yeah\nHey thanks very much mark for your for your call although he did suggest that I missed that that we need a psychologist no we\nJust have that in for like she was a wasn't she's like oh just\nMaybe she was fester I Can't remember ... or the combination man he was just the news it's over with let's go to David in uh oh you're getting into one of the subjects I didn't get to but I was going to maybe tomorrow David in price middle Tennessee Iran with mark\nI'm markets it's a pleasure to speak with you I'm this wall first of all all of us have been used throughout history of civilized man to keep people out or to keep people and for defensive purposes and the\nIf walls didn't work why do are a a high top are high value prisoners kept high walls\nAnd then secondly the\nCost of the wall itself\nWould pay for itself and savings of cost of crime in this country the cost of court all the litigation everything ... if that wall was put in place and monitored that would be cut drastically and the the money that's currently being spent\nOn those activities in addition to extra a law enforcement\nUh it it would pay for itself we wouldn't have to wherever else Mexico fan Ford our savings would pay for it\nAnd the crime rate would go down everything would be better with that well and uh\nI don't know why you gotta wonder you gotta wonder why why does Israel have a wall right worse than family\nWalls or proven defense method that they have to be monitored and reinforced if someone breaches it but it Ninety percent of all better of the people who are just war going across the border now would not be able to do so\nIt would not be able to come in and terrorize our citizens those come for various reasons\nAnd I just uh it makes no sense to me that someone would even have the audacity to suggest that a wallet\nWill work it will work but because of the the political ambitions so other of absurd leftist groups they don't want to stop it\nAnd the young lady that spoke earlier is so naive about everything even even with the uh uh she she she failed to mention that there were the the very witnesses that Dr Ford\nCalled and said we're there every one of them denied it happened these were her supposedly her with says I Know I've got off subject settled\nAnd she does have two degrees in psychology and she is a\nShe came across to me is having some real fundamental psychological problems herself\nDid you ever hear and I don't want to pick on her I don't want to pay her right now what's your take on her I think the hope they know I'm not up yeah uh well I'm not I'm not afraid of\nPicked on her but at the point I was going to make as many people say they go into psychology because they've had their own issues and then they'd have\nTo make money I can make money on this as well my whole a whole lot of us should\nBe struck just [laughter] and we\nWe are in our own way Thanks David it's your call let's go I like this or because of what it says you're let's go to Kim and burden Illinois I liked his Trump is giving us hope again\nHi Mark how are you Hi Kim how're you doing\nI'm ... and I just want to say um I listen to the young lady that called then so I don't take that she's just a Democrat I took a chase the socialists Democrat and how they want they want to have them\nAnd they don't believe in global isn't well where do they think that we're going to get the money to pay for their basic universal any time the free college how the health care or that Alexander ... or ...

B. R. O. [noise]\n\nSix six ... six six feet you know ... and early Marcos alert [noise]\nMark I asked her back\nYou again taking your calls ... one of the stories that were in was in the news today\nSo Michael of an audience last another one huh Stormy Daniels if you haven't heard this live a lawsuit over we by Donald Trump accusing her of a total ... job was thrown out by a judge who said the president was engaging and free speech\nOr the adult film stars real name is Stephanie Clifford claimed she was threatened by no no man\nNo men in Las Vegas parking lot in two thousand eleven or for a green to cooperate with a magazine article about Trish she said she had with Trump in two thousand six after lawyer released a composite sketch or the man Trump accused Clifford in April we do have a total Punjab concerning uh non existent man\nAnd one of the court decide they reason with Mr Trump's argument because the tweeting question constitutes rhetorical hyperbole normally associated with politics so\nThey lost and the ... been losing late which of course he says will appeal the dismissals a defamation cause of action and are confident in a reversal\nThere's a I Love the skull listen to this club there was something really rich in Trump or lying in the first amendment to justify the framing a woman\nNo it's really rich when you talk about decimation after what you did the judge cabinet and don't you love it when histories upside down anyway the judge awarded Trump reasonable attorneys ... also\nAnd his lawyers and no amount of spin or commentary by Stormy Daniels or her lawyer ... can truthfully characterize that he's really in any way other than total victory for President Trump in total defeat or Stormy Daniels and he didn't add\nUp her lawyer boy when I look to see him get the Democrat nomination for president\nMaybe we'll do that tomorrow ask you who you prefer to get the nomination but here's someone who disagrees with me let's see if I can find them again yeah Robin Boise idaho Rob Iran with mark\nAles goldfish taking my call I'm just happy to instill some common sense of the show uh I I think Trump is absolutely abhorrent a I got a laundry list I won't go through them all but they're barbaric handling of immigrant children disgusting um\nThere is at Youtube video I've seen and believe me believe me I don't believe me it's been taken off for you to he was a talk show years ago I Believe there was a David Letterman or said slog arrogant way I'm very very intelligent so of course I'm an atheist or he's got a Christian\nOr can you think we're going to hold\nOn I Want to just I'll give you a chance what you said something that hit me right away so the barbaric treatment of immigrant children first of all they're not immigrant children they're illegal immigrant children\nOr let's call them the way it is and I don't know what's ... why it's barbaric to say that you have certain rules and laws and ways of getting in a country and if you don't come in that way\nThen we can't accept you what's barbaric maybe his parents bringing the children here they're responsible for the families being separated and broken up so I don't think he's being barbaric you would probably call me barbaric just 'cause I Want some rules and I want some uh procedures in terms of sovereignty why is that barbaric\nI don't care who the children belong to\nThe handling was barbaric and if it was your child you'd be singing a different feeling you\nKnow I Would you know no no no you don't get to go on you don't mind you know you don't get to go on if you don't give me a chance and when you say something so absurd if it was my first I Want to bring my child's us here if I knew they could be separated from me\nI Would do in the first place so don't tell me what I Would do I'll give you your chance\nBut don't try to read my motivation on my mind these people I don't blame them from trying to get away from terrible conditions but there are rules in our procedures and it's not barbaric to say if you do that we we have certain laws and rules and procedures how we handle this go your turn\nExplain our federal judge a put a stop to it is barbaric whether you want to say it is not\nThe way they handled it not necessarily joining it in the first place separated show around here with that but if you want to go with the separation it'll be warranted it's the way they they ... they say half bought\nHandled it let's just say for instance I'll be real quick I took my kid Chuck E. cheese recently I had a bracelet said one two three for example at my child at a price said one two three\nThat way when I was able to leave their verified the bracelets without it will go on my way they could have done something similar but they didn't do anything she got children at all really\nFirst of all it was done and a half but way\nWay to first of all ... it's an unelected judges so you were trying to prove something by the judges if the judge yet he knows what's best than what's best for the country and what's best for the rest of us he never got elected to anything but leaving that aside\nThe parents shouldn't be bringing these that's what I Do what you said you would do the same thing if you're a kid no I wouldn't bring my child up if I knew they can be separated from me and and once knowing that I I just wouldn't do it in the first place they're the ones are clients and give us yeah\nAnd find your local food bank for ways to help\nAnd free Donahue Downey helps provide funding meals for those around you quietly

well I got to say is that\nUh your last caller and the young lady before a earlier than I are typically people who amongst my peers I noticed that\nThey hate Trump so much that they're a coherent they can't really articulate why but ... they give some time proving other people's point like mine when he was talking about the immigration a\nBig they are not immigrant because\nThe ... as soon as I say that right he's an immigrant because he came here illegally wire service I married my wife overseas I got married when I see people coming over here\nAfter I have to pay all that money and go to folks get hurt over here and help people jump in front of line because they came here because it's your graphic location I mean people got to realize\nAmerica is a country of laws\nAnd this man is trying to make sure that law barring forcing the Constitution's fall and the problem is we got people who have been\nA benefiting from the law being broken in a in a Democratic Party wants to make sure that the state's broke it because just recently are uh uh the woman run a favorite was running for governor she admitted she oil illegal aliens or is she called him a document it people to vote\nI mean it's just ridiculous what\nAbout sharing event she added it how\nShe video yeah sheep chickens Fox News he didn't go back when Steve ... a ... interview uh Brian Kevin she ... they showed the video and I'm a truck driver so I Can't watch it all the time 'cause I'm On my work I work right now\nA working up early morning ships are more than what I'm saying I'm I'm telling you right now I Believe in what the president's don't that's why I voted for him I don't think he's a racist at all as a matter of fact as a black man uh I remember\nIt was about maybe like Fifteen sixteen years ago in double ACP gave him an award how come they hear all these other people calling him a racist but how come you don't hear them speaking up than he is\nBut they won't even defend them either because if it's convenient\nI think for people to just put a label on people without any proof that's right you know ... it's just it's just it's just ridiculous and uh\nHe has done more for this country that will last president did in eight years and I'm the I'm going to tell you right straight out Obama was the worst president ever\nAnd you'll be surprised may not want to ... or you may be surprised\nTo know you haven't heard me 'cause I've been on a number of years but until recently not back on this network a I feel the same way I think President Obama is the worst presidents we've had in our history certainly in my lifetime he did more damage\nWell judging for the greatest country in the history of the world he was a ... going on on apology tour uh I I agree are coming\nOut and buy one before Saudi king and which is ridiculous but I I like what Trump you alluded to his speech a couple of weeks ago a and the un I well I got out of this speech was one of the things he didn't exactly say what\nWhat I took from it when you say it's going to make America great again it was letting people know\nWhy don't you make your country great again they make it a place that people wouldn't want to leave\nYou know what what about that what we've done that works so well right free enterprise little regulation limited government why don't you try that for a while the guys and see how it works in your country\nExactly and again going back to the immigration boy that guy said the uh the kids were treated the old policy was put in place long before Trump became president that's right and as a matter of fact\nA lot of those a lot of those kids coming across\nThere there may may not even be those kids are a so called adult children it's quite up somebody a walk across we saw it on the videos what what are some of the uh you know people from Syria which just picking kids up\nWalking across the border to get into some of these places they didn't belong to them so you don't know who these people are and in Mexico as a matter of fact treat the people that come across the border to legal be from Honduras El Salvador ... cooperate bottom out they treat them like garbage\nAnd they're very

um you're on with mark Hi Mike\nBut thank you very much the\nPresident Trump's party is the party of safety and one thing that the American people that are making this country work is that they want safety\nThey want every pre active measure that is it possible to make this country as safe\nAs possible and that the party or crime is the party a waste of time and I are trying to dig up a crime the Mueller hasn't come up with one yet more sick and tired of that and the voters are going to remember this that they have wasted so much time and this person that is the party of safety and that is what we're not\nNo up might make sense to me a safety and malls do that too by the way a quarter Rico in Clinton, Maryland Rico you're off the\nMark that last caller sums it up best [noise]\nThe the

she's basically saying yes sometimes there's no evidence how can you can you think about convicted in any one will know or either the conviction how can you think about even\nReacting on Oh yes the assumption of I think you did it that is so crazy and dangerous it's one thing for you to sit there and think someone did something it is another thing for you to put forth reactions\nTo now I'm going to react on them that I feel like they did [noise]\nWho in the world thinks like that these people are unbelievable idiots we have a president just like the last caller was saying cares about this country\nCharities we have people again like we've had so many times were sick of marching into the country that's just one issue on top of everything else we do not want that we want safety\nYour
