percent who aren't sure where chocolate milk comes from\nWe're not going to need a purge no no no no no no no just sort of no see that's the thing that sort of just running around in circles just sort of fade away because yeah like they can't they can't survive it\nReminds me of the the old magnetic football thing game where you just turn it on that just all go in circles and that's why\nI had no idea that when I got frustrated that a game as a kid come on can you guys wrong\n[laughter] just wandering around in circles little felt football the one guy was\nOld enough to remember they had the little kicker and you tried to get that it did but like never it never wear it never got past the center [laughter]\nOver and the kicker kicks up all the way to their own ever to hit again and that and that's why we all instead of playing the the you know the electric football we all took the penny and remember you put the penny underneath the finger and they took your\nThought on your finger and you're like ... yeah in up in the air and the other one held the gold price right and you're like this is more satisfying that a lot of football right exactly I've no idea how we got to electric football from turning out women Elizabeth Warren in one when we come thousand twenty well what does all of the stupid\nPeople are running around like the little electric football players these days it's what they look they're just running around in circles\nSo getting back originally and by the way this is going to be most of the show [laughter] you just heard here in the first segment yeah by the way I question another question we've got a lot a lot of questions from vacation is it a caravan or a mob\n[noise] I Will say this ... I think putting on our ...\nAnd we're going to be like we always do we put on our our substance had which is looking at the issues and basing it on the substance in our\nPolitical had put it on my political had I thought that what came\nOut of the the the campaign from the Republicans and Democrats I thought the best campaign slogan actually came from Trump that was jobs not mobs very a very easy to understand and very quickly on the the caravan here because we have lots of talk about today and uh it it's funny\nSometimes I just wonder how do people think and this is comes from from the uh people to support Trump but that's just about Trump it's about to get to Trump but I'm thinking to myself and you at the same thought\nThink people was it was for him this works for him we're moving towards election day and the closer the caravan comes to the U.S border is going to help Republicans and help Trump\nBut I'll tell you that was just saying it's a ... because this is because that's all I heard this is a conspiracy sources behind it and and they're doing this in order to win the election\nWell then\nTry and spend more money to win the election and have more caravans command if they believe that that's an effective way to win an election because\nIt's not it's not it it the we set it and it was the time and everything going on and twenty sixteen but Trump owned immigration illegal immigration if you want if he if he is to get\nBack on track to get funding for the wall this will be part of it\nIs five on you and I were talking about if there's a conspiracy yeah it would be the truck but I don't know [laughter] I couldn't have\nA billion dollars to make it happen because it's working for him right there is any conspiracy politically that would be called brilliant or affective in terms of a positive for one side of the other they would be him behind the conspiracy because\nThis work for the president and Republicans if you've got five ... this is what we saw a few years ago ... years back or when you had an influx not quite\nLike the caravan mob or whatever you want to call it\nUm but but pretty much the same effect right there\nAre about to reach the border and you had people you had Democrats who had rank and file Democrats saying no no no no no no we're spending people on the ... spending money government money on people who aren't citizens and we're not spending enough and in the cities in in our town them on our kids\nAnd that's the way that went and uh that was before Trump was president\nAh if you think this is the conspiracy let them try it it does not work for the left\nComing up on the show first the one over one thousand\nAnd twenty four we will we will get to because still I was you and I both on vacation very rainy vacation whether I was in New York or whether I was here didn't matter ... it just it rained it was a complete the a ... wash out and in fact the most the the biggest thing that I accomplished was I got three rooms steam cleaned in my house\nAre brought up the steam cleaner and did a three rooms and have formed more to go\nOr so that was really what I did over ... ... you know vacation oh by the way very quickly\nHappy sixty seven wedding anniversary to my parents as some Saturday oh we'll have you know it was the seven yeah an anniversary\nOr add a but we'll we'll get to that coming up because I just when I saw that I went when I first\nSaw that I said she is she dumber what how dumb she ...\nYou know for doing that and she came out yesterday and said that she did it because the world needs transparency and she was attempting to be transparent to a high there are also coming up on the show Hillary is just like Mike Myers from Halloween she just won't go away or should I say Michael Meyers yeah Michael Meyers Michael Meyers is pretty funny right All right in ...\nUh the the the jobs not mobs political slogan that came out while we were on vacation and the Democrats platform is what we thought it was going to be which is put a hacks on Kavanaugh often\nTo those Democrats upset about the ... a ... show these death\nWhere were you on Benghazi right\nWhere were you on ... ... because the criticism of the administration luck none of us know everybody becomes an expert on these things oh here's what happened you have no clue what happened and maybe somebody in the CIA knows what happened\nMaybe Trump knows what happens maybe somebody some of them in the house and and uh the house intelligence committee and and the Senate intelligence committee maybe they know none of us know what really happened over there but one thing we do know is the hypocrisy of the Democrats that in essence said\nWhen we found out that Hillary Clinton and the state department lied about Americans being killed in a terrorist attack and lie to the American people about it what did the press apt to say\nThis was her best day yes best week ever run Hillary right a\nPeta says a cow's milk is a symbol of white supremacists ... car crashes rice in states with that have legalized recreational marijuana and the illegal immigrant caravan Elizabeth Warren and that the study that

yeah so I'm their whole just we we had a comment on the Elizabeth Warren thing because we were on vacation or a ... last week but first off you've got cultural appropriation ... right now right sure I'll drill appropriation she's\nShe's a appropriating our culture and the thing I liked his when he even came up with a one sixty fourth while she could be one sixty fourth or could be won over five hundred and twenty or one over one thousand two hundred and twenty four\nAnd it was like yeah but the one or even if it's the one over sixty four and I don't even know whether this is true or not but somebody pointed out they said well no the average American is one point eight percent Native American so it doesn't even mean\nWhat the average American is that that particular point so without question this is ... ... you know cultural appropriation right this the the second thing was you want white privilege white privileges a white person claiming that they can be whatever they wish to be whatever minority they wish to be that they can be whatever minority they wish to being\nThe other thing was the median jumping on this is it as if this legitimize\nEver veto you're like well you know that that that was yeah that that ... that was it\nBecause there was some here's what was I think great about the whole scenario I don't know that was planned on the part of the president I don't think it was it was just basic basically it was his rhetoric on his side right\nBut remember back in twenty sixteen we were saying okay when you're on a stage with Hillary and you're you're debating just throw the facts that are you know she lied about being ... she you know uh the she broke the law but it came to her email server all these things just throw the facts out and have them fact check\nBack checking Elizabeth and Elizabeth Warren people basically doing that and then they come back as if it's legitimate right\nBut then they remember they kept changing it that well the ... was the Boston Globe way out\nYeah we made us take care of and we made a mistake again it just got to the point of being the most bizarre thing yeah right and I'm thinking to myself\nWow how bad are seriously now you when I Need to reconsider ... we need to get out of this radio thing and get into political consulting oh yeah I Would totally do that and just say you idiot\nYeah when you're going to work\nIf you're going to waste your money waste your money on us give us a million dollars and we can be a lot better political consultants for whoever you're using right because remember this\nWith all of her aides and they sat in a room and said okay here's our plan to counter Trump [laughter] yeah and everybody shook their heads going\nHa ha ha ha ha ha ha that's going to do with that you think there was one guy or gal in the room that said no no [laughter] but they all they all there was an overriding vote as sorry we all voted you were deciding to go with it because [laughter]\nWhere do just that tactic become a good idea\nAnd but this is not this is the mainstream remember when you had the Kavanaugh hearings the first cabinet hearings and it was the first day and remember that whole\nWeekend the Democrats on the committee had decided whether or not they were going to do a full on walk out\nOr you just do the ... thing right and they thought that it struck destructive thing I you know with Grassley a basically would be the tactic they would use that's what they went with\nAnd it looks like they had that meaning they met all weekend about it okay we can get up and walk out [laughter] which ultimately they did a during the a committee vote on on on Capitol\nYou know that you had come out here it's going outside and doing the press thing and all that but it wasn't that wasn't so much the ... that was like the protests after the fact they still voted yet and they still\nVoted so there wasn't offensively anything you know it it will show about it\nBut they had the meeting that first weekend they had that meaning we'll just get up and walk out\nThis is this is the ... this is the mainstream Democrats today this this is not the protesters and we talked about how the protesters ...\nLead the party they lead the party they lead the call for the party\nBut how many groups how many different causes and different protest groups are there this is why they have no direction because they're in every direction and it's it's it's\nCrazy and then then I guess the the other point was so Elizabeth Warren then does DNA matter quite right does this does this destroy transgender isn't mhm if DNA matters because remember the\nThe the next thing is as as we all know uh we we've gone through the whole trans racial thing the mill left just starting to embrace writer remember you're talking about Elizabeth Warren who\nWas [laughter] before this one of the leading liberal icons you know socialist icons social justice warrior ... who broke a ton of social justice warrior winds and regulations ... number one you were saying the DNA matters does it does so DNA matters\nAcross the board then and then it matters for ah your your sexuality it matters

last two and a half years and that's been there for two and a half years\nThis is stuff that is fresh in people's minds I don't know what's going to happen in the election it looks like right now that they're going to ah keep hold of the Senate\nOr the house I just I just don't know ... uh I don't think\nWhen you look back at Ninety four and Ninety four nobody really got a good read at that and nobody saw that wave coming in the house nobody start coming right and\nAnd so I don't know about the house is it a possibility that Republicans could hold onto it yeah uh I don't know how\nIn the mid term like this you can determine\nOr\nA extrapolate what the turnout\nIs going to be all I can tell you is I understand that in a in a midterm election the party not empower normally gain seats and the excitement level is normally with\nNot saying that there isn't doesn't excite voted voter excitement level and the Democrats I just see an unprecedented in\nA mid term at least in recent times where there has been so much motivation from the party in power which is the Republicans not to lose that I saw the interview that was that was done with\nA a bait or work Robert Francis ... over the weekend said if you truly are a rock star and I looked at you and I said I heard that over the weekend and I thought well no and you and I hate that term to begin with for politicians do what does it mean we we don't like to practice and political I dollar tree but since\nThat has been made I looked at you and I said look look at what Trump is doing some still out there filling huge arenas two years later and he's doing stop now bomb it into the same thing I don't think Obama could have done that two years later\n... well that would not at the same excitement well because ... and we warned in fact and if you look at the what happened in two thousand eight or then the four year that was there after that ah the inauguration and two thousand nine and then you saw what\nThe Tea Party the birth of the the modern day Tea Party or or the game I guess in terms of the the momentum of that Tea Party and ... and early about two thousand nine and ... and it kind of carried over but ultimately the rock star thing was over and we warned between election day two thousand aids and inauguration day two thousand nine\nFor Obama we said okay for people that wanted the rock star keep in mind he's going to have to do things that are presidential and those things are not going to work for you by the way that\nWas so [laughter] so and years ago [laughter] because [laughter] ... leave off\nThe charts now or to the fact that you know to the point that in fact or Beethoven does not need the former presidents of campaigning in Texas um but but\nThe that that didn't carry over\nThe ... the Trump momentum is built on a number of things and we'll things\nIt's not rock stardom\nBut if you want to talk about a political rockstar and that would be somebody in my opinion that that that performs gets things done on his agenda\nNot not that Obama didn't get things done on his agenda they got Obama carried through you know they had to lie about it but they got it through a this president got affect them things done on the economy\nThis president got in and created\nMore jobs is president got in and work with Republicans to bring taxes down and I don't think we've had this conversation we don't think he could have that anyone else could have done that Republicans are alone could have gotten a down on the corporate rate to Twenty one percent\nBut if you look at those accomplishments that's where the following that's where the ... it's that's where it's built and then as you mentioned the cabin offering something new to and wanted to do it woke up conservatives\nIt woke up the\nMaybe some of the rhinos who had abandoned too many conservative principles\nAnd have them re look I guess we are examine the threat to democracy the constitution in everything our entire system and process\nIn place during that Kavanaugh debacle that whole thing so that threat became real this is not some kind of rock stardom\nOh we think looks great or we think he's cool or we like\nThe way he tweets it's based on real things there's a big difference between skateboarding\nThrough water burger parking lot and getting the corporate tax rate down to Twenty one percent\nWhile you know you and I were talking about this said that if there is a\n... if they're ... and we had mentioned you know the ... or work here in uh in in Texas that that is viewed as the rock star ...\nWell a Bud Kennedy of the star telegram and waited out the other day and I just read the article that he wrote based on the tweet yeah he was a place called the originally theater molds like three to five hundred people that's it couldn't fill it couldn't fill\nThat\nGap that it was three quarters cornered Bud Kennedy was three ... you know three quarters full and did an article as beta burnout already here so when you talk about it ever existed or the I've ever really right did did it ever really exist or wasn't hype just what was it was it hype and the rank and file or hide after the media right right right\nIs you know is it is the point so if\nYou look at the excitement factor or and again I don't look at crowds just going to visit a candidate a you know you see a candidate as the the be all end all as as to whether people will go out and vote or not\nAll I Know is this that on the issues right now on the economy it's a plus for the Republicans\nOn on exposing what the Democrats really really want and and what they really believe when it comes to this country and they do they even believe in the constitution do they believe in free speech that they believe in\nSecond Amendment do they believe in due process under the law and we're finding out no they don't actually don't believe in the tenets of this country right right and those are pretty simple things to understand\nMaybe the separation of powers you don't understand maybe exactly what the role of Supreme Court you don't understand but you do understand due process\nYeah and you do understand the second amendment\nAnd most people do understand free speech and\nMaybe not everything that's in the first amendment\nBut they do understand the free speech everything that the Democrats now do not believe in and are bragging that they don't believe in in those particular things and then you have a caravan of illegal immigrants that are promoting it and the media is giving them as much publicity as possible but we're going to show up Trump's they're\nComing to the border to crash the border has the mid term elections are just Fifteen days away\nAnd it would take them I Will read one thing that to go what is it the eight hundred miles right either if you would take them five hundred and forty seven hours\nWhich means okay so should they should be closing in on the border come election day ... probably not something the Democrats want to be promoting as much as are promoting it right or the media is promoting as much as they are going to promote it because until I think Kavanaugh illegal immigration would still the number one issue of concern\nFor Americans and as you said\nIf there's a conspiracy out there in our pre sold meeting ... from it in order to get them build the wall right Trump is fun to this whole thing because if a lot of conspiracy theory that just because boom\nThey worked for him if there's if there's anything that that could get get it back on track in terms of the funding for for the wall that he wants the motivation right now go ahead keep promoting the care of and right up to election day\nDo it and let's see what happens let's see what happens on election day because even if the Republicans took the house\nWhat kind of solid victory is that I'm In long lines ... I I mean Democrats took the house and you know by by just you know what ten Fifteen\nMargin right two or three margin yes ability so even if they did that what kind of long lasting ... if if you think about the promise of what they've got to deliver\nWhat is it\nFree stuff well the house had all the funded\nWhile they were they would still have to be ... again you would you would you would still have to be the resistance how can you be the resistance and govern\nThere's there's no way you can't it's all about obstruction nothing else so what do you do that delivers\nNumbers for people of the president's working and\nGetting results in unemployment in taxes and real things that people seeing their bank accounts and in their lives every day what you're doing is working against one man show me how that works for your long term even if you take the house this fall\nI told the children at that age eight ... dot org slash kid a website created checks for them here family learned about the disease using interactive game story and other at that age eight ask dot org slash kid or call one eight hundred for thirty seven to for ... for\nFree information about macular degeneration that's H.

O.\n[noise]\nInternet radio he's are coming I'm Jerry McNamara eight six six Ninety right opposite of Rick in Virginia Rick Hi you're on Radio Welcome to the show I wrecked by how you doing I'm\nI was just thinking this is not totally relevant to the topic but I was thinking that all things being the same except let's say that Brett Kavanaugh was a liberal\nA judge and he was appointed by a liberal or president um do you think that those in the media who are on the left those in the media on the white and the\nLiberal and conservative politicians would\nHave taken the exact same position had everything been reversed except but everything else is to say just wondering what\nWell I I I I Know this that Republicans I mean you had you had people like us that criticized soda my your ... and and criticized Elena Kagan but it was on the specifics of how she would rule as a judge\nBut they got Republican votes they weren't demonized the way the cabin all was demonized\nRight it did I mean so I I Will say no it it would not be it would not be exactly the same based on the history of what happened to them they were criticized and they were severely criticized by\nConstruction is like us to believe that you should follow the rule of law we went back and looked at showed him I your\nJust sort of Myra ... who who who talked about\nUh the fact that uh oh sorry I'm not supposed to really talk about the fact that we legislate from the bench right right uh we had to lay in a cake and when she couldn't answer the question about a ... but she was asked by a senator whether the government should be able to tell you what food\nYou know you have to you have to buy and she didn't answer the question because it got down to what she believes the Supreme Court is actually you know a a a a buyout how you're supposed to rule as a judge but no I I don't think it would have been people would have been a number one it wouldn't have had\nYou're not going to have a liberal justice or then again with Trump you never know but\nYou're good at you could have early voting but I guess in that point from the color if it was a a liberal president who appointed a liberal justice and there was an accused you're like a you have a doctor for it but if you but then will fully reverse it be it being Dr Ford had\nA right leaning affiliation as opposed to left leaning affiliation I'm no that wouldn't have\nThat it wouldn't have played out the same way because the media wouldn't have done the same thing that they did here I mean the behavior would be different yeah I mean it would be quite the opposite\nOr you you see it all you you see it already whether it's you know senator brown of Ohio mhm they're not pounding him for stating that the\nUnfounded allegation against a ... him as a political hit job or not covering him not covering up the same way like well no no no no I don't know I I don't believe it would be the same no color\nAnd and I think we've seen is like you said we've seen that demonstrated I don't know how many times now\nAlong the way um\nI don't know that that I don't know that anybody would expect it to be the same any especially any critical thinkers that's watching the entire process play out in any given scenario would expect that to be the same but now if that was ... all of those items were reverse what\nYou saw from Kavanaugh was a first there's nothing to drive or that\nYou know that's right that's right great point there's no there's no way to you know that was a precedent that was set by the left and by the way that's the new normal for

I ... if you're a Trump supporter\nOn trade when he was talking about when he ran for office and what he actually got were two totally different ballgames\nCompletely yeah and what he was talking about on the campaign compared to what he was but he actually got and promoted look good at what he got was completely different\nThan when he was running for his campaign and as we've said if his most loyal if the always Trump hers want to support it and go with that we're fine with that because all we care about is the actual substance what did you actually get and doesn't promote more free trade to promote\nA more more good things but the ultimate thing that he promoted was actually a negative it raises the cost of cars in the United states Canada and Mexico and that's a bad thing mhm and now\nI think the average person who understands economics who is in caught up in the political I dollar tree will admit that's a bad part of the deal the always Trump or just ignore it big nor does if it doesn't exist were not just going to go there\nHe got the deal he said he was going to redo NAFTA he did after what what was in NAFTA I don't care don't want to know and that's fine that's\nPart of a demographic that's going to vote for every president that exists sure but that's not the only demographic that voted for Trump we broke it down to eight different demographics about six months after the election\nAnd there's a ton of people that in that age demographics is more now more United and you can even at a ninth and there which are the never Trump hers which have now come aboard mhm so\nTrump for all of the good and the bad has United with the help of Kavanaugh and the help of the Democrats and them speaking bluntly about what they want this country to become\nA have United around Trump and they do look at Trump he is that figurehead that isn't them\nRight and and I think you look at the end and you said this earlier if you want to look at the ... the the real rockstar look at the terms in terms of performance in terms of getting things done Trump over ... come on I'm close because\nOne thing that that is going to always resonate with American people is a good economy\nIt's going to be a man I'm doing okay everybody in my family seems to be doing okay\nA job status doing OK and or getting better\nYou look at the unemployment numbers in any kittens where the liberal media can't argue any of those points anymore they can't break it down because you you just simply can't those numbers now\nThey can be manipulated but in breaking them down in terms of the performance as as long as we've used the same standard standard with the same standard of approach basically on those numbers\nYou cannot have a debate about the unemployment or the GDP or anything else because the last president was judged by the same exact standards all of this basically wraps up into one thing\nWhat is it that the other side wants to do is that a threat to this\nExisting ... you know economy right now in other words a you know I'm really I'm I Am doing a little bit better you know my jobs doing better or making a little more whatever it might be I'm I'm taking home a little more taxes are lower\nNot only that but I remember you know we said this and I don't know if anybody's ever used the exact same words that we used and I think we use to probably uh I think this was early in the primaries and we continue to say it all the way through the election\nAnd we and and the media has completely missed this totally mhm but it's not just that the analysis that I was telling you that I read yesterday that Trump is the average ... an average person the average person looks at them as the average person what does that entail the average person if you cause that to me doesn't describe\nThe the the substance at just that's labeling people I use an average person therefore he likes Trump's\nBecause Trump relates to the average person because they believe he's like the average person what does that mean\nAnd you and I actually use the L Word back way back in the in in the campaign I Believe that and and I believe this too\nBut I Believe the Trump loves America mhm and I believe he loves Americans and he loves Americans first\nUm\nBut he loves Americans and I think the people that support them I think part of the political I dollar tree which is different than Obama's political I dollar tree right is if they look at him and they say here's a guy that truly loves America and he loves to me\nHe cares about me yeah he's rude\nAnd yeah he's crude but when it gets down to with a law that comes from the anger that we believe that he shares with us that these other people don't love America\n... and we love America and how do we love it and now the ... meter would get insulted we love America no you don't you don't believe in due process\nYeah both Cuomo America's never been great right but ... exactly mhm you you really you really don't you don't really believe in the first amendment you don't really believe in the second amendment you don't know believe in due process you don't believe in a presumption of innocence what do you really love about America you and I had brought this up\nFor over ten years when we've gone through certain issues and said well if you don't care about this and you don't care about the constitution because what makes us Americans that we live in the same geographical place\nOh no it's we share an idea and one is that idea the ideas the constitution and the United state us and when you have a group of people are political party were checked that\nThis isn't bumble thought 'cause that's what the Democrats will try to much above us out there oh Trump Globes America we love America\nOne of the and I love America to actually if you don't believe in the constitution you don't love America you may love the concept of what you as a group all think America should be\nBut you don't love America the way that it exists under the current constitution and the rules and regulations that we have you and I talked about it when you talk about\nThe fact now they're talking about well the president needs to remember the president's see is no longer effective or that needs to go yeah the the the electoral college needs to go to the Senate needs to go from what they don't understand what those are key words that you don't believe in individual liberty\nBecause we are not a direct democracy we are a constitutional republic and the reason we are as to protect the rights of the minority this\nTo protect the individual rights and the rights of the minority exactly what they claim that they believe the Democrats claim that they they think about so we look at all that and that's all part of loving America so when you hear when I say that um\nI've always got responsible that's above the thing that he loves American we don't\nKnow based on the actual specifics of what the Democratic Party is promoting ... were calling for which is anti constitutional mindset and an anti constitution well yeah and we can make that point and you and I said for the longest time\nBut it's the last that doesn't believe in the first amendment\nOh for them yeah mhm\nBut for others they don't and we have broken that down before they don't believe in the second amendment and now they don't believe in due process under the law when it's inconvenient for them there was not a presumption of innocence that mindset is wrong\nWhether you donate money or time you're helping big

[noise]\nAnd I mean I'm Gary ... six six Ninety or read I\nWelcome and good morning let's go to Dave in Kansas Dave higher or whatever and You're welcome to the show Hi Dave\nHas a very good show thanks Glenn shows like ... or just as good as such so when the last caller mentioned about\n... you know he was trying to get you guys' opinion on that older than ... completely different and it must narrow it Kevin on that so just came up to my attention okay and then let's say was completely different so\nWhat group of conservatives or Republicans would be like ... like ... or ... or ... like\nI was like ... who will go on our side will be going on locally or doing\nThat nobody knows who served as you're if you're talking\nAbout the behavior of the the uh the uh interrupt do so disruptive kind of and we're getting some interference on your calls will let you go\nUm if you're talking about the disruptive type of behavior or the after the the committee vote on Kavanaugh Kamala Harris and and uh and others walking out that kind of behavior who on the right would do that\nI don't know of anybody that would do that our point was that it would have been a different scenario based on the media treatment of\nA set individual and everything but that's really more about the media treat 'em and what we do and we did go back in and talked about the breaking down of the um\nUh you know how they have acted or behaved as the judge during the confirmation process for sort of my or or early in the Kagan and what they might do in a in a certain\nArea but that was based on their behavior as a judge\nYou still had Republicans vote for them and you still had and that was their treatment of them was based on again how they would be have as a judge that was part of a what Lindsey Graham and say you know he voted for Alina Kagan and sort of my ...\nAnd so what the behavior be\nYou know I'm a a a ... well a Lindsey Graham getting up and walking out likely not no\nBecause I think what you saw and Lindsey Graham and uh his uh emotional or the you know statement\nThat day\nDuring that hearing when Kavanaugh was there was based on the ... the behavior of those on the left and how they were treating those and essentially a shredding the process\nAnd and I think that's what that's what that was it for the\nYou know a liberal president and it was a a liberal justice or liberal judge a that had been appointed and during this process there was a conservative leaning or a you know a woman to accusing him of doing something with the behavior be different by the media would have been treated\nThe same likely not no but it was kind of a you know with all due respect to well the answer I think we all know that and then he critical thinkers I don't expect they\nLindsey Graham or or another conservative on the committee or or Republican on the committed to get up and do what about with Harris did you know after the committee vote get up and storm out\nThat wasn't the point\nYou know but I Would have been ... and again you can't make the case he was trying to make the case that it was the same and I'm like no it was unprecedented what happened right mhm are you even look at Justice Thomas you know that goes back you know twenty five\nOr ... that goes back twenty five years ago and and uh you know he those hearings were held and then but then but then he was he was you know confirmed that I Believe some Democrats even cross the line and voted for him yes they did I Believe that yes they did well I Believe that was a Democrat said it at the time\nMhm yeah\nAh so yeah so you know they they ... but this was on President\nNothing nothing we have ever seen a it in our lifetime or in modern times has has been like this so to even question that to me uh shows ignorance and that doesn't mean stupidity it means\nA lack of knowledge ah on on history and that's why we brought up and said that didn't happen with sort of minor and that didn't happen with Kagan there were people that disagree with that because we we believe that sort of my or and Kagan many times not all the time\nOn the\nCell tower right to cell tower\nCases the cell tower that they agreed with ... they you know that ah they used the in their writings they used um\nThe prior judgment by opinion written by ... majority opinion written by\nScalia is exactly that was the press and the right they use but in many of their many of their answers and many of their their decisions we believed they legislate\nUh we were always conservative or moderate Democrats but he's taken it helped pass show I mean it's you know just to back to\n[laughter] I don't know it just amazes me it's like I wasted\nThirty three years in the air [laughter] ... treated\nDidn't even know that the constitution or video has right let's get\nA ... I yeah I understand yeah I understand there's always been doing it on yeah there's always been thank you for your service\nUh there there's always been the ebb and flow is I mean if you if you were walking around the Nineteen thirties as an adult in this country you would have seen or you know the socialist mindset that really really really really existed at times or the anarchist movement that uh in in the first part of the twentieth century\nUh that that existed or in this country could get a just as wild at at times one of the things is that the factors do do as many people still hold his radical views\nAs you see maybe a little more right now I don't know how many Democrats rank and file actually hold the views of not believing in due process as the mainstream of the Democrat leadership now ... whenever I have I seem to see where is there a big just right now now we we know that on many of the issues\nThe ... if you if you actually polled Democrats on all the major issues out there as to what they would want\nYou would see as we saw back in and we noted back in a twenty twelve especially when\nOn the issues the majority of the public agreed with\nA Romney yeah ... yeah on the issues they aren't read with ... and if you take a ton of the issues that rank and file Democrats believe\nThey disagree with what the people they vote for a does and I think to a much greater extent than any Republican\nVoting for a Republican president directs right yeah yeah because you think about that should you think about the conservative never Trump ... the vast majority of the issues that they disagree with\nTrump on his his tone yes\nWhich is it similar to what they are a lot of the left criticizes him for his words in his talk\nAnd it's not so much the job that he's done you know they may pick apart you know whatever it is the tariff babies [laughter] by the way we're the original ... babies um but but but they may pick a part these things or the sort of that but\nUltimately if you got down and you were to ask the never Trump or is it conservative never Trump has\nA well okay the corporate tax rate Twenty one percent did you think that was going to happen or do you report that do agree with that um the unemployment rate the GDP where we are right now uh do you think we're moving in a good direction in the president's done a good job on a number of items\nI don't know how you do not even as a never\nTrying and ... I I Believe the president should fight more when it comes to the debt he's taking little victories that's I'm cutting the federal government that much but it's doing nothing to solve the budget problem lesbians right he throws those he throws out but\nThe fact is he knows he's not the legislative branch and yes he knows you wonder what power ... this isn't this isn't the president alone\nThat has you know created this deficit spending these other Republicans in Congress including a significant portion\nOf conservative or formerly conservative [laughter] drink right also who wants to identify conservative Republican congressional members that are also wanting to spend eight eight eight a ton of money well\nWell how did they get tax has done Roy Moore last yeah and they realized oh my gosh we got to get things done a because we may lose the Senate at some point we've got this slim you know victory here are slim margin now and it they didn't ... the Republicans in the Senate\nDidn't get it done until after that lost the president had been working toward that but again this answer tight if they're not going to do anything right\nI think the president should still work harder and still talk about more which he does not ... you probably and and I I'm thinking the probably the White House says look we can't witness because our own party doesn't care any more about the\n... well you know what's what's really disappointing I guess the downside of the capital of the thing or what may have motivated a lot of people or whether it's the never Trump or his or or the the moderate Republicans\nA who now are standing up for conservative principles again it could be too little too late not not in the Senate but\nIn the house and the president and the Republicans if the just imagine that that the Republicans maintain power in the house and the Senate the motivation to get things left now work on getting things done right that's\nVery real but it can't happen

especially Britain mean if yeah and and I read that I said oh you know that's the point that came out of this is not\nWell shoot vote to really did it it wasn't but it was taken away from her that still pointed should have been taken away from it right where's the oversight but from the judge or I Want to read part of the transcripts or from a U.S district court judge\nRoyce Lamberth the transparency group judicial watch initially to the department of or the state department and twenty fourteen seeking information about the response to the Benghazi attack\nAfter the government did not respond to a freedom of Information Act request other parallel lawsuits by judicial watch are probing issues like Clinton server whose existence was revealed during the the course of the litigation\nThe state department had an immediately ... uh moved to dismiss judicial watch his first lawsuit on the motion for some re judgments sane and an affidavit that it it conducted a search of all potentially relevant emails and the possession and provided them the affidavit noted that some more documents and emails could be forthcoming\nBut Lambert denied the request to dismiss the lawsuit of the time\nAnd on friday he said he was happy he did charging the state department officials had intentionally misled him because other key documents including those on Clinton's email server and in fact not Ben produced it was clear to me\nThat at the time that I ruled initially that false statements were made to me by career State Department officials and it became more clear it through discovery that the information that I was provided was clearly falls regarding the added the adequate\nSee of the search and this is what we now know turned out to be the secretaries email system Lambert said on friday he continued I don't know the details of what kind of I G inquiry\nA there was into why these career officials at the state department would have filed false affidavits with me by the way that's perjury yes\nYou do that yes you're telling the court somebody when you know what to do something else I don't know the details of why the Justice Department lawyers did not know false affidavits were being filed with me but I was very relieved that I did not accept them and that I allowed limited discovery\nInto what had happened during the tense exchange with Justice Department lawyer Robert Prince Lambert pressing issue accusing prince abusing double speak and playing the same word games but Clinton play and\n\nThat was not true that is a quote the judge said referring to the state department's assurances in sworn declarations that as a searched all relevant documents quote it was a lie\nAnd I thought about this the culture 'cause we've talked about the culture of the Obama administration the culture that existed in the IRS\nWhereas we know they purposely\nWe're trying to hold up\nThe uh the uh tax or a documents what do you call it again the tax um of all I got my bike here are the um\nWhen I go to church ... no no no the ... though they were trying to hold up these groups that wanted to get a\nTax exempt tell you yes right ... status as they held them up by the way ... you you want to know why I'm against the income tax\nI'm against the income tax for that reason right there\nI'm against the income tax because the government should never have to review any group as to their intentions as the federal government was able to do\nThat's why I Believe there should be a sales tax ... that's why I'm against an income tax write because the government has using income tax to get involved and to censor people and to do things that they have no business being involved in your life right\nNow and\nThen by the way you're touching on something I referred to earlier you know that that whole process of and well it was a couple of rogue agents remember that yeah it was a couple of rogue agent yeah no it wasn't no it wasn't and we're not saying it it was a direct order from the White House down\nWhat we're saying was there was a tone a clear tone that was set\nWe know\nWe know to be the behavior the pattern of behavior during that administration on many levels the question is how far did that go and was the tone and the department of justice or the state department just that look will do anything we want to we don't we don't have to tell the truth even to the courts\nWell and and when I when I look at when we look at the situation with the IRS which you'll look as all the rest of this seems the Irish might be minor [laughter] compared to compared to everything else when you when you when you look at for example here at the department of of\nOf a state where the judge is saying you lied to me yes you absolutely lied to meet you committed perjury\nYou lived in affidavits his his accusation right or you know it to a ... to them you look at what went on so that we're looking at the FBI and the department of justice you're looking at after when the Pfizer application\nWas declassified and the other documents declassified but the president didn't release it but sent it to the inspector general of the department of justice who looks at what\nLooks at corruption you look at how they were so willing the state department to lie I'm Ben gossipy yeah and and this is why the whole thing or with\nThe um\nOh I just I got my like you're in but on the air for a while [laughter] we've been on vacation I Do [laughter] with cars showed ... mhm\nWithin the debt murder of of a a lister a jump off the show

clarity as to what actually happened in this particular case should be investigated absolutely should there be repercussions if what\nWe believe might have happened happened abs absolutely there should have been but the Democrats have no business of talk after all the Democrats and the media backed up Hillary Clinton's line about a terrorist attack that got Americans killed and they lied about it yes\nAnd she knew about it and I believe the White House and President Obama knew\nThat they were lying about it why there was an election coming up so they lie about it a terrorist attack on that killed American citizens and an American ambassador and they lied about it and what we discovered that the evidence existed that Hillary lied about it remember when Jim Jordan\nBrought it out

what a couple of months ago maybe\nAnd then when the house I well I I don't know that we will but it's interesting Mike\nThere what I don't believe is is this uh like the FiveThirtyEight thing\nSaying that you know they an eighty five percent chance that the Democrats will take the house\nBecause you have to get into all the different polls and all these districts and I mean there's a ton of them but then we can break it down much easier into those thirty one tossup states right that that right now according to our she'd be there are thirty one tossup seats there are things like a Texas thirty two uh Pete Sessions\nAnd his Democratic challenger is someone who was in the last poll which was twenty eight days ago\nToday a was within a point now we know because we live here in in this area we know that that district is a north of Dallas County uh and so there has been a they're a demographic shift that's been going on\nThat shift has been happening really over the last uh probably\nA three to five years but really over the last few years especially because so much growth in this area brings individuals and for jobs right so there's a the the demographics change\nSo that could be an accurate ... we don't know my question is why are we seeing those big pollsters in these a tossup districts and why we're seeing these new polls come out especially a couple of weeks out because\nYou're looking at the house you would think that there was some interest there by the media in order to hire these pollsters these major pollsters are to do a more in depth polls we maybe we'll see some starting this morning and then the next week a and over the next couple of weeks as election day is one week from tomorrow\nBut my question is really not if five thirty eight or any of them or wrong\nOr because um who was it\nThat had the basically the the it was like a fifty fifty on the houses that NPR a couple of weeks ago they said it would just go yeah\nYeah so and and it came out to eat yesterday that\nIn what is it likely a vote or ... or the Republicans are moving closer right okay that that came out just yesterday I think I have writers somewhere yeah the the\nThe story here but it's so much tougher to tell on those house seats I just I I Wonder that if we're going to gain\nIn the in the in the Senate mhm and so that's you know that's looking at a populations across the state and right here or that\nYou know I just wonder how they extrapolate it out to so many of these races where if they're using the public polls out there there are so few of them\nSo few and far between how the if there was no if you're going to the internal polling polling which I'm sure is being done by the campaigns right and you would have the better you know a better guess at that\nRight yeah it it gets here\nIt is a a a Dems mid term advantage narrows among registered voters yeah my new national poll a few weeks before the midterm election shows the chances of a blue wave are far from a slam dunk for the Democrats the NBC Wall Street Journal poll released a Sunday shows forty eight percent of registered voters\nWould prefer having Democrats in control of Congress compared to forty one percent supporting the GOP these seven point gap is narrowing from a ... point gap the Democrats had in September I don't know if that tells you anything though\nWell and and again I mean registered voters ... we've got to talk about likely voters and then again what the motivation is on election day let's we've been talking about this it has changed since the Kavanaugh's confirmation\nLeading up to and since I don't know to what extent I Can't tell you it's motivated the left or the right more we do know there's no doubt the right is motivated Republicans are motivated right now are they more motivated than Democrats I Can't tell you that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Providence", "day": "22"}
