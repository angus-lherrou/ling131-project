about you know how uh the the uh\nThe players association could be saying look we got to go ... coming up that it could have been hey guys were starting talks right now or at least getting into the early stages of these talks and this is affecting it\nWe can't we cannot have ... down TV ratings right uh you know in another year and a half everybody has to be everybody has to be on board do protest wherever you\nOdd right of course because all of a sudden these players are saying this could affect my next contract and oh well then have protests wherever you want a look we made a deal\nUh the NFL's giving to our particular causes so we won that but no like air a greater Colin Kaepernick it doesn't matter what the deal is struck they just they they view the deal being struck\nAs a you know and and remember the air agreed to use the deal being struck\nTo not Neal and to keep Capra Nick out of the you know out of the players association that was going to decide where all that money goes to basically say no cap and you're not a part of in a air agreed wants to continue kneeling there's the there's a group or the the there's the one or two\nAre out there that wish to continue kneeling no matter what\nAnd there's the other group saying look we got our cash shut up [laughter] and yeah and so now there is a ... so the NFL the owners probably said look don't ask don't tell and it's a liberal it's liberals fighting liberals and it'll eventually blow up in their faces yeah I'm an hour and then we can move on\nYeah I mean I I think you're I think you're probably right on it's probably you know unofficially don't ask don't tell for me it's a don't watch don't care\n[laughter] well that's the thing if there is no reason to watch my team anyway because they're not colonizing\nWell yeah I mean you know my my team attempting to I I just saw the headline tempted to come back you know over the uh the Redskins this past weekend and then you know couldn't get a gun\nBut I I I I think\nOf again the bigger picture of the fact that it's not just the protest driving the people what you you you've got two big things to overcome right\nYou got to bring back to people who left because of the protest but you got to bring people back who left because they they're watching other things because they're doing other things I mean that's where I think a lot of the erosion is you've got to create new excitement in the NFL\nNot just in the whole protesting you've gotta create new excitement in the broadcast presentation of the game\nAnd\nThey haven't even started on that I mean\nUh you know the uh you send a lot of the movement to digital and and we knew that ... there's going to be more of that in the in in the coming years\nNo doubt but that's about reaching the audience where they are but you know you put a store where the traffic is right so you put your game your presentation is going to be where the traffic is if it's on digital if a if it's on line and that's where you're\nGoing to find that audience but you've also got to change and I think that will help change the presentation of the game\nBut that's something nobody focusing on right now because they can't get through you know this\nIs even if it's just a handful of players if it's making the news it's like you know come on guys it's time to get back to football but you can't get there because these stories still make the news\nThat's the you know it's it's like the left you look at\nA uh a war and and oh Casio Cortez they don't represent the majority of the\nUh the the rank and file Democrat out there but they're leading the party if they're making the news and they're driving motivation on the other side as a result of it\nWas a ... ... was a Tim Ryan\nYou know challenge Nancy Pelosi for for his seat and and you know we've got to get away from the identity politics and and everything else and who else so that a couple of others have said that\nUm but they can't\nBecause it's not making the noise I mean the the I guess being a more moderate Democrats if you could they would still be far left but getting away from you know the identity politics or whatever it is that's driving the far far left\nWell where where do you moderate where do you because that's not making the news that's not making the social media or that's not worthy interest is by the mainstream\nMedia it's boring so it's you know this this is this is all you know part of well\nAnd I mean really scrambled ... and what you see here is what you see happening in the ... in in the Democratic party where you have victims in the oppressors and\nAnd as we've said this that the identity politics you continue to cut the pie of victims becomes greater but then when the number of victims becomes greater than the number of oppressors\nA must you know must become a greater or you know we've seen it a ... look ... last week you saw the most of the cycling though the women's cycling a champion you know the the the the mail one the biological mail one and\nThe female came out and said it was the the two females that are are one of the females who came in\nLike third place she goes ... this is ridiculous this was a male right\nAnd he is gone crazy stating the bigotry and the intolerance and right and and and and and all that 'cause I Know you're a you know you're a man you're not a woman so that's the debate that goes on and so as we said\nThe feminist up today the ... the old time ... wish to protest is the new time that the new feminist do not want to protest\nThis but you destroy feminism as we said all along the feminist has now become the oppressors thinking about this did you ever think that the feminist would become the oppressors of liberals right now the feminist\nThe feminist movement this is how insane it is and what you have here is in the in the NFL you of Eric greed\nYou know a Malcolm you know Malcolm Jenkins was part of the group that agreed that okay uh the owners are going to give a hundred you know a hundred million dollars for the for the organizations that we wish to give money to\nTo help make racism less mhm okay fine All right we will we agree that we're not going to Neal anymore ... well now he is viewed by air agreed and Capra Nick as\nThe oppressor he is a Neal colonialist right he's a sellout right because the whole the the real thing is with the cap predict or a read\nThey don't want a deal no they want to be able to scream oppression so so the victims some of the victims now that we're perceived as the victims here in the NFL or those in the NFL standing up for who they perceive the victims war\nNow they have become the oppressor they're just as bad as Trump they're just as bad as any top ... because they have decided that they will\nNegotiate to try to make things better and the radical left doesn't want to negotiate show they want the constant and they want it's this constant the debate out there they want to be able to\nCry racism day in and day out and the fact that it's never going to be solved because it can't be solved once it solved or once you get to where most people believe society is today or racism is not a factor like it was fifty years ago or sixty years ago or a hundred years ago or a hundred and fifty years ago\nThey have to insist that it's actually worse than it's ever ban or they lose their purpose their purpose is gone they can't say that things are getting better for and so boom it's going to blow up\nA significant portion\nOf the NFL of blacks in the NFL that were initially supportive of it and said OK enough we made the protests we've made our point we've got the money from the NFL to put to good causes that we believe are good causes now they aren't the defenders of the victims now they are the oppressors is what happens\nGraduates happening with the Democrats every day it's happening now in the NFL we've been saying\nFor years here not unexpected no because it doesn't matter who you are\nPerson standing with you dealing with the with the case may be in protest could be the oppressor tomorrow and that's what's happening\nNow Malcolm Jenkins is a sellout\nRight I'm sure you know what whatever other labels and want to throw at them but a Neal colonialist that's the that's my favorite one mhm he's now Neal colonialist yes that term was used on an NFL football field yeah well that's the first at least\nLog on to the national guard dot com\nOr contact in the Army National guard recruiter in your area sponsored by the Rhode Island

where would you put them that that line like that lines going to be you know for a long long long it's going to be a few miles long at least\nOr you're talking about what an unofficial entry which would be in the middle of the desert those conditions get much much worse of course\nWay we we've heard the ball the whole goal is to have violence at the border and therefore will affect the election they won't be here on\nTalk well and if it right now they're you know they're they're suffering as a result of the you know again blisters on feet and everything else and exhaustion and all of that uh what what kind of a they're assigning to this group\nAh I think politically a lot of things that have probably won't apply it's not going to be violent it may be if they get to the border it may be passionate it might be a lot of ...\nI've actually heard that debate from the right and and and our counter to that is they're not going to be here before the election in order to to get that just because of what's roughly a thousand miles in that they still have to go over that period of time and they're not going to be able to covered in that particular time so advantage Republicans on this because it will\nBe in the news as long as this caravan stays together and it will be a major news item every single day up to an all up to election day and will favor the Republican candidates right

superhighway and immigrants that we're going to come through America up through ah I'm from Canada and that was something that literally my father\nHad to say that's not happening it's not happening so when you see these images maybe\nA conservative favorite drain and a gift and they turn elections because this is exactly what conservative think people on the last what had happened in this country I'm not saying I think refugees are not paying not accept legal immigration what what a lot of people aren't allowed to say no one on the table and the one open waters and no consequences\nWhen I Do wish I wish that the then the people on the right which tell the truth about what's really happening and immigration because the largest number of undocumented not telling the people in the Right rally around\nBut I'm not talking about you and I don't\nThink I Am more seem on that fishy then I think than I think people realize I come from a border said and I think when you hear stories like that happening finally shot and killed by an immigrant who is in a I'm a dyed in San Francisco which is one of the sad thing for anything go there now\nAnd I said I sat and count sanctuary but let me just say that something you have a cat [noise] forty one percent of undocumented immigrants are from Asia\nFrom Asia a large majority of have a link to undocumented immigrants from ... from Canada they aren't caravan and I we label on the right point that out as always about brown and black [laughter]\nProblem is by the way I don't I don't want to make this clear it's the left that keeps focusing on the brown\nThe color of their skin or the fact that it would be Central American refugees and it's the left the dust it the right doesn't know\nKnow the right looks at it and the right to know either you're here legally or you're here illegally that's how the majority of people look at it but they have to use it\nThey have to you that that mirage of an opinion comes from the left well the right doesn't want illegal immigrants in the Asians or your you don't care about the Asians you're only care about no I don't know any I've never met one conservative\nWhen it comes to a legal immigration that same will know let's let all the ... all the Asians in here illegally but not the people from Central America right over that\nNo my biggest concern is Canadian\n[laughter]\nWell I mean it's it's not only the only argument that they have is race so\nThat's the only argument that they can use that can't defend it right and McCain got into sanctuary cities you see how\nQuiet they got ... they got quite because they understand what the the one thing that I think even the the that people in the media understand is that those in power in the Democratic party actually do believe in open borders that's what they want they want open they won't reject open borders\nAnd so since they want to open borders as we said whenever they talk about campaign went up to the whenever they talk about comprehensive immigration reform you and I've asked well what would that be they never give you the specifics of what it would be because I Would think the comprehensive immigration reform to anybody out there\nWould be okay what we have to do is we get it would be to ... what do we do with the illegal immigrants that are here in this country that have been here for a significant period of time right and you and I both often said\nShe if you make the offer just see what the response would be from the left if you said okay\nLet's give legal ... let's give ... permanent legal status but not citizens ship or voting rights to every illegal immigrant that is but in this country since\nYesterday yeah right\nAnd from now on anybody who comes into the country illegally\n\nA must be sent back ... that we will give you everybody who was in this country as of yesterday gets permanent legal status and what do you think the response from the Democrats would be\nWell there's they're not they can't accept that the reason they can't accept that is because now they're at the point of wanting open borders\nIt is not about that because\nEven they realized that the argument doesn't change Twenty years from now assume that we did get politically on Capitol Hill agreement for that\nAmnesty and then\nStrong enforcement or the borders will Twenty years from now ten years from now five years from now we're still be people that you're coming here illegally that will be here that will that will get here and stay here for five years ten years whatever it is\nAnd the argument doesn't change so they know well forget about that we just want the open borders we just don't want\nTo have the borders at all come in and stay as long as you want\n[noise] I I have a challenge to the Democratic party\nGet together with the coalition of Democrats and put forth a comprehensive immigration plan we always hear them say that but they never explain what it would be ... and they're still saying it\nI'd I'd forgot who just set of recently but I I I burst out laughing but we need is comprehensive immigration reform that would include why tell me what it would include\nAnd be very severely obese but be specific and tell me or at least give her I said just the major stages of it that would be effective the major affective stages\nOf your reform plan what would they be\nI I think that you probably could go to the Republicans and you could get a comprehensive immigration plan that you could go to specific\nA congressman and uh and and senators and state to them say what would what would you want in your comprehensive immigration plan and they could and say we're totally they just wouldn't say\nComprehensive immigration plan so we asked a question to the left why can't you tell us what your comprehensive immigration plan would be is that a fair question right is that an outrageous question for us someone\nFor for for the two idiots overnight to ask right of any politician in Washington DC you keep saying comprehensive immigration reform tell us specifically what it would be give us the specifics and they won't do well why not\n\nBecause the leadership of the Democratic party wants open borders and prove us wrong\nProve us wrong come up with a comprehensive immigration plan show it to us and prove that we are wrong I Will be the first person to say okay I was wrong I Know I won't be wrong but [laughter] I'm wrong because there is your plan and you're going to stick behind it\nWell tell me one Democrat or a recently who is said and I mean at any one right now either running for office or that is in office that says and there's been promoting\nWe here's what we here's what I think we should do and it

matter to anybody\nRight now as we've said no one one of the things you may be the you might be the most loyal Republican the most loyal Trump supporter a and supporting the Republican Party now sorry\nThey don't care about the debt they don't care about the deficit and nobody does now it is gone caring for the the the the deficit and that goes across whether you're a Trump supporter whether you're a Republican supporter whether you're never Trump conservative\n\nA few conservatives care about it but as you and I said Eric this this is how quickly this country has changed\nThat in twenty Fifteen the\nBiggest issue remember the establishment and the swamp were who where did that originally come from ...\nThat originally came from the fact that when Paul Ryan became speaker of the house he would not go back and change the budget that they had passed a banner had passed and there was a theory\nAnd the the the whole swamp was created out of the Republican leadership including Paul Ryan\nThat would not control spending\n\nThat's ... you think about it that was one of the major points in Trump setting himself apart from other Republicans that he labeled them the swamp and said that's unacceptable we have to get spending out of control\nThat was three years ago\nWe had calls left and right we have to get the deficit under control that's why I'm going to vote for Trump that's not even a discussion anymore nope not nobody is having that discussion anymore eight is gone\nAs we said when you look at Congress right now you might have is what do we say half a senator or do we take the it would take to have some Senate yes three age of us right [laughter] 'cause even even if even Rand Paul showed he couldn't do that right\nWhen it came to the um medicate right when it came to Medicaid spending in his own state and\nAnd so uh it's a ... it it doesn't matter anymore so if there was ever a time for Democrats to roll this out all the free stuff it's now when the Republican Party\nDoesn't even care about deficit anymore and doesn't even care about that anymore Republicans don't care or for Republicans don't care this has a much better chance over the next\nTwo years of the Democrats telling you weren't going to take care of you from first mhm 'cause that's what it is right here from birth a thousand dollars in your account as soon as you're born\nAnd if you're poor

well no\nIt's not going to buy you a house you're oh man oh oh oh oh oh\nSorry I forgot where I ... I'm Sorry I forgot yeah I'd say right sorry I I Apologize Eric well because I because here's the thing to\nLook at the average cost of a home over the next let's say we start this in twenty or let's say we get it done and a twenty Twenty one in March or twenty Twenty one\nCory Booker wins or in in twenty twenty and she is inaugurated a and twenty Twenty one right so he starts his first term as president and they get this done in March and it takes effect that starts funding and twenty twenty two\nAt Eighteen years you're down to twenty forty what is the anticipated cost of the average new home in twenty forty\n[laughter] it's gonna be a lot more than fifty K. C. you didn't go big enough Mr Booker\n\nBecause of its education will no no no no no no no no but you're parties already offering you know the free college so they won't need it for that so what else retirement well we've already got Social Security\nSo and well they're not going to retire at Eighteen they won't be eligible you know they won't get that money until they're old so the retirement things not an appeal no it has to be to to buy a home not to put down on a home to buy a home he didn't go big enough\nAnd somewhere in there are some Democrats got to come across as we talked about earlier in the show and say\nWhat about three oh right because the\nCollege thing is it the Democrats are saying to him well no no no well first of all you know college fifty thousand it just depends on which college you go to fifty thousand isn't going to get you there if you're talking about a four year degree at some of those major colleges fifty thousand is not going to pay for that right it's not gonna pay for the whole home\nWell that's because I Do have you can go now you have a college has already paid for a member that's the other that that that that's my point your your colleague Mr Booker already doing the whole free college right so see so you got fifty thousand dollars close to fifty thousand is what forty six thousand bucks for the poorest of\nKids so we'll be up to forty six thousand when they're Eighteen right kids from poor families\nWell they're already get free college so they can't use it for that ah it's not gonna buy out so now they could put it down on a home and live in the home until they you know ah you know I guess the falls I mean but they're still going to have they're gonna have payments that's not helping me I'm going to have payments\nSo then the ten thousand dollars six to ten thousand dollars and\nGuaranteed income won't be enough to pay oh no no no no you have any you'll need another program in order to\nPay ... to ten thousand dollars a month if not a week\n[laughter] ...
