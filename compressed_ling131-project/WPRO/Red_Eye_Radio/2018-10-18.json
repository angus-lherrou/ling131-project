G.\nDiscovering that change line [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn ... definitely ... book is a mad catastrophe\nAnd we will follow Conrad with his delusions about how to defeat the Russians\nHe sends for army against the Russians who are overwhelming him from all directions she gives the order to march on ... which is well to the north this is Nordstrom the northern\nA policy the northern campaign that he's going to lunch but she doesn't use the few aircraft he has he doesn't use the cavalry has so he has no idea where the Russians are\nThe way you lay this out a ... I follow you very carefully Jeffrey is this a it is well known in Europe the Conrad campaign was ignorance an amateur tourism and he threw himself up against the Russians were any idea where they were\nNot exactly I think that the Austrian surprisingly to get a pass on on most of these things are they're viewed as having fought a gallon little war against the Russians scheme roller and this is to ignore the central reality here which is that\nWe're planning and you know since the seventies in Vienna in Berlin had assumed that the author Hungarians although numerically weaker than\nRussia I mean remember the population of Austria Hungary in Nineteen fourteen is fifty three million population of Russian where he's a it's a hundred and fifty million three times larger\nAs corresponding Lee larger army cheaply because they can afford it thanks to French financing part of the French strategy to hold off the Germans were bigger richer was to finance real ways and military expansion inside Russia so they knew they were they they'd known since the\nSince the late in the Eighteen hundreds of they were going to have to fight the Russians at some point\nIt was the strangest strategy was that the author Hungarians all those smaller would be qualitatively better\nThey would have a faster nimble are harder hitting army better trained better morale swift or and they would strike quickly into the Russian Empire\nAnd they would be real the the the presumably slower Russian mobilization by stray that the north stars you mentioned this pushing the lovely and the idea is\nBlow this northern blow that would hinge the Russian mobilization create chaos and allowed this more efficient Austria Hungarian Army to advance deep\nInto Russia and not not defeat the Russian Empire because there's no chance an army of\nForty five forty eight divisions is going to conquer the Russian Empire march all the way to Petersburg but no they could've really ruined the Russians back retarded their mobilization allowed the Germans to win and the west and then allow the Germans to redeploy two million troops to the east to finish off the Russians and so\nYou know the communist option to the Austrian did okay that they want a couple of frontier battles and it was only because a big Russian number ... there were thrown back but in fact\nThey knew they're gonna have to cope with the Russian numbers and those frontier battles that they are celebrated for having one home are often crossing were minor victory speaking in fact I argue in the book they aren't really victory as I say\nIt's like a a boxer who wins on points in the first round but didn't get knocked out in the second round claiming that he wasn't about you know in fact\nThey win these battles these early battles within the Russians pullback regroup\nCounterattack and destroy I mean literally destroy the stronger\nAnd all kinds of the arrogance of the Austrian Empire they believed they always had to attack the they were out numbered and the Russians learn to survive by digging in a shooting and then there's the ... as the U.S students got close to ... the Russians would run away and reposition themselves for the next\nFor the next contact and the Austrian never had anything to shoot out now that was just Austrians dialing it they'll they come off as if they're too arrogant to be in the battle they don't believe the Russians should oppose them\nWell you know I ... some of them some of them are certainly arrogance do you see officers you know in the book I Do it's robbers will say to them and oh just advanced the Russians are hiding in their trenches there's nothing to fear from them there's some areas there certainly\nBut the office of tactics the bullet the gate tactics charging\nA Russian gun lines and trenches really had more to do with the national in linguistics problems in the army there was just no way to get these multilingual true forward in any with any kind of precision if they'd been spread out and open order\nSo the ... the solution with the math them in the storm calm the ban it charges much like those used by Napoleon at the beginning of the nineteenth century and\nSend these massive storm called that the Russian trenches and this was absolute suicide the casualties were horrendous and the and the Russians were stupid\nFight there were like what army fight this negligent ally and foolishly\nThen not only were they attacking with these mass to ban it charges in the trenches that were bristling with quick firing artillery machine guns and magazine rifles but they were doing it without any artillery support and without ... in with one machine gun per battalion and the machine is\nOften didn't work ... point out in the book the troops to try to waterproof them smeared than with lard alarm clock the machine the machine gun couldn't fire safety conscious reports quickly 'cause they're not working but they didn't they only had laid off or they had no heavy artillery\nAnd uh so that the the the Austrian attacks\nAre slaughters absolute starting pitchers in the book to the shape the bloated black in the Austrian courses after every after every engagement\nThe two army than the one against the Serbs in the south pole T. R. S. army is turned back smashed back it will go back again and again and again but it smashed back and the army for Conrad going to the north runs into the Russians and his overwhelmed\nAnd when we return we'll be or how Austria explains itself because one of the things about Conrad in one of the things about ... is that they're always hurting\nThe rationalization for their memoirs each time they lose the battle the book is a mad catastrophe the outbreak of World War one and the collapse of the ... ... an empire Jeffrey ... the author I'm John ... this is the John ...

indictment alleges penny ordered the removal of documents from the Karolyi Ranch relating to announcers activities they're also images to remove all one's aimed at impairing the ongoing investigation of Nasser\nThe left is very good at slogans right so hoping change right Obama had hope and change how could you argue with hope and change you have to it's much more complex to explain our position wait a second or you always for change and I'll ask my students or you know where you're happy when you're younger and your parents are decided they were moving and they didn't ask you how about that change\nOr how about a change you know the taken away your car not every change is good but hope and change sounds fantastic\nSo those on our side or off and on the defensive even though as I said they're explaining the obvious the most recent case being parents with children trying to get asylum and you know why I'm mentioning 'cause it's happening now but I'll get to that in a minute\nSeeking asylum and President Trump and Republicans accused of ripping children of course there's the help of the media ripping children from their mother's arms and putting these children in cages\nNever mind that this was started under the Obama administration\nPresident Trump and Republicans are on the defensive never mind that if the parents of these children this is crucial but you're hardly ever heard of the parents of these children didn't come to the border and the first place there would be no issue\nNo one force them to come here they made a voluntary choice and we have a right to our sovereignty and to protect our borders and to decide who is welcome to enter just like we do with our homes\nThis is so obvious it's incredible that we have to explain our position but again\nThere's a simple right after ... you know you're ripping away from the parents how could you do that and we're on the other side having to explain things like what are coming here legally means why that's not acceptable\nBut the left and the Democrats and the media likely do not believe in having us you know our sovereignty but rather they believe in open borders\nBut they don't like to admit that because they know they would lose the argument\nWhich is why they would rather talk about tearing children out of their mother's arms is really bad they get to this set the debate and the terms of the debate when the media's on their side because no one's questioning that with comments like I'm throwing out there now you would\nNever mind that when anyone does something illegal and they're hauled off to jail their children do not go with them to a gym boys that a big one\nThat's a huge one you'll never see it when you know in the in the last time this happened and it's going to happen again with these hunters ah Honduras refugees coming you know seeking asylum that's going to happen very shortly whenever they get here\nYou never get to stay with your kid you can you can use the same phrase oh she was found guilty of robbery first degree robbery and put our child was ripped out of her arm you never hear the media say that but that's what happens in effect\nThere also and so to speak torn away from them why isn't it said and I was just in case the latest reincarnation of this conflict is is a news hundreds of Hondurans are heading for the U.S border in a mass migration to seek asylum\nSo again President Trump and the Republicans will be on the defensive just because they want to defend our borders and the media will again show crying children and distraught mothers you know what's gonna happen\nBut no one is forcing them to come here and we have a right to decide who gets to enter our house and under what circumstances\nAmong other things we have a right this is pretty obvious to it seems to me to protect the American people from harm weather from terrorism or disease we don't know the terrorists aren't coming through our\nOpen border or disease or we checking for diseases like we used to know or ... well you can't say come here and Russian or even for that matter this was important people don't talk about this\nTo make sure that people who come here share our values\nAnd just about every country does this including our neighbor immediately to the south of Mexico good try the same thing down there\nSome of us think this is also obvious but there have been huge forces arrayed against this common sense\nThe Democrats want more votes they will tell you that they they know illegal immigrants vote for them in huge numbers and the country club Republicans for lack of a better name they want cheap labor so you have a newspapers like the wall Street Journal I I stopped subscribing to it when they would have their editorials and it would talk about immigration in the title\nAnd then I mean they say illegal immigration the title and somewhere in the middle they would just sit switched immigration oh immigration has been a great for America over the years how could you you're in Iowa list right how could you oppose this this is insane but they would switch on us even though they pretend to talk about illegal immigration in the title\nOf course the Republicans are also the stupid party that's my party than McDonalds during that so you have people like George W. Bush and Karl Rove saying things like boy we can get this vote George W. Bush got up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote in Texas wonderful\nI'm not a math major but that seems like a formula for defeat\nAll Lawson politics by the way politics in particular a loss of sixty percent of forty percent is huge and that is based on an optimistic assumption most illegal immigrants come here for jobs but they also take advantage of government hand that says we know that the rest of us are paying for\nAnd by the way the Republican Party can never out do the Democrats in offering benefits\nI uh I think I use this phrase years ago when a ever voters given a choice between Democrats and Democrats meaning larger Democrats they choose the original ones they need us\nSo who these people going to vote for it's not that hard to figure out and if left unchecked the Republicans will never win a national election again\nSo even on a purely selfish basis it is clear that we need to control the border\nNot to mention fairness what do you say to the people around the world who have been waiting many years I've heard of people waiting a decade to get here but it has to undergo long waits on and says some paperwork to even have a hope of getting here so they have to follow the rules but those who dash across the border do not\nWhich is why a border wall makes sense among other tools is not the only thing but it's one of the tools so one color of this week and if you didn't hear suggests that border walls don't work in the long run\nAnd I said but even if that were true I bet they work in the short run while we try to clean this mess up and have an orderly procedure coming to our country\nIf to me it's the same ridiculous logic that the defenders of illegals murdering innocent America's like Americans like Kate Steinle use and I you know I pointed Geraldo Rivera 'cause I watch them do it time and time again saying oh illegals commit crimes percentage wise\nYou lower numbers the Native Americans as if\nThat matters who cares even if that's true if an American is killed or harmed by illegal immigrants that person would not have been hurt if that illegal had been denied entry no matter what the percentage isn't that obvious and that wall by the way in Israel preventing Hamas from murdering Israel's Israelis is working the room\nThe logic of these arguments is baffling to me unless you realize they have no real argument unless you change the words and the terms\nI more to say but I Know you have to go to a break shortly but let me give you the numbers in all going a little bit more in six six Ninety red eyes and that's the same as eight six six nine seven three three three nine\nSo example how can you ever justify sanctuary cities were criminal illegals or given safe harbor if you come up with phony arguments like illegals will not ... you've heard that they won't cooperate with the authorities if they know they can be apprehended or sent home so that's why it's important that you know we have sanctuary for them\nBut how about they not be allowed to come or in the first place and we wouldn't need to care they cooperated with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harbor and criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate watch this to the evil police officers at ice who have the audacity to arrest people commit crimes that said these guys are really clever on the left\nSo the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals through reading schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities so what's my solution\nYou take away the benefits like free health care and free schools you enforce strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you say in the first CEO to jail for hiring and illegal immigrant and will never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home\nRun the actually had a right to use the wrong language ... there we go again with language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would then say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no bad if I take it back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there were no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nWe but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they be saying for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake enough of the government's sending out the wrong message message with actions like ball legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents\nA country is United by

you're on with mark\nHow're you doing Mark I'm I just wanted to say that um maybe these um immigrants that are coming over to the u._s. um might want to be a little bit smarter and think about other places to possibly go that may be easier to get into\n'em if they have farming skills I mean South Africa or they're kicking people out of there and taking their farm so\nAh maybe but put together a band of you and\nSamir a guy that I think you have the the gall to go over there and make the protection of those people get paid some money or or use your farming skills and go over and help out South Africa because uh they're digging themselves into over right now so\nI hear your sarcasm delusion [laughter] ... yeah I I Do hear by the way you bring up a new story I don't know if it a lot of people know about South Africa's expert breeding the land of a lot of the citizens right and that's going to be a real struggle and I had a lot of them are going to resist right with the force\nAbsolutely absolutely yeah\nWe well it was you know when it takes me call when we meddle in other countries I don't mean coming to their aid and defense but like we did South African you gotta be careful what you get I ... and all this talk of makes me think Egypt right we we helped them over and throw a\nWhat's his name ... and I asked of the time I was doing National Review and I said wait a second that what they called the springs something what was the term anybody out there can tell me I've forgotten her for a second I'm\n... now and Brian was helping me and not their spring there was some something when spring but anyway uh the fact is we got where she got to ask that question what's what's after this so you got rid of Mubarak and you got the Brotherhood Muslim

that I think that um producer Brian so you know I'm I'm mentioning\nThe fact is that you you can't just do the spine when we did that in South Africa right you overthrow which you have and then you don't ask what's next is going to be attorney right open the best example might be Iran\nWe were so thrilled with Jimmy Carter to overthrow the shock yeah but they didn't ask goes next are you happy looking back and seeing what you've gotten and instead of the shah\nI ... the biggest enemy maybe or at least our enemy that's and you might say Russia China but certainly than the ... biggest immediate threat in terms of what they're doing to our citizens\nSo it's very important that you not just act emotionally I'm thinking coffee in Libya right Hillary was for that Obama was for that\nWhat is your place Libya with weren't didn't they killed Americans right\nIn ... in ... you just can't\nA parade let me get myself in trouble with somebody you now in Saudi Arabia we got a real problem there what they did was horrendous in my opinion the stone assassinate people like that and go inside and chopped them up and some people picked on me for that is that it's none of our business\nBut the other side of President Trump's got a huge problem now is they're our biggest supporters in ... you know besides Israel in trying to do work against Iran does Iran's their threat to\nThis world is very complicated and their offer no easy solutions or maybe you don't notice historically we had a war there was a war or not we between Iran and Iraq\nAnd you know you got to choose

I Would see this process saying we want to turn the country over\nOn the radicals who are worth a mob mentality\nAbsolutely well I I drink called Bruce I agree with you and you made a lot of great points and we need to protect our country you're absolutely right and I I as I said thanks for calling after I was last year director you too and let's go to AJ in Chicago EJ you're on with mark\n[noise] hey what's up man I'm I just want to say that actually the last caller had a lot of great only um the the biggest point that he had was that a\nLot of illegal immigrants coming to the United states uh believing that they have the right just or landing on this country um I think that\nYou know it's a lot more than just be your it's more of contributing\nIf you don't contribute your community the lowest sense or you don't you're not valuable in that sense so if you don't give a tribute to your country I think that's the highest sense which is what our military\nAnd uh most of our people who serve this country at the highest level can say\nThat they do um it's nothing they immigrate King County um so I Would say that I as a ... you should feel that um you come into this country to contribute to the absolute most\nIf you don't think you can do that and I don't know what your contribution to this country is I'm\nJust being here is not enough no they lean\nMm yeah I Do in fact I think you're anything that's something many of them come here and they wind up with an entitlement mentality right\nThey're entitled to serve as the hospitals schools whatever you want to say and and that you know what here's another great point once you give away for free I called the great point 'cause it's mind what you give away for free he's usually not value\nWhat you know you give free schools and they don't value the school you'll get free medical care they after a while people think it's coming to them so we even hurting them the the illegals because we're not making them value what we're giving them\nRight right so I I I think I have one final point you might find the point is that\nUh if if you take away a or given for free and what do you ... you know and if you come here with nothing and they expect the most um\nYou really can't deal with things that you should take at least a ... in my in my expectations of what I can give and what I can take it always has to do with what my contributions are at a comedy and I gave\nThe least then I won't be doing the worst if I ... and give most I Will be doing the best there or are you counting to anything whether it's a job\nWhether it's a service position whether it's anything at all or giving your your hundred percent ... should\nShould dictate and ... percent a tape that if you give your absolute least zero percent you're not going to get anything out of you know what I mean so\nI knew in Europe you reminded me of ... or if I could sure yeah let me ask you remind me of the story if I could share with you\nWhen I was teaching younger kids in elementary school when I first started out now I teach adults you know what the kids would do with a free lunch you have any idea what they do that they would throw in and they would take the ... they would take the green\nPeas and toss them all over the cafeteria\nBecause they got it for free and they place no value on it so in any sense ... in a funny sense\nEven with the illegals they they not only is an entitlement mentality but we're not even helping then because they didn't earn any if this were just giving it away from nothing and then we're surprised when they don't even value being in America and they don't share you stake in the community and give it a values in fact\nWe made it so easy that there are now communities where people don't even learn to speak English because everything's done for them in Spanish and I love this bank people yeah they they're mostly in my classes that's not the issue so we actually in a funny way\nDone harm to them and the other gentleman the other caller said we you know we should not abandon the fight yeah but you do need someone to express it in a way that the American people it is a winning issue and that's what he said\nThat the American people can sign onto it we're not even helping the illegals yeah you say in the short run they're getting free benefits and stuff not in the long run\nNot in the long run do they value what's so special about being in the United states of America and there are set America One caller challenge me on that\nRecall thanks so much AJ and you haven't

something on the top of everybody's mind so I think the industry in general I understand from beginning to understand the importance of things like air pressure but just to throw an idea out there that maybe not all our listeners here all the time is checked your trend that check your tread that's particularly on door will positions where\nTires or bolted together and essentially forced\nTo rotate down the road at the same speed because for two dollars in your local truck stop you can find a ... gauge anything beyond one eighth of an inch difference or\nCalmly refer to as for thirty seconds from the tire industry between door positions can really add to rolling resistance to not only does it add the rolling resistance to tears up your tires faster in in a lot of cases\nIt's a similar condition in terms of a fuel economy as having maybe a break tracking that may be a tad bit out there for the listeners to really key in on because mismatched treads apps on doors can really add to rolling resistance\nThis has been the merit George driver report Roger you buy pilot flying J shell roads hello and merits ... after market run with the\nWhole book with ... ... ... ...

goal is talking about a century city century state and about the people voting for them and I just wanted to I I live here where we vote on that\nCertainly not a bad name and the whole state of sanctuary space which I don't I don't know how many of the city's pay attention to him I Know some of them have actually voted against a following his directions but I don't recall ever hearing any voter that sanctuary city that here and you know the ones you\nKnow it wasn't so they ... on it it's just that the Democrats in office a very liberal extremely leftist a Democrat is in office and he just decided that's a good idea does it and I from what I understand San Francisco's kind of a dump yeah partly\nWhat it is when I was there a few months ago and I'm using it was amazed when I was walking the streets with\nMy kid or someone yelled at us now look at this hand this hand as a weapon and then another time something ... someone says something about a night that doesn't count how

first but\nYou have you heard the thing about the uh um birth tourism and it was on our throat gets\nMentioned this just a few people and they've got her to that and actually it was on television some some time ago on twenty twenty dateline or one of those where they fly on the east of Chinese women that are pregnant and they have this place all set up and they go there and they have a baby and get their little American citizenship for the baby and leave\nAnd then leave yeah no I actually I did hear that pregnant women going into hospitals yep they've got to figure it out and look people take

them and they had heard of that so I'm I'm Glad to get to see it on national radio so people can know what's going on it's we're very close to the border here so it's I mean people come over here and dumped the baby's all the time I say down from I mean they have them and I and I just\nI don't think it's right I don't think a lot of the country and the other countries in the world do that\nNot somebody had a major in Italy I said the baby out deals citizenship and they said no it was part of an air force us air force base so I don't know why we're handing out citizenship like if I can but

we ... civil discussions you know at the end of the parties that he put on his house or whatever and the kids were best friends you know it was amazing it was I I really thought he was going to get violent\nIt it's it's gotten really bad so I I don't look forward to they'll send you sang asking them to be civil I we've pass those days we've really pass those are\nPretty pretty discouraging and we I'll speak for myself I Know people who think like I on my side we think they're misguided that they got the wrong ideas and they think ... one of the other things I threw out\nWas they have such hatred for President Trump and they have no idea that a lot of us hated President Obama the same way but there was no resistance we just waited patiently until his term was up I Want them to be the first time I thought he was a disaster maybe the worst president in our history\nWhile we wait until it happened yeah we did everything politically we could and they picked on us because ... a Senator McConnell said Mitch McConnell said you know you want to do when we can to get rid of my forget how we phrased it that's about the most we say\nBut these guys this whole are saying you know I don't agree with Michelle Obama when they go low we we kick them or whatever they he said I Can't remember the other on your rights saying we're not going to be civil until we get back in power\nWell that makes sense on her case because you can never take not being in power right there for sale anyway and the hot sun this this is not good a man there is okay I have a gym you live in Portland I'm just looking at it again your mayor doesn't even want to please do anything right\n... yeah if I recall that real close but that's my understanding it or or if he would uh I I thought I heard one anecdote most of my news I I don't read the newspaper so much I get it on the radio and word of mouth and it's like a a thought the uh the uh ...\nRecording in ... one word of mouth straight they were the victims a lot a lot of people trying to do their daily lives you know I'm thinking what would hit you know I mean it uh it it's appalling frankly I'm a little ashamed of I'm not having the guts\nTo uh uh you know a ... not having the guts to ah ah have everybody obey the same laws\nNo is it that you're such a nice guy I don't want to disagree but it's not a matter of cuts that's what he believes is a leftist he believes are probably supports than it is it's not because he doesn't have courage and that's who he is probably probably supports them and it's worse than you think it's worse than do you think\nYou know he campaigned on the different uh you know with the different personality or different persona that the it's like what we got this what we're calling us you\nKnow that's always the case I said the left doesn't want to admit that they want to impeach the president is going to be chaos in this country if they'd retake the house they don't want to tell you when it's time to raise taxes that they want to raise taxes I rushed it but Michael Dukakis if you remember\nHis campaign was destroyed when he announced that he was in favor higher tax actually I think it was ... he had a
