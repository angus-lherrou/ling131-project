Anastasia Grady for the wall Street Journal editorial board she's the America's columnist and editor watching the story from Puerto Rico these last month since September hurricane of last year\nThe debate has been about excess deaths following the hurricane to Puerto Rico I followed the story was married to her columns because Puerto Rico was what was a mess afterwards with tangled and failed electricity generation\nAnd the inability of the Puerto Rican FEMA a executives to respond in a in a credible fashion uh also Puerto Rico has longstanding problems with debt and electrification it didn't occur to me that that was going to wind up into a political toy\nTo use against the Trump Administration in these last week's marry your reporting about access more excess of mortality yeah after the hurricane struck Puerto Rico I think the salient fact here is if you've got nothing to compare this to because that's not how the national weather service things\nYeah well the the the headline of course was that three thousand people died in a hurricane and of course the implication is this happened under Donald Trump there for Donald Trump has not enough money in Puerto Rico and doesn't care about Puerto Rican people and by the way you know let's extend that to all Hispanics you know it was very much politicized\nAnd I'm so that kind of got my attention for two reasons first of all um there's a very prominent meteorologist who wrote a wonderful essay about this particular study it's a study done by George wash at George Washington university's milking Institute\nAnd what they tried to do was measure how many people died between September of two thousand Seventeen and the following I Believe was the end of February so basically six months on end the hurricane was of course at toward the end of September\nAnd what they tried to do is look at what would be than normal mark ... rate over that period of time and then what was excess of over that and they attributed that to the aftermath of hurricane\nAnd this meteorologist by the name of John ... who is actually born I think in New York but I spent quite a bit of this like in Puerto Rico is a Puerto Rican mother\nUm he made it very um a sensible statement that number one this is not how anybody measures hurricane fake holidays\nSo to all of a sudden this extended the six months when hurricane fatalities are generally a measured in a shorter period of time is kind of disingenuous\nOn top of that you have this study at the milk and Institute you have another study at Harvard and you have another study at I think it was Penn\nAnd these studies can have different time frame\nAnd they they can they can use different methodology and his point was that for example if you look at the Harvard study that was he the Harvard study came out and said that somewhere between seven hundred and some people and eight thousand and some people were excess mortality\nIn four months or three months after the hurricane\nThat's a huge window and so what the reporters do is they chose the midpoint of those two numbers and they said this is how many people died well that is far from an exact science um and there's something similar was done it wasn't such\nBroad window but it was something similar was done with the milk and Institute and so I just wanted to point out that you know you have the period of time\nDuring the hurricane and then of course you know off obviously find bodies and people who have died that it didn't count initially and I think the government's count is somewhere around sixty four so to stand up to three thousand you have to start assigning\nProblems of the hurricane to um problems in the aftermath in other words it wasn't really the storm it wasn't a high wind\nIt wasn't applying for infrastructure and the uh the emergency exactly and that's\nThat's not how hurricane death are counted that's point number one point number two is to blame this on the federal government I think is really disingenuous when you look at\nThe way that Puerto Rico has been manage I mean I Would say over the last Twenty years at least um you have a lot of the of basically\nRun away populist them on to the point where the electricity company was giving away electricity and when you don't collect a revenue for your electric company you can't reinvest you can strengthen the grid and you become extremely vulnerable to the storm\nThat's what happened and this is a government run electricity company that's been a private company\nBut Mary don't remember correctly that the executives in charge of FEMA's office in Puerto Rico were locked in politically to the governor of the island and that a lot of blame shifting has been going on because that's political advantage in Colombia in Puerto Rico nothing to do with Washington\nYeah I mean I was very critical at the time of the hurricane the week after of the way that FEMA behave but not I mean you know the implication is always that Washington doesn't care about Puerto Ricans but in fact\nThe the guy the guy on the island was a Puerto Rican the guy who was running the operation\nAnd he basically in my mind you know messed up because he was saying in in the weeks after the crisis when they're still with no electricity for dialysis patients and all kinds of basically the hospitals were and really bad shape and you have\nPeople who need it electricity and he said well I have the generators but how was I supposed to know that the companies were not going to be able to deliver the hill now I think that's\nPreposterous you're an emergency management writer and he was a Puerto Rican so this wasn't a you know the idea that that bunch of people over here on this on the mainland didn't care about Puerto Rico is she said that FEMA messed up and that and that included have\nMary we have thirty seconds is Puerto Rico learned a lesson is there any indication that they're going to be prepared for another storm thirty seconds\nNo I don't think so I mean they're still blaming a President Trump and not taking responsibility and until they when they're rewriting the narrative in this way it indicates to me that they just want to keep shoving off their responsibility for managing the island to the rest of us\nMary Anastasia gravy for the editorial board of the wall Street Journal she's the America's editor and columnist on John ... this is the John ...\nDuring the civil war it was called soldiers' heart after World War two they called it grows stress reaction\nIt's

talk fast talking sports it's time to leave this news and weather from the revolution soft washing the news on\n\nLong\nNominee to be made\nPublic majority leader Mitch McConnell called this just another attempt by the Democrats to throw sand and the gears the goalposts kid getting moved the Senate's democratic leader Chuck Schumer couldn't let that one do\nThe goal of the man to complain about a one week away for an FBI here and when he held up a nominee for the Supreme Court and kept the seat vacant for ten months is that the FBI\nHas until the end of the week to complete its investigation and then says McConnell the Senate will vote Lindy can young Capitol Hill\nSaying that and then some MSNBC to for some reason they've been kept out of the discussion completely\nYeah yeah right right and and it's I think the you know what you're saying here really is that I mean it goes back to that buzzfeed\nUm the the editor at at at buzzfeed\nSaying this is how we see are you know are journalists now ah and\nFor the foreseeable future basically as active is is this what he was saying that was the message and that's exactly what you're seeing right now since saying\nWell we got a ton of things to ah to talk about the background check could be completed today was interesting the story that said you know our discussion is in our personal meaning a where the lawyers for Dr Ford are are\nAre saying look she hasn't been you know you haven't interviewed her yet yeah right and I saw store yesterday saying the FBI may not interviewer because she's already been interviewed right what we keep ... and we even because\nAgain because when you're talking about the FBI everybody thinks about an investigation this is not an investigation right so all they are looking for is more witnesses and any new information what other witnesses are there\nAh you know are out there what were the allegations that were made\nRight ... ... what were the allegations that were made again here or in you know that that uh you know in the hearing\nThat caused because it was after the hearing okay we need to have the FBI do further background check okay what's the new news out there and I started thinking I said why wouldn't they interview and I'm like oh it's not an investigation into\nBackground checks they already know what you said\nNone of them now I don't know I mean they may interviewer but I I was thinking well why wouldn't they and I went oh she's already been interviewed\nAnd then as you interviewed by the Judiciary Committee and so what they're looking at is okay what other information is is out there what other witnesses are out there what did she say at this hearing right\nAnd we will go talk to those people because she's the one making the allegations she's the one that testified under oath we don't need to interview\nWell she made her statement in fact she ... to the Senate\nIf there were any thing uh that she anything else she wanted to introduce introduced\nTo this scenario to this a process chicken ... she can do right now she could what she could still do it right and uh she and she had the opportunity to do it last Thursday but the great point you just made she still has the opportunity it's still open right\nAnd so what they don't have is they didn't have we didn't have witnesses making statements\nSo she's the one making the allegations so they're checking out her story mhm and if she doesn't updated with the Judiciary Committee the FBI maybe looking at the same welders ... look to see the allegations she made here some people she mentioned we talked to those people we give you a report\nWell because here's what the people said we don't need to interview her her statement is on record we need to interview all the other people that she made the allegations against or claimed that they were witnesses she has made her statement right we have that and then she wishes to change it and go back to the she can write a letter to to the Judiciary Committee\nStating a here's more information and then the FBI can go check that but they're not doing a here's the point they're not doing a background check on Dr for no they are not there doing the background check\nOr on the allegations that she made against Kavanaugh now we've\nTalked in recent days about the the possibility of her perjuring herself\nBy telling a different story to the FBI but really when you think about it and you back away from the whole thing and you look at the\nThe entire forest and not just the the you know the trees here than you or ... you very quickly come to the conclusion that there's likely zero political will to go after her for perjury unless she came out and said everything I said was false and my testimony\nRight and I I admit that I was lying about that they\nThey would then but but any kind of you know variants in a story to the FBI likely is not going to be pursued a by the chairman a Grassley or by anyone in the house I\nKnow and I you you see Grassley saying they want to investigate the fact that her boyfriend says something is something else because she was asked the specific question have you ever helped anybody a you know to ... you know how to take a polygraph test and she said no and her boyfriend is said yes but I view that\nAs putting pressure on her credibility politically in order to get the votes look\nOnce the votes on ... vote is made if he is if he has come from it's done it's over yeah right it's a ... this is this won't even be a topic next week we'll be back on we'll be back on the Russian collusion\nYeah yeah yeah it is not a ... and and I guess this is it\nIs it the whole I on the ball thing this has to be the process is is really to determine you know uh whether the those handful of senators actually uh believe he should be seated or not\nAnd that that's it that's actually the only question here the media and the and the left in the media and social media want you to believe it's about Kavanaugh\nAnd you know and and you must\nThink that he is you know a rapist or whatever they want to label him as now that's how you build political pressure but actually just what a five weeks out from the mid term election\nIt's it is it's different because they're going to look at the polls it's the polls that build that pressure and I mean the polls on the candidates themselves not whether they believe that you brought us to pull the other night of while at when you introduced the facts to the case\nMore people believe in fact it was a majority\nYeah ... have you seen it you know fifty fifty seven percent than a change what they think and then when asked well if the FBI comes back with their report ... 'cause once ... once they were told that the three witnesses to cooperating witnesses that she named\nDidn't cooperate if they said oh okay well then he should be confirmed and then write that it was fifty seven percent than they said well if the FBI does the background check and finds out no new information was sixty percent of Americans believe that he should be confirmed\nA at a you know at that point and of course you're gonna forty percent of America's we said you know roughly it's forty percent Republican forty percent Democrats and the rest of her into the other twenty percent is roughly independence and that's what you're trying to\nUh you know that that's who you're trying to convince those in the middle ... those are the senators were looking at as well right and so uh that will that that you know who knows that that poll probably was looked at by a lot of those\nAre a lot of those or a senator so I'm a you know I I think the whole thing of the doctor for commit the you know about perjury ... on that will remain a you know will remain an issue I don't know whether they would\nI doubt I'd be surprised if they if they confirmed him this weekend ... I think it's all done yet either go to another and then they and they will do anything they they move on they move on to the uh the the the next thing they move on to promoting the fact\nUh if I was the Republicans I Would promote the fact that you know we you know the ... the we you know the Supreme Court you know we've got\nWe've got the Supreme Court going up to the ... election\nAnd that would be promoting NAFTA irks me NAFTA or whatever it is now us MCA [laughter] yeah I'd I'd be promoting the the the the trade deal and Republicans you know the you know we're going to be voting on a that before the term I'd be talking about all the positives\nAnd that I'd be talking about also what your political enemy uh spouses and you would reflect on what has happened you know in the campaign\nAnd I think that's what they would focus on at that point uh I just don't think that they would look backwards who knows I mean whether they could have a a a separate committee of you know continuing investigation as to whether she did commit perjury and ... and and not make it high profile because there would be no hearings it would just be an investigation and down the road\nA as a warning shot to anybody who might do it to a a you know a future\nNominee with you know try to come in and and commit perjury if they could prove it probably was perjury right you know they might they might do that as long as it was low key yet I don't you're not going to hearings on that or a big to do on that because once they confirmed him\nThe battle is over we must colors to well they shouldn't go after every Democrat no the winner is you can you get him\nA on the Supreme Court yep after that that's the victory that's the super bowl\nYeah that's it uh and and I think Republicans to a ... you also campaign on look\nAh this this this kind of battle may not be behind us necessarily\nWhile it is specifically with cabinet or there's a real possibility that this president whether in this term or maybe in his second term would not would have the opportunity to see another justice and\nThat's a big deal we know how now we know what levels the ... to which the left is willing to go and we need people to vote\nEight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nAccuweather hung a voice of southern New England news talk Ninety nine seven of him and I am six thirty WPRI [noise]\n\nSome point when one W.

come into the discussion here uh this is about his performance in his performance when you have\nThe the mainstream Democrats in the Senate on the United states come out and make the claim that due process doesn't matter than an allegation enough\nIs enough for them to charge you\nAnd believe that you committed a sexual assault upon someone without any evidence I Believe it is totally justified in that manner to get angry his crime started not because of him\nHis crime started because of his compassion for his wife his daughters and when he really got emotional it was of the women that has stood by him knowing\nThat in the atmosphere the highly charged atmosphere that we live in today were Democrats and liberals will do anything\nTo destroy your life that these women stood behind him for him to get emotional I thought was extremely appropriate based on the\nUnfounded accusations against him and the certainty of one side of the Senate that he committed this crime these crimes without the evidence there is no I I Love it it's\n... as a judge you should you should never show almost never show emotion you should never be human I disagree I think judges should understand compassion\nWell if if if he had been very clear calm and directing the response you would have been cold he would have been said that they would have been set by the left this guy doesn't have

what are the allegations against you\nAnd how deeply personal it has become the jak has become person not not just in that room on that day last Thursday but in his home\nAnd and and dealing with his children and the people suggesting that he has no place in working with children as a volunteer right that's deeply personal and frankly I'd be concerned if he didn't get upset about it but the\nThe things that I Know I got angry about were strictly professional ... they weren't personal attacks on me and still professionally I automatically right if you look at him professionally professionally\nWhen it came to asking him questions\nAbout anything he was ... about his job ... and his decision he was calm and he was a cool and he answered all of those are questions with a with a great sense of humor\nWe're talking about the first hearing mhm and he answered all the questions there was no anger it was the personal attacks\nCame his way the unfounded in his mind personal attacks came his way that he again and by the time we got to that particular point of the the uh the the the hearings\nAh you know it was certainly the un committed sexual assault ...\nYes\nAnd it was labeled with others especially by Democrats as a gang rape but\n\nThis is that's how far they were willing to go right\nSo\nIt was personal and it was ... from ... and ... people take that personal and and I believe that is how I Would expect someone who believes that they are innocent how they would respond I Know it's how I Would\nRespond yes and if you think the judges are human and they don't get angry even when they're on the bench presiding over a case then you know ... you know very little\nAbout courtrooms it's just and we understand that the last caller Shannon we understand

letter to Dr Ford's lawyer were were were question more information specifically rationally wants the therapists notes all audio or video recordings produce during the course\nOf the polygraph examination of Dr Ford all written audio visual or um\nAny information given to a reporter or anybody else at a media organization\nA\nAnd has said that some of the material has been passed down to a national circulated newspaper or not provided to the Senate and he proposes a proposes this is suggest to let a lack of candor\nAdjacent to those requests just curious paragraph this National Review the full details of Dr Ford polygraph or secular early important because the Senate Judiciary committee has received a sworn statement from a long time ... doctor forge a sworn statement he's been under oath now\n... stadium that he personally witness Dr Ford coaching a friend on polygraph examinations when asked under oath in the hearing whether she'd ever given any tips for advice to someone who was planning on taking a polygraph Dr Ford replied never the statement racist specific concerns about the reliability\nOf her polygraph examination result she continued the Senate therefore needs this information it'll be interesting well they give it to\nOr a is gradually using this as a defense that when they don't\nThen they can expect to send it to delay it any further right right and\nOr make any other choice in terms of the vote because I think this is clearly by the chairman yeah I think this is\nWell it works in in on both levels they handed over a new review it or they don't handed over and you essentially look at the you you send it on to the Senate majority leader and say well we've done our due diligence\nBecause if you're looking for and looking at evidence and and you can't get any other witnesses to back up what she's saying then what you want to see is All right what was the process especially\nWith the uh any video or audio that was recorded during the polygraph the you know they they ask for that before the hearing they ask for that ah\nThe weekend before the ... the hearing a couple of weekends ago and her attorney basically said no it's not relevant of course that's relevant because you say that she took and passed a polygraph test\nWell we need to see the methodology and the polygraph test to see that you know what questions were asked\nUm and and again how the how the process on that level work I think that's fair\nYou know the thing is when you make an allegation you have to be willing to provide all the evidence that you have used to cooperate yup you're allegation to begin which which is a lie detector test right if you don't end and nobody well I'm sure somebody's brought that up but\nThat has to be brought up because just like the fact that when you used in say these are the witnesses these people witness it and they say no and then you say I took a polygraph a test will have you ever helped anybody else take a polygraph test you know in in you know trying to beat is what they're trying to say\nNo I never did well when you get a sworn witness dating nope I Know she I I you know I Know she did well then you want all relevant notes\nBecause she is using the she is using the polygraph as cooperation that there is credibility to our accusation therefore she should be willing to give everything over to the Senate Judiciary committee so they can verify\nThat the lie detector test was done in a legit way\nRight and and and that's again part of the process because if you believe it was legit you're promoting it as legitimate\nThen you have no problem you're telling the truth right and the process that part of the process was done thoroughly thoughtfully\nAnd in order to get the results that it was always going to again because she was always telling the truth right\nHer attorneys on Tuesday implored the FBI to interview her and act\nOn investigative leaves leads they have provided for its

Radio Welcome to the show\nIs doing good\nYeah I just wanted to make a point with uh with this was before lady\nYou know I think maybe the FBI doesn't really want to talk to her because if she says anything more I mean everything she said right now has been vague\nIf she says anymore and exposing yourself to perjury or perjury and herself and one that's not going to be a good look for the FBI I mean they don't want to be picking on someone that obviously has mental problems\nBut I think there are attorneys trying to push her to actually try and talk more isn't in her best interest I'd say a kind of obviously shows where their agenda is not in her ... her interest\nOn well I I I actually there and and I'll add to that I'm questioning whether or not they're being genuine in that in that situation oh yeah whether they already knew that the FBI would not be talking to her and it and now they're going to be able to label\nThis as an unfair uh interview process because the person may not even the person making the claim was interviewed and that's how the ...\nAnd when the FBI or you know again when you call it an investigation you would have ... they need to interview they need to investigate you know everything that's going on here well it's not an investigation into background jak they have her statement they have his statement all under oath and so what do they do they go and talk to all the witnesses\nOr that they that they have or that they have mentioned while being under oh ... that's what you would do with a background check and I you know and and I don't know and\nNow there is no investigation yeah right the minute it becomes an investigation she opens yourself up to having committed a crime along with a few other people\nI think she's lucky this just this is just an inquiry into his background\nA well look I you know it's they don't want to give you know the ... the boat one piece of cooperating evidence that we happen to examine is the polygraph test\nAnd they're now and go and and and the therapist note and they're not willing to give any of that to the Judiciary Committee right why not why not\nBecause they they are going to tell a completely different story than what she said\nAnd there ended that would I have well I I think that's they they know that it's going to likely destroy a further destroy the roadway that her credibility\nAnd by the way if as I said earlier if she has if she has something else to say to the Judiciary Committee under road ... can put it in a letter and and state any corrections walk I Want to correct sworn testimony ...
