be covering all the different news items out there a Nikki Haley\nSays the UN ambassador you know the interesting thing is we have gone now over twelve hours ... and nothing has leaked yeah and I do you know why you know why she's ... right even though it seems it seems that\nAnd all the media was jumping on this ... immediately in fact who was it was at MSNBC or CNN or somebody who's making the thing while she's out because of the Kavanaugh stuff and it was like yeah come right right I mean I maybe I saw that on social media that's where I ...\nI don't I don't want to die to anybody who didn't make that statement right right well I Believe I saw that on Twitter ... and and I can't remember who did it\nIs it you know Twitter flies by so quickly but they were just pounded out immediately that oh she's quitting because ... going to be a Supreme Court\nA justice apparently this has been in the works a uh a while and it seems to to be right now\nThat most people really have no idea but they sense that she only wanted to be there for two years because she's staying until the end of the year which means he writes she's been there two years and by the way that happens quite frequently get into ministry and somebody will come in put in two years gets you go in and they they want to move on to something else everybody is\nIs trying to predict what she's going to do whether she's going to run for president\nUh and I like the you know the uh a scenario that that ah she's out ah you know there and what was the scenario all I Know it's just an aerial had\nHad um bad is going to run and twenty twenty ... he's going to be the veep it in a death no ... no [laughter] it ended with Jeff Sessions or you know a a you know being out of a ...\nOf being attorney general I ... yeah ... sorts of conspiracy theories we looked at it and say well we'll wait and see we don't really deal with conspiracy theories here right or a you know she she did good I mean she was if you look at one of\nThe people that he brought in early that actually worked out she was one of the few yeah\nWell and I think she goes out on a strong note is absolutely a few ah ... anything could happen in the next three months but I don't I don't think it's going to change the demeanor\nAnd uh and and the fortitude of of someone like a Nikki Haley if you listen to her words at you and if you live if you look at a you know her positions are and how how strong she's been for the\nPresident ah that is that\nIs a very unique position to be in for its especially for this particular president who's not afraid to speak his mind and himself I think has been very strong we look at his un speech recently and I think he ... he did a great job\nAh and and he's been very clear on his positions or if\nYou look at a having a Michael Bolton a at [laughter] John both of his ... and it's not there yet what\nOh man I Love you so bad remake [laughter]\nIn the White House halfway [laughter] John Bolton I by the way I'm Michael Bolton could be a a he could be a good national security advisor\nHe would scare them other people [laughter] oh so you're a singer now that guy don't yet know the guy from office space a no is there a Michael Bolden from offices yeah that was his member that was a was already named ... ... I didn't watch office space\nOh no no no no no no you don't want I'm thinking I'm thinking the off the office now I Would not allow a hundred percent not on no no no our office space on his face the movie\nRight the yeah the iconic movie the iconic movie yeah I don't get it out safely today more coffee please yeah okay but if you have John Bolton by your side I don't know if I can play with you I Know I Know maybe I should have brought booze\nOr but if you have John Bolton by your side is national security advisor if you have a Nikki Haley in places you an investor my question is how do you feel Nikki Haley shoes I Know what you an ambassador and it's\nOne of those um odd jobs where you know you're kind of just basically in this case your the the mouthpiece for the president you're going to you're going to go out to the world to the other nations and you're going to\nI'm a ... advise them as to what the policy is going to be\nBut in the scenario where you have a John Bolton and you have a my palm payout did I get that one right um the [laughter]\nThe strength I think right now of this cabinet and staff or it and and I put Nikki Haley in there is is is right now I mean ... and we could maybe in the first\nYear you could go in and you could poke holes and and people did with Tillerson a as secretary of state saying he's not the right guy and ultimately he wasn't\nBut if you look at it\nRight now where it's set up and I'm Talking about national security wise and where we are with countries like Iran North Korea\nUh and and and even some of our um you know a Saudi Arabia you know the president's stance on the Saudis recently\nUm I think\nIt requires somebody of significance Frank I'm not saying there's not anyone there what it's going to have to be somebody who has that strength that can go to the un and do what you I I don't mean\nTo downplay the importance of the UN ambassador but it is somebody who can if if you're looking for quality ... you're you're not necessarily looking for a quality of the normal presidential spokesperson\n... and and I'm Talking about Sarah Sanders okay I'm Talking about the normal one where you know if you look at all the you know the the ...\nThe presidential spokespeople over the last you know just like what Twenty years later you look at them and you just said because remember their their parenting what the administration wants their parents and their message right and and the thing that made Sarah Sanders how can be so great is she's directed in your face and that is actually\nThe way and and you want to project the image of the president of the United states that you represent mhm so imagery of being able to take what the president says yes and speak at the un with that same kind of force that she did\nIs what you're looking for and I can't tell you because I haven't seen\nYou know I I really haven't seen in that setting any of the the people that I hear so far maybe up or I've never see them I've never witnessed them speaking in that particular matter one thing that I wanted to say about a a Nikki Haley though\nUh and and just shows you how the the the mainstream media is just nuts\nBecause they would always ask her and I love this question it rarely is asked to anybody who serves in a Democrat presidents or a cabinet and but\nWell what would you disagree with the president how do you deal with it of course I'm going to disagree with the president because my job is not to promote what I Believe it's to promote what the president believes right so of course we're going to have differences but if we have differences we talk about it but it's his administration that I serve in\nIt's like you arrive at one of the reasons we would have trouble ever worked right in any administration\nIs because we have a we would have a problem promoting something that we didn't believe in right and there are there are people that and and again I have nothing against people who do that that's your job your job is to\n... what the administration wants you repeat what the administration wants to the world when you are un ah you know UN ambassador the problem with you and I have been talk show hosts too long we just\nWe could we probably couldn't do that or we will get frustrated that are doing that even if the president was even if we thought the president was Ninety percent right we want to get our ten percent in well you can't do that when you're a UN ambassador you have\nTo be the national security advisor to be said to be in that position I mean not only that that he that he talks to the public but he's an advisor as opposed to someone who is mimicking or or ... ...\nAnd and both inside the same thing you know because when when they asked him well you know a fight or a [laughter] heads on John Hope [laughter] John Bolton was asked that he's ... he's always has these they said\nWell look when when you were ... ... when you were ah you know when you were whatever ah ah ...\nFive years ago you said this and now you're saying this and he said well this is what the president which to do I was a private citizen back then the president believes that everything has

I. M. W. B. R. O.\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo ... and early on red eye radio [noise] and I'm\nGary McNamara longer they're hardly eight six six Ninety red eye\nMeteorologist Tom hailed joins us right now the get ... get caught up on hurricane Michael good morning Tom\nGood morning I'm Renee how are you guys doing doing well ah what do we know about\nMichael uh in the current conditions and what we expect over the next uh twelve to twenty four hours\nWell I I Wish I could say that this is going to be a pretty picture but it it's not um I Am encouraged by a number of the reports of indicated that a lot of people have evacuated Panama City\nUh also uh down all the way through St or a saint Joe an Appalachian coal and and that southern point a then of course from their up to Tallahassee now folks in Tallahassee I\nSome of them have been boarding up and all that but what we can expect is really simple right now it is a category three\nHurricane that means sustained wins at a hundred and twenty five miles an hour and for those of you who are kind of geeky can write this down the minimum pressure is nine forty seven nine forty seven Mila bars and it's moving to the north it\nAt twelve miles an hour right now it is two hundred and twenty miles to the south south west of Panama City now it's in the northern direction so for it to actually hit\nThe target which right now is estimated between Panama City and the tip of Appalachia cola\nOr it's going to have to make a little bit of a right turn and so in simple terms what people are going to expect is in some significant or whether that they have not seen that in their lifetime um\nWell it's not totally fair to say that well no I I guess it really is um because I expected\nIn the next advisory to go up five or six miles an hour if it goes up six miles an hour it'll qualify as a category for hurricane and a category for hurricane hitting this post according to the national weather service outta Tallahassee would be the strongest hurricane on record to hit\nThe Florida Panhandle coastline\nYeah so\nYeah and and that's ... that's the strongest down on record yeah we we talked earlier that you know ... down the coast a little bit into the category five hitting in sixty nine that doesn't have the state of that that that part so you have an idea of what wins and and and that's the point when you talked about you know you get to a category\nAh for hurricane you're talking about winds over a hundred and thirty one miles an hour that's a little different than maybe you're a hurricane one where you may have eighty mile an hour winds arena five mile an hour winds so it's a completely different ball game is right\nExactly and when we get to the category three it changes we call it a major hurricane a category one and two are not major hurricanes but they're still I mean we saw a category to Florence\nA it was a category three briefly but we saw Florence come in and get we did coverage here on right on the radio for four days with Lawrence and that puppy just hung along the coastline\nAnd this is not going to be the case here by tomorrow or as this moves its way out of here it's wins will be affecting the Florida and south and North Carolina\nShoreline and in fact the last time there was a storm of that kind of situation that came through was Kate in Nineteen eighty five and Kate's case Kate\nAt the same time it's wins wrapping around the giant Winfield were causing storms and uh and tornados along the Carolinas and the Carolinas have got a\nPretty good chance of of multiple tornadoes associated with this and and\nYou know anyone in this entire area of the Big Bend and the panhandle uh are are going to basically relate to\nA cake which happened to be in Nineteen eighty five um but this is going to blow Kate out all the water\nTom in terms of the the the danger coming ashore because I think a lot of people may be who are looking at you know the I coming ashore but I mean the where the danger and the potentially\nLife threatening situation start what is that timeline where is that window and and what should we expect during that time line\nOkay when it comes to the timeline on what you should expect 'em by tomorrow morning it's still should be offshore\nAnd it will be probably still a category three but\nDarn close to a category for it I wouldn't be shocked if in the next ... in a in one hour from now or it may be upgraded but by Wednesday evening it should be on shore\nAnd so that would be in line with Tallahassee it would be coming across Tallahassee bites Thursday evening it shouldn't be\nEntering the Carolina and cutting right across the middle of the Carolinas and so the eastern side of it will be the onshore winds and the rain and the storms so Charlotte and end up the coast and and they don't need any more\nIf you think you have lupus contact your doctor right away or college that one eight six six six on media we can help\nLung cancer

percent I I don't know\nYou weren't a homeowner yet were you when they were in that range ... when I when I became a homeowner\nThis would have been two thousand seven ... a January two thousand seven\nIs when I bought my first home I'd write all over the country and never you know never settled down so I finally bought one\nIt was five I Believe was five point six or five point seven percent

and I was dancing\nAround the house I was so happy to to reach four and a quarter a the the point being is that I mean you know historically you look at the rates and where they were high I mean back

including former White House advisor Dina Powell\nUh authorities as well as a especially the local and state authorities in\nThis case as you mentioned John truck coming up a little bit later on this hour we will chat with him a ... a last hour when we talk to Tom Haley was talking about the incredible storm surge are going to see anywhere you know when you're talking about uh uh ... anywhere in that area where it's going to hit you know near\nA Panama City Florida you know probably going dozens of miles each way right you're talking anywhere between eight\nAnd fourteen foot storm surge yes which is extremely extremely dangerous and now being\nA a category for a they expected to drop a you know right in the the Florida area up to a a you know a foot\nOf uh of rain and and even as you get inland because it right now it's going north and it's really interesting to watch this because it's going straight north and at some point it's going to start\nOr it's going to start heading east because it does take I mean if you if you look at it uh it does almost take a forty five degree angle if you're looking at the cone and that Cohen ... you think about it the cone of uncertainty as they call it\nHas been extremely consistent over the last couple of days that have you noticed that it really hasn't moved that ... ... it's almost as if they know whatever that that front is at you know keeping it down you know to the southeast\nPoor part of the United states\nMust be pretty strong because that hasn't changed at all and the track is still the same word cuts right through a you know the the middle of um of uh of Georgia and hits the southeastern part\nOf a of Alabama then cuts right through a Georgia and then South Carolina in the north Carolina and then out to uh to the uh the ocean it will move pretty fast because it will be by by friday morning it will be really it'll be off shore\nOf the ... route of uh of North Carolina actually a little bit north east of North Carolina but you know they've been just pounded with the rain and\nAh as a a Tom told us last hour they could expect three inches five inches who really knows you don't know I mean it's so unpredictable you know we ... I I think about yesterday where they said okay we're going to be a little bit of rain and it just poured\nHere so yeah we had in fact we had to some some flooding just based on on rain right I'm In our area\nSo you think you think of when it's when it's a hurricane and then through that\nThen you know downgrades to a tropical storm but who really knows in what areas how much rain or you're you're going to get but an extremely extremely a dangerous storm now the update here at one am central or to a um an eastern time\nA hurricane Michael now a category for yeah stream Lee dangerous a hurricane now headed a really the bulls eye right now and I don't believe that has changed at all we'll find out a little bit here when we talk to me the meteorologist John trout but right you know heading towards Panama City\nYeah when you when you when you look back on the ... I guess the history of\nA major hurricanes or there will be names that that that the rise to the top there is no doubt that based on what we know about Michael already that in the years to come they will look back on on Michael as one of those again historic storms\nAre based on the size of it and and the amount of damage it caused a so we'll be following this and we'll talk to meteorologist John trout are later this hour a day and get his take on this and and the latest information that he has\nAnd of course we multitask here on the show on a consistent basis in and one of the things now just a\nLittle less than four weeks before election day is after the Kavanaugh hearings you know one of the polls doing and you and I really looking forward to what we're going to see a over the next to a couple of days by the time we get to you know this Friday and we start seeing a polls from the actual\nConfirmation a vote in colon speech and and how does that affect certain races out there uh we do have a a a few new polls out there are ... and again it just\nIt we don't we don't believe that there are any absolutes when it comes to polling but it does can give you an idea or at least a snapshot as to what's going on up looking at the Nevada Senate race right a Jacky Rosen the Democrat against a Dean Heller of the ... Republican\nWhere a in of all the previous polls that were done in September\nA Rosen was up a early ah one poll done in in the early September a she was up by one the grab this poll a mid September she was up by two or by the time the CNN poll came and these are all likely voter polls\nAre from nine twenty five to nine twenty nine she was up for ...\nWell the latest NBC News ... poll done\nNine thirty ten three\nSo you're really through all the hearings at that point\nA again five hundred and Seventy four likely voters\nOr however is now a bite to now all of these really are in the margin of error even when she was in the lead mhm so it's all in the margin of error but if you wish to look at it from one poll to another and again they're sampling can be different\nBut you ... what you see is a a six point swing in that particular race still in the margin of error\nBut still we ... what we're looking for is any type of momentum or any type of\nUh I I think a a change in the polls movement in the polls which could be perceived to be based on the excitement level\nOf people wanting to go out and vote right where a likely voter\nIn these polls would say you know a likely voter we said yeah I'm I'm a likely voter and and I'm fifty percent sure that I'm going to go out and vote this time where it's I'm going out and I'm voting sure and somehow that that ends up changing the the polls removing it\nOr in another direction so or that one in Nevada you know you and I were looking at other polls of uh other polls\nAre out there um\nWhat what's interesting is looking I was looking at the Florida Senate race between Bill Nelson and Rick Scott\nAnd if you look at that right now you have a you you've got a couple of the polls are the ... the average showing a Nelson\nUp a a to point for but\nIt really has been a if you look at it or just say a really a tie because it's well within the margin of error\nA on a number of polls with the exception of one a Quinnipiac poll that had Nelson a plus seven but you look at a other polls here a Mason Dixon poll or from nine twenty four to nine twenty seven and Nelson up by one\nA W C. T. V. poll\nThat was taken nine Seventeen to nine thirty which would have included a few days after the uh the the the Senate hearing\nUm it would that has Nelson up by one\nAll within the margin of boat way and the margin of error because of my dinner and both those polls is is three and a half\nYet away and so it it really is\nA it really is a dead heat there in Florida\nAnd I think you I think it'll be interesting to watch ah where where the where that goes\nUm I I just think that the\nThe polls between over the next few weeks everything from Kavanaugh the Capitol hearing\nA and the vote this is going to settle in\nAnd we don't know which side it motivates more doesn't motivate the Democrats to get out more due to try and hold the line on the on the Senate race and and ah in in in order to make an attempt to block Trump or down the road for a possible third\nA nominee for ...\nAnd so we have uh the the latest uh in the Indiana Senate brown versus a Donnelly a Donnelly not vote for a Kavanaugh\nAnd ... he was up by a by three at the end of August the Fox news poll nine twenty nine to ten to has Donnelly up by two well within the margin of error three point to a five percent or and now they have there are three of a different candidates are in this race including the libertarian\nYeah so uh but right now it's forty three forty one or a ... you know Donnelly with the lead but uh again excuse me a yes Donnelly with the the lead the Democrat in there but then again that really you look at that that is another a dead heat that exist out there and then we go to Missouri\nAnd uh the uh latest Fox News poll nine twenty nine to tend to and that is a dead tied now that is before the actual vote took place\nAnd before colon speech and everything else so that's the kind of thing that we're looking for the polls coming out ah maybe here in the next couple of days or early next week and as we get closer to see the effect that that has had there there are a\nTon of these races that are\nA statistical tie with even in the statistical tie Democrats may be a point or two and a and so this is something that I'm sure as being very carefully watched and again when you go into and I were not pollsters you know we're not pollsters we can read them but I mean the methodology\nOf of each and every poll has different nuances and it it all depends on you know what the sample is do they interview more Democrats than actually are in\nIf there was a hall of fame for garage doors garage headquarters would get my vote\nBanks are asking bags rather not engineered pictures on camera shy I already said no\nIt's against my religion I'm giving my dog it back you can have pictures in the past year and gives ... ... and around that hold on let me ask my mom and they went ... and where are you don't get how schools fortunately\nI just had my clothes green catches my body if they got\nOut and they never be pressing I'm already ... and you're making loans to not even if you were all three Jonas Brothers on\nHer new to the cameras in the ...

or\nA road I coming up here in about Fifteen minutes Fifteen twenty minutes we'll hear from a meteorologist\nJohn trout the latest on hurricane Michael which is now hurricane for\nA you know we talked about on CNN yesterday and it was it was just a useless conversation about defining the word Martin and and all that but but it does get to the uh you know the whole thing of not being civil you know Rand Paul calling Cory Booker machine get up in the face of congresspeople and\nRand Paul and his wife remember last week\nA a writing a letter and and and state or in an op ed piece in stating that she sleeps with a gun that remember Rand Paul was attacked yup I'm actually in his in his yard by by a neighbor and what they're saying what you know in the ... it's coming out and saying look\nYou know what you're what you're doing you're ratcheting up the rhetoric now of of complete and total instability in the end the beautiful part is ... you don't just are are we a month past\nThe the uh uh a funeral John McCain right number when they were talking about civility in you and I got this isn't gonna last Hillary decided to get involved in it you're ready for this All right they look at Hillary by the way let us know announced Hillary is back\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house hand or the Senate that's when civility can start again\nLet me ask you this because we we know that the left right now we we we know that ... whether it's Ted Cruz being in a restaurant whether it's Mitch McConnell being at an at an airport the mob mentality that exist now let's get a mob and to intimidate people\nMhm do they believe that's going to be effective yes they believe it's working that's my I guess that would be my point to ... to begin with that they believe and now Hillary of course when it's\nWill stab wished that the instability in mob mentality now exists then she jumps on board oh yeah I'm going to join now how many months later right yeah uh and she's no Maxie model but [laughter]\nSo so this this again [laughter] as what were we talked about that they believe that that they believe it's going to be effective either they believe there's one or two things either they believe it's going to be effective\nOr they're just so so enraged they have nothing less nothing left to substance to offer the people yeah so they just that's the natural I guess outlet is range\nAnd get in people's face wherever\nThey are in their own private time whatever in what they believe that's going to intimidate Republicans or conservatives and didn't really believe that you really believe if you're on the left you honestly believe oh if we do this then there'll be scared of no back off right do you really\nBelieve that the ... do they believe that it's going to change the supporters of Ted Cruz no oh wait wait wait wait it is it's going to further motivate them it's\nGoing to take people who might have decided or maybe just to have been sitting on the fence maybe haven't been in ... think about getting out and voting\nI mean conservatives or Republicans it is going to absolutely motivate them I was actually a online and and I was seeing a number of people that we're talking about\nEarly voting you know here's where to find out where early where the when the early voting starts in your area\nThat means they're chomping at the bit now we don't make predictions but we know right now both sides are motivated the question is which side as motivated more and historically where's that greater turnout did did you see the NBC reporter who went to the\nCollege in California ... and there was like thirty people waiting for a bus at a college all young people ... and all of them sitting right there and he said is anybody voting yeah in the mid term not one person raised their hand right finally they found a bench they found one person ... are they found to people or should yeah we're going to vote\nWell what's your concern well you know college and\nCost to college or ... what about the rational things on the Russian busted or we don't even know what's going on we don't know tension of that stuff that out I mean it was it was ... it was really really interesting but I I guess the point think about this now because Hillary now coming aboard as we said with with everything that\nWent on the insanity from the mainstream of the Democratic party now that the mainstream the Democrat Party\nThinks it's okay to say due process doesn't matter that Hillary can jump aboard and say a civility now it's gone too we take over ... not to be civil bogus civility when we get our way right right we're not we're not we're not going to be civil and and think about what it's about now you're not civil because you believe in what\nThis really is the calm before the storm adjusted a check on the wind speed at Tallahassee, Florida and we're only looking\nAt about Seventeen miles an hour but from here on out throughout the day today we will see those wind speeds increase we could see landfall as a category for we're kinda splitting hairs though I mean we will see wins in excess of one hundred miles an hour we're talking almost a sustained a tornado here\nFolks from the mid west can appreciate the tornadoes and we're talking about not only a torn addict event but a rain event as well\nAnd possibly tornadoes spawned from this system over the next say thirty six hours or so\nWhat is the threat of storm surge and where we're will those areas the highest ... be\n[noise] we're looking at a for the highest be a threat to Mexico Beach Florida to ah Keaton beach nine to Thirteen\nFeet now that's just that wall of water that this wind pushes in couple that with high tide and we know are tides and those areas can range from between three and six feet depending upon where you are on the coast this water will also push a\nInland Eric and Gary up through rivers and streams under sloppy areas so we'll see smaller towns inundated we could even see some major highways like I said affected\nNot only from the flooding but the wind event is going to cause a no doubt some power lines down power outages ah we've got\nTo ... roadways from a roofs ripped off of homes are talking about a very potentially catastrophic event here\nWhat time do you see it coming onshore right now\nAh right now we're still looking at the early morning hours today around eight nine AM and uh that's the actual landfall of the say Hi but until then from now until then anyone\nListening to me in that region a you've got to take precautions you got to save your life and family and heed the warnings from what the officials have been mentioned it for the past twenty four hours to get out of the way this thing is a potential killer\nA meteorologist John trout and I guess we're expecting another uh update here in just a little over two hours from the national Hurricane Center\nYeah we'll get another one and by then we'll know whether it should arrive as a cat three or cat for but I don't want people to split hairs on bat when we categorize tornadoes we're only talking about the wind speed\nWe saw from Hurricane Florence or a couple of weeks ago and we saw last year from Hurricane Harvey that the category does not\nMatter as much when we're talking about flooding because only the wind speeds or part of the categories one of the things I dislike about this effort Simpson scale the real killer here is never the wind it's always the flooding people think they can get through the roadways they can they can ride it out but ah\nThose floodwaters are very destructive very dangerous and very unpredictable\nCertainly a meteorologist a gun or a drought we'll be following the story of course and and the storm\nA in a throughout the day and then a ... as its path continues inland and by the way what should we expect are we still on target or to see a few inches of rain for those areas in the Carolinas affected by foreign\nA little less than we talked about yesterday I mentioned or possibly a foot of rain that's been scaled back by a couple inches but Ah yes those areas are locally or could see a some a ... foot rainfall total amounts into Georgia\nEnd of the Carolinas North Carolina and again don't forget the potential for tornadoes spawn from the system\nAll right Dr John trapper John or your time we appreciate it\nYeah I work in a so he'll be following this information are of course a throughout the day but as John mentioned that you need to heed the warnings\nAnd any other directors given by local officials and just keep in mind that the other ... gonna be a number of things that she first responders from getting to you\nAnd so that's the point a and also uh at at some point you could lose power or may not be safe to drink water or from the tap and so there are a number of things that could become\nExtremely problematic and of course uh the uh officials and all of us want you to be safe and and to be able to survive this that things can be replaced the people get up\nAnd it was just a fifty five minutes ago that the uh the new advisory came out from the national hurricane service on hurricane\nOr or center excuse me on hurricane a Michael the wanting in central\nTime advisory that it was up to a strength for hurricane and sit in a maximum sustained winds now a hundred and thirty miles an hour or so it is a strength for hurricane yeah which is extremely dangerous and will be\nOn on modern records the the biggest hurricane ever to hit if it stays that of or I even believe is a three and maybe the\nThe the biggest ever to hit their the strongest to ever write yeah the pan handle\nMore than ... in terms of the wind in and John brings up a great point about those a spin off tornadoes in those areas which can also be destructive as well will follow the story and coming up next our in fact we'll talk with meteorologist Tom hale get an update from him [noise]\n\n\n\nThe Sears ... radio on Westwood One\nEvery Tuesday and Thursday

today the rainfall will produce massive amounts of flooding there could be tornadoes spawned as a result as well a meteorologist John traveling now that\nSystem is about one hundred Seventy miles southwest of apple electrical of Florida\nFor the president of looking for a new U.S ambassador to the un after Nikki Haley announced she stepping down at the end of the year news blindsided some key us allies and many congressional Republicans involved in foreign policy matters White House has narrowed down the shortlist of five people to replace Haley including former White House advisor Dina Powell\nAnd the eastern half of the eastern southern half of a of North Carolina so they've got a ton of rain there as\nWe all know because of a Hurricane Florence but also their coastline could also be affected as are also tropical storm a a a warnings are especially long the the Georgia and South Carolina ... a line actually tropical storm warnings there and watches a\nA North Carolina so we are right now that quite often you'll see tornadoes uh that that that spin off from storms like this and they can become destructive and they are the ... and they happened very quickly\nUh the knowing and and growing up in tornado alley uh you understand that that they uh that that often there's little to no warning for those of tornadoes and they become of course a a ... a separate a destructive force\nOf the room so certainly all the folks in the path of hurricane Michael ah\nThe next twenty four to forty eight hours heed the warnings or keep your radios on a keep batteries charged and uh stay alert or coming up here in less than thirty minutes after the bottom of the hour we'll talk with meteorologist Tom hale who did a great job\nAnd covering Hurricane Florence for us or we talk to him earlier he also a covered a Hurricane Irma\nIn Florida for us uh on red eye radio so we'll talk to him about this a new report the update from the national Hurricane Center which came across at two AM eastern\nAnd what changed here and and again what all of this means in terms of the energy behind hurricane Mike [noise]\nUh it uh getting back to what we're talking about a a last hour and when we played the audio cut from Hillary Clinton same civility is impossible until the\nDemocrats take power again so that was her call for instability ... and the interesting thing about that is an and we've talked about you know whether it's Ted Cruz or you know in the restaurant that made a a big news\nAh a couple of weeks ago or Mitch McConnell are at the uh the the airport or\nA a Jeff Flake in the the the elevator uh what's you know what's going on right now the the call number from Maxine Waters remember when Maxine Waters and she might have been really ignited that that political flame of\nOf actually Democrats to like the office that right there was calling it\nA you know and and so we saw what happened this past weekend we saw what happened to Ted Cruz saw what happened to Mitch McConnell saw what happened to Jeff Flake\nOr the conversation on CNN yesterday if it's not a mob it's just a people expressing their their uh their their their viewpoints\nAnd it's like well most of America looks at it when they see people screaming and yelling and going into into a private place not an organized protest\nOr organized protest Americans are fine with you go out and you protest and you're with tens of thousands of other people and it's a peaceful protest and that's fine Americans don't want riots Americans don't want mob rule they don't want you go they they don't uh most Americans don't approve\nOf the fact that you're going into a place that is not your property trespassing just to the point of harassing right or you know a ... some you know somebody else has happened in Ted Cruz's place but that call to harass people are ... anywhere uh\nYesterday a Rand Paul again and you know Rand Paul's wife\nOr has been on this year for the last uh a couple of weeks talking about the instability Kentucky Senator Rand Paul on Tuesday took aim with the rhetoric employed by senator Cory Booker and others accusing them of ratcheting up the conversation\nOr to the point where unstable people could commit violence\nSaid Paul to Kentucky radio host I fear there's going to be at an assassination why I really worry that somebody's going to be killed and that those who are in a war ratcheting up the conversations those who are saying get in their face\nThere have to realize that they bear some responsibility at this this elevates the violence these are people that are unstable Paul says we don't want to encourage them we have to somehow ratcheted down and say we're not encouraging them the violence\nAnd violence is never okay or there's never a reason uh to resolve things that weigh directly calling on Booker\nWho last July told activists to get up in the face of some congresspeople Paul referenced his own uh salt of the hands of a neighbor\nAs well as last year's a baseball field shooting which Representative Steve skull east was wounded to show that unstable people can easily take things are too far and then we talk about the fact that Hillary\nTalked about you know no civility right share her call here so you've mainstream that completely now with Hillary comes out you can't get more mainstream Democrat over the last Twenty years so Hillary now calling for ... you know instability number one we talked about the fact that\nThey actually think this is an effective way to go to the actually think that politicians you know calling for it now to the point of Hillary Clinton saying can help civility which is to call for instability ... which is the calls to harass people in their private life\nAnd\nI that was the first thing that hit me was was they think this is going to be effective\nBut then you get to the point of the Hillary now bringing it up where she feels comfortable saying it looks Hillary's a follower she'll be asked you and not take an opinion on anything if she believes\nThat it is perceived as radical at all to anybody in her base ... we've seen that before remember when she was up in Canada yeah and she was asked about the\nPipeline right I'm not going to comment on that because other people right now are making a decision look you're running for president if\nThis is still a a an issue we need to know what your thoughts on it are and she didn't want to take a side right and so now here's Hillary Clinton calling for instability\nAnd and and they think about this\nSo now it's becoming mainstream and and and what why instability over what what is the issue you're calling for due process you're calling for presumption of innocence you're calling for preponderance of evidence\nYou're saying where's the evidence you're coming out 'cause this is and we talked about this yesterday what came out of this whole thing ah you know from from Democrats is if you believe in due process than you are enabling rapists and therefore you deserve no civility because of it\nWhich is of course that's their\nDefinition it's not the definition of people to believe and due process under the law people to believe in due process under the law obviously are not advocating rape or sexual assault now any other crime right\nAnd that's\nThe point and so I think about it that it's very important to get to the actual issue what is the point that they view that it's so radical that the writers taking were instability must lead and it's that simple point the belief in due process\nAnd evidence in any case\nTo show the guilt of anybody and not just an allegation that is what has set off even the mainstream now of the Democratic party to call for in civility this is\nHow far how low\nWe always wonder we always asked a question how long will they go you know calling somebody and not see you know and and and saying that that's been for a long time but you get to the point now where they're calling for instability based\nOn people's opinion on the other side that evidence is how you judge somebody's guilt right due process should apply and all of these cases which means you look\nFor the evidence to find somebody who's skilled you don't believe anybody because of their demographic because of their gender because of their race\nBecause of their age you believe people because the evidence backs what they what they say now you can believe them you're going to go on I think that sounded credible that doesn't mean that that person that you look at them and called him a rapist\nBecause that's what they were doing they were calling him arenas and the gang rape is yes I Believe her which means they believe you did it yes they believe Kavanaugh did at the evidence isn't there right never been there right yet that's what their state and because you don't agree with them because you say no I\nBelieve in the preponderance of evidence I Believe in the presumption of of uh of of innocence I

it\nIs yeah it will will will talking mostly coming up there and let him in a little bit but our important things out there that are much more important meteorologist Tom hale if you're a got caught up on hurricane Michael and a ... a good morning again Tom as you predicted hurricane Michael now data gory for\nYes yes it is category for I agree with you on the sleep\nPartner either way [laughter] I said you know we're we're keeping time awake in fact right now but I wasn't very does reason\nIt is is what these storms do and uh you know uh every once in a while you get to be able to capitalize on that adrenalin rush 'em because you know a meteorologist one of the few things that we get to do and as broadcasters in our lifetime Mr baby save a life yeah\nAnd and and and here we have an opportunity because we're being heard from one end of the coast to the other side of the United states and every one of these people who are listening right now have family and friends or know someone who as family and friends hurt along this coast\nAnd and so I'm making the suggestion that you get in touch with your family and friends and make sure that they're doing the right thing\nA simple example in Panama City beach uh there are six possibly now seven shelters that are open so if you've decided to stay along\nThe beach front\nUm and and not move inland maybe a ... you don't have to you can you can move inland to\nTo a little town called fountain up to a two thirty one or or you can take it a little bit further and and had on up to a interstate twenty if you want to go that's only an hour drive up the road to an interstate excuse me interstate ten\nUm the simple thing is that you need to get out of harm's way um\nWhen we talk about a category for storm I Want to put this in perspective and and that and not a slow moving storm like we saw was ... it was a category for storm that hit Puerto Rico last year called Irma\nAnd we've all seen the pictures and the devastation now devastation is relative to what it hits\nSo if it's a rotted tree it it could take a breeze to take that thing out um if the homes are not built to handle hurricanes or they haven't had hurricanes in a long time and the building standards and become lax\nGuess what the same story you get greater amounts of devastation [noise] um here\nThis is something that they have not seen along this coastline historically period um\nAlong the ... of the Panama City beach to Tallahassee Pensacola Beach simply put the panhandle and then the Big Bend area that's the area that swoops around and and and swings down to cedar key uh\nThere hasn't been a category ... storm hit and so that's in itself\nSomething that nobody can relate to and when you can't relate to something you relate to what you can and what you can or if somebody's been around since Nineteen eighty five [noise] that would be caked and and and and Kate\nWas quite a devastating storm a and at that point you have to say to yourself well if you haven't been around for Kate you know what other things have come by well ah there's been very few October storms to begin with I'm\nThis storm is in October storm math he was an October storm and there was a a failure but a Celia was a major all these are major storms but a failure was offshore and so it didn't have that kind of a an effect on Florida\nAnd so right now if you're listening or if you have family and friends along that area you need to understand that that on Wednesday evening\nOne hundred mile an hour gusts are going to be common and that's after it's come onshore um tomorrow evening because we're expecting a still a landfall sometime around three to four o'clock and that means that it'll speed up a little bit before it comes to shore buyouts\nGone gone to the north of twelve so\n... and of course uh you know it's been pointed out time and time again not just the wins in in the destruction of property and and presenting a danger to humans but but really the flooding in the storm surge here the water that comes along with a storm like this\nI'm being a potentially life threatening in fact that his life threatening and is often deadly um and

hale are meteorologist on this story and will again talk with him here and just a bit\nI'm Talking with him about the storm surge and the way it is a you know as he described it it's like filling up a bath\nSo it is not something again or if you are not familiar with this with a a storm surge and very few people are\nAre based on the the ... diction models for the highest storm surge from this storm very few people on the planet has ever experience that and again we just have to repeat that that is a deadly deadly\nA danger to uh to to individuals well that may not be familiar with it and not a understand fully or what the impact is\nSaid and I never lived in in Panama City but at the looks familiar the the downtown city area in which with a lot of residences right next to the water on the bay right and it reminds me of a lot of like Fort Walton Beach when when I Lived outside of Fort Walton Beach where I live actually lived in\nIn Fort Walton Beach for a very short time but mostly ... in Nevada or Florida which is between Pensacola and and Fort Walton Beach and and that's in my head trying to figure out what it would be like\nYou know when I remember sitting there right in you know residential the in in the city there and you could see the bay and I'm thinking if and that would have been in Fort Walton Beach ... that came up\nYou know fourteen feet what that would be like him that's what I'm trying to imagine my head ... estimates and on and look at Pensacola or looked at the uh Panama City in and say you're going to have a lot of flooding\nAnd and again uh we we talked about it the the houses on the beaches that are on stilts\nThey're roughly or the four of those houses and the deck roughly at ten feet\nSo if you're talking about a Thirteen or fourteen foot surge that means that inside those above the cells inside those homes you're still talking about three to four feet of water\nA and that becomes the you know I think that puts it in perspective for anyone who's even seen\nOne of those homes and I stayed in one over the summer I Can't imagine water getting that high there's a reason that they built on stilts and that\nThe average is roughly ten feet it's because it's thought to be above the ah average storm surge in in the path of a storm a you know in the average again storm but Michael hurricane Michael is no average storm\nWe'll be talking to meteorologist Tom hale coming up at the bottom of the hour trying to get in all the other stories that are out there and they're actually a quite a few stories the the one that caught my attention yesterday because\nUh we really have got no response from the White House on this especially with the president coming out really uh yesterday and and stating and Monday that a Rod Rosenstein is going to stay mhm uh you know he's she's going to be there they had the talk and everything is great then this story comes out the two senior FBI officials told\nThe bureau's top lawyer they believe the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein was serious\nWhen he discussed secretly recording Donald Trump and invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove him from office last year according to sources close to a congressional investigation\nAnd an account that conflicts with the claims from Rosenstein and others the comments were either inaccurate reported or made in jest\nOr this is again former FBI general counsel a James Baker more information coming out about his testimony are told congressional investigators behind a closed door deposition last week\nThat then FBI acting director Andrew McCabe an FBI lawyer Lisa Page came to Baker after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey and may have twenty Seventeen Baker said page and McCabe relate details of the meeting where Rosenstein made the comments\nThough he wasn't personally in that meeting Baker told congressional investigators he took ... pages word\nA seriously the sources said further Baker told congressional investigators\nHe suspected that Rosenstein was cooperating with two people in the administration to vote the twenty Fifth Amendment a sore said wow yeah the testimony would appear at odds with other accounts of those discussions Baker who's testimony was described\nAs deliberate and sober added he had not done a legal analysis and was not on sure whether it was unethical or illegal the source at it\n[noise]\nYeah I'm really this is the story that we've talked about the one that is\nHas been completely buried\nWhere there's been a really items that somebody may have written it out there but I haven't I haven't even seen it National Review ... Henry McCarty I haven't seen write about it the Kimberley Process all and and this is about ... analyzing the the fact that the president\nWith the Pfizer warrant application that he said let's declassify it\nAnd then came out and said well we're going to give it to the inspector general to look at and he will expedite it quickly and we went for what\nFor what you're you're if you're afraid that\nOr something should stay ... you know redacted well then you don't go to the inspector general you\nGo to you or a secretary of state former CIA director\nBecause what you're claiming as some of the allies don't want somebody information out so you go to him or you go to the director of national intelligence you go to the director of the CIA the last person you go to is the inspector general because the inspector general looks at what corruption\nOh oh they declassified it next thing you know it's going to the inspector general corruption why is does it seem to be that nobody in the media is covering that story every day I wake up and I said ... what am I missing\nWell because if you look at it there is there's nothing to gain the president's not going to get any kind of I guess political feedback or direction from the inspector general no that's not first of all it's not who Horowitz is\nBut it's not the role of that office ... ... of that position\nTo be an advisor to the president that's not the point the point of the ... office is to investigate misdeeds and wrong doings and possible criminal activity by people within the department of justice\n... ... if you look at how that played out and nobody talked about it except for the fact\nThat nobody talked about it\nAnd I'm not talking about the Kimberley straw souls or you know any anybody that has been you know covering is a ... even a Sarah a quarter who's been covering an a number of\nThings and and those are really good job at it I'm Talking about the liberal media who's been screaming\nRushing collusion Russian collusion Russia inclusion Russia inclusion since before the president took office so it was about that time that they went completely silent on Russian collusion\n... a data noon as brought it up like that I I don't know why the president doesn't make sense and then he stopped talking about right\nBecause nobody is talking about it in Washington none of the politicians Adam ship isn't talking about it nobody is talking about the fact that\nThey did the rejection and then gave it to the inspector general they see classified it and then said oh we see something here that the inspector general who investigate\nCorruption mhm we give it to him to review it\nBecause there's only ... it whether it was done for this reason or not there's only one thing that can really come of it and that is an investigation by the inspector general to look over it and write a report\nOn it you would think somebody would ask the president Mr President what did the administration see in the ... redacted material to give it to the inspector general who's only job is to go after corruption illegal wrongdoing and possible crimes\nBecause politically the effect of it is what it is what we said I mean 'cause I could see the scenario although we haven't been told us\nLog on to the national guard dot com\nContact in the Army National guard recruiter in your area sponsored by the Rhode Island Army National guard feared by the Rhode Island broadcasters\nAssociation and dissertation Hi I'm Kimberley ... the last time he got together we can go and what did you talk about\nMovies that date when the next time you get together here something really important to talk of\nThe connection between cervical cancer and some types of H.
