D y\nThat's correct that's right\nAnd so the decision who decided because they knew it bring America and what a gamble they talk\nWell the one that if you want to if one of single name who decided are actually two names he was a foreign ending Morgan looting or if they were actually running though ... to ... they were running the country right Iran or they're in charge and um\nThey they both they may come to the understanding and they were correct that Germany was not going to win the war on the ground that she was being done\nIn terms of material and you're right about people who are starving the winner of Seventeen Eighteen is known as a turning point or cause that's about all they had to eat there was nothing to eat German Army was actually gives ending up putting a groups to a gathering metals to make a noodle soup\nA poor the poor spit or me on the front thing he's Seventeen and Nineteen eighty\nSo the answer that in the navy said well look we can do this with you both we're we're building them faster bigger and better and have a bunch of them here pretty soon we'll we can sink you know a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a month or something like\nAnd the logic of that is that the British we'll start with is is that what they were thinking\nOh yeah oh they figured that they could actually um when no when we entered the war and after all sim showed up in London so he went to see um the the ... the British navy was driving the British told him that are\nOf the defendant if they didn't find a way to contain the ... war\nThey were convinced that they were on the payroll and the roots right there with the Germans and it was just about ... they had to find\nA way to show the decision then was too dark Britain and both sides would talk wouldn't lift the famine in Germany a start on rent though they were both they both got high command that the government were making this decision to race to gather\nTo elect their population star that's the risk who starts starts to cause I'll go first and if I directly and if I'm if I read correctly\nOr by the time the Americans that the Americans declare war April Nineteen Seventeen we don't really get our contingent of soldiers there until Nineteen Eighteen he takes a lot of ... did the Germans believe they can sink the transport ship\nThat's right they they thought they were their claim was a navy guaranteed them not an American troops will make it\nS that's nonsense did on ... recognize that it was nonsense by the by the winter of ...

they unfold as we make a determination for ourselves about what happened there based on the facts that are presented to us there ... says will determine what's the\nThat was that was interesting you guys you know we're asking the right questions I suggested maybe it was George Soros paying for all this one way or another and sure enough people are talking about that today so I may have been right about that\nBut I've certainly become more cynical about what is going on and this one seems clear to me I think they're timing it so that their arrival at our border is time to hurt President Trump and Republicans in the upcoming elections whoever's paying for it\nUh doesn't matter I think that's what they're uptick so I think they don't ask me of course to consult with them but I think the Democrats are once again misreading things as they didn't earrings with judge Kevin to where they clearly overplay their hand\nAnd showed you know the even the independent voters remember most people don't follow the news like the those who are listening to talk to you guys are actively involved you know what's going on most average people don't even know what's going on a but they showed their mission to ruin a judge Kavanaugh's reputation in his life and I think most people\nCould see that whether or not her evidence has yet is whether her testimony was credible or not even if they felt sorry for her I think they thought\nThe Democrats were going overboard and I think that's going to hurt them in the election so I think most Americans saw through their surfers and now\nThey want the American people will see crying children right so here's the children and distraught mothers at the border with a willing press reporting how heartless Republicans are to allow such suffering to take place they just you ever notice it's always the children's some rather because people\nAnd I feel sorry for children it doesn't matter if they're manipulated by the way you know it's as someone's kid at ten or eight or whatever that when they spouse certain points of view you know they've been indoctrinated by the parents about even if they're precocious as some of the things that come out with you know the parents are just using their own kids\nBy the way not to like the Democrats use you know a Ford there\nAnd they're all the usual spin I oh this line drives me crazy that this is not who we are as people are not who we are as Americans as if we're not allowed to defend our sovereignty and our values that we are in effect basically what they're saying we're stupid people\nThat would let all kinds of people come through our border on their word alone now I Want asylum whatever you don't know if there are terrorists or you don't have half contagious diseases which is happening more and more\nPeople have not been vetted in any way that that we are not those kinds of people either that can't we be smart enough to have some you know the rules and procedures about how people come into this country so when they say it\nJust drives me crazy oh this is not who we are as people Hillary set everybody said you know it just seems like that on the left the we're we're not we're so compassion and we take everybody you know you guys just full of it you want them here for the votes\nAnd you didn't care about basically for whatever her name is because of the final analysis you leak that when she didn't want the stuffed leek\nAnd Dianne Feinstein the rest of your time this so do maximum damage you didn't really care about her\nBy is a bigger topic for tonight just like I Believe the Democrats don't really care about minorities that just using them they know they take their votes for granted and whether they help them or not but it's it's irrelevant they are using them for them to get power [noise]\nSo I Want you to comment to continue to comment on any of those stories that I reviewed tonight at eight six six Ninety red eye and and let me know what you're thinking and I go with where you want to go there is a hot topic uh after our topic I'll go to that pretty quickly\nEight six six or seven thirty three thirty nine is is the same number a digitally\nBut colors also mentioned the reaction of some of their friends this kind of always comes out a little bit some of their friends and family members to or if their political beliefs are on the conservative\nOr you know you call them on the right I guess\nAnd a friend of mine Scott who used to live in California now lives in Colorado I'll leave that his last name because I didn't get permission to use his last name\nSo this is what he posted on Facebook yesterday he was ... just because of his political beliefs\nAnd he thought I thought he wrote a thoughtful commentary which I Am going to just read from it's pretty quick\nA and from what I remember by the way he's a moderate Republican not even a conservative like me here's this quote we continue to learn life set lessons in many ways today I had a friend who I've known since high school an friend me\nShe was always known me as a nice person in fact I helped her out in school and gave her job to provide her additional Lincoln\nNothing has changed as far as who I Am but today she in front of me not because I was nasty to her or because I was mean to anyone she knew about the cause I posted a political post that she disagreed with\nKeep in mind that you post political commentary that I disagree with and some I find very offensive she asked me to never let the other stuff and yet she comments on mine but sadly this is a way of our politics we\nCan do people for years even all of our lives yet they have no tolerance for a different political view than their own it's so angers them that you have a different opinion that then there's that they will not talk to any more\nPersonally I find that beyond said today I've only on friends and one person mainly because they're noxious and intellectually dishonest\nAs most no I guess people are no and I will debate anyone on any issue and I changed my mind than issues and vote at others change their mind yeah I appreciate that too when colors of done that in the past\nAnd you'll see me say sometimes you know that's a good point I didn't consider that but today it just seems that we're starting to forget the whole of a person is not just measure by their political views\nAnd if the ... if you've had a lifetime of friendship\nThat it should be more important than a different view on one area\nHe should have said in one area of your life\nI think I'm more saddened by the fact that my experience today is more symptomatic of what our society's becoming than about losing a Facebook friend if we can find a way to be more civil to each other then we're in for a bumpy road ahead I actually I think he's under doing it\nUh and by the same thing happened to me a couple of years ago so I used to do in a show in Los Angeles with two Democrats two Republicans discussing the issues in the news whatever came up that we can\nThe audience and the guess loved it some of the gifts I the degree to each other and a future show I said how do you know ... oh we became good friends because of your show mark up and I I was really that touched me a despite their differing views they've become friends socially and otherwise and kept in touch\nI'd love to reprise that show at some point if I was given the opportunity because of the audience loved it I loved it it it was just a lot of fun we didn't have very professional way you know\nBut one of the guests moved to Tennessee and posted on Facebook was one of the other gets the more you see what he did he posted in on Facebook after Trump won that he was the ... anyone who is evil enough to vote for President Trump your host included obviously well he wouldn't friendly you know you did\nIn all of his appearances on my show he was one of the milder very friendly and plus you guess on the other side\nAnd he ... he shares vice with me when I was dumb enough to run for office in California which\nYou can imagine for a Republican is waste the time so I was pretty surprised when he posted his letter saying goodbye to all of us now evil human beings I'm not sure you said the word evil but that's what he was implying\nForget his past interactions with me or others he thought were his friends they thought he was there for his friends so I Want to know from you what has been your experience when people find out your views if you're a Republican or a conservative or maybe you keep your politics quiet as I Do with my teaching job\nOne of the reasons I'm getting all over now I'd probably still teaching is the left just about never listens to the other side\nSo they have no idea that I'm a talk show host if they knew that might be the end of me but here uh several anecdotes you might appreciate on election day when President Trump was running it was the first day of new class in my school so I was texting a lot to see the election results\nAnd I remember I tears roll down my eyes when he a Trump won Pennsylvania which was always a Republican fool's gold always stay we might win but when it counted like with Romney we always came up short so when he won Pennsylvania I realize he was like going to be president\nIt was unbelievable even though I predict that morning I predict on Facebook that I thought he was going to win so what did some students do and these are adults students they went to the system principle to complain that I was texting a lot\nSo she called the inter office at the end of the night and she said you know what mark I defended you to the students because all of us were so upset with the results that it was not surprising that ... been going on [noise] it didn't even cross or my for second that I could be on the other side\nAnd another time there was a teacher's meeting and the ... teacher trainer who's running the meeting said you know we have some time why don't we go around the room all your teachers and you could tell us something that would be interesting that we don't know about you [noise]\nI Do you think for a second I Would tell them about my other crew life how could have been the end of me and a final anecdote was when Justice Scalia died another teacher said mark let's play knock knock joke so I've played along and his answer to who was there was just a Justice Scalia just died and he said that was funny enough\nI'd probably didn't hide my look of dismay 'cause he shocked me because you immediately walked away having no idea that I adore Justice Scalia and he was my favorite judge so now you know why I'm Still teaching in the public school system\nIt's kind of like the McCarthy Era to reverse but I have to keep quiet about my political views I Want to know what you do if you have to keep a quiet at your job what happens if you discuss politics with your family or friends were on the opposite side you

you're on with mark\nAnd mark I haven't heard your show more but it's a fascinating ah looks bright side of that is a I'm a single guy and I didn't use some of the day the website for the last three or four years\nAnd I noticed was increasing regularity that you'll be looking at pictures of women and and and reading their profile and\nIt's almost everyone you see will have\nOn the left you'll see\n'em do contact me if you're a Trump supporter do contact me if you're a Republican but you never see any kind of qualifications\nLike that on the right I've never seen any Republican leaning you're right leaning women say they'll contact if a if you're a Hillary supporter or something like that it's only only\nIn my experience a hundred percent on the left it's just when did we become that society I thought brief audit breached rushed it was was a good thing\nBut I'm not really not ... not on our side ... or ... years ago I have an old yeah go ahead\nBut it is I mean it's so one sided it's it's like a flashlight you know it's only these I don't want to talk to any a truck to truck people I don't want to talk to any Republican they'll contact me but but yeah ...\n... there were both ... said they'll contact the if you're a less your life with a tall yes it's it's just crazy\nWhich just imagine you could be the nicest guy in the world right what's your political views are different than hers in this case and they don't want to meet you might you might be their love of their life that they've been looking for that one exception and they don't even want to give it a chance it's incredible it must have\nTried to when I Try to engage them and say do you\nDo I have to like the same kind of music you listen to what do I have to love the same kind of literature you know a little difference that somebody is is a good thing and I have to I had the parrot your thoughts and political views exactly is that the deal is and I tried to gauge the cut it with a smile but that\nYou get hostility right back it is where do we help those people I just thought it said\nIt ... you you know the other night you say this is your first night you're you've been listening the other night I was asking about who would you like to see get the nomination on the Democrats' side and if you were a Democrat who to like sooner Republican side and that evolved\nInto who would you like to have coffee with could you pick someone on the other side so you you kind of give me an idea that we we can evolve this thing in would you I mentioned my monologue Mary Madeline and er what's his name I just lost a carnival\nYeah James Carville um they're married and married stream Lee opposite I worked in political campaigns for a total opposite candidates so here's how this may evolve\nCould you marry mark someone who had really diametrically opposed refused to you\n[noise] ah well why not I mean if you're compatible in every other way and you you why ... why does one little facet of our lives defy everything you know of course I could have played like you're ...\nYou're consistent but I'm going to play devil's advocate okay\nBecause it doesn't politics get into values somewhat about what people care about right or as an example again from this I think a lotta times single women who vote Democrat or looking for the government to take care of them are and so you start to get into your values system I think\nSo now I'm going to play on the other side maybe not marriage because it may affect lots of things I'll give you another one maybe this very I teach my students values or what should count not so much and I say it's my pin you don't have to agree with me not to you know look through obviously important at the beginning but that fades over time\nIt's it's the person's values that you should care but here's one what if you are religious as an example because of that\nBecause you're conservative and you believe in God and the other side doesn't so if you have kids some day you're obviously going to fight about that you want them to go to church or whatever she wants no part of that so I hear I'm almost contradictory myself I Do understand if

was always the one being told they take your sister with your ... el ... everywhere I had to go you know my sister went and I look back now and I absolutely love that you know and um but we're really tight all the way through and um you know similar I think it was my senior year my parents got divorced and so we got a little\nYou know a state of my dad with mom and and we got a little separation but we never let the distance or um\nGet it between us we stayed in contact and uh she became a flight attendant for a while for a flight attendant shooting and you know she would let me use or passes it we would fly places yeah and um and then you know slowly as family comes in you know you maybe don't talk as much but we always talk and um\nAnd we always had the same views for the longest time you know maybe a couple of little differences here and there but um she started traveling a lot to Europe and this that and coming back started talking about how you know America does the U.S does this wrong or the u._s. should\nBe more like this country and this and that is so you know it's just a little kind of like OK okay whatever well um we never really talked about politics until this past election and um and still during the primaries um\nYou know I hadn't made my choice that I think like most people you know they had made their choice and I was between crews ... than Trump and as she was more of a Bernie Sanders\nShe was all about Bernie Sanders and um she was happy with Hillary and so as it got closer and closer when I actually started leaning orders trial we we started getting serious serious debate\nIt's you know and then I'm In June my son my youngest son was graduating and she was supposed to come out to the graduation and um my son and her just had a tremendous tremendous uh a relationship and um\nTwo weeks prior to the um to the graduation we had a conversation on a song or were like hey you know what where you get here when I got to talk about politics of this is about politics is about my son graduation and um and then the week before the graduation she calls\nAnd she said because I'm a Trump supporter she can't come to my house and we have not spoken since that day and I I've reached down in ... or a couple of ... and\nA couple of times you know China is a a a relationship with my nephew doing nothing meant nothing\nI feel so sorry few I I you know it just breaks my heart and and you have to wonder what what about your son I mean she didn't seem to care about that either that the the fact that poor Trump was enough to break a bowl the relationship between a brother and sister in ... so much over those years\nIt is incredible what's going on out there and I just uh you know ... cliche but it is hard to even hear the story\nDo don't give up maybe someday she'll come around she obviously got infected with down and socialism in Europe and what's going on there if you ask most of your opinions I don't think many of them be happy with what's going on I don't know what she saw a but uh it's it's depressing hang in there my friend okay it'll it'll come around some time\nJust hang in there um I was just thinking of a you know people are funny that way I worked at a at a station ... in Los Angeles as I said I don't want to say too much about it except for one of the whole was had a\n... we have there's a gal on whose father was a famous I don't want to see what he did but it was it was pretty famous at us in this day\nAnd they didn't talk for a I don't know Twenty years or something\nAnd then um one day a host said to me you know mark or her father died\nAnd she didn't even know it and I had to tell her the news and she said a whole wow I never got a chance to say goodbye so they hadn't talked to her I think it was at least Twenty years and you think that finally when he passed on but it was too late to say goodbye to him\nBecause she disowned him all those years before it ever personal reasons so one has to think that\nEventually you hope people come around before something serious happens and I always tell my students you can never tell someone you love enough that you love them because life is very short\nBut when you hear the family story as a brother and sister daughter whenever that because of politics they disown their parent or their brother who they know their whole lives assuming there's
