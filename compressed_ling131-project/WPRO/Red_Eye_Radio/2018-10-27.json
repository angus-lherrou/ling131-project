he said to me a lot of time\nFor President Obama is out on the campaign trail for democratic candidates in Michigan he says this election is critical for so many reasons\nWhat's more the price of a ticket has doubled so your chance of winning has gone down but if you lose and you will ...\nAt least your money is going for a good cause or so you've been told in the middle of the twentieth century where lotteries first started in the United states there were soldiers states as a way to benefit the American public by providing additional funding for education\nThat means as a jackpots get bigger and people spend more money on lotteries two hundred and twenty three dollars per year by the average American in fact there would be more money in state budgets to spend on education\nBut that isn't happening most state legislatures haven't been using lottery money for additional education funding\nInstead they're using it to fund\nThe basic education budget and using the money that would normally fund education on other things altogether what's that mean states are misusing funds well no they're not there [laughter] are you getting may know the the lottery isn't adding to the education uh you know ...\nThey're taking money it's going into the education budget but then they're taking money\nThat used to go to the education budget and shifting battles\nThey're missing renting funds yeah mhm well they're not misusing them because they're not breaking in law they're just they're usually the original they're replacing ones that they're ... misusing [laughter] their mission having fun\nWhich is why that money's going into the Education Fund it doesn't mean more education money because the other education money is being taken somewhere else isn't that what you just said\nI I mean that's what I read earlier that there are misusing while on is that they have now and this this money is going into an education fund but it's not actually increasing the amount that they're spending on education right\nWhat they used ... they're they're moving money around and doesn't mean you're using money misusing money to me means that you are using it for inappropriate purposes well that might be ... well I Know no ...\nIt's it's it's money that's not appropriate for that that to me is a misuse if it's not appropriate it and they take it from one cough or to the other that's to me that I'm a ... but that's like saying if\nYou have if you open up a new tax ... and you say okay this tax money is going to fund education and this tax money that used to fund education is going to go elsewhere that isn't technically misusing anything\nYou're not always you on the line ... well you may be in line yeah you may you may have it may not be the original intent of what you told people you were going to do those politicians back then sold you one thing and politicians today by the way we had said this way back when\nThat eventually they're going to move the money around we talk show host back then said this was going to happen or and and it and it did happen so you can say is the did the system overall\nAre not tell you the truth over that period of time you would be correct sir yeah could you pick one individual Who Lied to by to Ronald Lee not\nYeah well in my opinion\nThat's the misuse of funds are out there that actually because it's allocated for this and that is what you some of them that's that's you you bring something to the people and you tell them we want to introduce this way of raising funds for this purpose low\nIncome because remember they'll still tell you it's going to education but\nAnd that and they like it is that it's not adding ...\nRight but as it was originally sold it would add to the educated with I tend to agree she would make it so we would solve the problems did you also see\nWhat was that did you see the attorney general of the of the Colorado saying that uh you know that overall state coffers aren't benefiting from the marijuana sales right because it's recreational things that people would spend on ... on other things\nYou well it's funny because you and I talked about this about sports venues or something and they they sell you you know okay we're going to build his new sports venue and it will bring a lot of money to this area well it might bring money to that block that the vicinity [laughter] that um that neighborhood\nBut it's actually shifting it from somewhere else in that area in other words people were making the because there's only so much money they have to spend on entertainment right um\nYou know unless unless with the exception of the Dallas Cowboys where you have people mortgaging there [laughter] in front of ... for the seat license and typically they wouldn't do that before so there is that\nBut uh yeah it's just you're just taking entertainment money I don't know what do you know what would be a great study now you've got me curious\nPeople who are spending money on legal marijuana and I guess we could only include the the people who\nI don't know who are smoking more marijuana or just started smoking marijuana because it's legal what did they change about their budget what did they give up in order to afford the marijuana [laughter] I Would I Would love to see that poll I'm just curious just curious\nIf not Netflix or\nCome up with a bunch of them but if if you're a heavy pot smoker you really worried about a budget well\nThe money has come from somewhere [laughter] right [laughter] okay what is it that you're talking now what's in the pawn shop now\nNot ... not you're you're not cutting back on Monday [laughter]\nWell and see 'cause that's that's adding to the budget so you're Cheetos slash pot budget where where's that coming from\nBut the judge just seeing a little bit about the laughter there we thought we'd start to show up with that and speaking of ... coming up with a little bit we'll talk about Mr pot ... John painter did you ever think you'd call him Mr Potter\nYeah here's a guy who didn't like messy so he went to work for a tobacco [laughter]\nWell you remember he was completely against legalization of pot you know now he makes his money off\nIt and you know what's interesting is this started a while back I mean this this is the company that that is with right I mean he I remember when it first broke that this was I don't know either earlier this year last year\nWhere they were saying you know he's evolving grappling whatever that was that they you know with with the Obama on gay marriage um he's grappling these evolving but he's changing\nOn his opinion on [noise] well yeah he's in the private sector working for a company who's going to benefit from it is going to get a paycheck from it so now he's for it\nWell you know the ... remember he he was one of the reasons that the term the swamp was calling swamp that he's currently in yeah if the DEA flies over at Belden\nHey a swamp like that that would be a good environment right lots of natural water\n[laughter] at all no I'm I'm thinking about where I live and I don't think they found any big pot farms around there now but it's quite it's quite a swamp the area and so there's a lot of there used to be a lot of grow areas you know within like a ten mile radius illegal grow area illegally are not legal in ours the yes illegal grow area\nI haven't seen one in a few years so I'm probably five or six years I haven't seen right where right where they have I don't know if the technology has got better but I mean they were quite sophisticated\nIn a row in some of these huge that boggles the mind that they they just\nHave these huge in the middle of a you know metroplex not middle but I mean how you deal but but still you would think somebody would discover it before\nIt induced in helping right in the middle of extremely large suburb right there might be a lot of wild area right right yeah you know ... just a 'cause Dallas Fort Worth is quite spread out but I haven't seen that in a while but I remember they had like two or three ...

about the horse face she said he wanted he had to win ...\nThat the lawsuit was thrown out\nAnd she's got to pay Trump it's done with it you wanted move onto the next when\nMhm don't don't even don't even sit there and you don't do it if you're going to do it go after ... say see this is typically that this was a kind of lawyer this kind of soup and files this is a kind of thing that he did with Kavanaugh and this is why the Democrats are dangerous\nBut she just\nWas in and she really has been President Trump is set in the past that was the thing that finally\nAt her she said why does he insists on going back\nAnd doing something like that when you have the wind and you and I talked about this before in politics you get to win and you move on you've taken you promote the frame so bad when but you take nothing you promote nothing that can be perceived as negative out of that when everything\nIs positive and then you move to the next win and that's one of the criticisms we have had a of a of the president he gets a win\nAnd then makes it not as big of a win because of the things that he says afterwards when there's no reason to say it now she it's not going to change her vote she's still going to vote the exact same way it's not going to change it my concern is when I look at this election is when it comes to Trump exhaustion or somebody like her\nWho again was wary of Trump and then came right aboard and things he's done as we do has done so many wonderful things with by the way the business tax cuts going to help her tremendously in her small business it's going to help her tremendously so extremely pleased\nShe's angry at Trump not because she hates tromp she wants them\nTo win and so\nAgain she's still going to vote I just wonder how many how many people that will affect\nWomen and men who are on that border and when you have an election when you had his election in in twenty six team that was so close how many people does it affect and that gets back to the again the\nThe old the I I think political philosophy is once you get the wind move on well and then they don't do anything that changed the way\nThere if there's one thing with being a sore loser don't be us or winners\nDon't be evil remember we said that remember at an end twenty twelve yeah\nWhen\nWe had Democrats calling up and we said you you know you said you guys were sore losers were our you haven't said anything that would make a sore losers in fact it sounds like you're a sore winner\nMhm this was an Obama supporter when he won and twenty twelve I'll never forget that\nNow because we called and ... you know fairly angry I wouldn't say you know but it just you know all way angry ... but he was saying why he wasn't gloating and he wasn't even it wasn't like it was ... he was still ... still angry and we weren't angry I guess that that was the problem is that we didn't we weren't\nAngry enough for him but yeah that's what it was right now and that apparently angered him and his guy one but the you know [laughter]\nThere are certain things that are are are are I guess you know built in when you try on a\n... compartmentalize this current president um\nWhat's not built in as well as the unexpected is the is the language that is used in and everything else\nI don't think there are a distraction the ... the problem for anybody who's going to be on board one way or the other neither do I ... ... except the problem is elections or one by people who aren't on board yet in every case\nThat's where your over the top that's where the you know whoever that ... or the people that are in that group are going to put you over the top\nOr to either win or lose\nAnd and that's what you can't ah so you know for us are doing this for a living of course but having followed all of this you know daily um and and and very involved\nThat was something that you know all the language is a given it's it's it's built in for anyone who is on board it's a built in it's not going to change your vote\nThat's not the case that I mean that's not the point the point is is that you've got to worry about those in the middle that are going to get you there and that includes right now in the in the house everything needs to be focused on the campaign trail but the president's building huge numbers massive numbers\nAnd these campaign stops these rallies are really doing well\nAh so someone someone posted a on a\nOn social media a Ted ... it was so crowded Ted Cruz even Ted Cruz had nose bleed seats\n[laughter] so\nYou know the the Houston rally ... but it's it's going well and it's got that momentum is going for you\nWhat you're trying to do is you're trying to bring in New business basically if you're going to talk to this president trying to expand the ... you need to talk to people who don't you're talking to people who don't know you or don't know what to expect W a who aren't decided\nWho aren't in your corner just yet that's who you're trying to lure in and those distractions or just that well it's and\nAnd that one led me to also think about the whole thing that you and I joke to uh uh uh about when remember when the new NAFTA was passed and he said\nHe called the people that disagreed with his tariffs turf babies ... and we laugh because we said we were the original tell you argue over their head and and we we left but we laugh about it but then we thought about it and we said\nWhat about a farmer who's losing his business because of it and the president says something like that to me and again I don't believe the president was talking to the farmers right right right but if you're a farmer he is talking to you I thought he was talking to you know the political pundits out there and maybe even us to see the terrorists work we disagree with it because\nThe only victory he claimed was the automobile victory that's the big victory that he claimed\nWhich cars going to be more expensive so if you\nPut tariffs on that hurt American business to raise the cost of automobiles tell me how that's a positive he never explained that and so we went through that at the time but we laughed at the whole thing and that don't take anything personally we we do this for business so [noise]\nAnd then he got so then he backed our business right doesn't effect but if you're if you're a farmer heater in mind right if it affects your business it's quite possible that your family your spouse your your adult children and everyone it's it's your entire families livelihood\nAnd then you think of the region and all the small businesses that support that industry as is always the case and what it means when we're town and community and everything else it's a big\nDeal and maybe a number of farmers yes that and and people that weren't a you know it'd be initially you know would not both Republican and did because of you right right and then you and and again that's\nWhat I go to Iowa in one state right and I don't know I don't know what kind of an effect will have only knows it's not a positive effect when those things happen right you don't need to my I guess my point is you don't need it seems that this president at times\nThings that the only people he has to satisfy is his base in his rhetoric mhm he's satisfying I Believe his base for the most part\nUh and and I think the the base has has his base has expanded because of the whole cabinet thing what's your base isn't going anywhere from space isn't going anywhere they're staying with him and and the people surrounding his base are going to stay with him that it's ... it's those people who are okay\nThere's some good things and bad things where am I going where you know what am I think and then boom and and so I just thought to bring up what the the the one\nLoyal Trump supporter told me who will vote for him again and vote probably straight ticket Republican I'm I I'm guessing I'm not sure ... but it probably would vote straight ticket Republican who was just finally ... that was the limit the horse race was the limit was because you\nHad the when you had the when it was a slam dunk win and then you made it less civil went right why why are you doing that why do you feel you need to do that when it doesn't help expand your base right\nAnd so there you go but uh what is your calls in comments coming up your life you can and we do

I don't believe they left\nI Believe that they are motivated to vote based on what based on any allergy and constitutional issues that are really really dear to them I'm Talking about the conservatives that have banned in Trump\nBack in twenty sixteen the never Trump voters\nThe people that might have voted for him but we're still a little bit wishy washy might not have been as motivated to go out in the midterms cabinet change that completely\nI look at Democrats and it's the hatred for Trump remember ...\nYou know I we talked earlier about uh about Trump's exhaustion let's talk about Democrat exhaustion how many allegations that they made against Trump that have gone away\nIncluding rushing collusion that whoever thought that Russian collusion just six months ago would not even be a talking point at\nAll from the Democrats going into the mid term well\nYou think about it we're about to go I I mean we're less than two weeks away from\nElection day and they're not talking about corruption in an election no and it was almost a sure thing given fat as as they presented it and have been for the better part of two years\nAnd so the the Democrat exhaustion that's been portrayed Trump is Hitler Trump is Hitler Trump is Hitler Trump is an authoritarian Trump is this Trump is well it's like the other day when Trump came out and and and I think that the the ... what oh there is okay he says he's a nationalized\nYou got to understand what Trump's definition of nationalist is\nYeah right that's the risk of changing the definition of words because you're talking about somebody a president of the United states who would like to put the United states first that's his definition\nTheir definition has to do with hate groups right has to do it a hate group sent and Hitler yes and so if you use the same term even if your definition is different it doesn't matter the the the label sticks but even that fading away because people of experience them and the thing is remember ...\nWe weren't going to be around in two years because of Trump ... the whole world was going to be a huge mushroom cloud and when you throw up that incredibly heated rhetoric day in and day out and day in and day out there is also an exhaustion that you put\nOn your own party that every allegation that you throw out never goes anywhere right and you find out\nThat I and I think what may get Democrats more angry right now than anything is\nTrump has become normalized we're used to it now well that that's the other that's the other side of it uh in\nIn the political realm it is not really it right now it it nothing has changed in well gosh since January twenty six teams at least\nI went\nBack and I was I was looking at some old the videos were clips or news clips and the different videos on YouTube and coverage of Trump before he officially started you know ... or ... announced that he was going to run and twenty sixteen\nI'm going back to the a fight with Rosie back and forth there right and they certainly people pick sides but it wasn't really anything serious\nThe left really kind of in many ways adored him\nThey may not have stood by aside during that back and forth with Rosie but they really didn't they weren't coming out you know and and it wasn't that kind of hatred until he became the threat and that's when he decided to run for president and if you think about it\nI Do wonder in terms of the things that he promoted at at the core lower taxes fewer regulations are these pro business thinks\nI Wonder if they knew that threat was real and and the way to engage him and this is you know are certainly would be a strategy from the left\nKnowing that he's probably got the the skills in terms of negotiating if he's got the the uh the makeup on on the numbers on Capitol Hill he can get those things done to do away with Obamacare things he was promising and twenty sixteen\nAnd even before a lower regulation lower taxes the thing's all of these things that the left AA\nHe became the real threat because they knew he was going to be effective in those things and rolling back essentially the entire Obama agenda that's the real threat so how do you start to unravel that threat you engage him and other things knowing that because of the history\nOf going back and forth on social media with with Rosie O'Donnell or whoever it is knowing who's going to\nEngage in that way that that would hopefully derailed his campaign the fact that it didn't and look at all the things that were said during that twenty sixteen campaign\nIs staggering it really is it's it's totally unprecedented and it tells you where we were as a nation\nThis is why I think we can't underestimate you know the the silent majority or whatever you want to call I don't think you can call this race and say you know oh was that the house was definitely go to will go to the Democrats I don't make productions\nBut there's this is this is anything but a normal election year because twenty sixteen wasn't and we've rented up ... and ... and the\nThing is as I mentioned earlier the danger of Trump exhaustion was blown out of the water because of capital\nRight right and is it is\nAs it is about ... fire right on that I like how energize\nYeah is there are the Republicans yeah because I have never in in that time period that that happened I don't have a read right now because everything's basically gone silent we'll find out in two weeks but I have not in a long time I don't know the last time I saw\nI'm trying to think of the last time I saw the Republicans\nSo United and I really can't you know again going back to Reagan I really wasn't studying politics as much ... ah back then I became a talk show host in eighty nine so uh you know I I wasn't as observant or you know as to the unity of the Republican Party at a you know at that time\nI Know it was greatly United but over an issue I in my lifetime I just don't remember the

want get them to be specific about what comprehensive immigration reform is to them and you do that by doing exactly what we had said\nMake\nAccusation that all they care about is open borders they don't want comprehensive immigration reform they want open borders then when they come back you and say you're just exaggerating it then you say fine tell me what you would do\nInstead of top for heads up immigration reform county plus typically what you want\nEverything from what we do with illegal immigrants that around the country right now\nTo when we decide what to do with them whether it's your plan to give them amnesty\n\nWhether it'd be citizenship or just legal status in the country without citizenship\nAt\nOnce you decided you know to Mr Ramos whatever if that's what ... or anybody in the last ... which you you would want than what would you do\nAt that point when more illegal immigrants which to come over to the United states what would you do and we let them all and then you're for open borders they deny that that's an unfair thing to say we have to win and this is why we said earlier when the president gets a wait and move on\nAnd move on move on to where you know you can get another when when you get another one right now challenge the Democrats make the accusation\nIn order to start the debate going make the accusation that they will come back at you and say it's unfair you're for open borders fine tell me what your plan would be\nThe what is your plan and because the because there's\nWhat you have to do is essentially force them into position of promoting what they actually believe\nIf they never do it they just talk about comprehensive immigration reform and carrying about everybody well what does that mean when it comes to power\nGive me the top three of the or give me three of the four pillars of your comprehensive plan what would that include\nOtherwise you end up with this and I want to play this audio cutting it gets you nowhere

available to law enforcement where law enforcement can follow you wherever you go\nMhm All right so they they can they can track of a pattern but a warrant is needed for that but the difference is on that is the fact that you have proactively said I'm going to you don't have to get a ... right you don't ... now you know you don't ... you don't have to use\nOr the toll tags now even if you didn't use a toll tags that would pick up your license plate and send you a letter so they could still you know as a track you but when you don't use or you can use an alternate route but when it rang some cases in in some cases right\nUh but you ... it'd be interesting to see how the Supreme Court looks that just says you know and it may be look you're on a public road anybody can scan you\nWell because you you ask yourself it imagine you had an officer [laughter] or a group of officers were riding down license plate numbers of um you know if they could uh if it was humanly possible for them to write down license plate numbers um\nUh and sit on the corner all day and do that or or just sit in a a a vehicle uh you know and do that I mean they actually have\nA some of the departments are getting these these ah scanners in in their in their squad cars or will be soon so that it helps them identify that that ah those license plates uh sooner but if you're talking about being able to to set up\nA in a stationary a situation where municipalities are authorities and you know any given\nA governing entity can monitor you and and that's what they're doing I mean if you think about that so all that data is stored ride it goes directly into a database and you're you can you can from that create programs that we'll extract\nA you can type and number was this was this license plate scene here on this\nDate or in this date range right um\nThat becomes a little bit different and is it like the whole in a safe thing where the government is just storing data on cell phones or your your matter data on cell phones and people say well they're not listening to call so it's not invasive but they can't track behavior\nYou know knowing what types of calls you've made they can from that determine what your behavior was to to a great extent uh this is interesting because\nIt's tracking the vehicle\nBut which in turn tracks the vehicles\nOwner or at least pairs it down to a household a and and then again uh you can determine the behavior they're so\nIt'll be an interesting case because I think it's going to go all the way to go to\nWell you know I I from ... in my life I cannot live a life of crime mhm because\nNumber one I have you know I've I've I've got the the whole uh what location stuff in in in my vehicle and and all that which\nAgain the authorities don't look at but if they want it to they could get a warrant look at it and uh then I realized that when I take my bike rides or hikes mhm you know I have the app that you know that and after you're done you can see exactly where you've gone well that's right or somewhere that the police could also use and they get a warrant for that and I realized mine almost my entire life and I have a told bag\n[laughter] ah so I have a I I have a toll tag I ah I'm\nTrying to think what else is is there any place that\nNo because every white guy even if I go shopping they've got cameras that they got cameras monitoring the ... and you and I and many people now have cameras it's very common to have cameras in your home oh you do see about just walking down the street going for a walk every day oh yeah there's there's there's a there's cameras in the ...\nAnd then what is my job everybody can monitor every word I send my job they can monitor or I guess I'm Talking into this microphone well I have zero privacy now [laughter] I'm not sure that as proactive in that we engage in that yeah you know we run that voluntarily\nUm you could uh I'm I'm sure the hearing in the hearings or the back and forth and and the debate on this whole thing with the license plates scanners and Florida\nAre on this case will be okay but you also that's kind of a voluntary uh you know process\nUh you can choose to not be in a vehicle or you know you could take public transit ah depending I guess on the availability of that well if that would and riding or using a bicycle or walking or whatever and I guess you would start at this particular point\nMany police officer if you're in front of them for any reason to run your life's mhm\nYeah they don't write right but they could run your license and make a judgment on you right at that point ... just based on the information that they have that you have unpaid marketing and the question becoming a is you're you've got a warrant out yeah you know what on that\nAnd what the what the complaint is is that because this is where it gets interesting is that you're developing\nA pattern to it would be like the police following you as opposed to a of a police officer just by happen happenstance you know a ... patrol right you know I'm you know pulling that up\nNow an officer can also follow you I mean if they if they suspect something now they're not going to follow you for days and store all that information for three years outside of investigation but they legally could they would not neither had war it's a four or most of of you know for just following you in a vehicle\nSo I guess what is the difference between that and DUI road blocks\nWhere they stop everybody who goes through if the\nIf if their claim is if their argument is by the way folks were just having a discussion here [laughter] I realize we're on the radio right right [laughter] it was like oh we're on the radio here\n[laughter] but well I think it's an it's letting the days just based on right technology in the world technology you know you got a DUI now some states like Texas in Oregon and as far as I Know I don't know about Oregon anymore but when I was there no robots aren't allowed they find that unconstitutional by the state constitution right\nSo we don't have road blocks or with ... so you can have\nMore rights in a particular state you just can't have fewer rights and uh but across the country do you I road blocks are are fine so with the\nWith the same a premise behind a or that or\nCould they would that I I'm assuming somebody would try to use it that look worse scanning every body it's not that we're picking out one individual were scanning everybody if we got one individual by race or one individual by you know I I think that\nThe difference comes with with the the data the sale and its story you know and and what it can be used for beyond any given day or moment right so in the moment of a a DUI road block or like a ... when they set up a we\nCall them speed traps are our apologies to officers but that's what they call them the dress [laughter] radar gun well that's why they they call them that you get your car [laughter] yeah right [laughter] I you know the the whole yeah and you know what I resent that apology [laughter] all of them you know I hit my break you know I had my breaks\nBut the but you know when they so when they do that it's kind of the same\nThing right it's just at random they are going to be in a particular spot whoever passes that spot is going to be subject to that uh action or level of enforcement by that particular uh an enforcement agency well now what's different is you're getting a you're you're taking this data and the\n... what what that data base now becomes right if it were just scanning and let's say they kept it for\nForty eight hours Seventy two hours uh thirty days\nBut didn't keep it for three years because three years would be a pattern or you know I mean thirty days could be questionable I mean you could have the same argument\nBut it's but the DUI data isn't necessarily stored on any given I I mean the deal I wrote stop right a isn't necessarily stored on any given individual I mean unless there is a pattern of behavior just by happenstance but but\nBecause of a person engages in certain and we all do we all have our certain areas and we go to shop at the same store we'd go to the same places maybe a you know whatever it is a you know nightclub movie theater or whatever it might be for entertainment or job and everything else\nAll of that become something different when you could say okay here's what that person or engages in or where he visits or she visits it doesn't necessarily prove anything but it backs other circumstantial evidence\nOr or a support other hard evidence well and the ...\nAt this station thanks for asking impact rather not engineered pictures on camera shy already said now\nIt's against my religion I'm giving my dog it back

O.\n\nApologize for nothing [noise]\nRead a review\nAnd hands are currently and I'm hearing that married to six Ninety red eye so you have one in the winter there is in\nSouth Carolina from what we know ... uh one winner in South Carolina of the mega millions of one ticket won ... went to when I wouldn't even take it was so I don't know if it's one winner but yeah um\nBut that'd be crazy if it was like a the entire population of South Carolina got together and bought a ticket and they all get ten bucks I mean it didn't have all after taxes they after taxes they get five [laughter] um yeah that that ... a lot of money\nTo deal with we read that Fox News or a a story earlier that said hey remember how it was supposed to supplement education it does it have been talking about the states where it doesn't even go to education ah anymore that hey taxpayer you were sold them sold a bill of goods and also\nSince twenty Seventeen they've made it harder to win the big prize yeah so ah purposely that the they said no the cost has\nDoubled over a period of time and the chance of winning the big money now has gone up even higher in and they talked about how they originally you could pick a number I I've never played it but like between one Seventy five now it's one and\nI felt it was yeah one in Seventy nine wanting somebody odds are are they are much labor and and why it's more expensive right you could still owns some of the smaller prices but they made it very hard\nThey made it harder to win the real big prize for it and and it really just to go to supplement education anymore because the state's even that use it for education have taken other education money that was targeted for education from the general fund and moved that elsewhere mhm so it wasn't this great you know huge edition\nOr to what schools or were you know we're we're getting to fund them\nAnd the other thing is it's mostly poor people that play the lottery ... the poor people spend the most money on it\nYeah uh over what they say the average American spends a the average American spends two hundred and I think two hundred and fifty something dollars but the average per person spends\nOver four hundred dollars a year on lottery tickets now that the average that's taking everybody into consideration if you just take the people to play it it's probably higher yeah\nI just you know for me I just I'm an odds kind of person I don't fear of flying because I Know the odds are\nOne in ten million of me died and those were extremely high odds I understand the odds I understand the odds of winning the lottery or what ah twenty times greater ... thousand times greater than me dining in an airplane\nMhm [noise] so yeah you don't get ... entertainment than anything I think for people that they they buy what they buy a ticket for what the dream yeah yeah uh\n... for I don't know what's the cost of a mega millions at two bucks as sitting on how\nAnd what what do they say if you you can't win it if you don't play and I always say well I don't lose if I don't play I\nI didn't know someone who won I say I did because they did the right thing while they were forced to do the right thing this was in the early\nNineties or what our state first got the uh the lottery\nUm and it was I think it was either I was six or seven million dollars and they want and the but the they
