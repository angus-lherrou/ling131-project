Americans might have been more tenacious it's hard to say but it was a constant complaint even with the second division as well some\nSay well I've wondered about the rock and the ... for example this took place in July the Americans just didn't run away and the French ran away the first the Germans ... at the moment Germans guns are opened up they run away and the Americans were unfamiliar with the idea that you run away when the Germans started shooting\nWell like I say that might have been a morality issue um it's hard to say uh yeah they were any way that the story as they were supposed\nTo come up on the Marines left and there was a there was a readout at the bottom of it this is the editor and hook as it\nWas very well fortified machine guns they the French could not take a Connecticut they finally said to fit a\nRegiment was trailing six regiment to the left and they they took it then they left and they gave it to French and the Germans rates of it so it just it was a it was a bad thing so basically\nGates and his men are uh it's about a mile let's say about a mile up the hill and their towards the top of that sort of the top of their their\nTheir banned in Germany trenches they're taking it\nBut they're left is exposed and Kate's at one point looked over the course of about eight hundred German said that his way he went back and they had tanks for support with assault tanks silver\nAnd basically in the Marines just started last way of them and he says you know that that broke up that that really well um then they get to the top\nFifth regiment followed them up basically like you say the kind of like an island that left in the air as it used to say about flying and it's night following and they're just wondering\nWhat's gonna happen I'm going to have some of the German town right to force down the hill or what but they survived the morning and then uh the fifth regiment was ordered to attack which they did and then they got caught by that afternoon in front of the villages that chant massive German force\nI'm just artillery machine guns could not advance any further and that that basically became the battle for the next ten days was just ... inches degrees until finally they were able to take to the village of Senate Chen and then the thirty six divisions took over\nThere was a lot of action left between October and November eleventh however part of the discovery of cliff Kate is that we're going to leave Nineteen Eighteen\nAnd we're going to travel quickly to August and September Nineteen forty two where are we were on Guadalcanal\nCliff cage is now a marine veteran he's a colonel commanding on Guadalcanal and the Japanese are sending wave after wave of the top teams they're bringing them down the plot US Navy as bugged out is left the Marines all by themselves\nAnd it reminded me as I got some of the chapters gym\nJust like a month or just like black mall that a case again and the Marines were left to fight it out of a and surrounded and they survive\nYeah exactly and others one battle in particular\nI Believe it was about August twenty first battle of the federal river with the Marines had dug in there was a colonel a cheeky brought up a portion but a thousand then down the beach towards them and attack them in the middle of the night and actually they killed\nQuite a few Marines but they never broke the line um and then in the morning gates came up to the front the was it was the first marine regiment that he was commanding\nAnd they sent takes in and basically uh pretty much kill that'd be less a Japan Japanese warrior so that was broken up with its vicious fighting and they moved on\nTo the rest of their portion of the island there is supposed to take an old ... feel these things\nOh it tastes week so that battle goes on until Nineteen forty three and chaos at this point is he and his diaries in his letters twenty four years later is he reflective on his ability to survive being surrounded and cut off because he talked about it to a to as to his route to his relatives or friends\nNot you know what he was a very matter of fact guy uh yeah I think it would have made a good attorney wonderfully light he should've gone back to being an attorney instead of staying with the marine corps I think he was\nHis mind was just it was a guy who is best under action went away and pick up the actions when he is the clearest and that's what makes them a great combat leader or a great leader in general um he didn't really reflect it was not a self reflective person that is that introspective than a KIPP I picked up the name of his letters but he was happy\nI did up most given what happened in first world war to keep us casualties down and that of course they had better equipment by then too\nBut he's very mindful of the waste that going on in the first World War and what not to happen uh at Guadalcanal and later although it more difficult path to keep casually down any Jima he did what he could there too but that was just a bitter fight\nA one detail that are made me like him he had a friend who went back for supplies I think it was a fellow would I think it was very early and he never saw him again did they find his body and did they bury it\nOh yeah he was looking for the third battalion right before the assault on Russia's yeah and a half of them was walking away with a cigarette in his mouth and they and then he went out looking for the body on the day that does if your gas attack or they did find his body\nThey did and he's buried at ... at the at the cemetery their\nFellow I Believe he is I Believe he is very there and where it's cake bearing rate Arlington\nWell that's a that's appropriate and ... and cases people remembered him until they all left us and I wonder if you know I guess the Marines from Guadalcanal er going now to two wars of veterans remembering case the name is\nThe book is I Will hold the story of United States Marine Corps legend

much already have a great night Randy I'm very kind words Eric and and and there will be back next week and they do a terrific job and they'll than the regular host so I'm just filling in and trying to hold on to do my share of there but I have a\nStory on Hillary no I Want to get a little while and the Democrats really fear that she's going to run again that yeah that's why the more I thought about the more about it that's my number one choice\nThat the others that you you know I'd love to see our NATO you guys crazy loon Tucker Carlson freeze room is not that bad right a sleazy porn lawyer bought a let me know what you think Andy in New York City you're on with mark Hi Andy\nYeah Hi thanks for taking my call [noise]\n[noise] um I just was you know interested in why there's such a big um such big\nTalk about Saudi Arabia and what they did [noise] um you know what they did was terrible book you know ... you know even if what to do something small that's all right but it's such a big making such a big uproar about it on I mean you know I'm sure that they they have Saudi Arabia or you know it doesn't have the cleanest record\nKing Solomon does for sure [noise] um and I mean generally get involved in things abroad when it when it's in our interest you know when when we could prevent you know bigger or human rights you know you know crisis or [noise] or you know to expand our power abroad you know to protect us you know as you know offensive is different\nBut in this case I mean she wasn't a US citizen I'm here to green card\nOn you know if they did it it is in our best interest to just you know there are big player in the middle east for us you know to protect us against Iran so like whoa you know they they helped us out so why um what's the big uproar you know they've\nDone things like this in the past that we've known about you know just I guess it wasn't so publicly you know he I mean this king Solomon he's locked elect all ... you know the princes in a hotel for a few months they said that make them pay ransom saying he's not he's not exactly a moderate you know\nIt is not your regular guys like let's say you know it's trying to understand that\nWell let me see if I can add something to your thoughts about him\nLook it's a ... it's always been a difficult a jigsaw puzzle out there in the middle east right the Israel's our basic friend and we can count on them but the other players or you know like Saudi Arabia the war more anti Israel than they are now they both have the one side of interest in terms of Iran trying to stop Iran\nBut I got to tell you I just thought of it maybe it's a visceral reaction the idea that this guy goes in there and I'm not trying to save and great about him because he was a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood and you know the their their enemies of ours are as they weren't in Egypt\nSo I'm not a big fan of what he believes in in that sense what to do when someone or be lured into an embassy which is you know he's supposed to have a special status when a country has an embassy in another country that is the snares and their territory their land\nYou lord in there and and then you shop 'em up when you assassinate him and\nI it just so revolting to people I I think that's what was going on and you're right it's a complicated situation as we need their oil and we need them to fight Iran it's very difficult situation for President Trump but just the thought I I must have been taught to me too I I felt badly from even though I'm ... I think I wouldn't agree with him probably many issues\nBut that's you know you agree with and the ... getting getting killed like that is horrible\nYou know I mean so ... yeah\n... even that there should be you know definitely should be an uproar and they should be condemned for it but I mean though that they really want to large scale it seems like a large scale you know cutting off you know businesses and\nAnd ... and I mean I I don't know if it's in America's Best interest to do that like just you know for the even though it's a it is a horrible incident but for this alone I don't think you know I'm In the bigger picture you know ... such yeah\nYeah I I I cringe when you said cutting off business I that's bad in this in this story but um you're right we we need we need them badly and that's why I say President Trump ... isn't a very difficult situation and there are people like Lindsey Graham who's terrific on in the Kavanaugh hearings now saying hey\nYou know I'm never going there again while this guys and the princes in power\nAnd this and then Marco Rubio a I mean there are people on our side saying\nWe we can't allow the ... you ... you know as as crazy as it sounds you have to have some civility in this crazy world right you don't want the president is assassinated you don't take out food and even if you can\nYou don't do stuff like that that's why the the Kennedy thing John F. Kennedy thing was was so outrageous it to this day I'm One of the few talk show host I should say now\nThat does think there was a conspiracy I a little kid but I I've followed this stuff and um I you just don't do that you just you know what I'm saying I don't know if the Russians were involved in a mafia was involved I don't know for sure I I'm not saying Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't involved\nBut you know this there's something about you don't take out people and that's why by the way he ... he was so outrageous by a Obama a because he was becoming our friend\nA difficult yeah so you you get it and it was right he didn't he writes for the Washington Post and stuff do you know I don't want all the different countries and assassinating them go ahead\nI Know I but I Do feel I mean my my impression is that let's say Russia you know they just recently had a story you know in in England with that export\nUm I'm sure you know it's probably no you know in Washington is probably like you know known that a lot of many countries you know Russia I'm sure Putin takes out you know yes people going down\nHis political opponents you know here and there it's not it's not really um [noise] it's not uncommon\nYou know so it's just interesting the reaction I guess because it just became like ... like public public no you know the story\nAnd he ... he goes he yeah he goes in there and it wasn't his girlfriend waiting outside and he said you know if I don't come out and you know his what'd you do and and he just disappeared and they made it worse no we always say that the the it's the not even the crime itself but the cover up\nAnd they said something they were never in you know they weren't involved and they came up the story that was\nA lot of interrogation that uh got got went badly yeah uh that that that's that's a little crazy right well yeah it does show they're\nPretty sure they're pretty bad [laughter]\nIf you ... yeah this wasn't a by the way it was mentioned my produced last night this wasn't a job interview that he was going in for that that would that would be a job interview that went badly no credible home I think people\nEven on our side are reacting viscerally and I I don't blame him because I felt the same way you can drop 'em up and when they brought didn't they bring suitcases it's reported it and you know how do they think it's funny I mean I don't want to be gross that way on the air but I I think all of that stuff you may be right just the fact that we knew about there's always espionage there's always dirty stuff going on\nBut this one way played out was not good\nYeah thank you Andy I appreciate your call very much by the way how old are you I'm a twenty two I thought you sound young who is your choice on the Democrats' side who

you\nSaid you would agree with that you ...\nYeah you said you've been listening to I mean that's what I said I I just care what he does he's totally shocked me how good he is a I think it's been a

victory in Kansas City look through your on with mark\nAh find good evening I'm my my main topic is uh the\nProsecution of Hillary call me and and but the ... I Can't remember the head of the CIA guy\nUm if we don't prosecute these people for the crimes that they did a weirdo were no better than a third world or the third world country we're letting these people get away with what was wrong illegal unconstitutional and basically all those things make make I'm an American\nAnd the if if we don't take people who commit treason and prosecuted for that then they're going to keep their little followings that they're going to walk around you got plenty of people out there that are saying that well you know ... evidently it wasn't that bad they did break the law they didn't do anything that was so evil and\nUm it it's [noise] I I just think that something needs to be done to show them and along with all that you know freezer assets because they're ill got games in the Clinton Foundation\nAnd I mean if we're going to go all out or go all lit on Kavanaugh for thirty five years ago I I'm sure we can find plenty of people and evidence for what Bill did back in the eighties\nSo I mean why can't we go that route\nYou can and although someone challenge me and said what about the civil war right he committed uh certainly uh illegal acts at the time and yet we were generous and you know we we didn't Lincoln didn't want to do that kind of stuff\nBut then the civil war time assistant Wertime says it\nPeople who actually are saying that the people who did who fought on the side of the confederacy were fighting this is I have a different view on on the civil war then some people do I mean I I I understand that\nFor some it was about slavery but for most it was about a overreach with the federal government and civil disobedience and states' rights that's where that's where the bases\nThere were a lot of the items were fighting that okay go ahead\nNo no you know I was living in synch gr\nOkay now but I mean that's so that that's where I mean to me the rebel flag that the rebel and actually it's not even really the rebel flag it was a a a battle flag from a particular state it took on a representation of states' rights to me that represents states' rights over\nSlavery and when I talked to people and I've actually talked to people who have\nFlown that flag where I've had that symbol on their truck or whatever it is and I asked him say okay now\nWhat does that represent to you and nine times out of ten it does have to do with\nYou know states' rights and an overreach from the federal government\nAnd the people that uh take the other avenue as far as slavery and white supremacists and stuff like that then I just you know okay what makes you better than anybody else why why or why are you better than that person what gives you the right to enslave another human being so and I think this is also the difference between\nAn old dovetail hear the difference between conservatives and liberals I won't go party wise here because parties are evidently irrelevant at this point and that is\nWe engage in conversation we engage in discourse\nDefend your defending your principles defend what your argument is they just want to shout you doubt that want to call you names now that is not everybody in the Democratic party that is why I I don't associate that with the Democratic party these are the left wing way out there which\nComes to who I Would actually have coffee with ... there's nobody really on the left politically that I could sit down and have coffee with however I have met George Clooney and he's a really nice guy and very humble and I I could sit down and have a beer at a cigar with him or something that would be cool [noise]\nYeah well I appreciate your hands are tied the guys are not following ... ...\nYeah yeah well it's okay ... well there's there's nobody on the political left I wouldn't want to sit down and have except for ... somebody said Lieberman I I Would love to sit down and talk to labor of it as far as people who I Would like to see yeah oh no no no you said a oh who's who's running [noise] yeah [noise] well you well I\nI Know that there is somebody who's actually discussed running or did you get used to be a rising star who uh no longer I think it is a viable candidate that'd be Jerry Brown I'd love to see him run\n'em really who actually is boom ... love I Love oh I'd love to see him run oh I don't think there is anybody out there that's going to be able to beat Trump I really don't\nAnd I think he's because he's got one a campaign under his belt for the presidency he knows a lot more\nOne thing you can say about him he learns and uh I I think he's learned a lot of valuable lessons and I don't think he's got to be he was a little\nDon't know if they saw but he wasn't he didn't play hardball the way other people do it and I think this time he would really\nTry to be a little bit more aggressive and the way he would uh address anybody who comes against him on the left I'd love to see Cory Booker go up there because I think each I think he ... the same thing with Elizabeth Warren I think anybody from the left it gets out there he's going to pretty much ...\nI certainly agree with you he's gotten much more comfortable in the job he really has become much more presidential and I think that's what you're saying he's really grown into the job and I Oh absolutely\nAnd and he does is he's been doing really good on everybody's watching what the right hands doing\nActually I should say left him because he is science with those right everybody's watching what the left hand is doing it with his right hand he's just signing stuff sided sign of mine and he's getting a lot done why everybody's talking about the rhetoric and looking at the bombastic and and um\nMy my my fiance and I have been a friend it by several people that we went to school with and suffer because you can't talk politics with him\nIs er liberals they don't want to they can't defend their arguments they they don't want to talk about a policy it's just Trump pay ... it's like well we're where do you see that he have ... well he just talks about\nMe examples because all the hate that ice is coming out of the left\nAll the people that I was talking about hate or over here on this side that are represented the Democratic party\nAnd when somebody on the white quote right or the Republican Party that comes out spewing hate the Republican Party shouts down and says no you don't represent the Republican Party David Duke there have been many many uh examples of people who have come out\nOn the quote unquote right\nWho spew force hatred and racism and and that kind of stuff and we won't have it at our party however\nThey will tell you I got to let you go but you've been terrific and you gave me an idea for tomorrow night ... you have a great night [laughter]\nYou're welcome cut me a check [laughter]\nI ... it wasn't that good an idea [laughter] [laughter] well I've done this before but I Want to hear I won't do tonight I'm about

along well in some became\nUm best friends\nBut that was one guy he moved away from California any on Facebook not just to meet everybody said anybody who support Donald Trump is no longer a friend of mine and among friending you\nSo I think you're going to do that or at least for it out there last night I Want to hear those stories and what you've done some of them are really sad\nPeople lost their whole family or certainly better not do to Thanksgiving and maybe we'll do that tomorrow night for tonight who's your choice for president at least for now and who could you have a cup of coffee
