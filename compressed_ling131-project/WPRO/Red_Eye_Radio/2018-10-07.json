anybody give her eye on the right ability I oh I Know this probably maybe we've mentioned her just once or twice as being\nJoking but why does anybody give her any type of credibility whatsoever I've always well then again if you're talking about the left I say you should give somebody credibility by the substance of their argument well that's the case you'd never hear from anybody on the left so I I forget about what I just said\nThere well I don't know why she's relevant is she in the current show I don't know I actually don't know I don't know why she was relevant otherwise I saw what ... who's the boss to runs all the time you know I'm just me and she was in the the one with the ... which is\nYeah yeah yeah so she was a witch right yeah yeah yeah so I don't know I I have no idea if she's in a TV show right now or not\nBut I don't know I was in something last year I don't I really I mean she's she's relevant\nTo the situation because she claims that she was sexually assaulted so\nNo I don't know that I'll get it I mean I Know I Know that she had in part of him yeah she'll probably already do okay yeah yeah\nI didn't know that she said she was sexually assaulted that's what I didn't know okay that makes that would that would be a connection that you could use them to gain you know right with incidents like that because that's what it's about right okay but I I but pop culture wise I don't know she still is or not I actually don't well as I said\nKnow we because we hear people coming forward you know the you know saying look I've also been I was sexually assaulted\nTo them and I stand with her well as we said before whether you were sexually assaulted or not still does not give you any more credibility when a charge is filed\nOr you know when the charges filed against someone I don't mean legally but in this case a ... in um in his nomination to the Supreme Court\nThat the allegation itself\nHas to be backed up by\nEvidence your case for no matter how a missed an evil it might have been if you were sexually assaulted has nothing to do\nWith this case right absolutely nothing because you were sexually assaulted does not give you a better insight as to whether Kavanaugh is guilty or not right none zero right\nAnd that is portrayed you know it's one of the one falls since that's portrayed\nWell then you well okay then you were late here in ... ... because you are sexually assaulted then or what you think about cabinet carries more weight no it doesn't that's ridiculous right it's ridiculous statement to make or to be promoting it has promoted constantly in this\nThe only thing that matters is the evidence\nAnd every Seattle case in you and I talked about this how long have we talked about this\nWhen you know whether it was Trayvon Martin where people were taking sides left and right and we just said look here's the problem you've got that was that the two or three or four minutes span there ... where he was running away and then next thing you know or he was on top of the government that's the only thing that people saw at that point\nAnd because of that huge blank space in there that no witnesses are there nobody can say what happened so\nThey went by the physical evidence which was the life the uh the the injuries to Zimmerman's head but exactly we've said and even a juror or a jury member said\nIt's possible that he got away with murder it's just that with the evidence we couldn't prove because he claims that you know he felt as his life was an imminent danger\nAnd and we rejected at that point and the people uh who would call this show and with certainty say they knew the guilt or innocence site and we had people bringing up the Trayvon Martin was in an age\nDoesn't matter whether he was or what is not an angel right or at any other time of his life it doesn't matter what their men had said at any time in his life right all the\nMatter is he said I'm going to say oh what I write Trayvon Martin right with it and I would have been obviously right would have been which are more said in say\n... but people were definitive in their belief of guilt or innocence and\nBased on a lack of evidence and what they think possibly happen we have rejected that we will always reject that as Americans\nAs far as I'm concerned you're obligated to reject that type of this mindset I'm so you go by the evidence the evidence is what dictates everything\nThe motion is what carries the ah the the cause and in in such protests\nAnd and certainly for the families who suffer are the the loss of a loved one whether it's a Trayvon Martin's family or or Michael Brown family you can feel for their loss but also know this this this is possible but many people find it impossible\nTo feel for the last of the family but also believe and see by the evidence the what the evidence shows that the evidence points to that person also being responsible\nNow it didn't necessarily in in the in the Trayvon Martin case you had you know what the physical evidence was was ... and then that's what the jury found and we ... we don't have\nWe don't have a everything the jury saw no no yeah but in the Michael Brown situation\nWith officer will Wilson on the scene I'm you know the the family or what's the first to commissioned an autopsy and that autopsies the one that showed the hands up don't shoot never heritage was\nAlive it's still being used today yes\nAs a rallying cry yeah never happened\nOr that is unacceptable in America right you know we we talked about the Democrats are always talking about the fascist on the right well if you listen to what we believe mhm and what we believe about the presumption of innocence whether it's a criminal trial a civil trial or\nJust the public opinion in general or a political trial\nStill it's the same thing you judge these cases you judge cases and you'd and and you judge the guilt or innocence based on the evidence that exist not just an allegation alone and and the thing is\nI'm saying this with passion but I really don't have to because\nEvery single Democrat listening right now\nEvery single liberal and democratic protesting yesterday and they all know it but they are willing to throw it overboard\nMhm you know how they know it because we're the first ones many of those who are in a you know who were arrested yesterday a will would demand due process under you know due process under the law ... but the fact is they know it but they will reject it when it comes to their personal politics\nFascism leads the mindset of fascism leads in them when it's what they want when it comes to how they're going to be treated no you must follow the constitution completely\nBut treating somebody else a constitution be damned the spirit of the constitution be damned the mindset of the presumption of innocence and that evidence is the only thing that leaves and should lead is thrown out the window\nBecause we want what we want\nYou know what comes down to I was following a case here in Texas where a man had been wrongly found guilty of murder and all that and you have a Nineteen years in prison\nAnd got out and twenty sixteen they wanted to be fully exonerated was working to that and and finally it happened it was fully exonerated so that's a total of Twenty one years\nWhere he was either behind bars are having is you know his name essentially associated with a murder that happened that he was not responsible for so I was doing some research just to try and refresh my memory on other cases and there was a man who was accused of rape\nAnd spent decades behind bars um it was raping a salt and something else or I think a aggravated assault and rape or in a third charge that I Can't remember but he was\nBehind bars for thirty one years before he was ... it was proven that he was not\nThe person responsible now mistakes happen in the justice system or we don't have we have the DNA technology now or that can prove that it wasn't a you know or their DNA of the scene or whatever it is\nBut you think about you know the\nThe label that goes with being falsely accused and there's a great burden that comes with that for a reason now sometimes it's that the work done in the investigation wasn't wasn't right sometimes it's an overzealous prosecutor on the ... in the legal setting looking to get a political win\nBut\nSometimes witnesses get it wrong well and and in one case in in the murder case it was it was a couple of jailhouse\nWitnesses that helped to seal the deal and you you look at that and and

O.\n[noise] bono show [noise]\nAnd it's running radio and he is there currently not Gary McNamara\nEight six six Ninety ah ah read I think what is the last caller is referring to the letter a truck recipes Sunday a letter to the lawyers of a doctor for that said uh\nUh reading in response to it to your letter dated October second you said Dr for just as yesterday said you said Dr Ford is going to turn over her documents\nTo the FBI but my request to view was not for the documents to be turned over to the FBI actually to provide the documents the Senate Judiciary committee response on behalf of the client is an sec what are the constitution charges the Senate with the ... and the president and his nomination\nSenators have a constitutional obligation to investigate and evaluate independently the president's nominees are obligation as unrelated to anything be FBI does\nThat's why we just don't vote on nominees after the president loans us\nOr the FBI background investigation we have to make our own assessment the U.S Senate does not control the FBI if you have an objection of how the FBI conduct its investigations take it up with director rate\nBut don't raise that objects and there's a reason not to respond to this committee's demand for relevant evidence yet the eyes investigative decisions art art concern\nEven if the FBI never interviewed Dr Porter interviews were ten times this committee as a constitutional obligation to investigate Dr Ford's allegations and that's what we've been doing since we became aware of or allegations\nIt's not even clear to me what purpose tornado do over those materials to the FBI would accomplish the FBI would simply turn that off but in sober\nTo watch it as we just said that we we stopped that's the only purpose the FBI search that's always that's probably stop the last caller says well\nTheir ... their political there's nothing investigation besides political it ... the ... the the FBI only facilitates the interviews they conducted interviews because they have the resources and the training and that's it's that simple right\nAnd and so it doesn't make it again this this is where her lawyers are bringing up something that isn't even relevant to the investigation to begin with because\nFor the million time there is no FBI investigation the only investigation that's been going on is the Senate Judiciary investigation what because it it\nThis shows you how are the the lawyers for Dr Ford or either completely clueless or they didn't want those notes to come out because have they been given to the FBI again assume the FBI decided to\nBond to them and take those notes those therapists notes they would have been part of the report they\nWouldn't they wouldn't have seen the light of day beyond the eyes of a hundred people\nA it's not even and by the way emerges from my phone because I just happened to go on Twitter industry that Mollie Hemingway was on it it's not even clear what purpose turning those materials over to the FBI would accomplish the FBI would simply turn that evidence over to the Senate\nThat is precisely the outcome that I think with this request is to get the information right you have claimed repeatedly that the evidence I've requested supports Dr Ford's allegations against judge Kavanaugh she even provided some of the evidence to\nGive me a second here as I have to go to a to a a national media indeed if the evidence\nOr supported your clients allegation you surely would produce it as quickly as you could but you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from consider any evidence most crucial to Dr Ford's allegation\nI don't know what other imprint we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegation in quite the way you will claimed ooh that's a challenge is not\nRight I urge you once again now for the third time in writing\nTo turn over the therapy notes polygraph materials and communications with the ah with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence in addition to the evidence I requested in my Tobar second letter in light of recently uncovered information this is interesting because that was the key of\nLook at the uh the last sentence with recently uncovered the mission please turn over

Nick or their representatives sincerely Chuck Grassley that letter said yesterday ... so like I said the last caller\nBrought up was she was willing to turn them over to the FBI and our and our point was when I when I said no it's like because our point is to go directly to the Senate to begin with yeah there is no investigation they wouldn't be in bed they simply take it and give it to the Senate

speaking to Shannon brain which means just had to be late last night right uh and Fox News ... said he personally called cabin up Thursday evening and told him I'm going to be there to vote for you as needed so that isn't going to delay anything it was funny because you said\nWell you know it wears his daughter getting married and in Montana it legit you inside right I don't think he wants anybody you know\nI'd probably doesn't want anyone to know and because and that really spells out how crazy this thing\nIs a and has become the left believes going direct especially after confronting a Jeff Flake that it's working that they're you know the the the tactic is not only working but acceptable\nAnd it will shame you out of a restaurant will uh will confront you on the elevator will anywhere and everywhere as directed or I guess they encourage further encouraged by Maxine Waters\nAnywhere and everywhere it doesn't matter where you are getting their face well that becomes dangerous\nBecause it's impossible for somebody to be able to assess a threat just imagine in your everyday life and you're not a lawmaker uh\nUnless we have lawmakers listening which we often do and we thank you for that but you're not included here you're just walking around grocery store [laughter] thank you or the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for listening and and also Senator Lindsey Graham for this yet but exists I guess and\nProbably Rand Paul although he's screaming know all the time um but [laughter]\nWe actually love rental but if you're walking around you know in public the average person and someone just ran up to you and started screaming your face you wouldn't know what they're\nDoing and you wouldn't know you don't you don't know what the threat level is and\nAnd and certainly it's it's different when you were Jeff Flake and you're confronted and the way he was in you you you know why they're\nIn your face but you can't assess the threat level in public you can you just cannot you don't know what the person who is capable of doing if they're the you know there to physically harm you um it's it's impossible to assess that so that such security has been wrapped up\nA tremendous uh the restaurant in fact that's where Ted Cruz was shamed out of the restaurant a first of all kudos to the restaurant saying you know because you can hear a person

appear the columns will if Collins had a concern she would have issued that concern about the report saying I'm not sure we got everything at the very least she would've question something\nPraising the report tells me you can count on that boat so\nRight now you're looking at I mean I think at the very least fifty with vice president\nBingo cyber at fifty one\nOr the word from and and there was another story in the in the wall Street Journal that the you know the GOP right now is a is really upbeat about the confirmation process they you know they it's a if you look at it that the the talk\nRight now is that they're confident uh\nSo you get through a a culture which will happen sometime during the day on friday as you mentioned Gary\nThe process will start mid morning\nUm but then the actual vote may not happen until later in the afternoon when by the time they get to the procedure one with the actual vote take place and then there were the third and they've already our lives the clocks stop starts at that point yet up and they can take up to thirty hours it may not take thirty hours they could end the debate before thirty hours but\nAssuming they'll use the entire thirty hours\nAnd they might ah especially on a Saturday the media might give them the the news media cable news might give them you know all the time of the world are so you look at the the so called hopefuls for twenty twenty\nYour usual suspects I'm a warrant and all of them looking to get camera time or the debate might you know go on the full thirty just assume that it will they'll that's that's why you've got the rule assume that it will so that puts it late into Saturday Night as you mentioned earlier Gary\nDepending on where they landed on the the the clock lands on the culture wrote maybe into early Sunday Morning\nBut that gives them there's the I guess the wiggle room or the enough room for senator Danes to get you know home from the wedding I guess or or back to work for the wedding\nAnd ah as daughter's wedding and we wish your daughter and her\nSoon to be husband all the best uh but though he'll get back he's saying he'll get back in time for the vote so that tells us it's probably going to be a late Saturday Night well\nYou know I I I think about all the ... you know I'm just sitting here just contemplating and thinking of all the\nAll the protests the violence the civil disobedience when certain things you know up at when Trump was elected to you know the the women's march show all all of these things that go on\nAnd if you look over the last eight years and the number of protest remember Occupy Wall street you\nKnow all all that that that the that went on all the the\nThe occupying of city properties and everything else that went on what you're seeing now\nAnd you have a party that constantly does that\nYou have another party that really doesn't do that at All right you see now the getting into the faces of people which can be\nQuite intimidating but here's the question is it effective for them right has it been effective in and you go all the way back like I said we go let's go back to the Obama administration\nI mean you can look at you can look at the uh you can look at the uh the Tea Party but the Tea Party was completely and totally non non violent did not know know riots no tear gas nothing like that mhm\nSo you look at it and you get into the Occupy Wall Street right right where you're actually trespassing\nAnd you know taking over and wanting to camp out and you know there were riots in certain cities that that happened when the police tried to push them off but at this is almost the exclusive domain\nOf the left and therefore the Democrats sure yeah and you think about the run that they have had since all of this\nYou know really I'll I'll look at Occupy Wall street as just the beginning of of this portion of it has it been effective for them when it comes to the vote do people actually respond to it or do they believe that the intimidation tactics\nWill actually work and change for example they're not ... you know you you you could see if they might be a you know threatening\nA just a a you know the the senators that are on\nYou know ... you know I'm On the edge right now right okay on the margins right but they're not they're going after everybody mhm and get whether it's Grassley doesn't care whether McConnell what do they really think that that's affected or is it the fact that when you are just so full of rage\nBecause that's what it is it just insane rage that they're filled with right yeah just anger and and and rage\nIs it just a desperation tactic or do they actually believe that is affected by just I I really wonder and [laughter] and I was thinking to myself here before I started talking about this I'd love to sit down and talk with them oh that wouldn't be possible [laughter]\nSo I'm never going to find out because I'm never going to be able to sit down and say you don't tell us what's your strategy is that right\nWell I I think after the ... like a thing I think they feel empowered to some extent they feel\nThat it is effective to some extent but I think it's probably a lot of I was going to say a little of both I think there's a lot of both actually\nThat they believe after confronting mansion and after ... you know the behavior in restaurants and everything else and shaming people out of restaurants I mean think about that Gary that youre not protesters in a restaurant\nYou work there it's your job and you refuse in one case to do it\nFor because Sarah Huckabee Sanders is eating the food you're going to prepare and serve can you imagine that can you imagine being in that mentality\nNo\nIf I worked in a restaurant I don't care what I was doing in that restaurant\nAnd bar rock Obama and his family came in the last\nThing that I Would do is refused to do my job me not doing my job is not going to change his politics or change anything that I disagree with that he did\nAnd that's the mentality but that's where they that's where they live we go back to the one restaurant where you had a man\nHappened to be African American wearing a make America great again hat\nAnd the staff was shaming him at a table to the point that his companion I don't know if it was his girlfriend or his wife was in tears\nAnd they kept it up they kept it up they kept it up I Can't imagine\nI cannot imagine I wouldn't be able to face my friends and family if I did something so despicable\nJust shameful just shameful if you want to talk about getting a picket going out on the steps the SCOTUS\nAs long as you're not trespassing are breaking the law I encourage that I don't care what you believe I don't care what you're promoting are protesting for or against and I remember it\nWas about you know we've talked about it before it's probably about seven years ago when um and and you know the person that I'm Talking about and and it was really you know somebody who I considered it a casual friend ... you know ... do the more professionally and and and uh\nThey were in a conversation and it was a ... a black man who was a huge fan of my show now I sort of knew her politics were more of\nThe liberal bent but she went absolutely insane we know we haven't talked since that point and she completely rejected me as a friend because in a conversation a black man said he loved our show right\nThink about that and that was really my first taste of that type of than sanity\nBecause that person you refer to as you described it before went\nZero to you know basically right or just just a small talk we do have good to see a a thanks for stopping by that kind of thing too\nSudden over the top rage right with could not believe that somebody of color would be listening to and more so be a fan of ... right\nLog on to the national guard dot com\nContact in the Army National guard recruiter in your area sponsored by the Rhode Island

North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons will be fully coordinated with Japan and South Korea are they all left Tokyo for young gang under pressure to produce tangible progress towards that goal after meeting with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe's\nKnowledge of this otherwise so it wouldn't have happened that I'm convinced why Dianne Feinstein waited until after the other background checks well we're\nIts own over the last couple of days that we have found out how the whole background check works with the Senate because of course it's something that we've never focused on before I Would I've been surprised that the Republicans you know they came out and said that you know they didn't follow the protocol\nBut they didn't fully explain it because when you fully explain it as you just did Eric when you when people understand that look there was a process\nThat ... that Dianne Feinstein could have followed yes that would have always kept because the claim\nFrom Dr Ford is well she just wanted to get a known and then you could do an investigation to find out if you find anything on it but I wanted to remain anonymous right well she could have actually got what she claimed she won it is very important for I think everybody to understand that there was a process to keep her name\nAnd have the FBI do a background check to see if any of this was true without her name\nEver being known\nAnd Dianne Feinstein really said excuse my language to hell with that if we're going to use is a politically\nAnd knowing that linking it would make it public\nWhere she still claims today she didn't want to come forward right\nShe still claims that it is that today so if that was the case and I don't know whether that was a case I'm just looking at the different scenarios ... but if that was the case it was the Democrats that be trade who they thought\nWas a victim of sexual abuse they betrayed her which is why we said they didn't care about her claim felt they never cared about her claim because if they truly cared about her claim and her wanting to keep it secret to keep her anonymity\nIt could have followed the process that existed that they helped create with the Democrat majority in two thousand nine left that have a process yet for somebody to come forward keep their you know keep it quiet and still have a part of the confirmation process yes and and a part of the judgment\nOf why you would or would not want to confirm or the particular nominee but Feinstein\nAnd the Democrats know that the only way to change those you know they were getting down to four or five votes that's what this is all about\nTo change any of those votes as the political pressure and the political pressure is built in the media\nAnd so you can't do it officially finance a Dianne Feinstein knew there was no way of doing this officially because it would never get to the media because Senate rules prohibited from getting to the media now we know why Lindsey Graham was so limited\nLast Thursday a week ago today\nThis is what he was talking about\nViolating the process and the rule circumventing those rules and processes along the way this is what he was getting too because that now the puzzle comes together\nFeinstein new by submitting this to the FBI early on as soon as she got it\nAnd it being part of the background check it wouldn't have seen the light of day Dr Ford's name would not be known to anyone but her friends colleagues and family because that claim\nWould not still would not be substantiated because they even with all of this they haven't substantiated anything except for the fact that she's making the claim\nAnd that means it wouldn't have left the Senate\nAh at all because it would have been apart as the rural states of that three oh to report and they cannot divulge any of the details from that report again keep in mind if there is a criminal case\nAgainst a nominee well that's public the people versus whoever that's public that would be no\nBut there but that's it's not the case when it's just a plain when someone's making a claim and there was no\nReport or authorities involved\nIn that claim at the time so it's very clear why the Democrats chose this route\nNow and didn't didn't want to go forward on the thirtieth you wait until after the vetting process the background checks are complete\nAnd then you linked to the media and let the media help you hopefully build that public pressure\nThat political pressure to drive that those four or five votes\nAnd the Senate that were on the fence\nAnd now uh like I said today is going to be an interesting day I I wanted to leave earlier I said uh just just do two hours the showing repeated the rest of the day so I go home and go to sleep and wake up at seven o'clock because I won't just because I I I I Am\nAbsolutely are as interested as you could possibly be in wondering how the Democrats are going to try to solve this another week\n... what are they thinking does you know they are you know there are ... are they are we got to be able to solve this in some way and so we know that we're going to hear the typical\nThings like well we don't have enough time to actually look at this report a twenty four hours a isn't a is isn't a a a enough enough time well okay we believe that there's caught some cooperation here we disagree with the Republicans and we don't we believe further investigation is needed knowing that the Republicans\n\nAt this moment are not going to break the protocol and the rules that the Democrats created in two thousand nine to all the irony or and and so I you know I don't know where that will go but I'm sure the Republicans have already said\nThey've had to look at and say okay what different scenarios are out there when once were released this I mean they know now the Democrats are going to the Democrats and Republicans both no you know what's in it and if the Republicans say look there's nothing here it's the same as it was last week we're going ahead with the vote I think that no matter what the Democrats say they should go on with the votes\nAnd even if he isn't confirmed then you make it an election issue delaying this another week is not going to change anything that we all know right now you you you did it once you go forward with it you have the votes Saturday if you don't have the votes than you make it an election issue\nInternally no doubt the pressure is going to be on those uh four or five people including mansion a flake or who is shown you know clearly a weakness and uh what they were ... ... what what what they'll tell you on the left the ability to be thoughtful\nConsiderate but [laughter] uh I'm Sorry that was funny I Know I'm the but the but that's what will happen internally externally it will be about building the political pressure still in that and this is the narrative\nThis will be the narrative from here and ...\nWe did not have enough time there was not enough time the FBI did an interview enough people there's no way that could possibly know because they didn't even interview Kavanaugh or Ford well they have both of them on record as a matter of public record as to their claims each of them so\nAll of that is a you know is is the political part of it um but you're right Gary I think in terms of now going forward are you the the the motion to invoke cloture was made yesterday\nOr the cloture vote will happen friday\nAh then they will er and if if they've got the headcount then\nThey're going to move forward with a vote which can happen as early as Saturday I suspect they will not want to waste\nOne minute\nAh in in terms of getting in Saturday and getting that done if they believe they've got those\nVotes even at fifty because the veep can be fifty one the tie breaker\nThen they're going to move on it the\nThe the majority leader will not waste any time and going forward\nAnd say what you will about Mitch McConnell and we said plenty about 'em over the years but he has done since Trump has been president I think a\nA very decent job I don't know what grade I would give him a but certainly I think he's done a decent job across the board and bringing the party together on a number of things to get them done\nLegislative ... this\nThis rises above legislation because as we know those decisions made at the highest court Thirty years yeah this is this is going this this is a big effect this huge affects the direction of the country and ... right now that the majority leader ah along with corn and\nUh and and the number of others right now oh well maybe not right now but last night and and just an hour or two we'll be whipping those votes together and ... and and saying exactly what we just said this is too\nWe're going to wait any longer\nEight six six Ninety read I\nOne of the key agricultural based achievements in recent trade agreements between the U.S Mexico and Canada according to the chief agricultural negotiator for the
