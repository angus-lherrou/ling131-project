block\nIt was direct it's nice and it was a couple of players I Wonder if those are defensive players but they weren't on defense they ride special teams I just wonder looking at this though as hard as we've kinda been tonight 'cause this game was ugly and you know I'm obviously critical of this defense a lot as a as a whole\nI Wonder if I hadn't been given enough credit 'cause looking at it with this pick tonight and now of eleven their second in the league are tied for second the league\nAnd they do they do tend to the game like tonight do they take the momentum away\nOr when the bills are

pick it up at another running back obviously tragic life the model but uh it got a point towards the giants obviously you know but we haven't shown\nYeah man you can't say that it's a bad even though I Know I don't think you are trying to do that on purpose or is it is it's a very bad offensive line there wouldn't yeah wouldn't use that not good can't use that word though a Jonathan Stewart was the name he was going to go for their Jonathan Stewart sixth attempt this year\nSix six times they've handed them\nThe football you're going to the limits season now already one years old at least thirty one years old I don't know what he's got left in the\nTank but I Can't imagine that he could be worse than Kenyan barter not getting the football at all yeah right yeah look I mean what would that may be cost you six around there on to the steward\n... like gift that uh I have no idea what it would cost at this point but he's a bigger back you know like two hundred and fifty pounds bigger type back\nMaybe a little bit more a durable between the tackles\nWhat kind of like what they were looking for to get out of you know maybe the kind of production there we're going to get up Jeremy hills you know just someone that they can add up to for a couple of yard near the end zone you know which I think that they desperately mess shore I mean if they could get him on the cheap I wouldn't mind that just in terms of deaths right I mean this is first year out of Carolina and a year ago Jim\nYou had a hundred and Ninety eight carries he's gonna are is that right well then down planes that are on the hill without them [laughter]\nShe's with us [noise]\nHow long he's been on a A R no material that oh maybe that explains all this when did he go on I urge him well September twenty eight oh that explains that then well but even still the only got six carry the whole month of September\n... I mean the giants team as dumb tremors\nSo looks like he's you know or is that there are so all then there's that we have an explanation as to why will\nNot be John Stewart he's already are\nI didn't even know that All right we're going to get a check in the headlines with your mother standing by as we broadcast live from the town fare tier studios in Ninety eight five to sports up let's pause ten seconds for station identification on the safety insurance now do you find the sports up patriots radio network\nIn a way to you and listening to New England patriots football on W. B. R. O. prominent accumulate station [noise]\n[noise] for so\nSo what does he do he plays them says you know what I'm not going to punish you because you didn't deserve to be aired out in public I didn't want it aired out in public it was going to be something we dealt with now it is out there although we would've question why wasn't out there early or\nIt gets aired out it gets put out in the media bill starts and then after the games as I have no idea what that reports all but you got to ask the guy who reported it yeah you know he did one of those things so\nSo this is what happened you know obviously the tractors of this would say well you're doing I'm too long of a leash she doesn't deserve it he's going to screw up again\nYou really need them though right now and there's enough veterans obviously on that team whether it's them a ... or Brady poachers ... obviously you know I think they're going to be able to keep them in line and it's not like other players are going to act out they see this sort of like oh well he can be late I can be late to let's all screw off\nOf it that's going to happen no no I don't think that's going to happen either but I understand why he would want to just change it and then throw it away in the reporter's face that I get six one sided seven seven nine zero Ninety eight five there also a reports\nAnd rumors that started with Jay Glazer yesterday on Fox saying that the patriots or shopping for another\nBig name sort of ... you know Markey wide remark key type of guy also throwing around that there would be premium picks being involved or your premium assets that the patriots would be willing to part with to pull off one of those deals that might\nBe partially because of Josh Gordon and I'm not having full trust him to be on board and to be\nCommitted and you know be reliable and depended on and then I think there's also the angle of you know what this defense is going to get much better let's just make sure officers good as it can be\nYeah in either way I Would like them to make a move in terms of whether that's with a wide receiver look I Would love Golden State that's the name it's being floated up there again the the lions are willing to accept the you know nothing yeah fourth round better for Ryan said mhm uh Larry Fitzgerald that name was thrown out there about ESPN again today\nAre so if you could somehow get Larry Fitzgerald but that that's a good guy I was a consummate professional would love him whoever so you add a piece there may be some definite safety or wind back like I Would like to uh obviously a running back to talking about that than I\nSomething has to happen in terms of your way expecting a big splash no uh but it does feel like it's going to be a pretty active trade deadline through\nSix one seven seven seven nine zero Ninety eight five I've seen a lot of these tweets from reporters over the last week or ten days it's or to insinuate that a lot is happening that a lot is going to happen at this tree deadline maybe more than what we see the NFL trade deadline is\nSort of becoming a safe it is and it never was when we went outside I Would make me man\nIt was such a non uh you know or non non issue but like\nIt was nothing you know was not important what was sort of be like roster falling factor rosewater or deaths for like a fourth round nothing exciting now like I have a really the one that that I feel like kicked it off and it's been kind of exciting I think for the last\nYou know basically like ten years or so is one mosque was out and they ended up bringing back the branch back in twenty ten like that was a blockbuster and since then I feel like a trade deadline especially if the patriots is way more active than it used to think maybe it's I\nI don't know what it is that sort of sparked it that made it um I don't know interesting and is that more teams involved I think it's maybe give teams are better at figuring out how to maneuver the money yeah\nThey're figuring out new and creative ways to bury the cap dollars and make sure the gap is not some sort of really important factor in trades\nMaybe that's part of it I I don't know I'm just speculating because trait activity in the NFL mid season\nHas really picked up in recent years yeah and I feel that I've seen a lot of the tweets and a lot of the I don't know sort of hints from writers and you know beat writers cross week like sort of a lot of chatter lot of rumors well potential things could go down at this deadline\nSo I Can't wait I Love it yeah I I'm not convinced that the fire\nSale was done in Oakland um Bruce serving as a name that's out there to the defense of them that they're that used to be with the sea hawks and obviously not what he used to be but still damn good boy or a Arizona I Can't imagine that they you know they're all kinds of lives in shambles story after imagine they're gonna try to require more ticks are going to try to ship off may be alert but sterile they're\nSome of the defense of pieces Denver's disaster the giants are obviously a dumpster fire like some of these teams are going to want to recoup some pictures so they could do for the future\nSix one seven seven seven nine zero Ninety eight five the telephone number got a couple of more segments for you to jump on board with your thoughts on another patriots when they moved

don't I don't I don't get him I just said he would he would have been a perfect two thousand nine patriots like that was one of the more ... testable teams of this era ... you can count on one ended up fingers leftover\nNow how many of those are but that team really bothered me because there was a lot of players like him it'd be a perfect fit for then\n[laughter] ah that's another player saying I mean what the ... are you going to do what are you doing we've got Aaron Rodgers the best I've ever seen and you're taking that risk\nI mean that's number twelve oh you got to do is given the ball and you know what's gonna happen so all the players they made ... sky made on his Jersey yeah you guys in a bad\nWay now yeah in Green Bay as we look ahead to this next match up for the patriots the

dot com I guess that we're taking a solid a improvement for the patriots\nTonight it was that their defense played well and the patriots did not turn them all over so\nThat's a plus too yeah and you know this package team doesn't have the weapons they had in the past Rodgers doesn't have the weapons out of the past what they are still you know guys like about the Adams can still in a light up a a team secondaries or he's good and then this Marquez Valdez scant lingo I feel like I hadn't heard of before until this past go past weekend watching the game against the Ramsey looks pretty good so\nI'm just pump for this can't be because the last time the the team was here\nWe've got ripped off because it was the ... enemy we're very cold at night I was there I remember that yeah very cold is twenty ten and we didn't get\nAaron Rodgers we got ... and off that one game ... got a yes he did that was an athlete get paid night yeah and uh and so I'm happy to have it in because you know we only had this game in Green Bay where you have Brady v Rogers and it actually happened in ... fourteen that Superbowl year\nOr so and pumps you know I've never I've never never never got to see Aaron

not conservatives but the populist conservative out there that believes that economics is what their opinion wishes it to be that's very frustrating because it shows that people actually don't care they really don't care about finding out\nHow things work and and to me that's I got that from my father my father cares about how things work he's an engineer how things work that's not an opinion\nNo things work a certain way physics works a certain way chemistry works a certain way economics works a certain way it's out side of the order of opinion\nAnd and so to me that's been especially you know I Know for us there's been other issues but ah you know economics science you know we we talked about global warming that it's come from the left for such a long time global warming destroying the planet destroying the planet destroying the planet destroying the planet\nAl Gore back again it's destroying the planet destroying the planet destroying the planet and we have asked since this has been going on for Thirty years ah where's the debate between the scientists right you would think that the left would want if the world was truly being destroyed\nBy what we weren't doing that they wouldn't sit that scientists debate it and as we've said tell us one federal one national debate that's ever been held ever on global warming scientist who\nBelieve that men manmade uh you know ... you know manmade uh uh a lot you know the manmade global warming scientists aren't sure and scientists believe that it is not and have them all debate it\nHad the scientist debate but we don't do that we're ... politicians that debate it and all you're getting his political rhetoric\nAnd and slogans behind it and\nDoomsday scenarios\nIs is what we're getting and then we see as a nation year after year after year from the doomsday prognosticators and that their predictions never come true so they then ... ... ... expand out when doomsday is coming okay it's done another ten years\nWhat are we now twenty thirty [noise] yeah what I forgot we weren't in ours are well well some were saying you know we have a hundred years or you know the late Stephen Hawking a was a hundred years to get off the planet a because Bob ... I mean you know\nOne of the forefathers [laughter]\n[laughter] oh ... ... ... ... I I I guess if you know\nThis is still have an audience for you know the global warming thing but you know it's all going to be over by twenty thirty\nI guess I guess this\nIs Al Gore can still have an audience Bob guild off can yeah yeah I I don't know where we're Bob guild office come out in an interview and admit that he lied about anything when it comes to what he believes about global warming\nBut but then they moved back to twenty ounce factor twenty thirty now for those that aren't counting uh that gives us you know roughly eleven years is a little over ... over the years to you know get this all wrapped up\nA might there be a debate between the people who are the scientists who believe it is manmade and those who don't\nSo then we go from not wanting to have the debate to what we see more on the left and the right even though it does exist and the populist right but we see it more on the left and and that is just to demonize if you can't argue demonize\nAnd that's it yeah name call label or it's much worse on the left\nOr the right if they disagree with you might call you will global as you said to find a global list and they can't [laughter] or they may call you a liberal even if you're a conservative\nBut the the ... are left is just insane\nYou're a you're a racist you're Hitler\nYou ... you name it they don't even have a semblance of wanting to have any type of debate on the left these days and so yeah it's frustrating someone ... when you hear all these\nUm I don't know sociologist and and media people say we need stability in our debate we cannot civility in our in our debate\nThe left doesn't want to debate you know how can you of civility in a debate on one side doesn't want to debate\nJust ahead of Tuesday's opening go on Wall street right now don't futures down to five or six one Twenty one I'm Elliot Francis\nMajor league baseball players were getting in on the action [noise]\nI'm Michael yeah I'm ...

yeah stop it was their tax [laughter]\nStop at a stop to do right now ... the Republican stomp with your tax cuts stupid taxes that's 'cause lately when you do a tax cut Eric and I get a tax increase

[laughter]\nBut it's [laughter] it's trial\nNow but we still agree even though our taxes increased we uh agree overall with the with the tax playing without question\nBut some of the economic things would disagree with the way that the president's promoted terrorists than we've had some ... not really much debate on it because we explained the economics of it and most of the response and we've talked about earlier about some people even on the right not wanting to debate it's well he's a great businessman ... that doesn't justify that's not an opinion\nThat's not an opinion on on the at an actual economics\nAnd so really people don't want to do when we happen to when we talk tariffs really nobody wishes to have a debate on that am I Am I correct right I don't know anybody that's really wished avid debate a closest we came last week when a guy called up and said but yeah but it's helped my business and\nAnd and uh everybody works in the price of the you know the the increase in price\n[laughter] well [laughter] no they don't [laughter]\nYou mean if you wish that they would but when you raise the cost of goods and ... of goods and services artificially it hurts the economy somebody gets hurt right now you can pick the winners and losers when you put tariffs then I'm gonna I'm gonna\nDo good for this position and against that business that's what people didn't like Obama for\nBut an economic snow but overall we agreed with the president but when we\nWhen we disagree with him I don't believe it's hateful rhetoric is where we believe he's wrong which everybody should do we should not practice political I dollar tree and believe that our candidate does everything right\nBecause they don't none of them do ever so make Eric great again\nLower my taxes [laughter] so ah but\nHere if this isn't hey what is it\nBy the way here's somebody who's trying to save their job or save the whatever money they get for\nBeing on CNN because she means it\nIn her heart and think about this I think about how delusional you have\nTo be how out side of reality you have to be you couldn't look like the president for some of the things he's done that's fine and dandy we can talk about that in the arena of ideas sure to come pair the precedent and say he's worse than ISIS and that his followers\nAre like the the followers of ISIS the members of ISIS that will kill innocent men women and children is just as reprehensible and hate filled\nMore than anything that I Know any Republican\nIn recent memory has ever said yes\nAnd and that is too because what again when we talk about the\nThe rhetoric what is it that you're trying to portray\nHow was it that you're trying to label the president as a major and in this case immediate threat\n\nThat he is radicalized that it's not just him that he was radicalized a great number of people that are also a threat to you\n\nThat they would attack you the way that ISIS would attack you\nI\nHaven't seen now\nCorrect me if I'm wrong and maybe someone else has seen it I haven't seen a group of Trump supporters shouting people out of a restaurant or even have you\n\nPeople wearing making ah America that great again hats shouting people out of a restaurant there there was some group that followed polo see\nOr that was a couple of weeks ago\n... okay\nAnd and by the way immediately condemned by all by almost every Republican I'm there saying don't do that yeah don't do the tactics that they do don't do it\nYeah and I guess that's the only instance we sing yeah okay well you see that at at the rallies but I mean where is where is the same kind of behavior I'm Talking about on the level that the left has behaved\nAnd in which the leftist ... chasing them down at airports chasing them out of restaurants will do behaving like that and they'll send it\nTo the the thing that one of the things they've got that comes up every time one of the major points has brought up every single time and has for a while the Trump is creating instability by stating you know by being part of the chant lock her up lock her up lock her up as we've said before though\nThat's not an uncivil comet that's a comment based on the fact is we have said before of many people believing that Hillary Clinton should legitimately be in jail\nWell it is based on the fact that she broke the law that is recognized I don't know who doesn't recognize that fact right she just wasn't prosecuted for breaking the law hope\nThe SP espionage law and the ... of trying to avoid the freedom of Information Act law by putting the server in her home\n\nAnd we have gone through this ... the actual law\nAnd even told me he said well it yet but no reasonable prosecutor would [laughter]\nBecause we'd never fought an instance like this yeah because you never had a secretary of state that put a private server in their home to avoid the freedom of Information Act and to allow foreign entities and she knows that she's smart enough former first lady former senator secretary of state to know\nThat our enemies are looking for anything that's on secured mhm\nBut thinking and believing though that's okay we know what the intent was the and everybody knows what the intent was I Want to keep stuff private I don't want it to be documented by the government as is law to be archived\nBy the government right now they're low Airforce subject to freedom of Information Act right\nThat's what locked lock her up about it's not about locking up because she ran against Trump son about locking her up because she's married to bill ... it's not locking up because they produce the offspring of Chelsea Clinton who now wants is is expressing interest in front of him for political office\nWell it's not it's not based on rhetoric is based on a fat right that she broke the law and that she is not above the law now you may disagree with their analysis but you cannot disagree\nWith the fact that back up what they are saying\n\nAnd so they use it by the way they use that every single time and the like the last month where I've seen them saying well let's see what you're saying that the lock her up lock her up that's on civil that's ... no it's not meant to ... it's actually it's meant to promote civility but you locked up people that have committed crimes that you believe in committed crime right\nI mean\nSomething that his provable by the way that fact\nBasis is not debatable right\nThe actual facts in the case nobody has debated no she hasn't gone to trial or shouldn't go on to truck you're right but nobody debate facts right and nobody debates what the law states right it's simply call me who hated Trump\nThey didn't want a prosecutor now\nWe know the whole story when we've been through it before we've gone through the law specifically we went through the first draft of as we know the first draft of analyzing Hillary Clinton what she did and how they changed the language of it because the language that they originally had was the exact context of the law that she broke\nRight that she was not prosecuted for she broke a lot this is the fact\nShe broke the law but was not prosecuted more ... and that's why they state lock her up it's not a hateful comments know you want to get in we\nDo have a line open eight six six Ninety read I read a book report readily radio with a record ...

learn from that don't be jealous dumpy envious do it better than they did it\nSee that's the difference is in the real world because you get kicked to the curb there's competition everywhere you you look\nBut if we create this fantasy that the world owes you something simply because you exist\nThen it never stops or your special just because you exist\nAnd and that's it that you have earned it because you're special we haven't earned anyway America thing your work is what earns it I mean it it doesn't matter what you achieve today even do cat rest on your laurels because the world the real world expects you to produce tomorrow\nAnd look I I agree with you on that when they started and that really started the late eighties early nineties will no we're not going to have competition know

and when we talk and analyze the midterm elections we've talked about the strong and weak points for the Republicans are and the strongly points for the the Democrats one thing that Democrats brought up\nA now we think they may have had it too late but it's still doesn't mean that people don't recognize that especially\nIf you know this is this was a time of the year when all of us I mean we here at at at our job\nI had to put in for you know benefits here the last uh ten days or so a lot of other companies are doing it a Obamacare but you know premiums are are coming in now and we had said this back then that the Republicans left this thing wide open\nThat you know they did a horrible job or a you know when it came to especially premiums that we're going to sky rocket\nAnd we said they got to come up with something as to what they're going to do when they really haven't\nAnd Newt Gingrich wrote an article for Fox News and so the twenty Eighteen mid term elections were less than two weeks away there's just three days ago and many polls show there was a sizable block of independent voters were not yet made up their minds at the same time health care remains the number one issue for the American people\nThe best way for the Republicans to earn the votes of these undecided voters an honor commitments to the Republicans who are already support them urge to clearly articulate how they would fix the broken healthcare system\nAnd he goes through the whole thing that the should be Republican principles\nUp for the book for America as a Republican principles for America's health and health care system we believe that every American should have the opportunity to live a long and healthy life supported by a health care system but it's simple to use innovative unaffordable\nWe believe that every American should up his or her choice of the doctors and insurance\nThat meets his or her specific needs we believe the healthcare system should be transparent about health care cost and quality of treatment options and the disinformation should be available to every American in a simple understandable wasteful patients can make better decisions about their own health we believe in protecting patients\nWith preexisting conditions so they can obtain affordable health insurance coverage we believe in the importance of American Medical innovation that leads the to the breakthroughs that dramatically improve health outcomes while significantly lowering costs we believe that a doctor patient relationship\nIs the center of ineffective healthcare system and it should not be disrupted\nBy micro management from public and private bureaucracies we believe American seniors have earned their health care benefits and that they their families and their doctors should make their own medical decisions not an elected government boards bureaucrats private third party\nPayers are middlemen we believe in a competitive healthcare market were private sector innovation works to strengthen public programs one size fits all government controlled healthcare interferes with doctor patient relationship knee caps\nMedical breakthroughs provides less asked access to treatment and leads to long wait times for critical care we believe that the current health care system and America is far too expensive while it is very good at treating people when they become sick it is much less effective\nAt helping Americans remain healthy which is equally as important we believe the goal of health reform should be to build on what's working and fix what's not destroying what's good about our healthcare system in an attempt to fix what's bad is not acceptable step\nTowards a better future and then he goes on to the Republican accomplishments and they go to the accomplishments you know including eliminating the Obamacare individual mandate\nOr the or a six billion new to fight opioid epidemic the pastor right to try legislation passes stored VA mission\nOr the Trump Administration providing more affordable health care options for Americans through association health care plans in short term limited to ration plans so they go through that there's ten different ones there then they say the Republican promises for additional improvements\nIf the American people re elect Republicans to a majority in the house and Senate we pledge to enact a series of practical in specific changes based on what works in the public and private sectors to build a better healthcare system the system will keep people healthy and provide effective treatments and economic security for those who get sick\nThese legislative changes will and they go through the pre existing condition which really goes back to the block grant right\nWe do we do so by committing the resources necessary for states to try new approaches like high risk pools and reinsurance so everyone regardless of medical history has access to affordable insurance but again it goes to the states the states make a decision as to what they wish to do\nRight and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs by requiring additional transparency and accountability across the entire prescription drug supply chain\nA lower premiums for individuals and small businesses by eliminating the health insurance tax\nReducing Washington's mandates of limited choices the drive up costs for insurance strengthen Medicare by protecting Medicare part D patients from excessive out of pocket costs maximize medical innovation they go through that but basically go through all the things that they should that they should actually do\nThis has been a failure the Republican Party completely", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "30"}
