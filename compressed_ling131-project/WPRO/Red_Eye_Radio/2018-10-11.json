be a major part of the area just north of Panama City and there is not a light on you have a lot of a law enforcement getting down here sort of checking things out in different areas there's been lots of reports of looting in certain areas in death\nHas been linked to the storm but chief justice John Roberts is referring judicial misconduct complaints against the Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh of federal judges in Colorado a neighboring states complaints deal with statements Kevin are made during his confirmation hearings\nRight right\nThat's the one thing that people don't I don't I don't think a lot of people didn't understand is the fact especially when that you know the winds and the outer eye wall in those areas\nYou just knew and and I you and I had gone back and forth because of some of the coverage on the ah the the Weather Channel and um you know putting on baseball helmets and things like that\nThat Jim can tore a you know at one point but a helmet on and and by the way there was a smart move because we do every year\nI Will not about that I always said why you would think they would do that more often even Windsor Seventy miles an hour I Would if I'm Out there sure covering it with the the debris flying around\nBut uh you know and a lot of them are reporting from around the vicinity of Panama City in ... and really what the worst was to the east ... uh uh you know a lot of them and and\nYou just knew what you just said well you know it seems like if you're just a casual watcher you might say well there's not really a lot of damage your well that's because and I saw one of the meteorologists they had down near there\nAnd you know she talked to can tour and they just said no get out yeah get out you know we cannot report you cannot report from a place where you've got winds of a hundred and fifty five miles an hour coming to you that you can't do right which was a very I sat there I said okay that's a very smart move\nRight well that's it when you know I mean does that that tells you the the strength of the storm or when the weather channel runs recover\nThat yes that's one indication that that you should do a you'd look at the number of people that are that stayed behind did not a ... did not evacuated a and you know of course our thoughts and prayers are always with everyone affected by a storm\nAnd and uh and others like it or you know we looked at the uh the situation with with Florence we looked at the ... and and covering that and and the recent storms in Texas you and I I mean go going back to a Katrina\nReally and then a Hurricane Rita\nAh along the Gulf Coast in and and the storms I mean we have so much devastation I've a friend\nIn New Orleans you know and talking about that you know people not coming back many of them moving to neighboring states like ours um and staying and saying you know there's you know there's I don't want to go back there's you know again if\nIf there is not going to be ah that that long term rebuilding effort that is a in some cases permanent\nDevastation or you know not only the physical devastation but of course the economic devastation of of a region or like that my ah my nieces husband station right now going to school in Pensacola he's in the air force\nAnd uh I was checking in on them and they were you know they had a mandatory basically uh order to you know stay in the in a shelter and ah and stay there he's a he could not leave a but they had of course there on the base where he is\nA they had it set up of course to keep everybody say uh that's you know again I was watching a couple of the storm chasers that were alive on periscope and and Facebook Live throughout the day and one of them had plans to stay\nOr through the whole thing or two to give us much coverage as possible uh but uh he had already are in this building\nHe had a a huge sea meant stairwell that he was going to stay in a but it was the one in fact a drudge linked to to his coverage or that was that storm chaser but he actually showed everybody where he was going to stay within the stairwell and it was meant\nYeah ah and and so um do you look at the I guess the job of these meteorologists and and people and and\nAnd a news reporters that are that are out on these storms ah they often stay right there in their hotel is right there close to the beach in fact the that's where the weather Channel's staying at this hotel that was right there on the beach or in one of their locations and\nThose are buildings that are likely a severely damaged although they are bigger buildings and gamble stand or more damage than the sum of the other smaller buildings are coming up here just a few minutes\nAfter the bottom of the hour we'll talk once again to meteorologist a meteorologist or Tom hale he's been with us he was with us yesterday he was with a with a for foreign ...\nUh as well and uh and Irma doing coverage for many years in fact in his career on hurricanes we'll talk to him and John trout as well we'll keep us up to date on the latest\nUh as of right now Michael Steele hurricane yeah yeah ... Seventy five on our sustained with wins so that puts it out a category\nOne just just barely a and and we're expecting you and I talking during the a crucial meeting and you were saying you expect a and I think most do or that the next report which comes up here in I'm In uh in forty five minutes or we could see that downgraded to a tropical storm\nAre still very dangerous uh you know if you think about the the uh a hurricane\nHeard sustained winds of Seventy five miles an hour while they're not what the ... the storm isn't what it was in terms of its power is still dumping a lot of rain and then of course those winds are still damaging\nSo uh we'll get letters from Tom hale and John trout along the way coming up here and just that\nWe have an election coming up here and just a little under four weeks yeah um yeah breaking news\nUh and uh some of the polls out there is some of the uh interesting a poll numbers up in the New York times yeah you yesterday right well we'll get to that look at the CBS headline ... also coming up here on the show prominent Democrats were jak taking the high road and as a viable political strategy that is yeah you know that's\nAfter Hillary Clinton and uh uh and then the more I got mine like Cory Booker or none of the former attorney general\nOh I'm a I've got Eric Holder oh Eric Holder yeah coming out and saying if they go low kick them yeah uh and ... and we you know said this yesterday in the day before\nA in a while we said the day before it looks like they're heading in that direction and yesterday was obvious that that's the direction that the mainstream now\nOf the Democratic party holds is that we're going to be it's going to be instability it's going to be mop like tactics\nOr is going to be getting in your face wherever you are it's going to be getting that on camera\nMhm uh in order to uh to do it and then ah at you when you had Eric Holder guinea the point of saying kick them that was really the first statement of using physical force against your political enemies they seemed to have no shame and this is coming from not the fringe\nAs as recently as even a month ago remember we had to call and somebody called up and said well not all Democrats are like that and we said well your party is\nYour party and that this was really basically going to where the party is being controlled by the left ... uh but now when it comes to instability and getting in people's faces and wanting to film it and and getting to the point of\nTerrorizing people with a with a mob yeah how 'bout mob terrorizing people matter where they are\nThat has now become a mainstream mindset of the Democrats if you're a Democrat you know that this isn't again when CBS writes it\nYou know that even in the media are saying well what are they doing here what's your strategy right Hillary Clinton coming out and saying it Eric Holder coming out and and and and saying it and so here we go I'm\nRand Paul and his wife taking on a Cory Booker for his for his previous statements ... and I still have not heard one\nNow maybe you may have heard it one of the debates if they asked one of the senatorial debates I don't know I didn't see that but I haven't seen in any major publication where you had I haven't seen any publication and make that clear I have it may be out there I haven't seen it where you have one Democrat come out and say\nStop this they're not as ... is this is ridiculous enough and as we've said when you when you think about it I I understand\nWhy they're going there because wherever else was there to go either you were going to make the decision as a party\nTo do what they said after twenty sixteen was look we've got to go to the mid west we've got to go to fly over country yeah we have to start talking to people we have to find out what they you know what their needs are either you're ... you're going to go in that direction\nAnd talk about the economy and talk about those things or you were going to say our bases radical left\nAnd we need to go radical left and so this is obvious at you know that they're doing this this is obvious that the mainstream of the Democratic party have realized we can't beat this site we\nAdd on that last week there is no are you there is no road for them to turn around basically and come back reverse direction we'll weed said that two letters again ... well and and you know when we set an after the election\nUh you because there is that at once they took that break and you know\nAre considered going to the mid west for a moment [noise]\nThey came back from once a month wait what are we say before lunch oh we're totally not do not know are not going to plan to do in that we're not doing that um but when you when you go you know back in and look at the history

I think ... ... and then of course the political discussions and that information I think is also key we've heard from a number of\nPeople over the years that talked about how you know they they listened and\nAh they have become I guess more thoughtful in their in their political views\nAnd I think that's a good thing that's all yeah that that's that's the left starts moving toward violence and and shouting and and what was it that Eric Holder said if you know if they go oh you're native low well you know kick them yeah right and and you know\nWhen they when that happens again I don't know what it at at what point they'd\nCome back if they ever do to a civil discussion Hillary saying recently is that it's the other days well when we when will return to a civil discussion that's basically her message and her statement\nI I think those with the debate or with the the skills to debate and the knowledge of the ideas on which this country was founded are always going to win when\nThey go low we kick 'em you know when you were talking about it though what I Want to but you know what things that might interest you and\nUh this though when you talked about you know radio and I knew this when I was I don't know seven eight years old I knew I wanted to be on the radio I ... that was dominant nothing else really entered my mind\nA bit like I said for years it's what I wanted to do I never thought I'd end up doing talk radio mhm thank God I did\nBecause I I\nCouldn't sit and talk about a star is born\nAnd Lady Gaga is wonderful performance every day and and ... by the way I haven't seen the movie so I've no idea what this wonderful or not I'm just I'm I'm assuming that if I'm working for music station I Would have to do that ... what a wonderful performance and the music was just wonderful not that look talking entertainment and we'll talk about entertainment once in awhile but to do that every single day\nAnd have have to be positive about what comes out of Bollywood and do that every single day would everybody knows it would kill me to be able to do this and articulate ideas\nAnd and uh there's there's two things first off the people to call you and say thanks so much because I've learned a lot that's that's a wonderful thing to have wonderful thing the other wonderful thing and people are saying might think well you can't really me that I Do\nIs when people call you with extreme passion of how they disagree with you mhm\nBecause I'm always amazed wow\nThey really care what I think [laughter] yeah I'm really I I always get that really ... somebody's really ticked off for something I said you're getting really loud and that's interesting and so I said to me that and I know it's gonna happen but you know when we talk about the Democrats and the whole instability thing I Will tell you this\nWhen I'm dirt during the campaign\nBecause of the way that you and I you know we've always done shows we don't care whether you're a Republican or a Democrat no and you know we're we're conservative you know slashed libertarian I have a lot of liberal friends right and and I don't know if they call them your friend any more of a well we but we don't we don't care that the politicians that we analyze we don't care what your label is\nIf you agree with you we will if we don't we don't\nA lot of people are bothered by that I mean even on the Republican side had been bothered over the years and not starting with Trump when we disagreed with him we respectfully disagreed with a a ... when I first got to talk radio George Herbert Walker Bush\n... read my lips no new\nTaxes [laughter] so it goes all the way back there with a with W we disagreed with a lot and and uh I'm with a a Trump a few things not ... you know and but the things that we just grew with Trump I Will say our core to our belief\nAs as conservative and free market or you know a a people when it comes to economic things are and so we may be passionate about it but the vast majority of what Trump does you know I ... what he actually does substance wise and the legislation that he puts forward\nAnd the executive orders that that he puts forward when you actually read into it on his foreign policy or I've been one hundred percent uh agreement with but\nAh you know to be able to do that to be able to go on and just to have you know the freedom and creativity oh I Know the point I Want to make\nThat as it seems that everything is getting on civil law out there ... and things are going crazy\nI don't know what it is but it's like and I know would you agree with me we've never had this discussion seems like I'm getting less flak yeah because I'm\nNot really getting their ... you know I mean I there was more an anger a year ago or two years ago or ten years ago or you know from the response that we you know the ... that I Would get from the things that I Would say ... very few and far between now\nWell and and I think the uh while the tactics clearly have changed and when the tactics change and they'd go the direct route as they call it they became they become a ... it's it's beyond a protester it's someone who's going to be in your face\nAnd when that happens\nThey don't pass because why do they go there because they don't have a debate anymore they don't want to have a debate I'm not saying this is the case where everyone on the left in fact I think there are plenty plenty of Democrats out there right now they can't stand what's going on\nOn the left and can't stand a first of all had no need for Hillary Clinton\nOr or if they did and they look at what she said just a couple of days ago\nHighly disagree with that kind of tactic and won't use it but the problem is is that that's squeaky crybaby whining wheel is always going to get the grease\nAnd that's where the cameras are that's where the social media is\nI I I look at it and I think to myself that the reason and Benin talk radio twenty nine years and I believe right now\nFor is insane as it seems to be out\nThere I Know the flack that I get is extremely light I think probably people are taking it to social media but I really believe that the point is is not\nThat are that are arguments had changed any or had become stronger we may ... and I think it should become a talk show host you learn\nHow to debate batter and put your points are for better I think it's the fact that the opposition is completely and totally insane\nI mean right now they're just insane and so people\nYou know they look and they say okay you know we're what's what's McNamara saying today okay I disagree with it but ah he's not insane like they are over there I really think it's worth a [laughter] when were you you know you if you're you're comparing and you say okay what about ... what do I compare you too and\nWhen you see that the opposition isn't articulating anything in any type of common sense or critical thinking fashion\nI think more people are just opened then

centered over the state of Georgia and let's get an update from meteorologist John trout good morning John\nGood morning guys everything we've been saying about the system throughout the past couple of days has been true and then some you know the system arrived in Georgia overnight as a category three hurricane or a storm has not hip to Georgia this strong since Eighteen\nNinety eight and those types of things just to ... with us when you begin looking at the you know the uh fourth strongest on record to ever hit\nThe U.S about just under a cat category five at a hundred and fifty seven miles an hour\nWhile a ... in terms of what we're looking at in the coming days here for a not just Georgia but uh the Carolinas what is the threat still from Michael\n[noise] [noise] well we're going to see continued rainfall in areas where they don't need any more rainfall that's for sure we'll see the system move through southern Georgia or most of South Carolina and the low country of North Carolina where the ground is already saturated the trees are sitting in mud\nAny amount of wind is going to topple those trees or we could see some additional flooding in those areas I mentioned also tornadoes if you picture a hurricane coming onshore at a hundred and fifty miles an hour when it hits the land it begins to slow down a little bit\nBecause it encounters homes and trees and the ground friction slows the surface movement\nOf the hurricane but as you go aloft a thousand two thousand feet up the system is still advancing pretty rapidly well that sets up a window gradient and when we get a win gradients we get rotation and a potential tornadoes are spawned as a result\n... and of course when you look at the the flooding are often the most deadly part of a storm or that's something that as you mentioned on the ground saturated in the Carolinas but but certainly even in Georgia or with this kind of rainfall flash flooding is is the big threat correct\n[noise] it is a flash flooding and the result of flash flooding I'm aware of one possibly to death set this hour we're not going to believe our\nEyes when the sun comes up I just want to mention that we're going to see

Michael as we turn to meteorologist Tom hello good morning Tom good morning All right so where are we with a with Michael and what is the the storm in terms of the power of this storm still look like\nWell the power of the storm is still there at about five thousand feet we've got wins that are blowing at about eighty miles an hour and they have a diminished all that much and with thunderstorms those thunderstorm and when is the downdraft translate some of that wind so we have higher gas\nAnd so for that reason alone at windows still an issue\nEspecially when it gets across into North Carolina them because we talked about this\nFor four days in advance as Florence was coming in that they had already had some saturation from a remnant\nA of a tropical storm that pushed its way through and and of course when obviously Florence came through the low lying areas that are run up through a Fayetteville\nAnd a south of Raleigh that entire area is still very saturated John trout touched on it and he said trees are sitting in mud and that's exactly what it is we had ... that's the event that we had in the Carolinas with a very slow moving Florence\nAnd as this storm moves up through there I think there'll be a lot more ... and also there's going to be obviously a good deal more flooding out yes they're likely to get about two inches of rain in that area but it doesn't take\nMuch for a little bit of flooding to to\nReef re and develop and it's west of there where the heavy flooding is actually going to be taking place up toward Raleigh and then back up uh up into Virginia a Lynchburg, Virginia Roanoke, Virginia everything on the eastern\nI'd of the mountains there [noise] uh up to Charlotte and or Norfolk that entire area um is gonna see anywhere from a three to as much as eight inches of rain as it gets further on up [noise] um\nAnd there's a you know why not to include here\nAre the folks over out in the outer banks from okra coke island which is down towards the south end up to duck or they're under a storm surge watch in effect ...\nAnd and how I I guess what is the potential there in terms of that storm surge uh and and what the the height might be\nA four feet okay two to four feet or yeah or you know it'll inundate some neighborhoods some some areas where it'll come out of the banks um but um it's when you think about it it it just goes to the power of this now tropical storm\nAnd its Winfield yeah right yeah and so just that's\nJust amazing I mean if you look at the the power of Michael has came ashore a a Wednesday afternoon and something that we touched on yesterday during our program and that is the the because of that power because of that energy\nBehind the storm in grew after of course uh we got off the air uh the it it intensified that that means it's a longer lasting a storm so you're expecting Michael to still be a tropical storm a strength in terms of a ... when it goes back out over the water\nAnd reaches Ireland yeah yeah [laughter] so [laughter] yeah well ah to\nOur friends in Europe or you know um you can have ... we hope you does that does that does that are like the water is warm enough that far north in the Atlantic to keep it going then\nYes among guy yeah wow\nYeah I did I just assume by the time we got to October probably be cool down so I was surprised to hear that but the outer still warming up yeah\nL and and and that's why we're having these storms or you know the the normal hurricane season ends at the beginning of November right and so at this point there's a reason to that extent this is the fourth\nA major hurricane that we've had in the month of October period and so yeah that's and that's simply a and it was unusual to have a major hurricane to begin with in October when you consider that there's been four of them total ...\nAnd and so and the last nine something that just sticks in my mind was and I can't remember which one of you said it well is it going to kind of lose some power as it comes into shore and\nAnd I and my immediate reaction was no\nNo [laughter] yeah\nRight yeah and you were right 'cause I I'd asked that question which brings into another question\nThat is just a just personal interest to me\nAnd and that is when you get it from ... you know ... ... tornadoes hurricanes get their energy from the warm water right yes All right so do does that mean\nThat a hurricane like this doesn't then does it as a result that it's taking the energy from the water just the water actually cool down\nTo listen on your smartphone or Bluetooth

passengers into pedestrians a judge entered a not guilty plea for him\nI I don't know how much I put on the fed right now for this eight hundred and thirty two point drop yesterday a you know there are smarter people than than I can look at it but as you mentioned\nYou look at the reaction to something like that and it was not the the meltdown of years prior because percentage wise it's still\nNot as big as you've seen in the past right and so it a lot of things are going on right now especially in the tech sector I think there's a lot of a concern about regulation that's going to cross the tech sector or at least a slow them down in terms of growth\nAnd what they are able to earn because that regulation I Believe is coming and I think there's a lot of concern for the tech sector there um but the economy\nChugging along pretty well and when you get a correction like you saw yesterday a it is expected it is not surprising at all to those investors on the floor\nI you know I I think it said they're just there comes a day when you just\nI I think that many investors just say okay I'm today everything combined\nMakes it so I think I'm going to pull out of this and put it into a this because not only was the tech sector head but caterpillar ah companies that are involved in international trade in the United states were hit yesterday there's a reason for that\nThere's a reason and the reason is still the possibility of trade wars when you look at it you know so the president said okay we have an app to agreement\nAre okay but everything hasn't been solved here Congress has been awfully quiet\nA on it or their negotiations going on does Congress want look that this does Congress want NAFTA you're the new NAFTA whatever it's called the Canada whatever United States and Mexico instead of NAFTA the nations formerly known as NAFTA the nation's yeah the ... the nation's formerly known as North America North America and\nUh you know ...\nI Wonder if there's pressure inside Congress I guess it's just pure speculation but inside St look if you got to do after we got to get the steel and aluminum done we're not going to do and we're going to do it let's get everything done and that's putting pressure on the on on the White House or the fact is yet you know having NAFTA is going to\nAt least stabilize the market with some good and bad\nAs we have gone through and we have gone through a a NAFTA because we do believe that if if the new NAFTA passes\n[laughter] it'd be trade agreement formerly known as NAFTA if it passes it's gonna hurt the auto industry it's not going to help the auto industry is going to make cars more expensive that's not a good thing now initially when you say it it's something that may not hit the market at that particular point\nYou know at at but when you take everything together the worries about regulation in the tech sector or all of a sudden the the you know the the fed or raising rates are the fact that the bond yields are going up again it's taken us taking us more interest money\nOr to to service the the the the debt\nAnd the possibility of\nThe trade war with China where there there isn't doesn't seem to be any type of conclusion and still a great uncertainty about\nA steel and aluminum tariffs and still and uncertainty whether you know Congress really hasn't there's been no indication from Congress or the leadership in Congress about the trade agreement formerly known as NAFTA\n... well you mentioned now of the the terrorists and PG E taking a ten percent hit yesterday a and you this is a very old company but talking about raw materials and the costs of raw materials and and so as you know there\nAre essentially they're manufacture a and and distributor of of uh of of coding and special material specialty materials\nBut that is also part of the auto industry so the the the car sales ah the automobile sales have or seemed to have stalled out for now or what's behind that are certainly you know that the cost of automobiles is going up and that is directly related\nTo terrorists then\nThere's a greater demand for used cars when there's a greater demand for any\nGroup in terms of products that cost goes up so it it is it's a number of things that hit start to hit all at once and you go back to All right ... how much of this is controlled by either the fed or the federal government\nAnd how much of this this cost of government and right now you can look at terrorists and I think you could look well at interest rates Iran and you see those two right now sticking out but everything that we just said here\nIs related to what government regulation ...\nEverything that we just and I didn't even think about that until you just said\nThere until you I'm a wow everything is government right ... is so you can actually make the argument that hurt it irrespective whether it's trade agreement government regulation the fed rate you know ah on on interest rates are the the debt that with the debt that we haven't servicing our our debt all of it goes back\nTo [laughter] in in some way a government\nA regulation and when we talk about the tech industry and what are they worried about government regulation so it all gets back to that\nWe said this before and you know look when we you know we've gotten into great debates and disagreements with the administration about uh you know their their policy on tariffs therefore or new labeled turf babies\nOr the president came up with a but the look in the real world you raise prices it hurts when the economy and the story right\nYou can sit there and go rah rah rah usa usa you can have all the chance you want\nBut if you raise the cost of goods and services it always hurts and economy and hurts workers\nAnd just because you wish to chant or\nYou know just say America First doesn't mean America is necessarily first by the policy that you put in because you love the slogan slogans mean nothing ... economics is related to how people respond to incentive\nIf you make the cost of goods more expensive it's going to hurt and economy not my opinion it's the reality of economics and the story\nWell and and again it is something that can be controlled through policy of this something that can be a tempered and and why do we want the ... why do we want to step in front of the progress that's been made that terms of you know ... what do we what's been done\nBy the administration has done so much good that when they do bad that's going to we believe hurt them ... because I don't\nBelieve that a Republican\nIn the United states can handle a bad economy as bad as a ... a Republican president can not handle bad economic news as well as a Democrat I Can't tell you why but it's just the reality although I got rid of Obama got elected for a second term there was nothing moving in the economy right\nI don't believe Republicans can survive\nA bad economy especially if you look good economy and then it goes down over the next two years and what is it what it was the first couple of years I think at that point almost all Republicans in this day and age are much more vulnerable because Democrats cell that better than Republicans do\nYeah uh you know you see that the interest rates rising and the you know any kind of slow down in in major sectors\nThen you you put those together ... the housing sector at the at the toward the end of of or I guess getting close to the actual fall out of the subprime mess the fed was raising rates so you had these\nThese loans out there that were set to balloon and mature and as they were the rates were going up which meant when it jumped to that ultimate rate it was going to be much higher than expected\nWell when you had delinquency rates are as as they started to creep up and up the forecast for that sky rocketed because of the rise in interest rates that was ultimately going to do those homeowners it was clear well if they can't keep up right now\nWell then what it balloons out with even a higher rate to a higher rate than it than they had expected and plan for well all bets are off it's just not going to happen and that's that's part of that was part of the dynamics in place\nWell what do you have here is you know uh the basically the fed going in and the the point Kramer was making is that it was not Jim Kramer at CNBC\nAnd sound a message from the U.S department of justice national crime prevention counseled on the council\nAmong busy today I can imagine for that stopped

energy or what are we looking at a I Know we're a scheduled to get an update within twenty five minutes or so\nBut the last update has it at sustained winds right now at roughly sixty miles an hour I'm guessing we can expect in the ... report that to decrease\nI Would think so should drop to probably fifty if that um it may still maintain itself but I think a ten mile an hour drop as reasonable although it\nLooking at it and radar and just kind of clocking it I I I don't think it'll drive more than ten miles it might pick up a mile and forward speed gone to the north east it may be Twenty one miles an hour and I said earlier predicted it would ... the United states at about twenty three to twenty five miles an hour [noise]\nUh but that's not going to be until it gets up into Virginia but for the exits out of here yeah um yeah it's a uh it it it's an incredible storm it let me give you a little kind of a broad overview\nOkay along the coast and the outer banks they're going to see storm surge from the storm in the Carolinas of two to four feet that's water inundation rice and then you can at high tide waves which could cause some problems it's not the biggest one there then it will be another one or not the biggest one\nIt will be feeder band soon we'll be talking about the potential for tornadoes\nNow these tornadoes and the feeder bans the feeder bans are coming in from the east and moving off to the west so that kind of curbing from southeast North West and the bans have individual storms at 'em and they're moving out of about forty miles an hour now those individual storms are capable of brief spin up\nTornadoes in the individual super Sal soon as we get into the afternoon those storms will be heating up in the afternoon maximum heat and that's going to happen\nPrimarily over the Carol North Carolina's where you're going to see that the greatest potential for tornado activity but it's a win and so whether it's torn addict wind or it's a sustained tropical forests when the forty to forty five miles an hour\nIt's going to do damage and a lot of that damage is going to be treated damage and it's got to be in North Carolina because what's going on in North Carolina or what has gone on as Florence and\nOh it's saturated soils and so these trees that we've noticed that most of them because of the wind has been toppled over we've seen a lot of root ball photos right\nOn on television mhm so boom overcome the trees now what are the trees hit the power lines\nBingo so we got the trees hitting power lines and we currently have seven hundred and thirty five thousand customers now that's they count customers is homes right\nOkay multiply that by two assuming there's only two people affected by every home and we know that number is low and an ear it already a one and a half million people already without power\nAnd that number is going to grow as it gets into the Carolinas and I think the next big numbers for power outages are going to be in the Carolinas during Florence\nBetween the Carolinas that over seven hundred and fifty thousand power outages and I think this is capable of of if not repeating it at least bringing in another four to five hundred thousand customers\nYeah and so we're going to get a will get over the two million mark on on people affected without any kind of power and then you have the question they were staging people for power\nIn Pensacola and just draw circle around from Pensacola around this whole area or thousands of power of of trucks utility trucks right\nThey're going to go into the areas they can get into first so maybe the Carolinas Georgia and so forth they are going to have a better shot at getting power even though they did stage I Believe the number was up to Nineteen hundred power trucks uh\nAround the uh Pensacola area and around the panhandle and so yeah they're going to be working as hard as they possibly can but just the physical flooding an inundation and the damage and the debris is going to limit the time that it's going to take for them\nTo get their power back so I still believe that the landfall area the pan handle that took the greatest Bryant is going to have the longest period of time to restore power\nI mean [noise] face it there's a lot of places they don't have to restore power to anymore but they still have to be able to address the power lines
