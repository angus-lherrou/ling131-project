T. F. B. defensively that they gave up that Seventy five yards score in a matter of five seconds for them to take the lead part of me thought whoever held the ball last in this game was going to be the team that ended up winning\nAnd the patriots are better taking their time and using the three minutes to get down the field in Kansas City was obviously they were given a touchdown Seventy five yards right out of the gate so I think maybe in a weird way all that horrible coverage on that play to give up the score may help him at the end of the game\nSo certainly I don't think there's any doubt and I think Brady I'm sort of said something along those lines after the game where you know you talked about like good they scored quickly now that can go to work and and now the game was back in Tom Brady hands which is\nYou know I I don't even care what happened in the super bowl this past year I I'll still you tell me three minutes or two minutes left in the game and it's tied or the patriots news score and Tom Brady is going to have the bombs hands I'll take it every single time\nGreg ... it was an uncharacteristically bad night for the special teams I mean ... was nails and turning to fix but he has this goofy ... we're still trying to figure that out there's really no answer there but they give up a return were you\nWere you surprised because obviously you know a special teams matters to build Belgium maybe more than any other coach uh so what what do you think the issue was whether there are with him and joined us than I'd\nYeah I I yeah I still can't figure out what they're what they're trying to do with these kicks and I'm sure all get out of Belcher is you know we're trying to win the game they could like that's the best way but um\nYou know certainly very curious it's obvious that they're trying some different things um I think\nYou know the kickoff coverage I don't know if they've quite gotten down the adjustments to the rule change where you can you know really run up and and they're trying to find some things out but you know look this is a team that basically spends\nSix million of their camp on special teams only players we talked about it before you know ad nauseam that you know if if if they're going to take the path that they've taken and\nKeep signing veterans specialty hers instead of giving roster spots to young guys with athletic upside who could become starters role players on defense at some point in time um they need to be better than this and so\nYou know I think the overall thing is like you know I just think it's\n... and you know obviously I'm wash the tape yet and I'll watch it tonight when I get home I'm a little bit more closely but I can tell you to this point in the season\nAnd I wrote about it you know this week the patriots haven't come close to playing their breast football in in all three of the phases and so you know that they've that they've gone on this little winning streak that they that they knocked off previously and beat chiefs\nAnd they're still they're still finding themselves even with what they did on off as the night there still find themselves in incorporating people and things like that like they are going to be a far better team by the embassies and hopefully special teams is included\nWell they're already trying to get in the right direction so that's a positive for the patriots winners of three straight Greg thanks for the times always\nSounds good thanks yes\nThey are grab your daughter the Boston sports journal here on the shots in stock market\nPatriots post game show to go on the agency in action\nAnd the college this agency in Arlington are proud members of his knee insurance services of New England presenting safety insurance visit team is neat dot com that team I S N E dot com insurance services of New England independence with reach\nBut still there's times again there was a first Dr where they ended up settling field goal in the third quarter to go back and look at it you don't see this tomorrow with Hogan was opening the an so like I don't know where do you just not looking at its way I'm looking at you\nKnow things are going to do your own yeah a Davis the cartoon\nIs it going guys good baseball amazing game tonight you're a football fan I was you know you can\nGet more homes like\n... you know you got this kid he didn't really play any any good really good football team this year so far into the patriots and just watching them at the game tonight\nOn the wrong you know get washed out of the parking lot across his body still go on strike to restrict Charlotte's Kelsey um and then what's going on I mean he was\nA belief like six feet away from I Want to see what the hell and back in the end zone and it's just like you see on the downward on the career with the cats of what's going on\nI Wish I had an answer there you know and I think right when I was the right to reference to the ... the Colts game to look like he's been chief in New York for two three weeks now granted we are talking about\nOne of the fast as of now the fastest while you're in the NFL whatsoever you kill you when you take it bad angles and it looks like a myth communications or it just looks like it a lot of times like I don't know I guess it's fair to may be asking\nYou maybe hit the wall terms of his age or maybe there's something going on but you know what to say no\nOr his brother looks like he's got caught early on in the second half of the green touchdown or early in the pursuit\nYeah and you really got there which is why yeah so it would be able to close on him\nSo speaking of speed to there was one in the end zone worst upon Gilmore is mostly an Sammy ... most of the night he closed on him and made a great place like I don't know do you question Gilmore getting that assignment all night rather than being on top retail at all no not ... I don't like the size match up more than anything else could be\nGood to be um yeah\nIt's an interesting thought though like I get round we bought especially by fiber mess for saying I still like Sami walk into my ... you know show what he can be in this this teams up with any walking the snake is just so hey yeah but\nI just wonder if that was the right why do they got like Samy Watkins what's there is you're I mean this is issues in his career and Ben injuries yeah being hurt very part of it and they just think he's\nA bomb that's all knows he's on what is it with them thinking everybody I think a lot of guys are ... I don't know what sucks and blows I don't know trust\nMe I don't know if I Lived it for him and now I Know the answer for all of it on Twitter or not the worst part about\nAll the ball that blow do I sympathize review don't tweet me I didn't say it they did oh don't give me or bull crap feedback ... running backs do matter I Know I'm the one that likes running backs on the show [laughter] a Henry is in the jar Henry\nHey guys that go I go up yeah they\nYeah I Would just go and I just want they get back to you guys have already brothers you know or are they ... they look the same anymore but\n... just looks terrible out there I don't know I feel like\nOK outside of tonight when or if you look terrible\nI I just feel like he's always Jay than a coverage I so I don't have a good\nEither you're wrong I think that I wasn't a good night for but I think on the whole this year Jason ... has been a plus Jason's recordings actually exceeded expectations and the guys love 'em to all the rain in a very high as of last week and he was in the top five years in the top five ratings for corners in the\nLeague yeah no\nIt's not a good year sorry tonight yeah may have had it handed to him a little bit but guess what those guys on the other side or go really going that's been I I just look at this game and and we'll hear you know what we'll we'll hear from a recording and drawn arm and after this game will get that coming up because those two guys pretty much\nSaid well you know we just sort of ... to replace we wouldn't have been able to make because you know why the other guys are going now you know what Tom Brady makes defenses looked like trash so often in his NFL career because really good and sometimes you go against really good players that are better at their job and your defenders are there yeah\nAnd look you know we as the fans and those are watching the game to cover it and stuff you know you're demanding I Know I I mean you get upset about it but sometimes you do you get a tip the proverbial just say hey what's going to do\nEverything I heard about this game I didn't hear anybody saying you know what the patriots defense kids can see they're going to let you know Eighteen points\nUp twenty five points no everybody talking about this game with same shootout ton of points take the over going to be a great back and forth could be wildly entertaining how did you think it was going to look when you give up forty point\nHow do you think that looks it looks like what you saw tonight yeah that's what it looks like you don't give a forty points because you're good on defense against a really great off same thing goes for both teams that I\nKnow when you give up ... points it tends to look kinda crappy actively yeah get burned the other team makes a big place that's how it looks\nNow because of the want to give up forty because of the personnel because her mom's the real deal I think it's for me it's an easier build his wall 'cause we're not that's a good team that's a damn good team they are going to be there at the end it's you in this the end of the best and the conference I'm not talking about you know Miami doing this to you\nMan from some of these calls and I think the patriots lost his game or a very negative patriots fans like very negative after a big win very important\nWhen I first dress or feel like I'm going that way I Know I

there's files pressure on Saudi Arabia [noise] how can we have friends that after weeks of speculation the search for another solution to the company that once dominated the American retail landscape is filed for bankruptcy protection to cast and bomb record\nThis was not at all unexpected years holding company was supposed to make one hundred and thirty four million dollar debt payment today many Wall Street analysts believe that the company wouldn't be able to meet its obligations in recent weeks several vendors reported that years had missed payments to them\nInstead of making the payment to lenders in the early morning hours years filed for bankruptcy the company is seeking chapter eleven protection from its debt holders rather than chapter seven which would have led to a complete closure and liquidation eve cast in Mountain View\nOn international pressure is mounting on Saudi Arabia over the case of missing journalist you won't go show she on Sunday the general manager of a Saudi owned news channel warned that if the U.S imposed sanctions on Riyadh quote it will have its own economy to death\nAnd your accomplices in the media would barely cover it\nNeed I mentioned Kathleen Willie Paula Jones Anita Broderick and more some you hope remember some of these names and these women weren't on the left so it doesn't matter they accuse President Clinton if you don't know of all kinds of\nA sexual assault there just these women are just road kill on their way to power the absolute hypocrisy of people like Cory Booker talking about sexual molestation\nI'm surprised they didn't have another Spartacus moment did he admitted in an op paid or something sexual misbehavior or the self righteousness of Kamala Harris or the other phone is on the panel\nThey talk about taking the moral high ground\nThese hypocrites have actually reach new lows let alone the moral high ground every time I think they can go no lower he break new ground that's the kind of works a kick out of the new ground\nTell me how you're able to contain yourself I I had trouble containing myself during those weeks that week whatever ... more than a week actually with the delay eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine o seven three thirty three thirty nine [noise]\nThese people disgusts me I Can't watch or listen to them Kavanaugh was not even my first choice to get the nomination but it wouldn't have mattered\nThey could have picked for example the pope\nAnd he's a leftist but they would have been against him if President Trump had appointed him why in heck did they even need hearings or further FBI investigations when they announced how they were going to be voted with the very few exceptions\nAnswer to soccer and people like Jeff Flake talking about I'm sure people said that I'm not the only one that talking about being named directly by the way\nHe said he would vote for cabinet are having a he was all set to but it did you see this as a woman confronted him in the elevator\nAnd he admitted that was part of the reason he was for an additional FBI investigation Jeff Flake is a fool this delay did not unite the country as he suggested or placate the Democrats if further divided us\nThis was all a show to delay the process so they can get in power Lindsey Graham had adjust right\nThis is all about power\nAnd I could take it more easily if they just said what they felt hey we just wanted to let you guys because we want to get in power and then you can have the Supreme Court judge on I Wish they would it be honest about that\nBut they're a bunch of phony hypocrite hypocritical leftists they disgust me tell me what you think an eight six six Ninety red eye but it's worse than that\nBecause we have now taken away one of our most basic rights the presumption of innocence you can charge anyone I said this before with any crime you want and you don't even need to have corroborating evidence it doesn't matter if they're in and said you can still ruin their lives and there are no consequences for the cues important\nBecause you have to prove they did it with mouse if they didn't intentionally do it then they get away with this do you remember I don't know if you remember this Reagan's secretary of labor I think it was secretary Donovan that's the name that comes to me\nHe was asked after he was found innocent after he was accused of I don't even remember what it was they said something like what are you going to do next and he said something like\nWhere do I go to get my reputation back\nAnd some like Feinstein Senator Feinstein has the nerve to question Kevin O's belligerence and demeanor at the hearings what was he supposed to do some and Feinstein after you've helped destroy his life act ever so serene as you ruined his life I wouldn't have\nI Would have let them out of it whereas his bank account\nFor all the good work he's done for all these years later\nHow did Bill Clinton stay as president after what he did with the complicity of you Senator Feinstein and others in the Senate those hearings were not a good week for America and I wanted to know what you think because it relates to my whole point about civil war\nI Want to know what you think eight six six nine to read I\nMatched with Christine for I'm getting a chance you guys can hear me I was on another show a few weeks ago so I'm getting this off my chair for a second time I'm very fortunate I Do I think she was attacked yes she appears credible in that regard did judge Kavanaugh commit that attack I doubt very much\nEspecially since no one could corroborate her story I when I say I think she was attacked I don't know exactly what happened\nAnd whether some of this could have been in her imagination because there are a lot of inconsistencies in her story she doesn't actually got there how she got home one it was exactly why she didn't tell others at the party or anyone else for decades after that\nSo now as I said we reached the stage where all you need are allegations so what's to prevent hundreds of people from now on making accusations and stalling every nomination they don't want and ruining everybody's reputation in the process\nNow there's going to be no way to get off this merry go round just accuse accuse and accused [noise]\nIt's a new Democrats strategy that has not worked\nThanks to Senator Flake and Murkowski flick at least voted for it\n[noise] but Murkowski didn't I think she I think there's some movement or recall her and she needs to be recalled\nThe rest of the hills fools who allow this process to take place looked by the way that sleazy lawyer what his client claimed about Kevin her fame can be yours would the flick of your cell phone do the Democrats as I said last hour understand where all of this is going\nTo remember Harry Reid starting the nuclear option with judges and now we can just do a fifty fifty one\nAnd yet the reaction did you hear the reaction of the righteous\nSenator Feinstein as a quote it showed him to be aggressive in bowling is with Joe Biden said he witnessed a degree of invective blind rage and Bruce partisanship that threatens not only the Senate and the Supreme Court it threatens the basic faith and fairness and justice that binds this country together\nIs he getting that's a Democrat play book and Mitt Romney or another genius I mean I was a delegate for 'em by the way I've got to make in full disclosure he announced the support the decision to wait a week another example of why he lost he doesn't know how to fight these people and that's a point do you have to know how to fight them\nI was going to ask you your least favorite person that you watch during that week and perhaps senator Mazie her on her own or however you surname my top your list especially after comments that men should just shut up\nShe and she by the way a week or so ago she was asked if she was confident Democrats didn't strategically leak Christine forms accusations against capita just days before a committee vote\nI think it was here's a quote are you confident the Democrats didn't leak that letter and how to respond to senator Graham's charge that it was inappropriate for the Democrats to refer to a doctor for a referred to a lawyer host George Stephanopoulos asked her own on ABC's This week\nAnd what a chance or she spelled spotted all of these things that go do not focus on what we should be focusing which has the credibility of judge Kavanaugh she responded before calling Kevin O's claims of political conspiracy against them bizarre\nShe didn't answer and stuff like that to me\nAnd her and she goes on and by the way even as all these accusations about this being politically motivated being tossed around everyone acknowledges including judge Kavanaugh\nThat Dr Ford is not being politically motivated by the way she her own and has suggested Kevin ... did not deserve did you catch this he did not deserve due process because of his outcomes driven concern of legal philosophy that is very clear again if you're on the right\nYou don't want to serve the process of being a a a proven guilty just the accusation is not\nSo she may not have been politically motivated afford but you used her you and your masters in deception used her\nThis is all just crazy and I I Love with Graham said he's going to get to the bottom of its suggesting that someone and find science officer wanna Ford's attorneys may have been responsible for strategically delaying the leak deploying to lead to harm Kavanaugh's chances\nAre it's just amazing as he said those actually some of this the goalpost moving never stops\nAnd here's my summation and then we'll take your calls the only force is the way you and your cronies conducted the circus\nAnd maybe the ... to cross the ACLU the American civil liberties union yeah right\nThey chimed in because they too are left this group before they our civil liberties group and so they came out against the nomination and I quote ... board of directors deeply concerned about allegations raised in recent weeks has made a rare exception to his last\nSetting policy and voted to oppose the nomination of bread Kevin up they passed a resolution stating they pose the confirmation of judge Kevin as the Supreme Court they're credible allegations this is the ACLU allegations that judge Kevin O's engaged in serious misconduct you mean like Bill Clinton did you see anything then\nThat have not been adequately investigated by the Senate\nWhat would it be advocates adequate seven

it's possible\nBut that's what I'm saying type a little bit of a lot of people going out and yeah they don't expect to go out because the Democrats motivate they hate President Trump\nThey hated cats

no doubt about that and that should make you feel better\nBut I think if people are as frustrated as jury appears to me it seems to be a no reason to doubt it across the country I I don't think the Democrats realized what their reaction is going to be\nAnd they may have overplay their heads in fact I think they did because even people maybe in the middle had had to have some revulsion to see what was going on they just bad or this guy they just told my poor and the wind\nThink Ford was credible or not credible he wasn't treated well\nAnd then and then when it's all done I mean they have

out there there may not be this blue wave it may be much closer than people think and because the thought of the ad and said this than I thought of the Democrats retaking the house\nAnd the hearings and the subpoenas and if the if you think the cabinet hearings were disgusting and revolting wait till these people do it for two years to do everything possible to impeach Kevin out to a beach

Bush the seven oh you know they'll get forty percent they can get up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote and I thought oh forty percent you still lose every time\nBut you're on to something really significant which is the black vote and President Trump said Romney got six percent I think Trump got eight percent\nOr if we start to get more of the black vote on the Republican side the Democrats are in huge trouble because they've counted on that Ninety percent Ninety three Ninety Ninety five sometimes I don't know what I buy my God I think it was way up there they count on that\nIf ever they lose an interesting percentage of that even the Jewish population they they started to go the other way they the Republicans and I'll START I think at twenty five thirty percent\nThey're in trouble ... big trouble as you suggested\nIf they can't count on those votes and they shouldn't shouldn't get those votes the Democrats have controlled every city just about every major city every major school district and thinking about the last thirty forty years how the schools have\nUm function and how well they've been doing I'm saying that in the opposite direction they're not doing well or how well our cities are doing\nAnd you come to Hungary inclusion what if the Democrats done for the people living in the inner city\nAnd that's a real issue if ever the Democrats lose that vote there in huge trouble and Donald Trump has many\nYou choke I and I was just right away I knew right away this last year so far I age you just from outer space hot actually she just she anyway right away as like you know fifty seven\nYeah you get to the old people it's like I mean she was so full of you know what I just can't believe anybody could have believed or for for ...\nWell a lot of people thought she was credible 'cause you you know she had that childlike voice and she's seen sympathetic and I can I be sure that none of this happened I'm not even talking about ... now\nBut I was saying can I be sure that she was an attack by someone could chief fantasize that all that stuff and maybe [noise]\nUm yeah it's suspicious but a lot of people don't want to talk about it for many years to come so\nIt's just unclear I ... you know I I Can't be sure that you make of that stuff up\nMore well yeah you you saw a picture of her in your book and she\nLooked I looked like a ... a nice kid like an awesome young child young girl and you think of something and a half and you think she would have\nBeen on it like you know like the next day that night she would have probably told somebody [noise] um so I think it's just the ... to me I mean just shame right away like a non starter\nYeah but you know it's hard to read someone's motivation and many people say been through that that you don't want to say anything to embarrass you feel guilty whatever I just try to be fair and this thing ah someone got me on the letter of the national show that I was on and said mark look at you saying she was credible well [noise]\nI don't know I I just try to think of what the average person out there watching his thinking and\nAnd she seems certainly sympathetic right a ... if I just want to take the position that people on my side or you know always telling the truth and the other side is not you're going to get in trouble you got to look at it the way an average person looks at somebody Susan Collins from Maine senator was so good\nI didn't expect to do the she did everything factually and went over everything in her speech for over a long and wasn't she seemed very ... of course they hate or for now\nBut I it's hard to get into someone's mind uh who knows maybe there was fooling around going on his high school kids or one of my engineers at a state\nWith skills technologies and compassion\nFirst of all you can choose where are you more of a loved one sees rehabilitation care so choose the southern New England rehabilitation center\nRecovery becomes reality\nThan yours the dot com to learn more\nMy name is ...
