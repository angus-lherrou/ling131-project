according to Reuters\nGiving us farmers more access to candidates dairy market and shielding candidate from possible us auto tariffs America's second largest trading partner was excluded when the U.S and Mexico reached the ... deal in August to revamp NAFTA\nAnd the Trump Administration had given Canada until midnight Sunday to sign on or facing schools you're from the pack in the past President Trump is railed against the tree deal blamed give for the loss of American manufacturing jobs we have the worst trade deals ever made in history here Crawford\nWashington mass burials now being prepared for more than three hundred bodies on an Indonesian ... hit hard by a powerful earthquake and tsunami toll of more than a hundred dead from friday's disaster mostly from pullout is expected to grow as there is cut off by damage or reached\nRemember it wasn't that the president said he would get a free trade agreement done what he said was he will get a free trade agreement\nThat will get rid of the trade deficit yes now I Know the president will be out and he will be selling this irrespective of what is in the free trade agreement\nAnd the people to love the president will say he did exactly what he said he was going to do I'm fine with that as long as he heads in reality he doesn't do what he initially said he was going to do\nWell you know ...\nI'm I'm just fine with everything it's all just get it behind us\nYou know the the the moving of well we'll do this much more over here and and this much less over here it really isn't because there's there's been no promise the only thing I've seen in terms of the measurement of the dairy agreement\nIs that it will mirror that of the the agreement that Canada just reached with Europe and other other countries other parts of the world so I have no idea what that means for the U.S\nI don't know how to quantify that and\nIt's it again [laughter] there was no um target right there was nothing\nThey said look we must get this much increase right or the dairy farmers of of the U.S you know we're this is what we're working on this this who were working on behalf\nSo I don't there was never this this I guess\nBlind or or goals for them to reach the administration in fact just a few days ago they were saying yeah we're way too far apart to be reaching a deal before the deadline and ... and here we are a few days later\nSo we have no idea what it means and how much of an increase for those dairy farmers in terms of being able to sell the camp Canada that is\nYou know what I didn't hear mentioned it all ... and ... article but right now it's early on and maybe in the maybe tomorrow nothing on the soft amber no I didn't see anything on that\nIn fact the only two hours as I did see a lot dairy and automobiles that so I I guess my ... and by the way when we say win or lose we're not talking about win or lose by our standards because women lewd by our standards with trading with Canada\nShould be free trade across the board no tariffs no limits or anything if Canada puts tariffs on that's wrong if the United states put tariffs on a you know uh uh the batters wrong but is that where we made the compromise on soft timber and that's why you didn't hear the administration come out\nAnd talked about you know the the the soft timber than we upset okay we're not remember they were going after the soft timber industry claiming that the government subsidizes it in Canada right uh and with the duties and whatever put on soft timber\nAs we know a construction in the United states will become has and will become more expensive which will hurt the bottom line of the GDP\nSo I you know look there's ... there's a ton of things here and you just mentioned something that just a couple of days ago we're way far off we're not going to have a deal well the president knew that he had to have Canada in the dealer was a no go in Congress was going to go anywhere right\nSo he was under that he was under that pressure to come up with some kind of deal otherwise it wouldn't go through when he had to get it done now because they want it done before December first\nWhen the Mexican president does out right so we're right at that sixty day deadline it's got to be done now so there was pressure on the administration did the administration crumble on parts that they wanted I guess we shall see it was interesting that ah I read a couple of articles in the last couple of weeks from Canada\nWhere they said you know what the Canadian government decided to do we're just not going to respond to Trump on anything he can sit there and script just be quiet say nothing\nDon't give them a target back don't say anything and so if you if you think the Canadians have been quiet lately because of it\nThat was their whole purpose let's just be quiet but Canada knew that they they look they understood candidates stood that look one of the things that we have against the United states in this deal is Trump has to get it done he's got to get it done by a certain time period\nOtherwise you know the Congress is not going to pass a trade deal that separate from Mexico\nAnd therefore that's the pressure they had in the administration I guess we shall see well\nYeah it it here's what I don't fear right now I don't hear any um any promotion of of a a massive I guess concession by Canada by the administration you\nKnow because the dairies tiny ... and that's that's the whole thing is that the movement if there were big movement here we we know about it already that would be in the media that would be the story that Trump claims\nThe fault\nSo again how much of a victory as it did it do anything to change anything and if we haven't gotten the steel and aluminum tariffs done\nThen what does that look like\nBecause that that right now if you look at what is really impact of the economy so far it's been it's been that just the threat of those when they started talking about those tariffs\nSo let me ask you this is it are we at a point where both Mexico and Canada because we talked about how not a lot of details have come out about Mexico right so we just to the point where they said look we both got to say we have an agreement to start the clock ticking for the next sixty days\nRight\nWe've come to terms and will work out the details later and we've pushed off the deadline for now\nThan we have a lot of stuff to talk about including that a cabin on the FBI investigation or how the goalposts have been moot remember last week I said that they moved the goalpost\nAre basically from a a a you know a a an American ... American football the Canadian football now I think the goalposts moved a soccer field now it's that even that ...\nThat much longer now ... years ago polls keep moving with the Democrats will get to that plus your calls and comments we had a great show ahead if you'd like to get in lines are open now eight six six Ninety red eye\nBooks with literally radio told at age ... he wrote a [noise]\n\nThese drivers new truck service pilot flying J truck has got to eat in the yard service centers and twenty four seven roadside assistance you want and we got\nEveryone eventually sees a when trucks carrying sign grocery store shelves\nGoods down but community\nProducts they keep the business running\nDo what they don't see is what the trucker areas inside your drive your history you're right and what we do we see you know\nWe see you carry a career that help support families communities\nWe see you carry the title friend named parent and provider we see you carry the sacrifice and the perseverance of a job [noise]\nEach was a determination to get the job [noise]\nTough hardworking than women like\nWhat you carry inside is more valuable than\nBecause it's what's inside\nDid you know the studies have shown that almost two and a half million truck drivers in the U.S have one or more serious health problems such as obesity diabetes heart disease even sleep disorders and our truck drivers lacked the same access to health that other Americans enjoy\nThe unfortunate result of these circumstances is that drivers are off and unable to get treatment and the early stages of disease\nMinor illnesses becomes severe leading to hospitalization and disability the driver then may lose their CDL and become unable to work this creates a downward spiral that leads to extreme financial hardship and possible unemployment\nGo to truckers fund dot org today and\nLearn more about how you can contribute if you are someone inside the trucking industry may be a need\nBurnt ...

anything anymore but credibly accused sex offenders should not coach youth basketball girls or boys without deeper investigation can't we all agree on that end up in ...\n\nThe tweets\nUh that led to promote the article said the U.S Senate may yet confirmed cabinet under the Supreme Court but he should stay off the basketball courts are now when kids are around writes Eric Brady\n\nAbsolute piece of\nCrap hit job on Kavanaugh's what it was now USA Today came in and this was just it was written as a sports article\nThey deleted the tweet and\nApparently made him change\nTo the lines the lines that are no longer in the newer article is this part isn't it where it says Brett Kavanaugh testify the other day that he might never coach girls basketball again\nThen this line was eliminated he shouldn't at least not until further investigation has concluded and the other line that then was eliminated\nWas the nation is deeply divided sometimes it feels like we don't agree on anything but credibly accused sex offenders should not oh shoot basketball girls\nOr boys without deeper investigation can't we all agree on that that was eliminated when USA Today took down the one story deleted the tweet and put out a new story not in the regular sports section but in the opinionated sports section\nDoesn't matter whether you asked that question\nIt's a hit piece what's you're trying to portray is that you suspect him as a pedophile\nAnd\nIt got me a little bit because I've read her up for Thirty years I'd like I said no one when I was a teenager\n\nAnd I and I look at this and and I over the last you know year or so I Will admit that I could see in some of his personal post\nYou know you could you could tell he didn't like Trump but that's okay I mean come on I got friends who do that I've Facebook friends who do that all the time we never ever got into a political conversation\nEver on Facebook right\nUh but I did see that you could tell that the you know that that it was in there it was in there somewhere but that's fine because people have their political opinions\nAnd I'm fine with that we've all got our family members and friends that disagree with some politics all the time again I haven't seen or what it since we were teenagers so I I you know I don't know but like I said\nUm\nI always thought that he wrote with class this is completely classless article a it's a hit job it's unwarranted\nA it is not up at all\nTo the sports journalistic standards but I knew from Arab Brady\nWhen\nHe started writing as a local writer and then went with USA Today probably for the first you know for for the last you know Thirty years this was just an absolute hippies and and what gets me angry about the ... you know you and I don't talk radio for a long long time and sometimes we may get a little bit of overheated whatever but\nWe never really got to we've never really gotten ourselves and any trouble we've had to apologize for anything that we've set on the air you know we're management comes in you must apologized because the sponsors are all Bailey\nAnd that's because number one we don't think I you and I don't think in a kind of radical ways to begin with\nWe're not hateful people we don't hate anybody\nBut I've always said if somebody says on the radio and loses that for a little bit to me that's a little bit more understanding even if you tweet it out and it's just a sentence but right here what he did\nHe wrote an article this was absolutely premeditated it was a premeditated hit job apparently because of the range that he feels of anything that's relating to Trump\nWell and this is you know indicative of the the mentality on the left this is just one more in a long line of people that are now just throwing everything at the cabinet nominations because they have room to do\nAnd you know how you know he's wrong and now he knows he's wrong\nBecause the editors or somebody got involved and said this goes to the opinion section you got to take out these sentences because these aren't fact based at all because he called it a credible accusation ... that's a political statement that is not a statement of fact\nNo and\nThe the the fact that the u._s._a. today how to delete the tweet oh and then he deleted his Facebook page completely he deleted for a reason\nBecause he knew the blowback that was coming why because one he wrote was an absolute ... piece on a man where there is zero evidence except for the allegation that he's ever done anything wrong\nWell again they you know for them now the claim is reality\n\nAnd so this goes to not just a hippies but a hit piece on his family\n\nNot he's not capable of making unbiased decisions\nNot\nWe're against him because he might overturn roe v Wade\nNot anything else\nIt was a hit job directed toward his children it involves the activities of his children ... imagine have somebody done this with Brock Obama and his daughter oh that person will be unemployed by now\nThat person would be done\nIf they were especially if they were working for a major news organization like USA Today\nThat that would have been over\n\nAnd and but this is what the left sees as a win this is what they see is acceptable tactics and it will continue now thanks to Jeff Flake and it's not acceptable in our nose where Aaron\n... about a dozen terrified mixture\nBrady knows it just so somebody says to him to the conversation they don't think I'm referring to you\n[laughter] and they don't care they don't care so that it's unacceptable because it's acceptable to them because anything to stop Trump and anything to stop this nomination process\n\nJust reprehensible what he did in USA Today and they wonder and then the gas that Kavanaugh was passionately defending himself yeah exactly yeah you're a bunch of hypocrites you know it\nYou're liars you know it but you don't care\nZero standards on the left these days is ear all\nYour calls in comments coming up if you like

either but yes where that's where we live right now it's on it's unfortunate that in\nThe day in age and think about it I just I go back to when I was in high school and college\nAnd how you have to

more news sources out there\nYou just brought it up ... not not only they're more news sources out there\nBut you have to realize that heart access to information to find out exactly what's going on is greater than it's ever been before we were growing up and they can say whatever they want and if you wanted to research it it would take serious time to do the research\nTo actually know what was going on yet\nWe said that people are actually more informed back then they are today oh because they did the basics first they actually learned and paid attention to and knew the basic ideas on which

articles in the Canadian media over the last couple of weeks that was stating that was on purpose they said Trump can rail all he wants we're not going to say anything anymore we're done\nWe'll negotiate where we need to negotiate but we're not going to get in the back and forth with them because they believe that it fuels ... ... it feels his passion and then support for what he is doing in the states so they said if he's just screaming and we're not responding\nIt brings all the rhetoric down and they said Jared Kushner was the one who helped the deal really you know get through on on what the actual deal is we don't know but we don't see any major changes in the free trade deal steel and aluminum or not included don't know why on that one\nYeah and and nothing is done until it's done and the signed agreement will be the agreement\nOr yeah because it would they haven't even worked out everything you had just a a lot like Mexico and I and I do think that one of the things is they they said look we got we have to announce in ... we had to announce that we've come to an agreement to get the clock ticking on this and we can work things out over the next couple of months\nYeah right well that takes it off the political table and gets behind the the number\nOne on one of the problems as we've always said it is with the president we have no idea since he has covered every single opinion on on trade we don't know where he stands we don't know what's acceptable or what's not acceptable he's gone from a complete protectionist\nOr any much of a you know rhetorical\nProtectionist during the campaign\nAnd then ah he had the ability about two months ago to be on Monday a complete free trader and by the end of the week was being protectionist again and so when you hold every opinion on free trade it's tough to figure where the president stands and what this eventual free trade agreement will look like\nUh but uh if it's more free trade\nAnd it's not protectionist as he promised in the campaign and his supporters are happy with it\nI'm fine with it yeah I mean it's it because it once and I think we will get the aluminum and steel tariffs are those that's going to fix itself\nAt some point it will have to just the way it did during the Bush administration and it takes it\nTakes a lot longer for that process or let's say [noise] back in the Bush years it took a lot longer for that process to play through to the market\nThis year or or or these days I don't know that that's the case actually on on aluminum and steel because when you talk about the basis of the of manufacturing\nThe based material for so much manufacturing you're going to have an ... have already seen a number of industries scream over the the aluminum and steel chairs ... so that's likely going to play itself out naturally the way it did during the Bush years\nWell you had a lot of financial publications just over the last five days saying ... the indicators are already in that the economy is starting to slow down in the United states and also when China because of the tariffs\nThat had been there and as we subtle along we believe that the president was absolutely wrong to isolate the United states if you wanted to isolate China\nBecause of their unfair trading practices yeah that you could win if you didn't isolate yourself if you ... the the goals should have always been isolate China don't isolate yourself because you are going to have basically the same free trade agreement that you have right now with Canada Mexico and Europe\nRaul modern western civilizations ... you're not going to massively be able to put tariffs on all of their products and they'll let all of our products going free it doesn't work that way we knew it you're not going to get rid of the one hundred and fifty billion dollar\nA trade imbalance especially when you have such a huge investment surplus into the United states so we knew that wasn't going to happen and so to us we thought there was a lot of wasted energy and the administration trying to uh have such incredible trade war rhetoric\nWith Canada Mexico when Europe when there was really no reason to have it and and with the Asian countries as as well but I Do think that when you see it you're going to see everybody claim their little victories here they're already started Canada\nSaying okay this is a great deal a great deal so they're going to be promoting their victories it'll be interesting to see the media in the United states promoting what is viewed as a victory and as we said you have to understand that when it comes to trade now a victory for a particular country is when the consumer\nHas to pay more for a product yeah that's how posterior backwards we are on ... it's a victory our consumers pay more yeah ha\nBut somehow that's that's\nThe way that it is it so that's how it's promoted yeah that was promoted that's the the weather ... that have that the political positive right is what they say we're hurting the economy slightly All right good [laughter] that's because the consumers pay because the consumers pay right\nAnd if the idea is protectionism which it is for targeted industry which it is then by\nDefinition you're asking well you're allowing that industry to raise its prices it's not just about being the tariff it's about paying higher prices for the industry that you say you're protecting\n... and it's the first initial impact as we've always talked about the initial impact as when you see that there's an over supply and the market and they can't sell it for as we've seen with the with the many different growers in the United states\nWhen the Chinese tariffs hit and then they had to sell it you know that's what initially happens at rock bottom prices ... ah you know everything because they need to get rid of it\nAnd then when the adjustment gums those prices will go the way you\nWrite it they'll go way up afterwards after you get rid of the stock the demon tore that you already had that you have to get rid of and that's why you had so many of the poor producers of Iowa killed over the last four to five months and because of those particular terrorists because they had to drastically lower for as we said all along\nA economics is simply how people respond to incentive\nThat's it right\nOr ... or you can say just instead of instead of one way distance that's it ... or anything else his opinion\nAnd the president can change that nobody can change that you can you can distort the market you can help one industry wall hurting another industry but you can't change how people respond to it and send them a disincentive\nAnd so when you do that when you decide to raise prices you hurt the overall economy if you decide to raise taxes whether it's income tax or attacks through terrorist you hurt industry\nYeah\nAnd it that simple and I don't decide that Eric doesn't just to get people mad when we say that although some tax is helping the economy no they don't\nKnow no\nThey hurting the economy and so I'm\nA I Can't change it you can't change that none of us can change if the president can change it all you do is distort the market in some way\nAnd that's the that's the only effect of it and then then there's inevitably the reaction against that\nBecause when the economy if the economy starts tanking if steel and aluminum products start skyrocketing which they will by definition then the consumer is going to react to that\nWith the consumer reacts to that the economy changes that's when you have to have another political answer which is the opposite political answer that you gave for the first place\nYou undo what you did eventually\nA lot of a of our listeners lined up to talk about cabin on
