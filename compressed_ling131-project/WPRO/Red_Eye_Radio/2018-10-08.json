Chris Fiore\nSouvenir stream standing nearby were also struck ... witnesses\nThat it appeared that the limo was speeding down the hill leading to the intersection but\nOfficials weren't sure yet how fast it was going\nWe do not have an estimate as a sign this for the rest of\nThe national Transportation Safety board is also investigating I'm Steve cast and\nBecause it makes sense to them clearly independence understand the presumption of innocence clearly they understand due process under the law the polls have showed that Democrats may they just wish to ignore\nIt because what they want now is more important than anything it is about their day to day politics\nAnd so I think it's just important just a little nit picking their and then I Move on to those goes do you remember ... no men were maybe ... maybe we're a little bit more content but we understand because we've been doing this for such a long time is just one battle and it's not over the next battles in a couple of weeks\nWell it's a couple of things the um the the whole idea\nOf of this there are two parts of this the political part of it and the question is is a greater motivator a greater motivator for the right or greater motivator for the Web or a greater motivator for the center you know the left a you know says there are since\nSaturday evening while we're more motor ... motivated now well that's what the press will have you believe we'll see about that um will look at early voter turnout as we always do\nBut really even with the right I Know I Know the motivation on the right there we know that so that's not going to go away or the motivation in the middle that's the question and that's where you win the election and so you look at the undecideds and how many of the key races right now\nUndecided or have a great number of undecideds are certainly to the extent that they can throw that election one way or the other that group going one way or the other end thrown out\nIs is is the key so beyond that the win at the highest court remains to be seen\nBecause we have to go back to chief justice Roberts twice ... rewriting Obamacare for the from the bench\nIs a victory and that the left did not get their way and their attempt to destroy the process I'm certainly they they just started the process\nWill see what happens to it next time there is a a an opening on the high court and if this president is still president uh how that goes but ultimately\nNow you're going to have to wait and see what what Kavanaugh's does on the bench what effect Hilton we have and that won't be seen for years and so the when there is that\nIt's an odds game as we've been saying for for many years going back to Andrew Breitbart and his comments to his during the twenty twelve race and\nTalking about how important the Supreme Court was when we asked the question why should we support or should conservative support a moderate like Romney at the time for for president and his answer was SCOTUS Andrew Breitbart censor was very clear\nAnd it is an odds game because you can support\nA John Roberts Neil Gorsuch\nOr Brett Kavanaugh Ben through all of it you still may not get those decisions you think you're going to get its always intriguing but sometimes it's disappointing and how they decide and we'll again we won't be able to see that effect\nOr if that's going to happen or for many years ultimately on the court there there will be cases where his decision will be key in those cases but we'll see how he decides and and what his thinking is in those opinions as they come across\nRight I mean if what what it's about ... if you look at his judicial history I Would say that\nAre most likely I'll agree with eighty percent of what he may be eighty five to Ninety I don't know ... between eighty and Ninety percent all agree I'm a ... with him you know we we talk about a true construction and some and by the way when we talk about remember what was that the or\nWas it the location device was at the location\nOf ice on the cars are about ... what\nWas the case that everybody thought it was the ... was the ... there for everybody where everybody said well we're especially the never Trump first came out and said see you didn't you see he sided with all the liberals [noise] excuse me you didn't get your judge mhm and then we had to point out as many other people\nDid no uh actually on that particular case it was the liberals on the court uh and and the Gorsuch that actually used the Scalia ruling\nA you know Scalia was probably the true with the the most construction as judge of of my lifetime paying attention to what the Supreme Court\nHas a has a has has done\nClarence Thomas always is not always a construction it right Clarence Thomas will\nA judge based on at times based on what he views as a conservative win for the day right that's not what I'm looking for I'm never looked for that I Want that's up for the legislature to decide to me there's these are all constitutional issues I Want judges look at the Constitution's say does it say that\nNo well that's not up to me to put that in\nDon't bend the constitution or straight from the constitution in order to fit your political agenda right so I'd say ... I'd say if I look at a a a a Clarence Thomas he's probably got a ... a ... it was almost\nNinety nine probably Ninety nine percent just doing it off the top of my head Clarence Thomas probably somewhere between Ninety and Ninety five percent ... depending on depending on the year [laughter] yeah and and what I'm hoping is that you have a\nA you know you have a Kavanaugh that ah would get to the Ninety percent level at least ah for me on on the ... on the important cases I'll be very pleased if it's greater than that but again nobody expected Roberts to rewrite Obamacare right do you\n... and and then you look at some of his other cases you're like Oh absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right so\nI'm a again this to me was about\n\nThe greatest thing that came out of this besides getting a ... Supreme Court justice that isn't a a roof gator ... Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the fact that you and I talked about the the left has made it very clear what they want\nA but I don't think that the Republican Party a\nI think a lot of conservatives knew this was this was a a part of who they were I don't think a lot of the moderates in the Republican\nParty fought they they were\nUh I I Will say some of the moderates that were never Trump or some of the conservatives that were never Trump hers but to see it in action and to see\nThem look to see the debate points that they were bringing up to see what they want it done to see that they rejected\nThe mindset of due process the mindset of a a presumption of innocence this\nStereotyping but if they're convenience all women are to believe unless you're deals those type of woman over there and by the way to one of the stories of saw\nThat now Democrats are starting to blame white women for cabinet are being put in well wait a minute I thought women were always right\nRight and then I then they started blaming ...\nAnd the case if he well wait a minute thought the woman was women were always right right yeah yeah but that case had too many holes well that's the whole point that the\n... so now we're just in a comparison of holes in a case right you are stating that and so they're all over the place and when it comes down to is\nThey're just trying to fit in argument to fit their narrative at the moment in order to get the judge in that will fulfill their liberal desires and a judge that will legislate for them they're all over the place on their opinions\nAs\nTheir opinions don't and their opinions on their goal post move all over the place right\nSo to me it was the fact that you were able to see the left and them and not just the far left\nWhat you saw because we normally get calls where people will say well that's not the mainstream of the Democratic party what you saw over the last two weeks was the mainstream\nOf the Democratic party in Washington DC the leadership of the Democratic party that reject due process under the law\nReject a presumption of innocence and we'll slander and defame somebody's character\nWithout evidence to do so yeah\nAnd I think a lot of I'll tell you I had a conversation with independent Bob yesterday boy he was renting he was you're burning my ear ah because ah as you said you know and and I've talked about independent fought for years and used to vote for Democrats he's sort of tell me how I can never vote for democratic get ever ever when I'm being told\nWhat white males thanks as always Ron and white men are always evil and women are always to be bullied because everybody knows that's not true right\n\nBut that's where they are so we'll get to that or by the way last year it was getting rid of the

uh and and let me point out something that that I just you know I I look at conservative media and I just say stop it\nAnd whether it was the you know in a drudge you you know we know he's conservative but you basically just lift things but he had the Taylor Swift story as the number one story half the day yesterday yeah and it's the number one story right now on Fox yeah All right\nNobody cares what she thinks no ... nobody cared over the Taylor Swift things why do the editors at Fox News\nBelieve that she deserves the Taylor Swift comes out in support of Tennessee Democrats who cares ... before she had said she won't speak on ... not ... who cares somebody cares nobody cares what she thinks\nThere's so many things that we can be doing as a as as as a media that are important and I'm not saying you don't put the you don't have the story somewhere ...\nYou know because you can you get your story but it's been the number one story now for a few hours sitting there and as we go to a Monday with everything that's going on right right Taylor Swift as a story that they they put up there\nEven though ... story and you know him supporting Donald Trump is a Side Story it's notable and the different because you have\nA mega hip hop star supporting Republican president who was hated by pretty much everybody else in his community and in in his profession so that's notable because it's not\nWhat a what he respects unique ... news just things that are unique and different right ... and ... and the thing is that\nUltimately though the the endorsement doesn't really do anything now sometimes you'll see a you know these mega endorsements come on come on board for an Obama but that wasn't what got Obama to the White House the\nEndorsements don't do anything except show that those celebrities are getting on the bandwagon\nA most often but you're not it doesn't matter who the celebrity is\nThat's not the influence with the with the people that's not the the real influence with real Americans they really don't care what celebrities have to say politically unless those celebrities are getting involved in politics and they're going to run for

the law you and I talked about this during uh during the uh uh uh during the whole uh uh\nA Ferguson case ...\nWhen you had a when you had a a Eric Holder and you had the president giving their opinion on it when they didn't know what happened right and we said you can't be doing that just shows you don't believe in due process under the law you can't be indicted unless you know you've got to take each case individually if you're not\nThen you don't believe in due process well we've seen this year the mindset of due process because what you did have her was a political trial yes uh it wasn't a civil trial wasn't day it wasn't a a a\nA criminal trial by many aspects of a real trial were there you are under oh mhm\nYou can be you can go to jail it was a legal setting it was illegal it's it's a legal maybe a political legal setting might not\nA criminal trial or civil trial but it was a trial\nWhere many of the enforcements of a trial\nA ... like when you testify if you commit perjury you can go to jail for that\nAnd they didn't believe in due process or under under the law they didn't believe in a presumption\nOf innocence none of that mattered to them then we got to trumpeting the presidency and they didn't believe in the electoral college anymore now this one when you have a ... and this is this is going to pick up now because the oh wow we forgot the Senate\nOr that are now that the the the Senate has and we told you this was coming if you've been listening to show the last couple of years we told you the next thing they were going to try to get rid of was the Senate\nWell if you don't want the Senate if you don't want the electoral college if you believe that the Supreme Court is the legislative branch and should be making up law when that was not their intent when you don't believe in the first amendment\nWhen you don't believe in the second amendment when you don't believe in due process under the law when you don't believe that the ... in the presumption of\nInnocence you\nReally don't believe in this country right you have no idea what the country's about\nAnd we understand\nNow on the show we believe that that the majority of our audience and the majority of conservatives understands the separation of powers we've talked about that a lot we've talked about how the majority of America though ... close to Seventy five percent does not\nBut if you understand the concept of the hour by camera legislature you understand why we have a house of representatives you understand why we have a set it you understand why Great Britain as a house of lords in the house of commons\nYou understand that the founding fathers of the United states\nThey wanted a separation of powers\nThe thing that they were most scared of was that a ... ... group a particular group of ... a a person a small group of people a particular kind of a legislature or a court or presidents see\nThey were scared to death that power could be concentrated in one of those areas and they ... they were trying to avoid that more than anything because they had looked at the history of the world\nAnd seen how authoritarianism works and they didn't want it\nAnd the by camera legislature was a compromise made by the Congress and when you look at it the house of representatives uh you have I think fifty three house members in California only one in Wyoming why bigger population and California\nFewer people in a ... in Wyoming both of\nTwo senators a that was done for a reason that was done sold the house would more represent the United states by population and by region but the Senate\nAnd on and and by the way the the reason that are you a are elected for two years so you're closer to the people more accountable to the people if they wanted they believe that the\nHouse of representatives would be closer to mob rule than a Senate [laughter] [laughter] and so they they but they wanted if they wanted the the the\nCongress to be closer to the people small areas you know of the country were you represented you know that area of the country and you had more power of the state\nBecause if you had more population and a bigger state you were more representation in the house\nBut they also wanted in every state wanted the ability to have\nSome kind of equal employed so the big states could not rule over the little states\nThat was the reason right the reason the bill of rights exist the reason that we are and constitutional Republican not a direct democracy is why separation of powers and also protection of individual rights and protection of states' rights\nAnd that's why it was done and do things move slower yes\nBut founding fathers were worried so much about legislation moving slowly through\nThey preferred that then mob rule\nThe reason the electoral college exist today is so you can't have Marlboro or you can have the big states not knowing what the future was going to be in this country where the big states would totally dominate in the executive branch ...\nIt was all it was all thought up not to have the separation of powers so power cannot congregate in one area and as we said when it comes to the by camera legislature to give them to give the people one body which is the house\nAnd then the Senate which is to per state which is six years so they could be more long term looking at the country where they weren't voted in every single or every two years\nAnd the senators were more likely to look at what was best for the country and not just the region that the congressional membership or represents I'm most\nRoom five I daresay that the vast majority of the left have no idea of I think most people I listen to our show do understand you know everything that I said but I don't believe that the left understands that at all or cares to understand\nI don't think they care about it because what they want is again a and as they often engage in in fantasy they create and there might a fantasy of what the nation should be\nI mean they create a in their mind a fantasy of what the what the government should be giving you every day so the makeup of that government needs to change to fit that fantasy most often they're okay with doing that they don't understand the process they don't care to understand the process\nThey don't care why it was set up this way\nAnd you know it's interesting because you look at what happened after Trump was elected and you had people on the left\nYou know then that at at that point start talking about uh we want our guns because not all but some on the left we want our guns because ah of the possibility of a tyrannical government\nHey welcome to the second amendment now\nThey're excuse the point of course directly to this\nPresident but it was about the same idea basic idea of the second amendment and\nIt's often too little too late for the left they called for something something changes well we didn't know it was going to be that just one small example was Obamacare not that it was small but much smaller than of course change through your way with the Senate completely\nWe didn't know we were going to happen but we thought someone else was going to pay for it\nYeah well lesson weren't you start coming in and you start changing the very foundation of the constitution and they do believe this is this is really been the game all of them all\nYou know the the the whole um changing of the first amendment isn't just about\nProtecting their free speech because of the things they want to say and doing away with yours and we've talked about that battle but it's also doing away with the freedom of religion because your religion is bigoted\nIt it needs to go away completely because we disagree with it freedom of speech while we protect that when\nUs it's our group talking\nWe don't want you to be able to talk you don't have freedom of speech example California used the wrong pronouns the penalty mechanism in the law includes

I Know when the Republican base is motivate 'em and they are quite motivated right now I I don't know that they're\nUh they're motivated and their unified when when I saw that what George W. Bush how many times and he called Collins and he called her numerous times during this whole process is George W. Bush ... to push for a Trump\nNominee mhm for for the Supreme Court this says you're not at everybody and I think one of the reasons that you not everybody is look we've dealt with Trump for the last two years the people in the Republican Party but just can't stand up and all of a sudden the last three weeks I woke up and went hoops\nHe is really not our enemy\nIs really not our political enemy there maybe some things that we don't like we don't like his tone we don't like this we don't like it'd be exaggerates we don't like when he doesn't tell the truth at times but\nHe's a lot better than these insane people on the other side I Believe that that's what a lot of never Trump ... maybe not all but I think it's a ... well it was just that everybody except Bill Kristol\n[laughter] well [laughter] if the interest [laughter] and that's not going to happen and possibly George Will uh but they're [laughter] what\nThe the the the the idea if you look\nAt it and I I find it kind of a interesting that George W. Bush at the same president who said well\nIn campaign finance into law I Know parts of this are unconstitutional but I'll let the courts work it out [noise] called columns to make sure that the court gets it right um but but [laughter]\nI just sat on the way it right by the way great observation I miss yeah well I I just uh you know but but certainly anyone from the Bush family doing anything to support a a Trump nominee is is definitely notable but\nIt also goes beyond what we'll do it well it goes right to what we will set and goes beyond the the political aspect of this uh and removes it from the current White House because it is\nAbout the long term makeup of the court and George W. Bush of course recognizing that I'm certain um as many of us do and it is\nAlso recognizing a indirectly and while we haven't and I would love to hear from the former president on this or asking the question\nOr if if it is the case with him we pointed out it is the work that the president does now we can go back and forth on the comments made a the end the communication errors and and things even on the issues that we disagree with uh we we are the original ... babies [laughter] and then\nHave those discussions but we said from the beginning\nIt is the reason that you from the beginning so you know ultimately with your vote that it becomes\nWell as it always is that buying their decision and then along the way regardless of whether or not and I saw somebody in my neighborhood with for Ted Cruz signs in their yard that you know not one not too but a total of four they're really really voting for a group\nAnd so our time for science I'm ... and and I thought to myself you know okay that's that's a that kind of enthusiasm\nUm even if we were to show that uh we don't do when we don't do endorsements because again as we mentioned earlier I don't believe they really do anything it tells it it might tell your audience which way you're going but there are the the point is is that we have the discussion on the ideas and we believe\nThat our audience and the rest of the country is smart enough to make their own decisions they may be willfully ignorant not our listeners but others may be willfully ignorant along the way they can make their decision\nOr you know or are there still capable of finding the information whether they choose to or not but ultimately it is about ah when that person is elected if I\nIf I'm campaigning for them if I'm doing a volunteer work for them if I donate to their campaign I'm Still from\nDay one going to watch them on on the issues on their work you judge them on the work and then of course a head of that work you are back them in order to you know uh to to\nHave them do that work to keep them in place to do that work and you see a George W.

confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court\nBooker in Harris got to raise their profiles because they sit on the Judiciary Committee buck Austin Deanie washing\nYou know it is and and it's it's just\nBecause you look at this look these we know that these protests are organized to a great deal it was happening during the Trump rallies in twenty sixteen we know that there was a great organization and money to a certain extent going\nBehind a that was behind and driving a lot of these protests are we know or the west is very good at that but that's that's why\nYou can't find for a lot of them you really can't it's hard to I identify with them and and for most Americans that is\nYou know again the idea of a peaceful protest and standing up for what you believe people are quick to you know speak out in that if there is a pollster that calls whether it's kneeling in the NFL or any other issue though I Believe people should you know have the right to be heard\nBut how many people actually do it are active in protest most people are not the overwhelming majority or not and in fact if you didn't have a you know a Soros organization\nAny or the organization or that I mean we can go back to Ferguson\nFerguson they authorities they they told they were quick to tell you look we've got people that aren't even from the state that have come here from a long ways away\nAnd that was clearly organized so when it comes down to\nHow many people are actually willing to get out there to the extent that are driven and motivated to the extent that they would get out there if not part of some kind of organization\nI'm well we're we're the Facebook crowd opposed recalls oh yeah yeah well and so the poll a Facebook so half of their uh one click to like buy and we might share it we might read tweeted\nBut the fact of the matter is is what is it I guess the question is what is it that really drives most Americans it's the everyday things in our lives and when we go back to the poll that you brought up earlier and we we talked about last week\nThat the majority of Americans it was somewhere around sixty percent that said well if there was nothing to corroborate claims from this additional background check on Kavanaugh we that sixty percent saying he should be confirmed\nWell that's a big deal now it's not eighty percent not Ninety percent what sixty percent will win you a fuel elections and the point being is that we stepped back from\nThe insanity under display the show that's being put on by the left here\nAnd the behavior by the left I mean I'm not saying it's not real I'm not saying people aren't going to react to it or you know cirrhosis can can back whatever he wants to and people can act the way they want to and even on the Senate Judiciary committee they can say the most insane things if they believe it's going to get them political points well it just might\nIn your state of Hawaii or California\nBut if you believe it's going to win the argument with the people of America you're flat out wrong\nAnd and that's why I think ... and and again this is\nA not a ... analysis of facts like this is just my my gut feeling from\nWhat I what I've seen what I've heard the personal response that I just generally talk to people over the last uh a couple of weeks were more independent or non political who have paid attention to this and even though they do sympathize\nAnd because this is one of the things would just really ticked off a ton of people including a ton of women that I Know and that are that are more ... a\nMore conservative was if you didn't believe her\nThan your for rape ...\nIf you don't believe in the rape if you don't believe in the rape allegation\nAlone without cooperating\nEvidence if you don't absolutely believe the allegation then you're as much a rapist yourself because you're enabling raping our society right well\nThat kicked off a ton of women that I Know who just went wait a minute and I and I gave you the example two of my my buddy independent Bob\nWho said what what what is this something that you always believe the woman you don't believe anything but evidence and to me that's where the Democrats jump the shark is\nMost of most Americans which is why you see the sixty percent and I bet you that sixty percent I bet you that other forty percent that so we don't want to confirm Kavanaugh had nothing to do was just the fact that they'd rather have a more liberal judge or if Trump pick somebody they don't want him but I guarantee you that the majority of Americans looked at that process and said\nNo you don't always believe the woman you have to have evidence you don't believe always believe the man you don't always believe a woman you don't always believe anybody gets the evidence that you make the judgment on and yeah these senators are accusing him of being a rapist without the evidence without the evidence and in fact there gives him being a gang rape is\nWithout the evidence of of being there they say believe all women or you know all women don't tell the truth but it's a majority doesn't matter that's why we judge every case individually because that's the only way that you can do it in America and I do believe that\n... Americans understand that they understand\nBasic fairness and when they see I'm not just the radicals but the mainstream of the Democrat Party the mainstream of the party that are arguably has more people supporting it mhm\nNot by much but maybe more people supporting it then the Republicans\nMhm just looking at the last election on the popular vote out the electoral college vote or\nWhen they see that they say I don't really wished to be a part\nOf that that's just that's crossing the line that that's no type of\nAnd and and when you find out that you know the the fact is they're the ones that burned Dr Ford it was a Dianne Feinstein she burn ... the victim is the one that wouldn't T the anonymity of the victim right it was the Democrat who leaked it\nIt was the Democrats right it was either find of Feinstein's office or one of her staffers or it was the the the congresswoman mhm\nRight was it was ... or or her staff that said it had to be one of those two right\nAnd so when you look at it you all you see is from the Democrats is manipulation across the board character assassination across the board not the no belief and the presumption of innocence the stereotyping the bigotry\nAll women all need to be believed a white man white\nMen or ... white men can't and people look at that stage and it's just like stomp it well I think\nYou two we have to keep in mind the and this isn't a ... this was recent history we don't have to go back into the Democrats in the sixties recent history\nYou have in it because again the same side that said we're going to stand up for women\nCalled the women who voted for Trump self massages yep they in fact the candidate herself after she lost said well the problem is is that women listening to their husbands the husbands tell them how to vote [laughter] enrichment stupid\nBecause your husband has to tell you how to vote your son even your boss tells you how to vote your stupid and can't make a decision for yourself well which is it Democrats\nThere to be believed or not if they vote with their hearts and minds and the twenty sixteen election against Hillary no theirself massage units which first they will tell you for whatever reason they hate women\nLiterally history headlines right here or San Francisco chronicle activists blame white women after Susan Collins says she'll vote for cat All right ah [laughter]\nAh critics blame white women the rap after Susan Collins a a a cabin uh a speech\nYeah because we're amber was women women were were the oppress women were the victims in general until they lost and now it's that women of color are the victims they blame white women well I don't know\nDr forged genetic makeup or her her ethnicity background but she appears to be and a white\nWoman and and what it comes across as is you just will do anything to get a win right you won't show compassion to of victim\nYou will slander people you will defame people you will say that the presumption of innocence should not be part of the the the the process you say at one point that all women should be believed than you demonize other women\nAre there is no consistency to the mindset except we will do anything to get a win and I do believe that's why you had the reaction of many independents who say\nThere's a complete total lack of any type of fairness any type of ... it's the Democrats were screaming for civility like McCain and as you and I said after the McCains dinner we said by the way this week on Monday\nThis will be gone as soon as the hearing this was all completely gone and you've seen them taking it up to a level where there was a possibility if McCain was alive today ... he and Lindsey Graham would have stood side by side\nYeah I could see a ... a John McCain after the behavior of the left in this process making the same type of comments that Lindsey Graham made\nOr contact in the Army National guard recruiter in your area sponsored by the Rhode Island Army National

going to work out for you if you attempt to do that and he said probably unconstitutional to try to impeach him for something that he did when he was not in office right you know that he did as a teenager that is that the point you're going to try to bring\nYou know bring up I mean there is no I mean they're going to try that you're going to try to make the perjury claim right again where there's no evidence for perjury or you know whatsoever and uh and and so uh it's like really you're going to bring that up and he is just and they do not\nAnd he made it known he said look I don't want to Brett Kavanaugh on mhm 'cause I don't want it goes but if the Democrats want to pick a Supreme Court justices win the presidency right\nWhat you have to do and and that would be you know going forward a your best bet in fact if you're on the Web can we you and I talked about this off the air last week to play would be look\nThey Kavanaugh seated but we can't let this happen again we can't have a third justice seeded by the current president I mean that would be the argument from the left or I guess the a proposition or concern issue to the rank and fight 'em but the left doesn't operate that way\nThe failure of with all due respect of Mr Dershowitz in his appeal to the left\nI'm really is to\nIs to not recognize what the left is all about they don't care about the process they don't care about whether or not there's a case there or not they don't care about anything else just keeps screaming whining crying a you know foul and that's what they'll do\nNow that's what we want them to do because it's working it's actually working right now because the rest of America looks at it and recognizes that for the silly behavior and at times outrageous behavior that it is\nAnd I don't know what's gonna happen you know I I read all the polls and everything else but I don't know because to have something like this happened so close to the election yeah so I think that has United the Republican Party like I've never seen before and I don't look I don't know how if it's motivated the Democrats because\nIf twenty six team didn't motivate the Democrats mhm right and they hated Trump at that point mhm uh will the motivation be there now or is it more despair from the the the Democrats and well the Republicans\nWho have definitely been energized follow this will they be

the ... case heard it even more\nYes but it all starts with the fact that the first case was not credible yes so\nIf we're mirrors would have come out first that might have been the first one and the boards would have been viewed as not credible because she couldn't remember the majority of the incident from that night except it was one hundred percent\nBrett Kavanaugh\nAnd and I think that you you look at that are like the the and again it and the court of public opinion when when we're forming opinions but\nIt is often foreign through information that as a given to us by the media and and the people that represent anyone making the claims but if you look at the winds team cases right mhm what did we we started everything started to be corroborated through through\nUh the well not just the number of people coming forward and others who said that they were aware of this kind of activity pretend ultimately his own from that essentially had to pay schedule find schedule based on this kind of behavior if he were to be caught\nAnd and so\nThere were things where again if if if Ford made the claims and couldn't get anything to substantiate those planes that were nothing there and then Ramirez came forward and their war and then the third accuser came forward and she had things to back up her client\nThat case would have been hard for the president or Kavanaugh to deny those cases collectively as one big situation that Kavanaugh would have been face\nBut that didn't happen\n... were we and the only one that the only reason the Ford came out just because it was late yes\n... and so that that it would not it was an all likelihood would have never come out if it had gone through the proper a judiciary a of way if it ... it but I find so I Would have taken it immediately and taken into Grassley then they would have gone to the FBI to do a background check but everything would have been anonymous\nAnd what and what the what you just heard too was the failure to recognize how Ford story changed\nYou know and and they talk about how the ... story change how the sweat story changed but look at how the Ford story changed but what their point was on the political picture of being believable the scenario that was that was their\nStarted with a he said or she said he said\nWell then are we developing a pattern with the second and third no they fell apart and then we look back at the first one and realized it also changed and was falling apart\nWhat they what they were trying to point out here was she could have been the victim the one person to centrally if she were to give him a Dr Ford or to have given her testimony and nothing else happened\nShe could have been the one and it could have been at least played or spend with out the evidence to back it up in a way that might have influenced votes\nBut because of the behavior and they mentioned\nCollins making the or the you know talking about having these role in her speech but it that happened all of that happened because of what\nBecause of the left and made it happen because the people sitting on this panel helped make it happen\nWhile you're in you think about it too because of the narrative that every woman must be believed mhm and after Ford\nAnd again her story was like ... the story itself is incredible yet right being told that was their major talking point you've got to believe that the the alleged victim the alleged victim as a woman alleged victim must be believe we've seen the science we know it must be ... and then you get a second and third\nThat also are not credible then you start destroying that narrative at that point right I Believe that's what they're probably saying even though they are the ones that plane you need to believe all the women all the time and they help even that you know they're they're yeah they're just you know even Chuck Todd is making the point well that really isn't\nTrue yeah what is the this is the version of a right after the twenty sixteen election or we need to go to the heartland and listen to their voices huh that's basically what you see except for the fact\nThat it had greater substance en route and relevant to it I mean they ... they were right by the way uh in in in November of twenty sixteen when they said that but there was no expectation they were going to do just that in this case they're looking back on it and and recognizing\nAnd again they were part of carrying that narrative\nHelping to form those narratives along the way and then saying yeah well we shouldn't have played it that way it shouldn't have been played that way\nYou when when you look at well I have an Audi stormy Daniels' case that and no one absolutely no one is shocked\nThat a playboy billionaire had an affair no and again not shocked not surprised and also not politically motivated either way by it but the left creates these narratives they give out and out of the\nThe the ability to introduce the credibility if you will from their perspective not ours to introduce the sweating to claim\nIt must be because he's got a legitimate claim and legal claim against Trump now there must be something that he's got was sweating it must be legit\nIt's if it's against Trump Trump so it has to come out because there there must be some legitimacy to it even if there's not like I said the the only other point that I'd like to make is because this is what I Wonder and again this is a completely totally unfounded allegation without anything to back it up whatsoever but everybody will understand my point what is Joe Manchin have\nOn Schumer [laughter] I'm fine dining and right what does he ever had a Democrat leadership nobody's calling\nFor a primary challenger to him in the next\nElection nobody is criticizing Joe Manchin from the left at All right he's a Democrat wired their screams that he should be kicked out of the party where is that\nRight exactly how come all the Republicans are taking the flack from the the the left but\nThe one Democrat who voted for Kavanaugh\nNot same nothing nothing it's like to go back to West Virginia just yeah I mean because because the reality of it I mean you know they they I I saw somebody liberals on on a social media late a while as late friday and also into you know Saturday continued\nOn college we need to find somebody who as Susan Rice spoke up who\nWill chat with the next election Susan rough tallies raw ... ... runs isn't right so it's a woman who got on TV and lie on the wrist\nAttack American please that's kind of credibility and the Democrats made and\nAnd then and then I thought to myself well wait a minute how many of these liberals on social media would vote for Susan Collins had she voted no on Kavanaugh zero\nYou know it's this disingenuous well now we're going to challenge or like you weren't anyway right now we're going to vote in election that's right now we're gonna have to find someone to challenge her eight six six
