up here coming up a little bit later on the show but it was really interesting saying\nThat in a normal election for example that you know and this was talking about Ted Cruz and uh uh Robert Francis or working here and also in on this ... not in in the state of Texas and it said that and and you were talking about the ... the average went from a toss up to\n... yeah they well they had at the state this is our state Senate\nRace went from toss up to a a leans Republican and it will it end if it if the polls keep trying to the way they're trying now it will likely go likely Republican before the elections\nAnd ... and they the some of the analysis of looking at said six percent of Republicans a will be in an average election ... will either sit out the election or vote for the other candidate mhm\nAnd they made the point that if that six percent of it was just a normal election and that six percent which is a huge amount ... old decided to vote for a walk and\nHe would still win by five hundred and fifty thousand votes cruise would still hurts would still wins\nYeah yeah I'm looking at the the breakdown of it and the the\nUh the history of of those waters because you look in El Paso in his district um in in El Paso county uh it it he can run for that house seat and keep that house seats as long as he wants to ... ...\nYou when you move out to the ...\nThe the broader much broader state of course the demographics change drastically um Dallas County All right you might win that uh there's in fact you if you looked at the polls\nI'm sure Dallas County would show going for him Travis County Harris County so those are Dallas ah Austin and Houston\nAre respectively if if you're if you're not familiar with the counties but that those metro areas are tons of support tons of money coming in from\nUh the packs that he promised to or not ah except uh in terms of that and and and not he while he promised to reject the the the pac money I guess in in earnest but you really can't reject pac money pac money\nUh ultimately I guess but the the point being is there's a ton of a liberal money coming from out of the state a ton of liberal press from out of the state\nUm and of course uh the the make up the demographics in those those areas that we talked about a bear county in San Antonio uh same thing so you've got all these uh blue counties\nAnd these metro areas and and that's that's kind of the breakdown of it and he'll do well and and likely win and those that were that were mentioned are and some other counties in or districts\nIn the state but ultimately it comes down to the broader stay as it always does and uh right now it's got it according to our sleepy leaning Republican\nAnd looking at a Tennessee uh uh for example you know as as we look at how did the cabinet thing and uh how might it have you know change the way that that people are looking and you look at the CNN the tendency race ah Marsha Blackburn against\nA a Phil Bredesen a British thing was up by five ... Democrat challenger back\nFrom the poll taken just from the eleventh of the September to the Fifteen\nHe was up by five ... uh from the twenty ninth to the second black burn up by five ... from the second to the fifth which took us to Saturday and write a note tickets to friday friday yeah black burn up eight ... that's a third team point movement in\nA matter of a a matter of a month and that's why we've always said we don't really\nWhen you see plus or minus ... uh you know five or even six or even seven and it doesn't give you an indication\nAs to you know how the polls may tightened and this is the time right now I mean I'm Talking about right now in the election fight is when you get a much better idea we always hear from our listeners that polls are never right mhm that is incorrect analysis\nOr you know\nPresidential elections for example you and I really paid attention\nA front in two thousand eight two thousand twelve and two thousand sixteen ... after the election saying how many polls were close and normally you find\nUsually a a three or four of the polls were probably one or two we're almost dead on and three or four pretty close then you have the you know some of the outliers out there and we always bring that to you after a presidential election but the polls actually do do a good reading in the ... there were a couple of polls that were\nDead on they didn't have Trump winning ... because they just do the popular vote they don't do the electoral vote\nOr but they were dead on us to the vote ... what a Hillary won by what two percentage points for a and so there were a couple of polls that were dead on but they didn't figure out the electoral college so they didn't figure out in those states\nIn those particular states because they weren't doing the electro electro college\nAnalysis right so uh\nBut they had the the actual vote count which again we come to a presidential elections from now on if the Democrats if a case of Cortez doesn't succeed in getting rid of the electoral college in the Senate [laughter] uh you know a\n... will will they started trying to figure out are doing more detailed analysis and ah because you've had a you know a\nA Trump you know have this\nHad this victory so right it'll be interesting to see what what happens there will go be going over some of the polls but yeah the un says that we're doomed unless we pay the amount by twenty Twenty one hundred ... two hundred and forty dollars\nTax on a gallon of gas okay by one the\nOne hand you know I Know I here's what I Will commit you what you I Am willing I I cannot speak\nMy children grandchildren great grandchildren or anyone else in my family that is president now or will be present in the future\nBy if I Am I live in the year Twenty one hundred will will pay that tax you know it's going to happen to him through some scientist is totally totally gonna mess that up for me\nHey we found a way to make your lives six hundred years oh yeah yeah yeah ... well on the old cat that I thought you might come up with a new energy form like the movie the St ... with with ... [laughter] well no see here's the thing by Twenty one hundred if we're not transporting if [laughter]\nIf I Can't just sit there and the ... just something we have a witch hunt for giving up at all but you're forgetting word where does the energy come from robots to disassemble and the Adams of a person and then put them back together that's got to be\nYou know it may take the energy that that a nuclear bomb would create in order to do that for a human being we're assuming that the energy source is there for beaming oh it is\nIt could be tremendously because it may beaming may leave a huge

their mind also\nComing up hurricane now Michael a could hit Florida as a hurricane's freeze while three and\nYou know a hundred and ten miles an hour you look at the analysis a and and apparently from the flyovers as as you and I are following it and we are not meteorologist although John trout is with us of\nCourse every hour um and we we look at that and but when you read the discussions the the discussions changed drastically and those reports from the national Hurricane Center on Monday morning and it they started to show signs of that and that ah Michael strengthening\nA and having potential to strengthen greatly late Sunday and Monday morning but then they saw there's apparently a sheer that's involved here that they said typically would mean that it's not going to be such a powerful storm but they said despite that cheer and I I read the ten pm central\nDiscussion on it and it said it defies all logic that the sheer is still in place\nUh this this elements essentially that would\nDiminish the strength or keep the strength from growing I guess\nI'm despite that and they think maybe it's because of the size of the I thirty five miles I uh it is\nIt is showing great potential for strengthening so for our friends there uh in in the Gulf Coast in on the panhandle of Florida listen to the authorities listen uh to keep your radios on uh make sure you were up to date on the information because this storm\nAgain has the potential to be and most are calling it now or that they're saying there's a likelihood of a a major hurricane hitting the panhandle of Florida lived there for three years and nothing yeah\nI was I was I was lucky but ah I have a lot of friends down in that area so uh well we'll have the latest uh on that in the latest updates when the hurricane center or gives or update which would be another hour yeah uh you know not to central is it yeah so yeah\nIs it to some guy I Know there's one at for central as well so we'll we'll ... we'll look at that as soon as we get updates and they may by the way\nUh it's I guess it's possible they may or issue or more information on in fact I'm certain they will uh if it warns that based on a a a

done that in the analysis for example of President Trump and many of the different controversies\nThat the the media believes that uh he has created into those people are Jonathan Turley a the a well

many Times She's old school too and they don't know they look at today's Democratic Party and they say ... like we do it they're they're becoming the mindset of a fascist that the authoritarian streak is not in Trump\nIt's in the Democrats and on Fox yesterday they brought in Bryan dean right who is\nDemocrat strategist who said Democrats will suffer the rightful consequences of using the victims of sexual assault to advance a political agenda he was on a Fox and friends and he explain\nWhat he meant\nBrian van right and joins us now to explain what do you mean by that time\nWell I think what we saw at the beginning of August we had an opportunity to do the right thing which is work with Republicans quietly privately and investigate those allegations not in the public domain not do a a fact finding mission in front of cameras what to do it in a scrape by [noise]\nAnd instead we use those allegations have the last possible minute\nAnd we rally that power base and we frankly traumatize a whole bunch of people are not just miss for but also a lot of folks in America who have to suffer from sexual assault\nSo that is the strategy that I found appalling are watching these past couple of months so the two parties who's more energized frying going into the midterms [noise]\nI think we have a horse race I think it's neck and neck I I think that's a real question uh for November is going to be where do these independents fall so what's really interesting is that the polling shows the independents are leaning ... ever so slightly rather to uh to Trump and to the Republicans\nAnd this is especially true of men a white man Hispanic man and those folks who do not have a college education\nIn other words that as the Trump coalition and so it's the fact that contains ... that's that's really the coalition coming home\nFor November So really benzene the strategy if that that they are Democrats employed or has backfired\nYou know the ... and here's another thing that the women and and I talked about there's five or six women that I Know\nThat I've been close to for a long long time ... all of them at least over a decade\nAll professional women when I first met them ... you know and and um as ten to Fifteen Years ago not that political the majority I think one in their mid to late thirties the other in their forties and fifties early fifties and all professionals\nOkay all executives and professionals and when I first met them none of them really political\nAnd they knew that when I first met them that I was a talk show host and it was ... now when I talk to them total interest in what's going on in politics\nAll of them over the course of ten to Fifteen Years not because of my influence uh want to make that clear a are extremely conservative they\nAre a whole\nNot if the Republicans there appalled if the Democrats\nAnd so there is this mainstream media narrative that women naturally\nUh are attracted to the side of Dr Ford and feel sympathy and hate the Republicans for what has happened well the woman that I've talked to and again ah you know I've ... I've explain\nYou know what what their background is every one of them know the fact that Dianne Feinstein could've kept a secret they look at it and they said the Democrats lose across the board here the Democrats lose because they could have kept quiet\nThey could've kept that she was she claimed she want it now they're suspicious as to who's telling the truth here but they said even if you believe\nDr Ford and that she really truly wish to keep it quiet then the Democrats completely betrayed her Dianne Feinstein completely portrayed her\nBecause as he just said and he's a democratic strategist\nThe Democrats had the chance to keep it all quiet\nTo fulfill her wishes and still do an investigation and they said no we don't care about the woman who claimed she was sexually assaulted and wishes to have her anonymity we are going to use her as a political football we say to that earlier\nAnd I'm sure there were Democrats dating on on a there is a democratic strategist saying the exact same thing that's what will hurt the Democrats is because that's what he as a Democrat believes that they have\nDone well and that's the damage that's his job is to assess essentially damage what works for them what doesn't work for them\nAnd it is not it did not work for them on any level\nBut not only did you have that situation where they clearly leaked it to the media then beyond that you had the overreach with the two additional accusers coming forward and ultimately the nail on the proverbial coffin in that\nThe sweating the allegation that came across from her by their hands through her lawyer\n... that was not only overreach but it was clearly a tactic by Abernathy who clearly has it out for this current president\nSo I have to ask this question because you know after on on Saturday on on on Saturday when I heard it okay\nWe're going to what you know where you're Jerrold Nadler okay if we take Congress we're going to impeach we're going to impeach we're going to impeach we're going to impeach we're going to a beach\nAnd I thought that would die out because I thought to myself but that's a pretty bread a bad strategy you have lost in a variety of ways here I don't think this is a win for you so why would you go out and attempt to motivate\nThe right unless you believe you would motivate the left but still if you could impeach them you're not going to he's not going to leave\nYou know it'd be his Supreme Court seat you would need to go to\nThe Senate now ... and this is a question I was asking does the house or the Democrats\nWho believe that they would be part of the house leadership and ... would be the head of the house Judiciary Committee a you know under under you know uh what would go on it if if the Democrats won a the the the house um\nAre they saying that because they believe that the people to both of them are idiots and they believe that they believe that impeachment means we can take them off the seat\nOr do they believe that this will just motivate their base and then don't completely drop it if they win that they have no intention of of going after impeachment\nAnd told him they'll scream obstruction by the the Republicans that that we wanted to get it done but the Republicans wouldn't let us get it done 'em and that we still want to get it done a it is one of those campaign promises that is definitely going to fall short while the applicants if they had the if they had the\nThe the majority of Republicans couldn't stop an investigation up in\n... well not an investigation the investigation may happen but it's not going to be an impeachment there's there's the thing it's the promise ultimately what that you'll remove him from the bench and ... that are not only what happened that that's not going to have and what are you gonna do Dr Ford said she she's done or he doesn't want to be part of it\nAre you going to subpoena all these women and bring them back again right so that would be my question is democratic strategist are out there stating you've done damage to your own party\nDrop this well enjoy because here's a question when you start moving in that direction how did you move in that direction and go through the entire process without learning\nWho leaked to the media is not going to tell you because they don't have to reveal their source\nBut the investigation if you look at an investigation where would go\nAnd it will be public\nI mean there's nothing here in terms of classified material that is going to be in place this will be a very public investigation how do you do that without revealing who\nLeaked and we know who leaked it so the problem is\nThey don't want that on ... the Democrats who leaked it don't want it on record\nBecause that has to be a part of the process\nAnd just below sea as you said just she really want to see the second background check from the FBI ... by the way you in a bunch of Republicans who saw it and said release it released to release it and they do it because they don't want to break wrote it\nAll right for the next judge right\nRight but the Republicans are saying we wish we could release this thing yeah it's an empty it this was an empty promise that isn't going to happen um they can hold their investigation they can call for the investigation they can hold their investigation but a complete investigation must include who leaked it to the media\nSigning a kind of nation my pants Batman brought me about the U.S department of health and Human Services and the station mom that maybe you're right maybe you

I have not seen that\nChanging the only numbers change in terms of uh I guess dollars are changing hands is the credit now you would have to go through of course a Congress to get\nThose subsidies and everything else the president may say I will push for greater subsidies what is pushing for a year on the surface really is selling more ethical\nWhy yeah this is some job that doesn't while it doesn't have a mandate attached to it and the oil companies don't care about the credits\nThey don't care about the credits\nThat's not something that helps them if the government forces a mandate and that's what was being proposed the even President Trump has talked about in the past raising the mandate right ... percent right well if you do that that becomes a that becomes a big problem politically ... outside\nOf Iowa got I just I've read like three different articles on it and that's what I thought it was was okay you're trying to please both sides but you're not really pleased anybody well because you're not mandating it the oil companies aren't going to do it right it's not a mandate on it so you're simply saying I'm going to allow them I'm going to allow I'm going to allow the industry to do what the industry doesn't wish to do\nRight and sell it year round well I think you're probably going to see pushback ... first of all I guess we'd have to see what the participation rate is well once I like the the city's like Houston in LA they don't want more smog\nWhat gas station is going to be the first to put want to put a Fifteen in when you do as well as I Do on the Internet is going to be fine you could damage your car you know of of a faster you could damage your lawn mower faster if you use e Fifteen mhm right that it should just be ten percent should be the max and putting Fifteen Percent\nIs is just ridiculous so nobody's going to do it\nSo it's just the way the president's just trying to appease people without doing anything\nIt's trying to appease the farm but you can't get there from here because there is no great motivator there really is no incentive even with changing how the credits work\nDied or news talk six thirty and Ninety nine seven FM W.

Westwood One meteorologist John ... who joins us live right now good morning John ...\nGood morning guys so yeah we're looking at the possibility now of a major hurricane a a a hurricane at the level free or above that's greater than one hundred ten miles an hour hitting a in in about twenty four hours from now\nWhat's changed over I guess a late Sunday and into Monday the forecast seem to change and showed the potential for the energy increasing in Michael what what was it that we were looking at or I guess you guys were looking at a that showed that change\nYeah well one of the things that are well a couple of things that will slow down a hurricane would be a wind shear we don't have that one of the things that will slow down a hurricane would be colder ocean temperatures we don't have that or lessening of low pressure none of the\nNone of the data that we'd like to see that we'll see uh lessening of strength is a is a part of this particular forecast now so uh that's where we are getting this rapid intensification as we move from a category one to a major category ... storm\nJohn where do you see it hitting on the Florida Panhandle cause most\nLike talking about yeah we're talking about the Big Bend area somewhere between the Appalachian coal at which was down on a state road Ninety eight over to um oh just north of saint Petersburg let's say but we're going to see some road closures definitely guys will see I ten affected from Pensacola to Tallahassee\nWe could see sections of by Seventy five shut down the right to in the Georgia or Florida line area so are truckers are going to play an important role in this thing getting supplies in and out of the region there'll be needs for diesel fuel and some rebuilding efforts\nYou know with Florence we talked about the reign of at this will be a rain event\nAnd a wind event uh we're looking at the possibility of up to twelve inches of rain all within less than a twenty four hour period of time in that Big Bend area\nWhat about storm surge what is the threat there big time\nOr we're looking at a storm surge and a wave heights in and around the\nFive to twelve foot range with a a major category three storm so that's going to have its impact certainly coastal erosion will see folks with a coastal interest or with a maritime industry and folks with homes along the region affected\nSo will definitely see some storm surge effect\nAnd I don't believe we have a full moon right now but if we did that would increase the likelihood of being under a higher tide certainly inundation being grader\nAt this uh Michael's moving quicker though than Florence it's a fast moving hurricane\nYes just slightly faster so it's expected to a move into that area and make landfall as I mentioned in the Big Bend area we're looking right now about eight to nine o'clock tomorrow morning and um [noise]\nOr just a hope that everyone hates the warnings is we've got several I mean we're talking thirty six counties I think now they're under a some sort of a advisory either get out\nOr get ready to get out and of course the state of Florida it's been under the state of emergency now for uh about twenty four hours\nAs we look forward to later in the week we mentioned Florence our friends still in recovery mode after Florence what can they expect in terms of rainfall that might affect him later this week\nYeah we'll see this system move right on up through Georgia and then into portions of South Carolina and particularly southern uh North Carolina so not good news for folks trying to dry out in any of that area from South Carolina into North Carolina\nUh we'll see not the twelve inches but certainly are between three and five inches of rain but we got to remember those\nThose are creeks and rivers are swollen there the ground is already saturated so any amount of water not good for the Carolinas\nWestwood One meteorologist drawn trout and gotten thank you so much for your time we appreciate it you got guys\nOr John Will be on that for us in the in the coming days of course in a well keeping it will be keeping us posted a lot going on there of course in Florida we just want to

seeing an increase in hurricanes\nCurrent data sets indicate no significant observed trends in global tropical cycle frequency over the past century ... Mr lumberjack said we're seeing an increase in hurricane cost\nBecause we hear that all the time right well the warming I mean look at the hurricane costs hurricane costs are more than they've ever been before and he says we're seeing an increase in hurricane cost not because of climate change but because more people with more well living in harm's way ...\nNoting that the U.S population roast four fold over the past\nCentury he said declined fifty fold in coastal areas the areas hit by Hurricane Florence had fewer than eight hundred thousand\nHomes in Nineteen forty now eleven point three million a one thousand three hundred and twenty five percent increase homes are bigger now and they hold many more expensive possessions adjusted for population and wells\nUs hurricane damage has not increased since Nineteen hundred global whether damage as a percent of global GDP actually fell from Nineteen hundred to twenty Seventeen ...\n\nSo and I always like I said I I like going to him because he is somebody who believes he can quantify but he says he believes that that global warming is happening and man has you know something to do with it but doesn't know you know what percentage but he's as you said you can't stop the economy's\nYou can't put people into mass of poverty you can't do these insane things that the left is is they need to do people have to have a quality of life so much you have to do is\nYou have to prevent you've gotta you've you've got to do the preventative things that you need to be doing but everything that the left his too when he criticizes as being absolutely ridiculous well and and that's again\nThe proposals over the years have been a remember the former governor of Oregon saying uh we need to uh essentially a decrease the economy and I forget what the number was but it was in ...

table how about the scientists\nThat are on both sides of this have the discussion with the ... the problem with that as the politically driven the very motivated politically driven agenda inside of that to the extent that Al Gore by the way\nWhy in the world was she telling the UN and why why is anyone even listening to Al Gore who admitted back in two thousand ten that he lied about about

a and a talking about the Washington Post saying that the president President Trump is complicit ... and and he's and he said you're studying uh twenty six team in the Stanford law review that said\nWe call a shooting in September fifteenth and sixteenth Wall Street\nWeekend edition columnist homeland Jenkins we've quoted him a lot and contrasted an archaeological study of the first century\nA de Germans who raised dwelling mountains and built dikes\nIn response to rising sea and storm blood levels\nHe compared to what the us response of rushing him with federal dollars to rebuild so the next storm will always have something bigger and more expensive to knock down ... setting a twenty six team studying the Stanford law review that said we call weather related catastrophes natural natural disasters but the losses are often do to questionable government policies\nYou said Congress struggled for years to reform the national flood insurance program and it's turned it into a perverse subsidies for coastal development\nHe quoted Bob sheets then head of the national Hurricane Center saint after Nineteen Seventy nine hurricane Frederick\nIt was like an urban renewal program out there he said that the uh twenty Fifteen a A R worldwide and insurance consultancy said climate change it's not climate change but the growing number and value of coastal properties has the largest factor impacting hurricane risk today a whopping Seventeen trillion\nIn property now exist inside the U.S storm surge zone\nWhere is Al Gore when you need to be continued All right to climate change crowd has become enamored\nOf coastal development because it creates a constituency for doing something about climate change well not exactly for doing something about climate change but for throwing more money at coastal dwellers and calling them victims of climate change for the benefit of generating media coverage\nOf climate politics yeah wow yeah no that's a ... or ... genius why why why it altogether\nBecause think about what that what what is done\nYou know if you if you look at that and and that's that's what happens if you look at those you know the the wealth that was created\nUm and is very much displayed on those coasts with people that have the homes and I mean if you've got a beach house think about the value of a beach house right what's that would be now think about what it takes\nTo replace that right\nNot just insurance but then there has to come after the insurance there has to come public aid inevitable well the left has used that uh and the emotion behind that because who doesn't want to help\nWell then it is okay this is because this is happening because of climate change\nAnd so not only will we again continue the public aid that's not going to go away but on the other side of that it's to poor public money into and tax greatly\nThe American people based on the theory of man made climate change which is to say oh I don't know we'll start with forty or fifty bucks a gallon tax will start with and that that won't be the end of the tax I mean if you if you look at it there'll be tax and this is why they wanted\nYou know that it's not necessarily because of climate change it's because you can you can implement the taxation\nAt levels before the retail level\nIt becomes a compounding tax like the vat tax this is the kind of policy that they want until you have a centrally tax the poor especially in the middle class because those are the groups that are affected immediately and greatest\nThen they become what even more dependent on government\nAnd they quote Holleman Jenkins from the wall Street Journal here factoring in social economic demographics of the population on the Atlantic and Gulf Coast said Mr lumber damage by future hurricanes will only increase because the population is greater and wealthier and there may be more deaths sane vulnerability is the main hurricane problem facing the United states\nWe should not allow so many houses to be built on flood plains or coastlines we should insist on higher building standards and increased wetlands\nTo handle flooding we should stop federal insurance subsidies and encourage building in vulnerable areas and mentioning that every news site in cable news channel will be promoting heroin and heroic stories about Hurricane Florence\nMr home and said major storms have become events they afford great footage which feeds of false sensation viewers at storms have become more frequent and more powerful meanwhile tragedies befall Americans every day for which the federal government does not shower them with aid because CNN is not present\nHe might also have said connecting extreme weather the climate change to encourage carbon production is today's falls mantra declaring practical steps towards living rationally a A R possible he said they could begin with Congress qualifying for the American people\nWatch their forking over annually to entice fellow citizens to live near the beach\n[laughter] so um\nI just you know interesting the actual politics of it but you know and and we will probably you know hear it

cover something that we didn't get a chance to cover really for the last couple of weeks because\nOf the capital nomination confirmation\nOr a the demonization but let's talk about the Justin Bieber story what is that going on at that young man\nBy the way I see I have seen the picture everywhere isn't it amazing though how you see like I've seen his picture and it's like I don't care so I don't even read the headline yeah and so I don't know I don't even know what's going on with them even though I Know something is going on with\nI have no idea okay I've seen the pictures I notice hairs longer these days that's all I Know\nUh the the only thing I Do know that like over the weekend if you weren't talking the capital nomination mhm\nUh is on social media at least the women I Know it was all a star is born they were all guy got over ...\nOh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and then he had almost a U.S she fight where one out of control in the fight and everything else that was oh I I didn't see that part I don't see neither do I just but no but it just it filtered right it filtered into my world and the Lady Gaga and a star lower wait a minute I actually would be could be coming into my world or yeah just I\nI did see some of these things it was a ten second clip that involve day in the ring after fight yes question by Joe Rogan and I can't repeat the answer [laughter]\nAre other things that that we've gotten emails on ...\nA lot of people very very concerned a lot of our listeners yeah ... are very concerned saying you know ... what's going on with the fights a warrant thing it just disappeared what happened and what we did covered a couple of times ... or you know over the last\nCouple of weeks but just to just to go over it again so\nBut he knows and maybe do it in a little bit more detail here where we can spend a little bit more time on it\nOr the the president or was going to declassify\nA roughly Twenty one pages including the Pfizer application and\nAnd at the last minute before releasing it he decided not to and he didn't release it because he said uh there were some of our allies that did not wish us to release it\nSo he wasn't going to do it yet when we read it we thought OK they what are they trying to do figure out of some of the classified information should stay out\nIn ... or ... should than they need to read that more and that's was I think our original thought and then the president said I'm going to give it to further review to the inspector general of the department of justice Michael Horowitz\nWell we immediately said wait a minute and even Devin Nunes is like the day after said you know I I don't know why they won't release it and then we thought\nTo ourselves well wait a minute and this is the least covered story in America right now I think ...\nThe least the the lady made hunger about I read or radio exclusively [laughter] have the but he's not covered by possibly the most important story in all of this over the last two years is that the president\nBecause he said and we were at and what a couple of stories said it was Great Britain because of Christopher steals involvement in it but some of our allies did not want us to a release sitting there were a couple of other things that needed to go over so he was going to give it to the inspector general for further review\nNow we were initially for the first day little dumbfounded golden couldn't understand why it was going to him\nAnd on the air this is going back ten or eleven days as you and I were discussing why were to go to the inspector general an off the subject was\nDoug that's the role of the inspector general is to do what\nIs to investigate corruption there it's the you don't give it to the inspector general to save review this and tell me what I can release and what I can uh you know what I can unwritten pact you you that for that you use\nYour a director of national intelligence your CIA director and uh your your uh a secretary of state it was a former CIA director those are the people you would go to for the for for that maybe your national security director now you know the secretary of defense\nThose are the people you would go to\nTo to decide at least in my opinion whether you should declassify it or not and I say you're secretary of state former CIA director because they claim that some allies or didn't want some things to be released in our initial thing was wait a minute what are their allies no they don't know what's in their right how how do they know that\nAnd we were initially puzzled when he said he was going to give it to ah the inspector General Michael Horowitz until we realize\nThey were they ... that it went whoa look at this\nBut yeah the conclusion we came to was that if you were looking if you're looking to give this to the inspector general the apartment of justice then you're basically asking him to do an investigation and to issue a report they said they're experts they asked for an expedited process here from Mr Horwitz\nIf he has a clich s trucking as it is\nA long way to fly by Cooky junkie\n[noise] find out what makes progressive the number one

or let's go back to the ... for those who do for those of you who may not know ... the declaration of independence was not signed in Nineteen Seventy three ... know\nEveryone knows that was Nineteen Seventy ... ended the constitution was ratified [laughter] and I thought I'm going to get an email in Nineteen Seventy three\nAh look this is this is it's quite simple ... we debate over things and here's what we debate what what came when you were if you want to look and simplify it and just do a couple of words you know\nIn in a very short sentence what we were what we were dealing with the left basically said if you believe in due process you believe in the rape of women\nMhm that's really what mhm\nThat was what the left which dating to us that's unacceptable that was ... when you say things like that Denver fighting words well do you do yeah those are words that up those are words that get people upset it is a charge\nToo when when you make it at ... and it was made by Democrats\nAnd\nBecause the simple thing is people upset I because I Believe in due process does not mean I don't sympathize with ... with a with rape or sexual assault survivors of course I Do but I also believe in due process under the law and you can do both and\nThe ... was attempting to tell you that you must always believe the woman oh come on that's ridiculous and everybody knows it you judge each and every ... ... ... each and every\nThing that comes along by the evidence in that particular incident that's the only way that we can do it in America it's well known when people come out and said the constitution be damned you're going to create a lot of banks\nAre and and em remember more the yanks was coming from their side demanding that you were jak\nThe spirit of the constitution that you were jak the presumption of innocence and then the allegation that was thrown\nThat if you believe in due process than you believe in rape and sexual assault well sorry a Robert Redford I don't know how you would act\nIn that case but then again you're not being specific enough you're trying to you and this is I I dealt with people you've dealt with people like this before the people that say well I'm going to take the high ground in say civility in law for everyone and blah blah blah blah blah you're a coward\nAnd\nAnd I say you're a coward because the the people that aren't are the ones that say no I'm going to stand up for what's right I'm going to stand up for the constitution the United states I'm going to stand up for a presumption of innocence I'm going to stand up\nAnd say that and and and reject somebody who says that because I Believe in due process of the law that I Am somehow a supporter of rape and sexual assault I'm going to stand up for it and I'm going to bigger recently attack those who put out such a ... foot\n[noise] well you know to this comment or when he talks about fighting it out to the bitter end you mean November ninth\nOkay wanting sixteenth [laughter] the day after the election because let's let's talk about bitter\nLet's talk about the reaction that started a actually late that night but I mean if you think about the election wasn't cold until November night or so technically it started [laughter] November night but you could see the faces being made among the evening of November rate\nWill split those hairs later but the whole bitter rent thing\nSay what you will about this current president and I'm sure he has Mr Redford but the whole thing with pretty much every day since he was elected\nAnd not on the issues but on something that no one can identify\nThere hasn't been one crime identified\nIn connection with Trump his campaign anyone in his campaign and the ... the Russians on the twenty sixteen election not one event we have a\nBig growing pile of evidence that that shows us and no one debate that the Democrats and the Hillary campaign through their law firm\nHired fusion GPS to get on verified salacious information from the Russians and then used that\nTo petition for and ultimately got in October of twenty sixteen a warrant on a member of the Trump campaign let's discuss bitter and Mr Redford\n[noise] well I I just I get a kick out of it because I I Do believe people lack courage\nWhen they they try to sell you the propaganda\nThat I'm rise above all of this and I'm call calling for love for between everybody and to stop all of the ... and the anger and the the the bitterness without directly addressing an issue to me\nThat is the height of wimpy and this is not willing to actually look stand up for what you believe in if you believe it's right in just defended and get specific about it but don't throw me this crap and not get it all the time I Know a couple of\nOf a Facebook friends would do it I'm going to rise above all of this no you're not\nWell simply let me ask you Mr Redford I'm or was it rising above when the Democrats out to Dr Ford\nOr was it rising above when chairman Grassley decided that they were going to delay the process and give Dr Ford in front of the American people or even behind closed doors that was her choice\nTo issue her concerns and make her claim officially\nWas it bitter wasn't divisive\nWhen the president himself decided he would order an additional background check on Kavanaugh delaying it even further was that divisive\nOr when Bernard Goldberg wrote the book by us he talked about the elites uh in in the media in Hollywood and everything else that believe they're not part of either side\nThey just believe that they are part of the absolute right ... you know that they just believe that they're right in everything than their opinion is above everyone else that in essence that's why you called them the elite because they believe they're on a higher plane of consciousness\nWhere oh we just call for civility and the way that we think and just follow what we do and everything will be\nOkay so they don't provide Redford here for example doesn't have to get specific\nHe just puts out this general statement we know where he stands\nEverything where he stands is is a ... addressed you know is meant for the Republicans and he's not insulting the Democrats here and everybody knows that but he doesn't have the guts to say it\nRight\nWell because he talks on these generalities that are straight from Hollywood script\nWithout without going on detail by detail a mission to say what was done wrong in this process I can tell you what was done wrong in this process and it's by the side that you support but you aren't big enough to actually stand up\nAnd say it Robert Redford in this instance Taylor Swift has more guts than you do\nWell I mean right now [laughter] um that little a speech you gave a statement that you made Mr Redford ah we just to make sure that a river runs\nThrough it and it's very clear now that it didn't even hold up to the water test but BS rarely does it's a good

national Hurricane Center another update on the way in less than twenty five minutes and we'll bring you the latest as we get it at our meteorologist or John trout is on that\nStory of course and we'll be following the storm or in the coming days so I'm again or advice please heed the warnings of follow the advice and instructions by\nLocal authorities in state authorities there in Florida as this is a very dangerous storm life threatening in terms of ah all elements of this storm storm surge flooding from rains and wins a all combined expecting over twelve inches in those areas where the\nWhere the hurricane or when was overland right yeah yes and and and and then later in the week bringing\nA some rain that they don't need to areas that are still recovering from\nFrom Florence because the ground as John pointed out earlier John trout are pointed out earlier that it is already saturated there in those areas that were affected by Florence and any rain or is just going to

... of the judge Kavanaugh the hearings and and the the ... the confirmation and everything that has gone on\nThe all the different uh allegations all of a sudden we got to Monday yesterday and I woke up and it was there is nothing\nIt was almost like a big exhale where it's like okay and where do we get on the axe we need a day to figure out where the news goes because it wasn't really a big news day right of a a yesterday and it's when I came to the thought where\nI said what's the issue for Democrats with everything that you and I discussed over the last two years I\nActually woke up yesterday thinking\nWhat are the Democrats have right\nWhat are they going to you besides impeachment you know what is ... you know what is the issue thinking about this or we went through and and even just just before we got to the Capitol nomination it was still know Mahler investigation Trump illusion you and I I I remember ah\nThe ah the was it the the the Thursday or the ... the Thursday or the friday when when Chuck Todd said you better not miss work tomorrow that had to be like what was\nThat right right around Labor Day that was the friday heading into Labor Day we ... and ... and that was because you know Mueller's going to let the investigation nobody's even talking about rushing collusion no it's not on anybody's radar it seems like that was\nTen years ago and that's how fast the the cycle has has moved you know what is on people's minds and so when I woke up yesterday I started thinking what are Democrats thinking the issue is what's the issue that they can go after Trump out what's the issue that will even grab Democrats right now to say oh\nYeah okay that's the issue you and I talked about the fact that the un coming out and saying OK it's time for our annual we're doomed to update because of global warming\nAnd we're thinking of the Democrats going to jump on that they've been jumping on that since the beginning of the Obama administration that end race on a consistent basis and so I was looking at your earlier and saying I'm waiting for the race baiting to start some time by the end of the week because it's been their old standbys just what they've always use now even though at the same time the American people have said\nWe don't care yeah we don't believe those are the top issues we don't believe race relations\nOr the top issue we believe we get along with each other really well are you folks in Washington may not and you people that belong to certain groups or or you know or may not but for the most part we get along and global warming
