S. new pay you're going to pay because of the tariff right and then the producer at the domestic producer of a similar product because part of it is protectionism\nThen they're going to raise their prices because you know they're being hurt so they're justified in raising their prime because they can and because they can and all they have to be as a pending cheaper than the foreign product\nTo be competitive\nTell me tell me why that's a positive\n\nAh we had stated that are all along and I do think that again the uncertainty because still today Congress completely silent mhm uh on the uh trade deal formerly known as NAFTA mhm\nUh a steel tariffs aluminum tariffs which adds to the base cost of how many thousands tens of thousands of products out there which as we've seen in a and I don't know I haven't seen an update on it we know that in the first half of the year steel was forty percent\nMhm uh we know that the trade agreement formerly known as NAFTA does not cover steel and aluminum and until there is a deal the tariffs from what I Know unless they have made exceptions to the ruins and some of those cases still remain with\nCanada and Mexico so you know we stayed at when we looked at the you know when when we looked at the the trade deal formerly known as NAFTA but the most part they're really much isn't much of a difference\nAh you you know the I saw especially on social media Trump promised to rewrite NAFTA yeah he did a little bit but he didn't do anything that he planned that he said he was going to do which was I'm going to reduce one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit\nRight that this that this isn't going to do it there were little winds here or there the problem with the the new trade deal as we said that will be a long term problem is\nAnd the president views it as a victory is raising the cost or to buy a car in Mexico the United states and Canada making it more expensive to produce the car therefore making it more expensive to buy a car and making it\nLess likely that the president one of the president's number one goal which is to be able to produce products here and sell them overseas has just been flushed down the toilet because\nIt's going to be more expensive to manufacture vehicles here which is exactly the opposite if you wish to sell them overseas right\nIt's the one thing they're ...\nThey're a couple of things but it's really the one major thing where I have no idea where the president stands on it as\nWe know he has changed his mind on he'll change his mind on on trade in a week they'll go from as he did one for me in a complete protection is just sounded like a total free trader I've no idea where he really stands\nI Do know though that in this in the the uh trade deal formerly known as NAFTA that he viewed what he did to raise the price of buying a car and producing a car in\nNorth America he put that as as his number one victory mhm which we have said that's what drives us crazy that's why we're tariffs babies [laughter] the original ... the original ... babies as the president said now you know something we you know we laugh at it I Wonder how many farmers were\nLaughing at that comment though well because the you know he talks about protecting the farmers in the move on ethanol which was not a mandate and likely will have little if any impact because the the the the the fuel producers don't don't want it they don't want the higher blend\nThe it it may sound like a good deal to be able to\nUh sell a Fifteen in the summer first of all here comes a lawsuit here comes a lawsuit here comes a lawsuit um but\nIt will the but even because at the refinery level you don't have to do the special summer blend\nBut when there's no market for it than there would be a ... a glut of the product\nAnd for the consumer that temporarily ... might be a good thing but the point is we're not going to get to eat Fifteen with out a mandate and he knows politically outside of the corn belt\nYou can't get that done it too so but appeasing farmers and and using that politically on on the ah on the terrorists and then they came back and said well we're going to give you billions of dollars to help you which you just admitted it's hurting them to that extent and they came back and said\nThat's a tiny number compared to\nWhat we what we are losing and the fact that we're losing the ability to be in that supply chain and once we lose that and we're not dependable in that world supply chains are going to go somewhere else and so it's not just well the tariffs hurt us until they were lifted it's the fact that we may never get back in those markets again because\nThese countries don't know when you'll use national emergency or trade deal\nYou know or or the the the fact of of ah we need to get a you know a new trade deal or whatever\nTo to uh to\nTo terrify you're not an double anymore you're not a consistent supply chain exactly and that is a problem that the you have but ah you know we noticed that you know it was obvious that President used the greatest victory\nAnd that's the weird thing on trade to begin with countries always talk about their trade victories and their trade victories were always when their citizens have to pay more money for goods and services right we don't know how that's a victory\nRight we can't figure that one out here's one thing or to media asked that question mhm\nYeah I mean as an when when you look at it and you know you talk about the supply chain Canada saying you know or Mexico saying they're going to go to Canada and work out a deal you know for pork\nOr as we call it Canadian Bacon and the when they set up that supply chain if they're happy with that agreement why did they go back to the U.S for\nWhat would they are with any of those products from a domestic producer if you believe that the government is going to step in and disrupt that process then you're going to make another long term deal elsewhere with someone else but we said\nThis during the you know the um during the permit tore them after the uh when when the Gulf spill happened\nThe BP thing that\nThat whole thing where you had companies are producers from uh the U.S saying well we can you know go somewhere else if we're going to do offshore drilling and you're not going to give us a permit back you know we can go somewhere else you don't just make that decision short term right\nAnd so you're you're gonna have to make long term plans because you can't deal with you know the the shift in policy\nUh you know on a ...\nAt the staff of finger and and frankly the ethanol thing is to become you know the for the ethanol farmers\nThat's one thing but you look at the entire farming community and I'm Talking to political you know support if they're hurt going into ... and this is what we haven't been able to gauge\nYou go to Iowa I mean and\nFor those people that the New York times of listening when you go to Iowa let me describe before Iowa is is this state in the middle of the country\n\nBut when you go there it is all connected to farming just like Texas has oil directly or indirectly\nI mean that is the driver there when you go to the to the the farm belt that's everything what's the impact right now of terrorists politically\nVote for Republicans and in twenty twenty ... at the midterm this year and in twenty twenty for the president and his reelection because keep in mind they may support Republicans who aren't on board for terrorists this time and twenty Eighteen at the midterms\nAre they going to support the president who owns it completely if it's still ongoing in twenty twenty\nSurprised by what happened the last couple of days you know you and I talked about it that and we said look the big terrorists were hit on September twenty eighth mhm so I'm not ...\nI said when you look at you know steel and aluminum and how they have skyrocketed since the beginning of the year right and we said look eventually it's gonna be a point where the market's going to say look you're raising prices too uh too much and when the terrorists went into effect on September twenty eight\nDiscovering that

O.\nBona show [noise]\nIt's running radio he's our country and I'm during ... eight six six Ninety right I well ... and a good morning\nOr so happy to uh have you with us here\nSo I'm there you go there you have it [noise]\nSo the stock market tumbling over a a five hundred points ... uh yesterday bringing the two day\nA loss totals to more than Thirteen hundred a points so there you go\nYeah I'm\nTaking a look at the uh overnight markets and a a globally and it looks like a against being down too as well around the around the world how long lived\nIs that it is the president's a trip as he announced on a Thursday morning it was going to try and go into China mhm right\nSo how long is a I guess this going to to last that the market you what you're looking at is earnings reports ... ten percent drop was based on what happened to them and the third quarter in that situation has not changed at this point\nOr because they they talked about three or dynamics there and that's raw materials a freight\nUh and and the and oil costs um\nIf the president gets to China they get a deal done on terrorists\nI was just a it was just\nReading something it at Business Insider talking about the uh what is going on right now with\nA you know with China their exports to the U.S continue for the most part even with the terrorists in place they say they're still moderately strong well\nIt doesn't change the the trade deficit right a scenario is is not likely to change it wasn't going to change with the new NAFTA you know so that that thing is kind of off the table\nBut with China you have a couple of concerns the the very valid concern is the intellectual property consider mhm that's the real thing that the president has to address I mean the tariffs thing is going to\nUp to be remedied but it's going to they're going to have to there's going to have to be and it's not just pressure from the U.S when the ... when the president announced that he was going to or it was announced that the president would be going to try to sit down with a G n China\nWell that's we need everybody at that table on our side of the table the rest of the world needs to be in China's face saying this can't happen anymore you got to play by the rules\nThe\nBecause of the ... if you look at the the steel and aluminum tariffs if those are in place long term you're going to see you're going to see an adjustment on the stock market the stock market is the least of your concerns\nThe reason it's adjusting as because\nThings are becoming more expensive like you mentioned uh the fed with interest rates\nAre the the you know I agree or disagree the sanctions on Iran is is causing a lot of the global uh oil prices to to go up or the Saudis have some play in that too yes and we'll see if they ramp up production and and and enabled and change that and it is an incentive\nUh uh again because it makes it more profitable for American producer yes and and were eventually going to get to that point I Believe\nI well it depends on\nWho's in Washington but I Believe we will get to the point of self sufficiency where you know we can produce for the United states and export at the same time which is a which will be a great point a to a to get to we're not there yet but as we the ... really one of the most under reported stories\nOf the entire year ... is that the United states\nIs now and it happened about three weeks ago became the number one producer of oil in the world mhm\nYeah um and and this is it I mean you if you put in place all the things of a ... that will make an economy great again [laughter] um and they did\nBy the way I think that's the number one reason icon is supporting a uh the uh the the president his tax bill went way way down\n[laughter] but um the you know the [laughter]\nThat'd be enough for me [laughter] it's not the case for me though mine went up a but but the line to you that right\nSo the but but you put in place all of those

to kill old people but which site is it that says oh people should go home and die\nWe're not gonna you know afford all the technology and medications were going to send you home so you can die that was Robert Reich ... almost verbatim what he told Berkeley years ago and the former president Brock Obama again saying the same thing\nThey don't care about the fact that\nElderly people will suffer if you if you give Medicare for all first of all you can't pay for it but I imagine you could pay for even part\nOr half of it again pure fantasy\nBut what would happen ultimately because you can't afford it it is going to affect the benefits of the old ...\nAnd\nThere's ... there's no way to debate that the question is does elect care about field\n\nWell Brock Obama and and Robert Reich ... one of his advisors a and a labor secretary for Clinton\nKnow old people should go home and die\n\nThat's the way they saw it so maybe they don't care I don't think they do but a Schumer needs\nTo say it

don't mean it all it was I'm telling you it was just beautiful we found that out the other thing we found out this week what did we learn from the left we're doomed run the un we're doomed\nBecause of

you've or like the Trump that these hurricanes are happening\n\nUh Los Angeles times wrote this quote\nThe reporter the un report serves as a stark reminder of President Trump's status as a global outlier in terms of climate change Trump has rejected the twenty Fifteen Paris Agreement signed by a hundred and Ninety five nations to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions exposing skepticism about\nHuman caused climate change and vowed to increase coal burning end up quote but as the more rights in an op ed piece of the New York post who is the political party who is the country and who under what President\n\nHas reduced greenhouse gas emissions but most when it comes to the substance who has actually reduced greenhouse gas emissions who is number one\nWas a candidate nope no nope Germany nope Australia nope France no the one\nCountry that pulled out of the pony Paris climate accord reduced its carbon emissions by ... percent the most of all major countries in the world the\nSo the rest of the ah the rest of the countries are joining homes\nUnited States has not we're not going to join the groups because they're signing it there because there's going to they're they're

people that actually voted in a way\nTo get the substance of how we go after our energy that actually voted or the policies that made it so we can produce energy\nWith lower greenhouse gas emissions which has nothing to do was signing the international agreement that everybody is cheating on and not getting to the levels that they say they're going to get to in fact the United states blows them away\nThe people that actually do the job and get the job done it\nAre viewed as the people that are destroying the world where all the scientific evidence shows you that they are not\n\nThat's where we're at today by the way the number two nation in the world and not a a big nation but the number two nation in terms of reducing uh they're they're a greenhouse gases and ah and such Venezuela\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter]\n[laughter] so there you go\nAnd um it's a it is but but that really is the insanity here's here's what I Wonder\n\nAre they are they getting through to the generations beyond this we know that the loudest of the left or the far left and the in your face left\nOr the um the protest or the go direct approach by the left\nWe know that they're you know not only buying the hype helping create the hype but I mean on on\nAll these issues that the left has been trying to sell like global warming the generation behind them\n\nAre ... you see sometimes indications that they're greater critical thinkers anecdotally mhm my my granddaughter's\nUm and and I I Try and step back and take my bias away you know and look at the facts you know in that situation as I assessed their generation the oldest of which is a is Thirteen ah and then there\nI have to twelve year olds as well so you know those those early teens that's when you start forming right opinions but you're very curious about how the world works and all of that and and so\nI I ask them questions about their friends you know just about behavior okay so you know I like social media is not is very different for them Twitter and Facebook not even on the radar not even\nBut also how things are presented to them\nYou know one one of my granddaughters a few years ago it was\nA it was they were they were showing a video on nine eleven\nAnd they had put sad music to it\nAnd then she asked me that following weekend when she was out the house but what do you think of that and I

yeah yeah we're down to\nA uh we'll be right at the two week mark which means uh early voting will be starting\nIn places and yeah you know you ... and by the way a our friend Rick Roberts will be here all week next week to uh have great conversations with you and then we'll be back a week from Monday but the\nThe polls if you start looking at the polls are and you know that the numbers in the house I mean I'm I'm ... it's\nIt really really really really I mean you know going up over you know hundreds of old there are some that are you know going to be blue with no doubt a there are some that are going to be read the thirty two RCB has thirty to\nEssentially\nA you know a ... that are in the middle undecided basically just yet it doesn't show the polls are neck and neck\nAnd does end did you see some of the amounts of the undecided you're talking ten eleven ... percent and that's a big deal did it and and the pollsters\nUm aren't as active in the house seats as as they are for the Senate um they will start seeing that but we haven't seen any polls\nPost capital\nWe don't make predictions but if you if you if you look at the number of toss ups as they call them on on our cp that's thirty two uh the the pole in those areas or you know it in those thirty two districts\nAre really going to start juggling things are showing something here probably by the time you and I get back from London\nWhen when I started thinking about somebody who was undecided today and again in a congressional race who knows but all I'm thinking is that if you've got ten to twelve percent that are undecided it means they're not driven by Trump hatred or Trump bluff right\nIt's not either of that that is driving then\nSo what is it that is what is it that is driving you know that you know that independent in that particular district and we're never going to get the specific poll polling on that lets pull the independence this congressional district to find out why they are undecided and what would change their vote\nRight would it be in their local congressman came out and said everything is free but by this time they've already seen a ton of political commercials so what is it that would push them over the edge to build a certain way especially if they're likely voters\nWhich means in all likelihood they're going to vote but they're still undecided at this moment what is it it's got to be an issue that's huge right yep and watch the hugest ... issue over the biggest issue over the last couple of weeks we'll be Kavanaugh I don't know if there will be a bigger issue\nThat that will come out in the in in the next few weeks in popular culture that will reach everybody Kanye West I [laughter] I'm Sorry just throw that out\nI I I just I don't know uh you know the the the president the president tweeting and the president coming out with outrageous comments to me doesn't drive anything anymore\nI don't I don't think it it I don't think it\nIn flames anybody knew or pleases anybody new\nIt's going to play in the same people and it's going to make the people that love when he'd ... when he does that still love him\nBut it's not going to change what's it think about it who can this day and age how can tend to twelve percent possibly be undecided and death and and most definitely be going to the polls\nIn November\nYeah it's really it's only when you think about that here's something else interesting looking at the end and it's just\nOne small indicator of small movement but I find it interesting looking at our sleepy and the map for the house race or the house races\nSo Republicans took one from the Democrats I haven't figured out which one it is but it was at two o five Democrats in other words likely very likely Democrats and one Ninety eight for Republicans it's now too old for for Democrats\nOne Ninety nine for Republicans and the center of the toss up district still remains at thirty two two yes\nBy would love to see what your district that was a that that that shifted and I and again not from toss up\nBut from the Democrats so I'll go back and look at it I I have no idea um but it is interesting so you but you do look at those started to keep in mind to Eighteen is the number the magic number a for a majority right so right now\nOnly Nineteen those thirty to need to go for uh the Republicans but even fewer uh fourteen only need to go for the Democrats\nHave you noticed a face rash have you been feeling tired experiencing joint pain or other symptoms if you've been feeling sick but still look healthy then you may have

going out they're fantastic how are you\nAll right yeah that direction I'm going what I go to the wedding where would I go to vote\nIs going to be the restoration of some show some some semblance of due process and the court of public opinion is going to have to be reined in at I think that's the Republican direction yeah\nThat's a great by now yeah\nNo I think it's a great point is that you say that you know the the the court of public opinion or isn't the final determination of of uh of of anything and and a quarter of a public opinion we're talking about on the left side of of of a public opinion and it has to be it has to be due process that's a very that's a\nYou know that that that's a great point that comes from the capital here it's yeah I I think it is and\nPeople apply it a\n... based on their their own life you know our ... our audience a and a ... and new sounds and and and people who do we do we're we're in the thick of it we're always immersed in it\nBut most people the average American is not but if they're still politically active in terms of voting they look at it and say okay\nThis this is you know insanity the fact that it went this way they don't uh apply the left believes that they apply their feelings directly to their feelings lead that is the case for some\nBut most Americans look at it practically speaking and going you know this is a big deal to vote to be able to vote was a big deal\nAnd if they are to the point where they are you know in that likely voter category this is why those polls start to shape up the way they do and that's why likely voter gives you a better read but they look at that and go you know it's a big deal on election day to get up and go cast my vote\nYou know I Know people show up and they're driven by you know a slogan they're driven by whatever imagery\nBut we can't forget the people that take it very serious they consider things they may not be immersed in it every day like we are for whatever reason\nBut they will show up and they make an informed decision and often it is a reaction Chuck Todd on a with a bottle\nAnd and Chuck Todd was saying well why do people get it wrong in and say twenty sixteen was a referendum on Trump but it really was a referendum on Hillary that was a small part of it what what Chuck Todd as we're getting here because they are discussing the polls\nThe mid term is is about you know the house and Senate and not a presidential election and his point what he was implying that Hillary's not here to be the the bad guy right\nWell what Chuck is forgetting is the real facts of how the Republicans in districts all over America\nOutperformed Trump and that it wasn't a referendum on Hillary it was a referendum on the left ... you know that that's a great point of the other point brought by the caller there and and I think you can't underestimate this is that Americans may not know the three branches of government right uh\nYou know and and that's what the poll shows Seventy five percent of Americans roughly could not tell you all three branches of government they might know one or two or late in zero but they couldn't tell you all three as you said you need to know all three to understand how the government actually works they may not be able to tell you the freedoms and the first amendment but think about when it comes to due process\nThink about since Perry Mason let's go through all the lawyer shows that have been that had been on TV ... battle salt [laughter] ... up well I'll Try I'll drop Perry Mason I'll throw up Matt like I'll throw

is enough\nIf you actually ask them off the record if they believe that they would tell you know why that is bad is just think about that in not just in the courtroom if you've ever been in a jury but it is they're completely in our popular\nCulture shock for me ... ... and it's a great point because you don't have to get into the details of how legislation worked for no the three branches of government don't but in pop culture we got we got those and yes they are simple lessons\nFor the simple lessons can be enough to recognize when the process is being distorted\nFor they attempt to

this is really interesting here because\nYou you\nApply this I guess it ... you you broaden out right to the other is thirty two or well together thirty one because it's about this district for the twenty seven\nIs one of those and they are cp toss up a category a of a total of thirty two right now toss up\nBut you are you're going to start seeing that momentum ... in one direction or the other and we're going to start seeing the real numbers here over the next couple of weeks as more of those undecideds\nMove those who you're it's so funny the undecided ultimately are the insiders [laughter] right [laughter] people who can't make up their mind yet will finally make up the mind and and when the election for one or the other I mean that's that's how it works right mhm but it the\n... here's what you ask yourself you as you pointed out\nOften different than a than a Senate race because\nSenate race a you know covers an entire state and if you to look at a at a state like a Texas for instance or Florida and the Senate race then it becomes a very different um the\nThe the Washington politics comes into it and the Senate race but not always in the district I mean you really have to it's it's a real boots on the ground effort and the district well I just wonder if uh sell us our\nIs using in her ads the fact that Donna Shalala was the president of the Clinton Foundation from twenty Fifteen to twenty Seventeen now I don't even know if that would have any effect on a congressional race to begin with I don't even know if that's important to people anymore I don't look the Russian collusion\nNobody's talking about it that's gone after that issue being pounded the American public for two years straight\nYou know what else has gone gone this district Hillary won yes ... on the national scale\nPeople on the left have to admit it was their chance to vote for and remember there was always a Ninety five percent chance she was going to win\nThey thought they were going to be part of history it really wasn't about Hillary for some it was about being able to say I helped to elect and put into office the first woman president\nThat driver is gone I mean there's no presidents were waste here but but the the point being you look at the districts that she won and things have changed for Trump in some areas but it's based on something\nAnd it's based on his you know so far short history is president but very active short history\nAs president and it's not based on end and think about it\nOr the euphoria of created by the first black president cannot be denied by the way it's not Bill Clinton bronco bonnet that euphoria that was there\nWe even had someone that we knew you and I are mutual friend that said but you know you look at it and and it was a it was that cool feeling this person is a conservative didn't vote for Barack Obama but was basically drawn into that euphoria\nAnd we always said well wait a minute you have the
