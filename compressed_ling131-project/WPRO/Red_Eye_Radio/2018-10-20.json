the ... by the way one or the other things I mentioned last night\nThe lessons very good at slogans right so hoping change right Obama had hope and change how could you argue with hope and change\nYou have to it's much more complex to explain our position wait a second\nOr you always for change and I'll ask my students or you know or you happy when you're younger and your parents are decided they were moving and they didn't ask you how 'bout that change or how about a change you know the take away your car not every change is good but hope and change sounds fantastic\nSo those on our side or off and on the defensive even though as I said they're playing the obvious the most recent case being parents with children trying to get asylum and you know why mentioning because it's happening now but I'll get that in a minute\nSeeking asylum and President Trump and Republicans accused of ripping children of course there's the help of the media ripping children from their mother's arms and putting these children in cages\nNever mind that this was started under the bottom and missed ration\nPresident Trump and Republicans are on the defensive never mind that if the parents of these children this is crucial but Yardley ever heard the parents of these children didn't come to the border and the first place there would be no issue\nNo one force them to come here they made a voluntary choice and we have a right to our sovereignty and to protect our borders and to decide who is welcome to enter just like\nWe do with our homes this was so obvious it's incredible that we have to explain our position but again\nThere's a simple right how can you you know you're ripping away from the parents how could you do that and we're on the other side having to explain things like what are coming here legally means why that's not acceptable\nBut the left and the Democrats and the media likely do not believe in having us you know our sovereignty but rather they believe in open borders\nBut they don't like to admit that because they know they would lose the argument\nWhich is why they would rather talk about tearing children out of their mother's arms is really bad they get to set the debate and the terms of the debate when the media's on their side because no one's questioning them with comments like I'm throwing out there and they you know\nNever mind that when anyone does something illegal and they're hauled off to jail their children do not go with them to jail boys that a big one\nThat is a huge one you'll never see it when you know in the in the last time this happened and it's going to happen again with these hunters ah Honduras refugees coming you know seeking asylum that's going to happen very shortly whenever they get here\nYou get to stay with your kid who hid you can use the same phrase oh she was found guilty of robbery first degree robbery and but our child was ripped out of her arm you never hear the media say that but that's what happens in effect\nThere also and so to speak torn away from them why isn't it said and I was just indicated the latest reincarnation of this conflict is is a news hundreds of Hondurans are heading for the U.S border in a mass migration to seek asylum\nSo again President Trump and the Republicans will be on the defensive just because they want to defend our borders and the media will again show crime children and distraught mothers you know what's gonna happen\nBut no one is forcing them to come here and we have a right to decide who gets to enter our house and under what circumstances\nAmong other things we have a right this is pretty obvious to it seems to me to protect the American people from harm where the from terrorism or disease we don't know the terrorists aren't coming through our\nOpen border or disease or we checking for diseases like we used to know or eat while he's had to say come here and Russian or even fat matter this was important people don't talk about this\nTo make sure that people who come here share our values\nAnd just about every country does this including our neighbor immediately to the south of Mexico good try the same thing down there\nSome of us think this is also obvious but there have been huge forces arrayed against this common sense\nThe Democrats want more votes they will tell you that they they know illegal immigrants vote for them in huge numbers and the country club Republicans for lack of better name they want cheap labor so you have a newspapers like the wall Street Journal I I stopped subscribing to it when they would have their editorials and it would talk about immigration in the title\nAnd then I mean they say illegal immigration the title and some are in the middle they would just sit switched immigration oh immigration has been a great for America over the years how could you you're in Iowa list right how could you oppose this this is insane but they would switch on us even though they pretend to talk about illegal immigration in the title\nOf course the Republicans are also the stupid party that's my party than like knowledge ring that so you have people like George W. Bush and Karl Rove saying things like boy we can get this vote George W. Bush got up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote in Texas wonderful\nI'm not a math major but that seems like a formula for defeat\n... Lawson politics by the way politics in particular a loss of sixty percent of forty percent is huge and that is based on an optimistic assumption\nMost illegal immigrants come here for jobs but they also take advantage of government hand that says we know that the rest of us are paying for and by the way the Republican Party can never out do the Democrats in offering benefits\nI uh I think I use this phrase years ago when a ever voters given a choice between Democrats and Democrats meaning larger Democrats they choose the original ones they will need us\nSo who these people going to vote for it's not that hard to figure out and if left unchecked the Republicans will never win a national election again\nSo even on a purely selfish basis it is clear that we need to control the border\nNot to mention fairness what do you say to the people around the world who've been waiting many years I've heard of people waiting a decade to get here but I have to undergo long waits an incessant paperwork to even have a hope of getting here\nSo they have to follow the rules but those who dashed across the border do not\nWhich is why a border wall make sense among other tools is not the only thing but it's one of the tools so one color of this week and if you didn't hear him suggests that border walls don't work in the long run\nAnd I said but even if that were true I bet they worked in the short run while we try to clean this mess up and have an orderly procedure coming to our country\nIf to me it's the same ridiculous logic that the defenders of illegals murdering innocent America's like Americans like aids finally use\nAnd I you know I pointed Geraldo Rivera because I watch them do a time and time again saying oh illegals commit crimes percentage wise you lower numbers the Native Americans as if\nThat matters who cares even if that's true if an American is killed or harmed by an illegal immigrant that person would not have been hurt if that illegal had been denied entry no matter what the percentage isn't that obvious and that wall by the way in Israel preventing Hamas for murdering Israel's Israelis is working the short run\nA lot of these arguments is baffling to me unless you realize they have no real argument unless you change the words and the terms\nI more to say to you but I Know you have to go to the break surely let me give you the numbers and I'll go on a little bit more in six six Ninety red eyes and that's the same as eight six six nine seven three three three nine\nSo example how can you ever justify sanctuary cities were criminal illegals or given safe harbor if you come up with phony arguments like illegals will not you've heard that they won't cooperate with the authorities if they know they can be apprehended or sent home so that's why it's important that you know we have sanctuary for them\nBut how about they not be allowed to come or in the first place and we wouldn't need to care if they cooperated with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate watch this to the evil police officers at ice who have the audacity to arrest people commit crimes that said these guys are really clever on the left\nSo the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals through reading schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities so what's my solution\nYou take away the benefits like free health care and free schools you enforce strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you say in the first CEO to jail for hiring and illegal immigrant and it'll never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home\nRun the actually had a right to use the wrong language softball then we go again with language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would venture to say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no bad if I take them back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nWe but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they be saying for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake enough of the government's sending out the wrong message message with actions like ball legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents\nA country is United bites language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn

hey you're on with mark\nHow're you doing Mark I'm I just wanted to say that um maybe these immigrants that are coming over to the u._s. um might want to be a little bit smarter and think about other places to possibly go that may be easier to get into\n'em if they have farming skills I mean South Africa\nA they're kicking people out there and taking their farm so ah maybe but but together a band of you and\nSamir a guy that I think you have the the Gulf to go over there and made the protection of those people get paid some money or or use your farming skills and go over and help out South Africa 'cause they're digging themselves into over right now so\nI hear your ... and ... yeah I I Do hear by the way you bring up a new story I don't know if it a lot of people know about South Africa's expert breeding the land of a lot of the citizens right and that's going to be a real struggling and a lot of them are going to resist right with the force\nAbsolutely absolutely yeah\nWe well it was you know when and thanks for your call when we meddle in other countries I don't mean coming to their aid in defense but like we did so after you got to be careful what you get\nRight in all this talk of makes me think Egypt right we we helped them over and throw a what's his name ... and I asked of the time I was doing national radio and I said wait a second that what they called the springs something what was the term anybody out there can tell me I've forgotten there for a second I'm\n... now and Brian was helping me and not their spring there was some something was spring but anyway uh the fact is we got where she got to ask that question what's what's after this so you got rid of Mubarak and you got the Brotherhood Muslim Brotherhood which was to radical and certainly not on our side\nAnd then eventually ... took it over there we were saying maybe it was the Arab Spring I may you may be right Brian I think you are now that I think of it um producer Brian so you know when I'm mentioning\nThe fact is that you you can't just do this by what we did that in South Africa right you overthrow which you have and then you don't ask what's next is going to be attorney right open the best example might be Iran\nWe were so thrilled with Jimmy Carter to overthrow the shock yeah but they didn't ask what was next are you happy looking back and seeing what you've gotten in instead of the shah\nI ... the biggest enemy maybe or at least our enemy that you might say Russia or China but certainly there the ... biggest immediate threat in terms of what they're doing to our citizens\nSo it's very important that you not just act emotionally I'm thinking Gadhafi in Libya right Hillary was for that Obama was for that what is your place Libya with weren't didn't they killed Americans right in Bangkok\nYou you just can't operate let me get myself in trouble with somebody you're now\nIn Saudi Arabia we got a real problem there what they did was horrendous in my opinion the stone assassinate people like that and go inside chop them up and some people picked on me for that that is none of our business\nBut the other side of President Trump's got a huge problem now is they're our biggest supporters in ... you know besides Israel in trying to do work against Iran cause Iran's their threat to\nThis world is very complicated and their offer no easy solutions or maybe you don't notice historically we had a war there was a war or not we between Iran and Iraq\nAnd you know you got to choose sides sometimes they may both be terrible we work with the Soviet Union during the more I think about this we work with the Soviet Union during World War two because we had a bigger enemy and Hitler\nSo a lot of leftist and liberal say well you work with these people what how do you respond to lead well life is not easy you're faced with difficult choices and you got to figure out what makes the most sense\nThis stuff is not easy\nAnd that in St Louis with illegal

listened to a lot of the so called you pet with the left and\nBy the way the way that you talk to them is inspiring I mean it's it's difficult I mean for me for me it's really difficult to try to converse um\nYou know with a very differing opinion and I just want to say man you've done a great job\nOh thank you very much and we never know and I\nMean you oh no no no no no okay I'm just kidding [laughter]\n[noise] um you asked about who we want to see\nA challenge Trump or we'll just see Hillary Ron I Want to see Hillary run and I want him to beat her so bad in the election\nI I mean I think she watch or were you match and I were to happen I walked her to be their mom and me and I just want to see her [noise]\nJust be really bad and the election\nI'm ... and and your average oh yeah\nI think a lot of people overlook would shut up about it is not my president and I don't know I just I just go to your\nList for her to be it's a little bit [noise] but I'm Serious about what I said man I thoroughly enjoyed a just your whole character you're just seemed like a wonderful guy\nAnd uh I really appreciate you know I think he's not a not an easy thing to be a but you do a wonderful [noise] ... ah you have a wonderful evening\nYou too thanks so much already have a great night Randy I'm very kind words Eric and and and there will be back next week and they do a terrific job you know than the regular host I'm just filling in and trying to hold do my share of there but I have a story on Hillary now I Want to get a little while and the Democrats really fear\nThat she's going to run again that yeah that's why the more I thought about the more thought and that's my number one choice\nNot the other is that you you know I'd love to see ... guys crazy loon Tucker Carlson phrase for him is not that bad right\nA sleazy porn lawyer bought a let me know what you think Andy in New York City you're on with mark Hi Andy\nYeah Hi thanks for taking my call [noise]\n[noise] um I just was you know interested why there's such a big um such big talk about\nSaudi Arabia and what they did [noise] um you know what they did was terrible book you know ... you know even if the to do something small that's all right but it's such a big the making such a big uproar about it I mean you know I'm sure that they they have Saudi Arabia you know it doesn't have the cleanest record\nKing Solomon does for sure [noise] um and I mean generally get involved in things abroad when it when it's in our interest you know when when we could prevent you know bigger or human rights you know you know crisis or [noise] or you know to expand our power abroad you know to protect us you know as you know offensive is different\nBut in this case I mean she wasn't a US citizen I'm here to green card\nOn you know if they did it ... it is in our best interest to just you know the big player in the middle east for us you know to protect us against Iran so like whoa you know they they help us out why um what's the big uproar you know they've\nDone things like this in the past that we've known about you know just I guess it wasn't so publicly you know he I mean this king Solomon he's locked elect all ... you know the princes in a hotel for a few months they said the making the ransom saying he's not he's not exactly a moderate you know it's not your regular guys feel like\nI'm a stay you know it's trying to understand that\nWell let me see if I can add something to your thoughts about him\nLook it's a ... it's always been a difficult a jigsaw puzzle out there in the middle east right now Israel's our basic friend and we can count on them but the other players or you know like Saudi Arabia the war more anti Israel than they are now they both have the one side of interest in terms of Iran trying to stop Iran\nBut I got to tell you I just thought of it maybe it's a visceral reaction the idea that this guy goes in there and I'm not trying to save and great about him because\nHe was a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood and you know their their enemies of ours are as they weren't in Egypt so I'm not a big fan of what he believes in in that sense what to do when someone or be lured into an embassy which is you know he's supposed to have\nA special status when a country has an embassy in another country that is the stairs in their territory their land you lord in there and and then you chop them up and\nYou assassinate him and it just so revolting to people I think that's what was going on and you're right it's a complicated situation as we need their oil and we need them to fight Iran so\nIt's very difficult situation for President Trump but just the thought I I must have been kept to me too I I felt badly from even though I'm ... I think I wouldn't agree with them probably many issues\nBut that's you know agree with him but I kept getting getting killed like that it's horrible\nYeah I mean so yeah it\nEven though there should be you know definitely should be an uproar and they should be condemned for it but I mean though that they really want to large scale it seems like a large scale you know cutting off you know businesses\nAnd sanctioning I mean I I don't know if it's in America's Best interest to do that like just you know for the even though it's it is a horrible incident but for this alone I don't think you know I'm In the bigger picture you know ... ...\nYeah I I I I cringe when you said cutting off business I that's bad in this in this story\nBut um you're right we we need them we need them badly and that's why I say President Trump ... isn't a very difficult situation and there are people like Lindsey Graham who's terrific on in the Kavanaugh hearings now saying hey yeah I'm never going there again while this guys and the princes in power and this and the Marco Rubio a ... there are people on our side saying\nWe we can't allow this to happen you ... you know as as crazy as it sounds you have to have some civility in this crazy world right you don't want the president as assassinated you don't take out food and even if you can\nYou don't do stuff like that that's why the the Kennedy thing John F. Kennedy thing was was so outrageous to this day I'm One of the few talk show host I should say now\nThat does think there was a conspiracy I a little kid but I I I've followed this stuff and um I you just don't do that you just you know what I'm saying I don't know if the Russians were involved in a mafia was involved I don't know for sure I I'm not saying Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't involved\nBut you know this there's something about you don't take out people and that's why by the way I think al ... was so outrageous by a Obama\nA because he was becoming our friend\nA difficult yeah so you you get it and it was right he didn't he writes for the Washington Post and stuff do you know I don't want all the different countries in assassinating them go ahead\nI Know I but I Do feel I mean my my impression is that let's say Russia you know they just recently had a story you know in in England with the export um I'm sure you know it's probably known you know in Washington is probably like you know\nKnown that a lot of many countries you know Russia I'm sure she takes out you know yes people going down his political opponents you know here and there it's not it's not really um [noise] it's not uncommon\nYou know so it's just interesting the reaction I guess because it just became like ... like public public no you know the story\nAnd he ... he goes he yeah he goes in there\nAnd it wasn't his girlfriend waiting outside and he said you know if I don't come out and you know his what'd you do\nAnd and you just disappear and they made it worse no we always say that the the it's the not even the crime itself but the cover up and they said something they were never in you know they weren't involved and they came up the story that was\nA wad of interrogation that ah got got went badly yeah uh that that that's that's a little crazy right well yeah no those sure they're\nPretty sure they're pretty bad [laughter]\nIf you ... yeah this wasn't a by the way I was mentioning my producer last night this wasn't a job interview going in for that that would that would be a job interview that went badly you know the credible home I think people\nEven on our side are reacting viscerally and I I don't blame him because I felt the same way you drop 'em up and when they brought didn't they bring suitcases its reporters and you know how to do things by the I mean I don't want to be gross that way on the air but I I think all of that stuff you may be right just the fact that we knew about there's always espionage there's always dirty stuff going on\nBut this one way played out was not good\nYeah yeah thank thank you Andy I appreciate your call very much by the way how old are you I'm a twenty two I thought you sound young who is your choice on the Democrats' side who would you like to see run against President Trump\nI'll tell you what for the fun of it I Would love for Pocahontas or on I think I think that would just the you know those are just be a lot of fun to watch [noise]\nYeah well I think she shot herself on the phone right now that wasn't\nWhat they see that\nI bet you aren't related to George Washington some are what are you saying [laughter] rations we're all we're all related to everybody if you go all the way back right\nNow she's got the Indian heritage I I think she can get I think she's done you're not going to get your wish recall anything so much yeah thank you and I and I are and let me know what you think eight six six\nSponsored by the Rhode Island Army National guard here by the Rhode Island broadcasters association at this stage to find\nOut about the best local events concerts and more with the six thirty WPRI dot com community calendar is presented by the rented Jody I'm\nNews talk six thirty and Ninety nine seven half W.

were talking to a while ago is talking about a century city century state and about the people voting for them\nAnd I just wanted to I I live here where we can vote on that certainly not Governor Brown name and the whole state of sanctuary state which I don't I don't know how many of the city's pay attention to him I Know some of them have actually\nVoted against a following his directions but I don't recall ever hearing any load about sanctuary city down here and\nYou know the ones you know it wasn't so they were on it it's just that does a Democrat in office a very liberal extremely left is a Democrat in office and he just he said that's a good idea does it and I from what I understand can Francisco's kind of a dumb yeah partly\nWhat it is well I was there a few months ago and um you ... it was amazing you know when I was walking the streets with\nMy kids are so many other just now look at this hand this hand as a weapon and then another time something ... someone says something about a night that doesn't count how dirty it is now I didn't see this but they were needles all over certain sections I think they said market street and of course the problem with the trash and the\nAnd the homelessness is a problem but that's true yes you know everywhere in California right\nYes uh-huh but I think uh I I miss San Francisco in a long time I don't really go up there that much I mean it's quite far from San Diego and I've I've just never been into their way of thinking so um yeah it's it's it's ... it's the only thing we vote on and I like to ask you one other thing I didn't mention is two dollars\nFirst but but you have you heard the thing about the the um um birth tourism it it was\nOn our throats when it gets yeah mentioned this few people and they have not heard of that and actually it was on television some some time ago on twenty twenty dateline or one of those where they fly on the east of Chinese women that are pregnant\nAnd they may have a place all set up and they go there and they have the babies get their little American citizenship for the baby and leave\nAnd then leave yeah no I actually I did hear that pregnant women going into hospitals yep they've got to figure it out and look people will take advantage of the weaknesses in anything right especially your in laws source we of course we call that anchor babies right to so they come here and they have a baby in there and they have all the rights\nAnd wrongs of course was wrong in an awful\nLot of people have not heard about that because I've I've told that she likes the politicians here\nAnd they well there are people that work for them and they had heard of that so I'm I'm Glad to get to see it on on national radio so people can know what's going on\nIt's got we're very close to the border here so if I mean people come over here and dumped the baby's all the time I came down from I mean they have them and I and I just I don't think it's right I don't think a lot of the country and the other countries in the world do that\nNot if somebody had a major in Italy I said the baby out give US citizenship and they said no because he was born in an air force us air force base so I don't know why we're handing out citizenship like if I can but you know it's it's it's the parents or\nTheir action yeah go ahead if\nThe actual do Sylvia there was a reason for it which is a there with the with the slavery issue we want to make sure that they weren't taking advantage of it any way but of course if you pass a law and for every law by the way there's a phrase I've heard was at one time a solution every problem was the one time a solution to something else\nSo you you mean well and you pass something and then people figure out how to take advantage oh I Would do the same thing I Lived in Asia and I think I could get my kids have American citizenship if they're just born here well I'm going to time my trip so\nThat I have the baby now of course they

taking my walk\nAnd he says I saw you on radio and you you guys are crazy and even I thought because going to hit me one point I'm just trying to do my walk and he'd never done this before but it the anger was so strong\nAh yeah I Know you're you know what you you and the Fox and the rest of those people thinking on their you know you're a radio guy and all this ... he was so angry at me yet we ... civil discussions you know at at at the parties that he put on his house or whatever and the kids were best friends you know it was amazing it was I I really thought he was going to get violent\nIt it's it's gotten really bad so I I don't look forward to seeing you saying asking them to be civil I we've pass those days we've really pass it was a\nPretty pretty discouraging aim we I'll speak for myself I Know people who think like I on my side we think they're misguided that they got the wrong ideas and they think revival one of the other things I threw out\nWas they have such hatred for President Trump and they have no idea that a lot of us have been President Obama the same way but there was no resistance we just waited patiently until his term was up I Want them to become the first time I thought he was a disaster maybe the worst president in our history\nWhile we wait until it happened and we did everything politically we could and they picked on a ... a Senator McConnell said Mitch McConnell said you know you want to do when we can to get rid of my forget how we phrased that that's not the most we saying\nBut these guys this whole are saying you know I don't agree with Michelle Obama when they go low we we kick them or whatever they he said I Can't remember the other on your rights saying we're not going to be civil until we get back in power\nWell that makes sense on her case because you can never take not being in power right there for sale anyway the fun this is not good\nA man there though I have a gym you live in Portland I'm just looking at it again your mayor doesn't even want to please do anything right\n... yeah if I recall that real close but that's my understanding it or or if he would uh I I thought I heard one

victims a lot a lot of people trying to do their daily lives you know I'm thinking what's what hit you know I mean it uh it it's appalling it you know frankly I'm a little ashamed of them not having the guts\nTo uh uh you know a ... not having the guts to ah ah have everybody obey the same laws\nNo ... ... years such a nice guy didn't want to disagree but it's not a matter of cuts that's what he believes is a leftist he believes are probably supports and you know that's it's not 'cause he doesn't have courage that's who he is probably probably supports them and it's worse than you might say it's worse than you think\nYou know he campaigned on the different uh you know what the different personality or different persona that the it's like what we got is what we're\nCalling us\nWell that's
