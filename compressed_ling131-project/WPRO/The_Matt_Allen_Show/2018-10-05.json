the WPRI row news at noon and historic\nVote in the Senate this morning moving the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination to a full vote like lead them are on this\nVote the yeas are fifty one that knows are forty nine the motion is agreed to\nThere were few surprises in the vote today Republican Susan Collins of Maine says she will announce later today how she'll vote when the final confirmation vote is taken again likely tomorrow\nNow there are different types of things where you have if you have more options in more diversity of options of ideas and things like this that um that that can be a great strength but division and difference for the sake of it is not\n\nThis is why you know hashtags and little spawn statements like that make great slogans but they're terrible policy\nAnd you know we have been fed a steady diet\nOf slogans\nBut it's slowly but surely being deconstructed we don't have a common view a common link a common culture a common belief a common set of guidelines um\nIn our politics anyway and a lot of times and our social discourse and it has a lot to do with the slow and um and and steady progress\nOf the de construction is the people who wants to take the fundamental institutions of western culture in a in a or American culture in this case and break them down\nEither because that's just what they want to do because there are some people that are to quote Alford in the in the movie Batman some people just want to watch the will ...\nThere's some people who ... who just think everything that is needs to be destroyed because they are they're broken inside their messed up and they have problems\nOr they're just evil\nThere are some of those people that are like that there are some people who are absolutely riddled with resentments\nFor all the things that are in there in the world that haven't gone the way that they think they should go or the suffering that they've had in their world or there are some people out there who legitimately think that the institutions that have existed or mankind for eons in some cases\nOr hundreds of years thousands of years probably\nUm leave too many people out and they're sympathetic to the people that get left out and so therefore they have to be either deconstructed reconstructed or broken down or or or regulated in some way so that the people who are left out are left out anymore\nNow\nI Believe that when we see protests when we see political division that there are the number of people who I think are well intentioned who are worried about those who are left behind are becoming less and less and less and the ...\nI'm a angry and and resentful people are becoming more and more and more\n\nAnd that concerns me now the other question becomes this when it comes to this issue with the other Kavanaugh's situation\nIs America\nWhat I think regular America is is while this guy is the Supreme\nCourt justice what could be a Supreme Court justice we should make sure he's vetted properly and he's good and we should make sure he gets he gets the uh the proper a scrutiny\nWhat there's an allegation of sexual assault motion probably look into this although you know the details a sketchy but what is looking to make sure it's not legit and if it's a legit then obviously or maybe this isn't the guy for the job but let's see what goes on here or or there's a couple of more allegations yeah but there's these uh sketchy is how it's going on here I I don't know what this is\nA but we should look into it because you know we want to make sure that somebody was victimized that they get to justice they want\n'em over pay we didn't investigations of seem like there's anything new here okay um well then I guess you can go forward with it 'cause it's terrible to have somebody who's either falsely accused or we can't tell who's\nTelling the truth I mean the doctor seems credible the judge seems credible and\nSweat seems mean means my bias look at the way over you know I'm trying to tell somebody lying by looking at him I Can't tell that so do we do we go to the evidence the evidence is isn't really there so I guess we can't really act on this that to me is a um is is a normal average everyday centrist America\nNot be my maybe you think that it's biased but I that's the way I look at it\nBut then we have those who get all the time on the cable news channels who get all the time on Facebook get all the viral videos who gets slammed into your eyeballs in your ear balls\n[laughter] for a twenty four hours straight a day of the ones that would\nYou mostly hear from them\nRank man have you made\nThat stupidity you get that twenty four seven\n\nAnd to a lesser ... I mean a vast\nSmaller extent you get the people on the other side of just like you know this is Eric ... ball in ... which I Can't even tell you I I um this one I'm trying to find a balance on the other side that I think is over the top and maybe maybe the overtime over the top and the other side would be you\nKnow women lie on mass about sexual assaults\nMaybe that's a cause that's just not true maybe that's what his Bible even heard that much\nEven the whole idea of boys will be boys I heard that quoted a couple of times I've not heard anybody say that\nEver when in this case nothing not one iota people make this crop up and so if we cannot even look at reality and we can't even\nYou know have a basic baseline of of of uh understandable and shared values will never agree on anything and it's dangerous for the republic but my point of bringing this up is and my question would ask you as whether or not\n\nThe division is real in this country if that centrist or explanation I just offered you is the majority of us and the extremist\nSpecifically right now in the media you see mostly the left wing extremists because luckily wing extremists\nAre are way more numerous and way more powerful they have more influence\n\nTheir way more powerful than we have way more influence and they're way more numerous because it's a safe place to be\nYou know what I'm saying you walk around talking about the extreme Nazi views are extreme uh you know or whatever type of use people look at you like you're a lunatic and your pretty much without a without question Sean publicly you lose your job you do whatever\nYou're some social justice warriors lunatic up at the state house wearing a pink hat\nI'm as saying ridiculous things like rape culture and that uh and that everybody that you know we hate women and that all this nonsense it's just not true yeah you know a show the White House would take a picture with you\nGovernor among don't make a speech to you\nSo the extremists on the left are way more influential and way more dangerous because of that influential nature and um but they're just as dangerous in terms of the just as I should say irrational as the extreme is on the other side\nJust at a different way\nAnd by the way they occupy higher education from from the top to the bottom\n\nAnd so ultimately a icing hearing wonder is there going to be a time\nWhere the sane Americans who don't see the world is black and white who don't see the world as one side's already is right and the other side's always wrong is there other scene Americans going to stand up and be like\nPlease for the love of God shut up already and let the adults take the control the we'll see the problem is with with with people who are normal and more balanced\nThey're

moves on it spreads out\nThe truth and what really happens is like low on the priority list of their things to talk about if they can push the victim narrative and the oppressor narrative that is more useful to achieve the end result because really it's all motivated by compassion\nYou see sure it is um\nThat does not recognize human nature it doesn't recognize the reality of the world\nIt doesn't exist\nAs a new book coming out that I uh I'm working on trying to get the authors on and it was already out and I'm asking for review copy so I can read it first and I've heard a lot about it called the coddling of the American mind if this that helicopter parents the social justice warriors in college campuses and the whole idea of triggering and safe spaces\nThat's all demented stuff meant to weaken people not strengthen them\n\nAnd that's what that's all about now that philosophy is something that is if it's not out rightly accepted by governor among do it is at least flirted\nWith with by governor or a month ago and is or at least pander to in some way by governor among do\nYou saw this in the Democratic party and the debate between the progressive than that the more I guess\nThe um the more conservative Democrats and all that other nonsense these people have been a philosophy that is not based in reality it's based on a ...\nA fabricated reality that they want to achieve it will use political power to do that whether they want whether you want them to or not\n\nGovernor among do is a a willing participant in that to a certain extent and it's also it can be seen as almost like a Trojan Horse\n\nSo you know while I Am not somebody who is likes to be like a this ... this this is a this is a symbolic what this means something else other than that in this case you know this is allowing for certain philosophy is to get a foothold\nHer election or reelection I should say because she had to\nMove further to the left on this in order to be to maintain a power base by the way I'm she's way more than she was when she ran the first time\nShe's had to cater to these people the people around her who are supporting her\nI mean you remember that you remember that a ridiculous a press conference took place a couple of weeks ago it was back in the end of September\n\nYou know sitting there and and using what was the cabin or thing and then the allegations going after Alan fun seeing ridiculous thing state senators and a ... unbelievably ridiculous things that thing waited like a lead balloon\n\nBecause its its demented but those are the people that she surround yourself with\nAnd so those are the people that are going to be at the table that are going to be the ones who are going to be helping to make decisions in this state it's not good\nYou know the kind of people that make demented things up like a like a a and this is a small tiny thing but this is a it's a it's symbolic of a larger or larger philosophy the idea of a boy's owned a girls only a governor for the day contest that demented thing\nThey ... they laugh at all votes to celebrate women's history month I'll go go go vote but yeah okay\nWe know exactly what you're doing again not looking at reality\nSo when I look at the governor's race I think I think Gina Raimondo not only represent somebody who is who plays with the truth somebody who's who's shown herself not to really be I think in my mind care about the every day running of the office of governor and running the state of Rhode Island but to be off into being governor of Rhode Island we talked about that in the past\nThose people who want to run the state and there's people just want to be called governor I think she just wants to be called governor\nBut she's got higher aspirations but the people she surrounds herself with\nAre people who do not have I think a\nWe talked about the normal centrist view of the world last hour they don't have that in her ... in her in her administration\nSo the ... the conflict that I'm having is\nTo sit there and sit there and I know Joe ... obviously has a right to has a right to to to run Patricia Morgan has an absolute right to come out and say do she thinks should be the governor and all these things and Allen fungus what Alan falling is\nHe's not a guy's going to like the world on fire\n\nBut a a a lot of people are doing this thing where they're sitting there trying to think to themselves do I vote for somebody I support or do I vote against the force that that is going to be toxic\n\nAnd you know I've said this before I think people tend to vote for something not against something so I don't know what on God's green earth has to happen between the pillow Morgan and phone camps but I Hope somebody figure something out soon\nBecause otherwise this um\nLeviathan of the progressive left will have a bigger and more um pronounced foothold in the state of Rhode Island\n\nAnd ah once it's in it's going to be a long time of demented nonsense before people wake up and go what the hell is this\n\nSo it's a tough situation to believe that everybody has a right and that everyone has an and I and I got to tell you I think Joe ... is a phenomenal guys that can make a great governor\n\nAnd I'm not really I got to tell you personally I'm not that excited about the island phone candidacy\nJust because I don't think he's a bad guy and I don't think he's I don't think he's a I I don't think he's a corrupt mayor I think that's you know you're going to say that you better have some evidence to it and\nThere you go thanks Matt Good afternoon
