the tweeted that on September twenty fifth within a ... he was locked 'em\nIn another tweet he feels that he was locked after having voted for Trump I'm so he's he's got an anonymous account and he's got you know a smiley face with a with the table for one salute right over the front of it and uh and\nAnd he's had some harsh words for the Rhode Island DOT okay that's fine ah Rhode Island DOT as walk them I don't know if they've on block them at this point I've been blocked by the way by a senator Morgan not rep Morgan senator Morgan\nBecause I asked I last year it was last December she called in to Jean Val is on the show one one morning during an ass the DOT segment and she called in real late and she got upset because she didn't get out now I don't know if you've ever worked a morning show\nWhen they have the asked the DOT beat her I'll be here uh I don't know if you've ever been asked to work come in that early it's it's it's an ungodly hour a but\nA lot of people call up for it okay a lot of people have questions they feel that this has been a great way\nPeople start calling in I think he's on at eight o'clock people ... like seven thirty like yeah I Want I Want my call I'll hold for thirty minutes and hope for the chance to ask my question she called in towards the end of the show a senator Morgan\nUh from uh the the south county area a ... and she called in late there were other people online I had her\nAnd\nThey never got the recall and then she started blasting gene in the station saying you know they they they're picking and choosing they never take my calls all the law and\nSo I asked her I said who on on Twitter and like do do you think you're more important do you feel that you're entitled to to be able to jump the line people have been waiting to get their questions that answered your senator you have you know presumably you\nA little more access than the average Rhode Island or to these various departments can't you just go ask the guy yourself correctly I mean why you've got to start hating on all this stuff up and and I said do you think you're more privileged because of this I mean this is the same\nSenator who is you know she's upset when they they they didn't recognize her at a at a at a school committee meeting\nA you know for for an issue and it was just like okay that was the whatever it was fine the the thing uh you bought me I I I really don't care uh it doesn't but that was her right now according to that that ruling in a by the judge\nA according to the ruling she should have a she should have ... the senator showed him walk me\nRhode Island the T shirt on block at ... for zero one\nWhich was a gentleman who is on Twitter that you can find them you can ... it's you know uses some language uses a you know that's I've seen a sweets okay that ... says right to his right to free speech\nNow ...\nI'm curious as your thoughts to this are you a A R U blocked on Twitter by anybody whether it be a a\nPublic figure our friend or somebody you know you ... are you just blocked um do you tweet at people do you use Twitter as a means to communicate with a officials used Twitter ... what do you use Twitter as a means for a and\nYou know the ACLU at this point Steven Brown executive director is still the political scene that they're considering taking legal action to address the issue if it's not favorably resolved\nOh\nUm they're just choose not to have him you know comedy here they're tweets their threads that the information they put out there\nYou know to go\nOff in and to to to tweet against now maybe he's asking relevant questions maybe he's asking you know stuff that's important I don't know maybe he's making baseless accusations\nMaybe he's just being relentless and and just trying to you know being harassing\nThere are ways that the Rhode Island DOT could report\nBlunt for zero one and if you try to report somebody\nFor harassing speech or inappropriate language a Twitter [laughter] well Twitter suggest that you know block up so it's Twitter telling you to block them\nAnd that's what people will do\nI consult some national radio personalities that have gotten some pretty nasty messages sent to them\nWhat do I do well when it starts getting to the to the to the point where it's threatening yeah your call the cops ... you file a report because that's harassment they start showing up at your your station your place of work in and harassed me yeah you you call the police that's their job\nYou block them do what you can put people to recreate these

thanks for your support and listening\nTo yeah I I listen I I I Love the ah you know I I\nEnjoy what I Do hear it and you're right it it is it is opinion base it it's it's commentary I Try to stay really neutral on things I tried to call out you know absurdities when I see them or you know I I\nJust because to me that's I think sometimes we missed the absurdities of it um there there are various topics out there that I'm much better versed on than others\nBut nevertheless I mean I'm I'm here to have fun to do some entertaining chat with you hang out with Alex talked to ... and Gary across the hall or you know just that's it it's it's a fun gig I Love doing it are here and that's why I I I think the opportunities when they come along a and and we certainly have enough to talk about\nHere in Rhode Island and even on a national landscape on on a whole variety issues um but the uh\nBut this whole you know when we start seeing somebody who is so wholesome and ... um [noise] you know always I mean just really avoided\nAt at uh went to painstaking lengths to avoid being any\nHaving any sort of of of of weigh in politically\nUm\nYou know Taylor Swift who has you know\nIt's just one of the world's leading contemporary recording artists out there and she's she's done that because of you know sharing stories of her personal\nLife whether it be boys or or just growing up as as a as a young lady in in confidence in body issues and I mean she's listening who you say what you want about her music she has inspired\nMillions and millions of young people male and female or with her music\nAnd I think she's done a great job I have I I I I don't I don't fault\nAnything she's done a you know her music catchy\nI have played a number of her tunes in various bands I've been in and you know you just it's the some of them are kind of fun but\nHer\nI I I really don't turn to her for her political\nViews and as you heard in that a story from ah from ABC they're\nSome of the some of the the the backlash has already started saying you know people saying listen I'm not going to go to your show now you're you're coming out on the Democratic side I'm not going to go to your show\n'em or the\nOther side is oh jeez I'm gonna buy every album all over again on vinyl on cassette on eight track I'm going to buy the sheet music I'm going to buy everything I can piece was all because she came out and supported tendency Democrats\nUm\nI just it's\nI I don't know it did\nDoes endorsements like that to that does that really weigh on you\nFor one four three nine seven seven six\nAnd and I realize that this question is probably best targeted more towards a a younger demographic out there not nothing against the older demographic but I I certainly want the older demographic call in or were you influenced by\nPolitical or by by musical acts back in the day I mean let's face it there was a whole genre of music that was just a you know against the war against whatever political actions were happening out there whenever it was um there's there's songs in all different genres\nEven Marilyn Manson if you want to go is as far to that that direction yeah you know system of down P. O. D. I mean all of these these artists that are out there they've all written songs that have been based on politics but you know I don't know if it's necessarily translate into\nCome through but Taylor's just coming out and she hasn't ... speaking so that's why it's different as well it just I don't know it\nKinda goes along the whole the whole line of\nThinking when it comes to a you know debates\nAnd everything you know when you have like five or six of them are you know the presidential debates I always think you know by the time you get to the second or third presidential debate like how many people are really ... and they're like oh I Wonder if a wonder that person brings up a good point on there is that you know who you're going to vote for a you know just it's that\nIt's
