{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WPRO", "content": "For a second and then that's what Paul said I'm afraid we can't retire and two years like we plan I looked at what we said and what we spent every month and it just doesn't seem it's enough and it was a very open moment both hole and John they were scared and\nFrustrated they had set a goal while they were working and now is they got closest to the deadline they felt like they missed it now before we make any changes let's find out where you are today and at the end of this process will give you the confidence on hotter retired two years Keith the lifestyle you plan for and make sure you don't run out of money and sold in the next few meetings we talked about what they had saved\nFor retirement between their Social Security there for one case in IRAs and savings accounts\nThey have plenty of money but what was missing was how to distribute it out over the three types of income guaranteed predictable inflexible this is well written income report really helped it actually allowed me to be able to explain how all three of the income types worked for them\nSo as we were going through the report together I turn to them and said you can retire in two years as long as we organize your four one K. and your ... for distribution with your Social Security is to create the guaranteed income you need to cover your day to day needs\nWhile still leaving plenty of money aside for you to cover the things you plan on doing in the future as well is make sure you can sleep at night even if like it's in the way it was at this point that Paul was actually able to relax she was finally able to see the missing piece puzzle and she was now ready to be ready for retirement\nEar you could financial services we believe being ready for retirement is more than just having saved enough money it's about knowing how much you've said what's the lifestyle I'm going to have\nAnd how am I going to sustain for my entire life but it also includes having someone like myself in the tea near equal financial services to guide you through the pieces that are missing and now that beginning point of any retirement plan\nIs making sure that you have a stable foundation that maximize your retirement income and a predictable fashion so the starting point is to optimize your Social Security benefits\nBecause at face value you can leave tens of thousands of dollars on the table but by employing a few little known strategies it's actually possible to generate as much as a hundred thousand dollars or more an additional lifetime income so come in just like Paul and John and let us give you a complementary customize ... income report so this way you can see how maximizing your retirement income\nCan impact your overall retirement\nNow to get your customize raining complain you must be at least fifty five years old and be ready to be ready for retirement we have only three left to these reports so called right now for all one seven to seven to seven to seven that's for one seven to seven twenty seven twenty seven and let's get ready to be ready to retire\nYet you really do need a written income report it puts the image or together for us so that one of your biggest hurdles is just to\nTeach yourself how to dream big again how to teach yourself to I Want to be an astronaut or I Want to be I don't know I Want to run through two states ... wearing only Nike's just just two states just to will it for me it would be Delaware and Rhode Island so back to back yeah but but the short way okay yeah that's a long way\nGot it ... if anybody's ever see that that's actually not\nSo the idea is you have to start dreaming big you have to get your lifestyle in order and you have to really start giving yourself permission to really be you again and I think that is a very difficult thing to do when you've been in a regiment for fifty forty five fifty years when you're in you're working years 'cause you're told well this is your purpose this is your purpose and then you build your entire life around\nThat they have the idea of what's my new structure which that new plan which my new routine and that doesn't mean okay I've retired I'm going to get up I'm going to have two cups of coffee I'm gonna watch daytime TV and the more the lawn grow it all over it and I I think that's I think your nail it because it's\nAll right there when when the retirees say that it's that's them deflecting the conversation of I'm not really sure what you're talking about it's okay to be lost in this conversation you have to say it's new to me it's okay to be lost take a second and just think through\nWhat did I give up by working yeah what did I give up what do I need to gain back to make myself hold again because if it's going to I'm going to fix my house\nWell that that's good for about a year and then you're either going to go back to work or you're going to really have a lost retirement and you're gonna be wishing that you had something to do so have a great retirement become a precise planner and actually understand that when you are goal oriented\nWhen you have a purpose you can start to do that in that layers in income because now you know guaranteed money predictable money and flexible money all flows is one so that you go from your go go to your desk you go from your slow go to your desk and then you go well flexible\nAs I've gotten the waste to think of as no different than go planning organizing yourself for a project at work\nYou're just trying to figure out what am I trying to accomplish over the next five years ten years Thirty years now you don't need to plan out every single year between the day you retire to the day you pass away but you can have milestones at checkpoints because then that\nHelps you actually defined what's your retirement income and how am I going to break out the income in the different layers from guarantee predictable and flexible now

council or other ratifying body within minutes the ...\nAnd with ... under the law which makes them completely on ballot right invalid\nIt would make them yes there is a fairly well a well known Rhode Island Supreme Court decision\nIt was issued back in Nineteen Ninety four but justice tray Supreme Court ah we're Providence city council a\nI was addressing agreements made by then miss an see that it not been ratified by the council and of course on the ordinance or in the city collective bargaining agreement had to be present the legislative branch truth in a simple government for ratification\nAnd the court made it very clear that agreement struck\nA in such a way that they have not been presented and vetted by the city council and ratified are invalid and not enforceable\nAnd so that's pretty much it's safe than to say that site agreements or basically illegal in Rhode Island\n[noise] well site agreements per se or not a lawful unless\nThey've been a\nPrepared I mean anyone can foremost I cite agree you could have a a fight feed\nA forming a side agreement with a union to resolve a particular issue or to create a benefit at that essentially collective bargaining however\nMerely because reform the agreement doesn't necessarily make it a valid one side agreement it struck it then has to go through the process of a ratification\nMore famous to me that's not done that seems to me the ... the didn't noting the fact that it's a site agreement makes it aren't automatically invalid because if it wasn't a side agreement would just be an addendum to the contract\n[noise] while maybe different decided that means that we have an agreement over here that nobody knows about now we're kind of just working out between ourselves those can happen\nSite agreements can be negotiated but they have to come to this or they have to be presented oftentimes ah issues arise during the life of the it for a year collective bargaining agreement\nAnd the party

mhm consent agreement if you will in arbitration the point is\nThose agreements bill to be valid must be that it by the city or town council or the ratifying body and if they are not than they are not valid collective bargaining agreements because remember even though they may be single subject matter\nBy agreement they still are in the nature of collective bargaining agreements they struck between a union and the ... and as such they have to be ratified if not their invalid void and unenforceable\nAnd if they then take a step further if they are acted upon as if they are enforceable unreal what happens then [noise] well\nThat's an interesting question because unions often grieve violations of side agreement and then when a revelation is may ... side agreement was never ratified\nThan diminished the power the has the ability\nTo raise as an affirmative defense a void ability\nOr in validity and on enforce ability of the so called site equipment so I'm again merely because people go through the motions of preparing the side of green in some cases\nSigning it in some cases acting upon it doesn't make it necessarily a valid collective bargaining agreement if it's not ratified now\nYou have to look to your grievance procedure too because in a main collective bargaining agreement your grievance procedure trying to what a grievances and normally it's defined as a violation\nOf the collective bargaining agreement already miss application or a misinterpretation of the collective bargaining agreement\nAnd when you have a site of green\nThan it is the subject

[laughter] I visited him this morning It's MORNING I'm Sorry yes yeah that\nThat was only after I met with the uh the fire chief in my office first thing this morning\nSo you hear about this for me 'cause I Know we talk to you had not heard about it or not\nI didn't I didn't hear about it from you I'm I when I Walk this morning I have my cup of coffee pick up the paper or read the newspaper and I saw the article in the front page of today's Providence Journal and what was your reaction to\nA ... it's ... my curiosity that I Want to come in earlier than normal and try to gather as much facts are actual ah background to this as possible and address what I think is a very important issue that has to be addressed\nSo ... do you look at this and the same way can thought it was that this is some kind of a um an issue of intimidation or attempted intimidation\n[noise] ah no I don't take that point of view I I Know that the point of view that Mr block talk but uh I Am gathering all the factual information that I'm able to gather at this time and I will continue to gather information\nAre and how does that information was speaking to the chief of my fire to ... of of the city of wild fire department a relative to the information he may have\nAnd uh from there I went\nTo directly to the property location as you know there are for businesses that that property so I I\nWanted to get a better understanding as to what actually did occur at the at the first business I went to that there was someone occupying was ah this the blocks business that ring the doorbell or he invited me in a he showed me around his business and a\nProceeded to tell me the factual scenario you encountered a upon a a visit to establishment\nAnd I again I indicated the mist to block that uh I Will be taking the information he provided to me the information that will be forthcoming from my fire chief and if it requires further investigation by any outside authorities and the information that people will be provided by them and\nA correct\nOr take the appropriated that appropriate action necessary to address this issue not because it's can block if it was John Smith or anyone else or I Want to make sure that uh we are treating everyone equally for Smith equally and on\nAnd that there are no ulterior motives to any actions taken by any personnel at the city of\nOr the phone calls they're recorded every adult falls at my office\nI no no no no I'm Talking about those I don't know where the call came in for the for the anonymous tip for the inspection\nI I I think if if fire does at the same way as police\nIf it comes in a as an emergency or a state it as a non emergency I don't know if you call it the individual directly um if those calls are recorded or not recorded on I Know within our um system\nAnd I have in that way the reason why I mean I Am I asked\nDepartment yet but there may be some sort of record I I don't know I mean I've just been I've been performing to shop for six months in every day is an education and you're a learning experience and an issue that arises that we uh attempt to address and do what's best for the taxpayers of the city\nSo you'd be looking into this doing some kind of an investigation to see if somebody inappropriately a cold this in in ... in an effort to kinda send a message that can block and then the oil there as well\nI I I Am looking if there was a wrong committed I'm looking to address that wrong ... upon receiving all the facts and examination\nAnd I objectively sought those facts and I and we're both visiting the taxpayer business and dealing with the department head Hawaii I in turn I haven't\nGotten that information yeah you're waiting on that from\nThe ... well uh yes I Am waiting for that information from the cheap I gave him a list of items that I Would like to see and upon examination of those items\nOr it may require you know nothing or it may be quiet further examination ... from a different authority like get that in front of me I cannot um definitively tell you what's going to have a you know what the verdict is sort of\nYou I appreciate that so I you know good for you for doing that I think it's important issue since a terrible message if it's in case where it is in fact what it looks like since a terrible message to the business owners in Oregon it's a it's it's a camp and have that kind of thing you have a I Can't have fire service and fire protection weaponized against business owner so\nWell as you know ... I'm I'm I'm pro economic development I uh actively seek businesses to come into our community and I would it would be counter to my ideals as to where I Want to see the direction of this community go and making ... uninviting\nA to locate a business or expand the business within our community\nHe taught me about the about the ... time with the firefighters where are we with this and and this this whole story came out in the journal on on Tuesday I Believe it was\nThe issue there are we as a city of war still paying this out to people we don't know what are we doing with ... what is what is being\nHe ... in terms of their ... benefits\nThat they know the the the price of the uh the formula that was in place when I took office um had a has been a a canceled ...\nUm and that was because uh upon examination by the fire chief and uh as to how this came to be\nA a document resurrected a executed by parties are back in two thousand Thirteen on that possibly may not be um\nA a\nLegally and force forcible type of document I don't know I'm waiting to see what the arbitrators come back at but once we found out that that document it existed the chief a discontinued that policy that was going on\nA a grievance was filed by the uh the the union to firefighters union or the chief\nDenied the grievance and that was appealed to my office and at that point it's up to me to uphold that a denial or reverse that denial I upheld that than I ... and I stood behind the chief finding that the document was not proper\nThey're still getting their their sick time bone is it's just not calculate without\nBased on this um this site agreement that uh appeared now based on\nWhat you're talking about when we talk about that side agreement for a second I mean is it or is it beyond a is there any any sort of a definition or any sort of a type of site agreement that you could ever possibly see being legal in the city of war for any ... chief executive to make with any sort of union outside of the council purview\nAs well as the eye and the originator of ratification by the city council of any agreements entered into of this nature I can tell you that if there's going to be any amendment to an agreement or if there's going to be agreement at all and requires the ratification of the legislative branch of government\nWhich is the city council to making it right in agreement and that's what happened uh and then if it's ratified it uh it uh you know it becomes implement\nThat sure um but so there's no sense in other words there's no such thing as side deals with mayors of any kind of [laughter] it is well\nUh other agencies not not the city council but uh that's it I can tell you that\nIf you coming before the council and you know\nYou or a had these side agreements\nAnd we voted on and other collective bargaining agreement in two thousand sixteen this one was an amendment to collective bargaining agreement that was voted on a two thousand twelve right how you can come before the council and not have\nA a call before us and told us that there was this I'd agreement that significantly impacted or what we believed was the compensation package is unconscionable\nWho presented it to the fire chief\nUh the fire chief yup and a ...\nIt seems to me yeah now\nNow I read in the paper that may arrive at the Asian at no knowledge of this yet the administration paid out the the the money that goes along with the amendment\nRight what does that tell you so I don't know that occurs it seems to me and\nYou know we're we're a part time legislative body when\nPeople come before us and gives it give us the school notes and tell us the impact on our budget we assume that telling us the truth\nMhm and somebody lied year\nWell it wasn't you know you can call it a lie certainly wasn't the truth\nThe intent is the issue right and I talked to is that right out a little you know I've talked to a guy about it though I Can't\nAsk I Can't assume what the intent was what I can tell you [laughter]\nEverybody damn well knows what they're supposed to do when they because when they called before the city council and the collective bargaining ugly and I expect people to tell us the truth\nWell that's the issue and I talked to move in regards to yesterday said well some people are ignorant to this I have a I have a zero ability to believe that all that that's the fire ... ignorant\nTo it if they paid out\n... ... I'm I'm Talking about ... ignorance of the fact that this stuff has to be um that has to be ratified um there's no way anybody in the ... century absolutely\nNo and it was witnessed by the um the city solicitor for the city award will report directly to the mayor\n... yeah yeah\nDo you is there any ability for you and desire for you at the council to call for an investigative body to come in and look at this as a result well\nObviously we have and now are you know when you say investigative body we've hired in accounting firm and every day it seems like a war accurately every week or the\nThe task that CPA for changes as their investigation goes deeper and deeper and more and more as uncovered\nWhat about law enforcement ...\nEvery time we start investigation or to look at something that you know Mr Cody Mr blocked brought us those documents are a few months back\nWe provided those the CPA firms were not auditors are they went in a ... and started looking at it and as they requested records are more and more information started to come out um\nAnd uh it was very upsetting\nSteven Rosen city council president ... so what about law enforcement here at this point the attorney general's office state police is there's some you got to be some kind of ah you know recognition yeah I\nDon't I'm not going to jeopardize any investigations but are you talking about what ... what may or may not be going on that's not my role my role is to approve things\nAh and there are other agencies are that look at this and make determinations as to a pet\nAnd uh I don't think it's in the best interest of the citizens of war word that I turn around and said\nThat there is an investigation or there is an investigation or we're assuming that someone did something wrong or that's not my task as an elected official like\nAlmost like what do you mean by that others will hold on a second that's why that doesn't make any sense it is a city council president ... represented the people it sure is within your purview to say listen uh we see some sneaky stuff going on here so it's called the police let her body and I\nThought it looked like we have an I I've already made statements active investigations happening and I'm not going to talk about potential litigation matters because I don't believe it's in\nThe best interests of the city as to what could or could not happen\nWell hold on hold on to say when you see investigations you talked about an order that's being done is law enforcement involved in looking in this\nI Can't answer any questions regarding any pending investigation that's that's up to the agency\nHas the city council officially gone off to any law enforcement agencies and presented this and say maybe I should have should come take a look at this\n... very good question [noise] uh and you know it's a yes or no I I Know\nThat this issue just came up with regards to the to this contract I'm sure that people are working\nAnd I'm not going to jeopardize investigations by saying that they are are they are not um you know this is a very fine line here between a\nPending investigations and making statements and I'm sure your work very well aware of it ah as to what what my beliefs are compared to what the facts are and I have a fiduciary obligation to the citizens that I can assure them that I'm that I'm following life reduce your yeah\nHold on one second costs mineral I get a quick break and come back to the ... the city council president we come back and when I just want to ah just going to explain what he just said a little bit more and ask them a couple more questions will do that we come back next\nCity council President Morsi role was on the line with me come from I just wanted to\nClarify something for me I'm sure in your ... you don't have to talk to him but to me about any potential investigation but you know you can tell me what you've done have you and your capacity of city council president or anyone in the council contacted law enforcement to look into this\nI can tell you that wall any investigations that people have contacted me on or requested information from war any uh investigations in the future I have and will continue to cooperate with\nAnd I don't I Can't I I Know you're trying to get me to say was there a crime was like\nOh no no I'm trying to get by I don't know that that's a threat to the agency I get you from a\nCivil perspective you know what we've done is an extensive amount of research which continues to to yield these unprecedented results as far as I'm concerned of where we're finding out the good agreements with that for\nMy my my my asking you to tell me about that I'm asking you about whether or not there was a crime I'm asking you whether or not somebody ... you think somebody should look into it to see if there was a crime\nOh yeah that that's what we're doing\nOkay yeah I mean I was I going to do it just shows as it is is that you've seen yeah\nIt it it was what you see and say you know it's time to officially in publicly asked the state police to come and look at this or to ask the U.S attorney to come and look at this\nBut I I'm Sorry could you repeat that\nOh well from what you've seen and what you know about your with your what you've seen so far is do you now think that there's time to publicly call as a city council president for federal law

being as a governor remodeled filed with the Rhode Island state bully and you can check that out second point\nAt me and they serve it set up because of governor I'm Wendell policy\nNo matter what the police department is if they ever get around it particular individual right they they I mean like if I it's not all which is like hey when these individuals they time is up I had no way of picking them up and that is out there getting around it and that is why that individual\nI have no quarrel I have no quarrel with with your with your I have no quarrel with your analysis on the area here frankly I'm a I'm going to respond I'm going to respond is it okay can I respond to\nYour Oh thank you I have no quarrel with your a CIA a discussion here there's no doubt that beginning with\nUm governors chafe ie that there was a clear mind drawing around the a Shiite when it came to the to the ice is specifically the the ignoring those detain or a Lawrence and in in the mornings and issues so that had no other discovered\nAs I Am absolutely got it I agree completely you are correct but I Will I Will\nYou you'd have to show me your play by play because I had done the work on this and I have seen what Cranston Providence in Central Falls do when it comes to criminals of lake nature with like status and they're ... they're they've got the\nGuys get it all you have to do is call colonel itself but go off all colonel climate\nI've done a sheet hey do you and I I've done I've done it on the air that they're not\nTelling you and I tell you the truth I'm In the system Providence Central Falls but pocket to not check the ... the ... ice Warren ... although like\nI hold the federal system they simply do not and if you're being pulled all the way they are simply not Kelly\nHi here's what you're going to do here is we're trying to do since you since you cared so much to dial the show you're going to send me an email a Dana six real dirty beer to come you can identify yourself you're going to tell me who you are and why you know these things and you're going to give me some you're going to give me some evidence\nThat because I Will I Will provide like evidence and will and will go from there Allen thank you you know I've got I've got police chiefs on the record here\nI've got them I've got them talking about the specificity of these things I've been talking about the fingerprinting process to use that goes on this kind of automatic that goes into the system that's that that that becomes ice alert if\nThey are what what they are not doing is pursuing non criminals and tossing them to ice what they're not doing is processing misdemeanor traffic stops and the like which I don't believe that the city of ... doing either\n\nThere is there is there's no distinction\n\nTelephone numbers for three eight dirty bureau toll free one eight hundred three two one dirty pure I ask colonel when quizzed about this the other day\nThis one document that our phone keeps getting you know off on this notion that he's like super immigration dude because he signed one of the agreements that the that the Trump Administration was looking for that day I ask colonel linguist\nAbout it I read a press release were Alan from a writes that he signed an agreement with the department of justice promising the federal immigration officials will be contacted when a criminal and custody is in this country illegally that's not new news\nTo me yeah\nNothing changed with the city of Cranston Allan Fung keeps telling me oh we signed this agreement\nAs if it was we're stepping up the what we do business\nThat was the chief they weren't stepping up the way they do business\nThey'll look a T shirt to might end up being processed differently depending on the charges and and who is what we are and how\nDon't misunderstand me I have no criticism of the Cranston police I'm Glad that guy what what was it was was the beginning of the tape or The Annotated maybe I missed that it was cocaine possession ... alleged the federal possession felony position cocaine\nYeah once they actually figured out who had the uh different licenses the he was wanted on felony alright\nSo that was deeper into the tape All right thanks so so this guy's got a felony possession of cocaine charge against him\nSelling the possession of cocaine is going to be treated in the same manner especially when they got aliases issues in the city of Providence the city's Central Falls where do you think those those police departments just turn those guys back into the street\nIt's complete bunk\n[laughter] your show how ...\nBoth elected and campaigning for office you know miserably in statewide around here are trying to use the same modus operandi for different purposes\nYou know I'm a sanctuary city that's where halo is though I'm not a sanctuary city in the criminal we just arrested in process through eyes would never have had that happened he'd still be walking the seeds of problems in the streets problem is Central Falls these things are\nIn in in system comparison to what the way the law enforcement operation works of art that is not true\nOkay now\nPut that aside for a second here's are like little this is a nice little did he for you when it comes to Alan ... presentation on this arrest a day when he is governor\nHe's now going to attempt to make communities pay the price\nThe feds they're not want to have to quote guess\nWho is walking out\nAnd perhaps after try and detain someone in a situation where family might be waiting as well as for the conflicts arising\nThat's not cooperation and that's not putting the safety of other Rhode Island is first that putting politics first I've been asked how to incentivize cities and towns cooperate with my no sanctuary state policy all simple and all sorts of love\nThe city's like Central Falls in Providence or any others are going to thumbed their nose at the federal falling when refusing to cooperate with the feds on these cases than perhaps they don't need to see an increase in state funding as well\nIf they don't think they really need those federal dollars then I guess they don't need more state dollars I Would freeze currency to them in his palace and I'm not talking about school they'd only the city side at current levels to incentivize cooperation\n[laughter] can you can I can I take a moment to just laugh out loud\n[laughter] ...\n[noise] what\nFirst of all first of all\nThe Trump effort to penalize cities and towns or or to threaten to penalize cities and towns on federal funding\nWas met with ridiculous bravado on the part of some Democrats across this country\nRidiculous ...\nThat they wouldn't that that that they didn't need that money that they could they would stand on principle\nRather than worry about the money and I do believe\nWe will be from the New England trucks illusion studio in Tucson guys whenever I'm a I'm six thirty WPRI accumulation

A. N. G. stock says Facebook Amazon apple Netflix Google\nCan you repeat that\nJeff sure and I know it's kind of went through pretty fast\nBut that ain't right\nS. A. N. G. so Facebook apple Amazon Netflix and Google that so they've\nRefer to as the fangs thought years but now they're referring to fang plus Microsoft so they've added that another all technology based sucks so when you look at those six stocks in earlier October before the correction\nSixty four percent of the growth of the U.S some peace five hundred\nWas related to those six company so six companies out of five hundred accounted for sixty four percent of the growth of the U.S and the five hundred\nSo people are looking at the index and say gee the next ... my portfolio is not following it or near it well if you weren't heavily invested in those six stocks that we're all high tech\nThen you wouldn't have have seen as big a rise in your portfolio and that is on the\nPress aside if you're in all that technology\nNow when you look at it the corruption that we had early October it was those six that again cause that pulled back so they had a minor correction within the technology area\nBecause they were overheated this year they had grown way too much in a very short period of time so the market will quote unquote corrected meaning some people are saying wow I really made a boatload of money I'm going to take some profits off the table\nAnd then that that's going to drive other people to sell if the if the selling drives the market down or the cost of that sucked out other people might get triggered for their cell orders so because now five or ten percent it might cause other people to trigger a cell which drives that don't deeper\nAnd that's the kind of feeds on itself so when we look at what happened those six stocks drove up the market and they kind of cause that correction and then we'll see what happens as we go forward but we don't feel too strongly about buying into those six socks at this point because they're way over heated in our opinion\nSo as I mentioned a moment ago we always want to look at the fundamentals and if the fundamentals are so strong meaning is unemployment low\nOr people working you know is a things stable in the economy itself are retail purchasing numbers looking strong well those are fundamental issues so if the fundamentals are good\nWe anticipate that these quick corrections will again kind of recover now we don't never know how long that would be or how quickly that could be but the fundamentals are so strong and it's just the way that we look at our clients portfolios and where their position\nIf that sounds interesting to you our number here is for one three three three eight thousand\nIf you save

dive into your portfolio and show you exactly from a technical perspective where you are\nAnd of course we do our best to make that simple so that you understand it the feedback we get from our listeners is always has been wonderful it really has where people say wow I never knew so much about my investments until you showed me this report\nAnd I often hear well gee whiz my advisor never showed me that I'm not sure why but we think that's key and fundamental you need to know where you are today before you can make good strong investment decisions going forward that number again is for one three three three eight thousand\nI Want to talk of financial fundamentals with you Jeff to protect us from volatility the volatility we see on Wall street what is a fundamental you think we should start with\nWell the first fundamental is is to ensure that your assets are appropriately diversified now by diversified you know everybody hears that where it wasn't me well I mean methodically allocating assets across various classes you know you've got stocks there's mutual funds exchange traded funds\nAnd potentially some annuities which of course we prefer the fixed variety because the variables I I'm not a fan of the feast tend to be high and I I just don't care for them and then perhaps some cash and are there any alternative investments that you should consider\nNow that applies to your entire asset Bayh's retirement accounts that just four one K. your stock portfolio if you have one outside of your retirement plan et cetera the goal is to build a mix of assets where the behavior does not correlate\nAnd that is when the value of one asset classes down the value of another asset class hopefully is up or at a minimum steady so one balances off the other\nYou know this use of non correlated assets\nIs designed to help level out those ups and downs in the overall performance of your portfolio of assets while still producing a certain level of growth on the one hand\nAnd having a certain segment of your holdings in a protected position and that's the fundamental basis of how we structure clients portfolios back in\nThe number ... ... says the it's ...

fluctuations in the value of our assets now the first fundamental is asset diversification suggest what's your next recommendation\nWell this next one actually also related to asset allocation in diversification heading into retirement it's important not only to maintain a strong cash reserve\nBut to be prepared to use it when the situation weren't no flexibility is key and managing your assets and your income sources for your retirement years a cash reserve\nProvides options as to how and when you draw your retirement income you know let's say the value of the investment portfolio from what you're drawing all of a sudden drop substantially\nWell that's a time when instead of drawing from that depleted value account\nPerhaps you can draw from the bank and said\nIt was just one of those options so rather than selling off stock or some other assets to generate that income\nYou know it's just like All right let me leave that alone for now and let's go into our more protective places that didn't lose it will draw from them\nWhich again goes back to our philosophy of splitting assets typically in a fifty fifty mode so that we have fifty percent in what we refer to as

Jeff helps people retire successfully at something he can help us\nIf you need that assistance I'll just today for zero one three three three eight thousand on the show or attacking financial fundamentals help us put volatility and its proper place them retire but so what's next\nWell the next fundamental has to do with what's among the top one or two issues and usually it's it's the top every survey I've seen\nThat you know some heading towards a retirement tend to worry about most and that is having enough income to last as long as they needed to laugh the fundamental is to ensure that you have some retirement income sources that are not tied to equity markets because we've seen how those equity markets can go down\nIf we just think back to two thousand eight and technically it started in October of ... and it dropped even though oh seven was positive for the year there was a major drop from October to December\nAnd then two thousand either it was like thirty seven percent it kept going down until march of ... own nine but oh nine itself\nWas positive so everybody's skipped so seven and nine but if you look at the S P five hundred from October of of seven to march of oh nine it lost two thirds of its value in Eighteen months\nSo it's very important not to have all of your money tied to a market that can be that brutal and unforgiving\nBecause your income is what you live on it's not just a pile of money yeah you can draw from a pile of money or cash some people way back in two thousand ... actually buried money you know because they were afraid of what was going to happen with computers and stuff\nBut that doesn't make a lot of sense and thankfully it didn't really cause or any type of major issues\nSo it's important that you have multiple sources of income for your retirement now most people will have Social Security\nA lucky few or might have a pension plan and then many people have their retirement plan at work whether it's for all and K for three baby four fifty seven or IRA accounts whether that's traditional or ... or you may have an investment portfolio outside of your retirement plan and if you do\nThat's awesome because now you're diversifying the tax ability of the income which is very important\nAnd then you might be a somebody that had rental property that son well over the years you know some people\nChoose to liquidate rental property when they get to retirement because they don't want to be tied to the property if it's been a challenge and others intend to hold those rental properties and use that as rental income\nAnd for them that can be the perfect strategy and then of course if you're going to have a safety position in the back well you you should earn interests and thankfully finally you know interest rates are coming up and that and that's fine that's been great to see finally\nAnd then you know many um maybe not many but a fair number of our clients choose to continue to work\nNow they'll they'll quit the full time job they had to do something fun do something part time it gives them some socialization out there to to have friendships et cetera and it gives them a few extra bucks so it makes them feel better\nSo when you look at the bigger picture Social Security is an income source that is not tied to the equity markets that's important uh neither is a pension plan\nInterest bearing accounts income from from working also those are all in that category but many others retirement plans for one k.'s investment portfolios\nIRAs regardless of the time many of those are invested directly in the stock market so you may be overexposed and the stock market\nAnd it gets perhaps than in certain circumstances we should be finding other income sources that aren't tied to the equity markets shrill\nOh absolutely and you know you see it and all types of\nMagazine financial magazines whether it's kept blender or even the wall Street Journal we'll talk about securing your income that you need to cover your your fixed expenses at a minimum it's not your lifestyle\nAs a minimum now the only exception with the lifestyle would be you don't need to have a secure monthly income for like travel expenses here's your travel expenses you don't need to have that money coming in every month you just need to have access to the money when you're ready to take take that the trip\nFunny ... years ago I had a couple that had come in and we hit agreed in their first meeting that they said they needed twenty five thousand from their assets okay great I put together a plan I come back to the next\nTo me they they said well you know our our numbers changed a little bit\nUm I said well All right so instead of twenty five ... what do we need to bump that up to and they said sixty thousand [laughter] and I was like well wait a minute how did we get from twenty five to six\nSo so one of the points was that he had four thousand for Gulf trip with his buddies every year\nAnd she wanted twelve thousand for travel for the two of them\nAnd and so I said well first let's take the travel out of the budget she about jumped out of her chair Meg and it's really it's really kind of quality she was no you can't take the travel a lot of my budget as well let me explain why was taking him out of the monthly budget\nI said let's say march comes along and you decide you want to go on your trip but you've only receive three months of your twelve thousand dollars\nCan you pay for your trip while the answer's no so it's not you don't want if you're going to spend twelve thousand for your trip you don't want a thousand a month to come in you just want to have access to twelve thousand when you're ready\nIt's a very simple way to look at things so\nWhen you look at structuring your income it's important to cover your base expenses but also certain lifestyle expenses so if you're eating out every month that kind of stuff you want that to be structured\nSo in our opinion we believe that fix the new these can fit in that space and there are two different general categories\nThere are some that are really built just for um the protective side if you will where they can't go down if the stock market goes down\nUm and they're good for accumulation and then you can just withdraw as you feel you need to\nAnd then within certain restrictions I might add because with the ... one of the downsides is that you generally are only allowed a percentage that you can withdraw each year now most of the plans are ten percent that you can take out each year\nSome of them are at seven percent of very small number restricted to a five percent withdrawal\nNow in the context of a of an overall plan none of those are problematic because the other half of your portfolio is fully liquid and you have access to that money pretty much anytime you want it it just say three or four days for us to sell things input and get the money put into your account\nSo it's very simple but a fix annuity or can be a very good way either for accumulation or the other category is for guaranteed retirement income and we do a fair amount of that type of planning\nBecause many of her clients and it seems more so or or a lady listeners are concerned about making sure that they get that income for the rest of the life and what what I hear most is I I don't want to become a bag lady when I get older [laughter]\nAnd you know I kind of lab but it's a very serious thought that they have they're very they're that concerned about ensuring that they have an income that they can rely on for the rest of their life\nSo that's the type of planning you would like to take advantage of our number here messing associates his four oh one three three three eight thousand if you save two hundred thousand or more of your retirement we'll look forward to your call", "show_name": "The Matt Allen Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "28"}
