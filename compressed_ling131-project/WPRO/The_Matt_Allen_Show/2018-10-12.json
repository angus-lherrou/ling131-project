Ninety four or or anybody else really like a or\nThe guy people you know the um this if for some reason the teachers' union because I think obviously your children are impacted and your children have ended up becoming\nUm because they are the end result or the direct impact of the work that's done when the work gets mitigated or work gets impacted or the impacts your children\nAnd the development of your children so people take it personally and so when a collective bargaining agency that represents children ... excuse me teachers\nUm starts to do collective bargaining type things worked to rule strikes things like that people get crazy and they can also get they get angry about it but they also take it very personally in terms of the way that their teachers on the other side they might not be treated well or things that they should be treated better\nAnd so they get involved with that because they love their teachers things like this\nAnd one of the things I think that adds to this whole idea then then the sensitivity what the what the teacher's unions that they've been turned into an education in general is in this case is in a situation where they are turned into illogical tools because the ah especially teachers unions but ended in general have started to become\nA radiological tools they are without a doubt bending more towards the political side then\nI Would imagine that would justify it if I had ... on the phone line may tell me we do this because we are pushing an agenda that makes everything better for our members they'll say that that's but there are many people out there who don't think that the political agenda that comes along with um the left wing in this country is a good thing\nWhile they may light the fact that they have strengthened numbers when it comes to negotiating their pay negotiating their salary negotiating their retirement or in protecting those things stuff like getting involved in things like marriage equality or\nOr uh you know I'm the me too movement or just trying to think of things that are more ideologically driven um or you know all that stuff\nUm it's something that is\nIt's controversial and it doesn't really have a place in a in ... when do you pay somebody to watch out for your for your um\nYour paycheck and for your benefits\nAnd they do endorsements and now that there's a story in the journal today that I find fascinating is Kathy Gregory wrote it and I was re Kathy Reichs stuff\nAnd the headline is any a A R I endorses Raimondo for governor not Gina Raimondo has the has the distinction of being um the figurehead\nThe person who shepherded through and negotiated and created in ... and created the call for the reform of public sector union pensions and the state of Rhode Island\nShe\nCame out with a formula with the with the presentation of numbers and said you know the whole truth the numbers thing talked about how the pension system was in a crisis talked about how the pension system needs to be reformed talked about how the reform was absolutely legal\nWent out so that I followed it we talked about it all the time supported it\nBecause the financial shown it was going to take out of the end of the state's budget or a year after year after year is going to grow and grow and grow and they knew you were ... they assumed return rates of return we're going to be completely and totally unrealistic\nUh and we were in a headed for crisis\nSo they made a bunch of made a bunch of changes they extended out and and kind of refinance a bunch of stuff they did a bunch of different things including ... eliminating coal is to a certain period of time\nAnd lawsuits were filed and if you remember at the time the lawsuits were filed the lawsuit in of itself was was coming to a head right at the time that she was running for governor and when she was starting to run for governor she backed a plan to settled the lawsuit which made it so that the changes that were created in the legislation were mitigated a great deal\nOr and kind of throwing the whole idea that we have a right to do this and answering the questions of how much the state has a right to change pensions that are already established whether or not\nActually even though one court said there were as you know what the Supreme Court say whether or not there was actually an implied contract when it comes to benefits pension benefits are that are written into a that are written into statute rather than actually into a contract\nUm all these questions that needs to be answered and because she was the figure head for this the unions have been you know the old people in the in in that have been retirees and what not have been ticked off in her since then last time around they indoors too is that uh what's his face in the Democratic primary or clay Pell\nAnd an epic failure of of calculations I have no idea why they did that\nUm they should have checked a guy's car record first how often the office car um and then they should have what they did was a you know the the same kind of I Believe they stayed out of it when she won the election the primary they didn't endorse anybody well now there are endorsing her for governor and the reasons why are what Donald Trump\n\nOr maybe even Kathy Greg's story in a statement any a A R I president Larry Pearl said quote we recognize this will be a typical recommendation for some of our members due to the impact of of pension changes but after due consideration committee members felt the remote his record as governor specifically her work in promoting all day kindergarten\nPreschool gun safety the school construction bond Rhode Island promise\nWell as addressing mental health concerns and strengthen the equal protection for all students marital recommendation to NDA all ride members to support her in the election of amber sex\n\nAnd you know how much of that stuff actually first of all that she actually do number one number two how much of that stuff actually has to do with a you know ah the actual working conditions you could say the school construction bond obviously all\nDay kindergarten\nThat's a you know what that's more money for their members right so I guess that counts to\nRhode Island promise scholarship or does that have to do with anything with the with with with people who teach\n\n'em mental health concerns I don't know what she's talking to what they're talking about with that one equal protection for all students I don't know what that means that's most likely in eighty a logical thing I'm sitting here
