with\nYour battery goes that everything can come to a stop don't take a chance on\nSo neither the mayor or finance director or the fire chief could answer the question so I kept persisting and then they said to me well that line item of sick leave only take into consideration the secretary non uniformed personnel\n[noise] so I asked them to point to the line item of sick time that recognizes the uniform firefighter sick time an outfit counted for understanding accounting procedures and they couldn't do that and finally the mayor says\nOh we just roll all that into line item of salaries well you can't do that violates your accounting principles\nSo seeing that every other department it correctly the city council went and they filed an ordinance that fire department now had to break out they're sick time\nIn a separate line item as dictated by the city charter invite ordinance and they they initially voted in favor of doing that so they could get a clearer picture on the budgetary issues and how the money is being coming in and out the door may rapid ... vetoed it\nDidn't want to hear\nWhat the city council overturned the veto\nAnd that was supposed to start happening on July or August of two thousand Seventeen but they didn't do it they kept pope postponing it postponing it postponing that just until just before ... left so what happens is this [noise]\nUm the contracts allow the firefighters to get twenty six days per year\nAnd that allocation is given to the monthly they in other words\nCrew one point six six six days that goes in the bank per year once they reach a cap of ... the main road promote\nPromote yet which one point six six times twelve months he goes the twenty days once they reach a hundred and forty days in the bank\nNow they still get their twenty days per year well out of that twenty whatever amount of sick days they don't use they get to cash out Seventy five percent of that for in other words if\nYou use to five sick days you have Fifteen days left in the bank and by contract you can monetize Seventy five percent of that Fifteen which would be eleven point two five days\nAnd historically\nUnder the contract that and you will benefit would be paid annually\nAt the last day on march right because the\nSick pay counter is not like the fiscal calendars or the county yeah the sick pay county goes from February to January so having said that when I started to look at\nWas when I got the unused sick pay report I had at the time to documents I had the attendance records which they call the accountability sheets would chose who's on who's off will stick who's on vacation who's on military leave whatever\nSo I got the unused to pay a report and I got the attendance records and I started seeing all these names of men who had ... they got the maximum amount of sick time that was due to them which was at the time\nTwelve point for eight days then it moved to Fifteen days so set let's say for example they all got Fifteen day's pay\nAnd I'm looking they all got the exact same amount of money but when I looked at your attendance record they had missed six days five day seven days eight days one guy miss ten days but they were all paid as if they had perfect attendance\nSo I started to do access to public records and I was met with a brick wall on every single request they refused to give me records I had to file complaints with the H. G. and this went on and on and on so it took two and a half years to get the documents\nOnce they had the documents and hand it was two hours the fifth grade math to come up with the numbers now this scheme began and two thousand and twelve\nUp until two thousand and twelve the end you will benefit and the contract language indicated that was to be paid annually as does every other fire department that has an unused sick pay benefits it's an annual benefit that is paid once a year well in two thousand and twelve\nAll of the union decided that we're not going to take a pay increase but the fire department balked at it so what they did was they developed this scheme that took place behind closed doors\nWith the mayor involved and then they would change the last word in the contract to not get paid annually to monetize the monthly\nSo what would happen was you can see guys attendance records where they're being paid monthly every month right and then the last couple of months they take enormous amounts of sick time\nSo they basically takes place instead of getting paid Seventy five percent for the on you sick time we have individuals that got paid a hundred and twenty seven percent of the sick time\nThe fire chief got paid a hundred and Thirteen percent of the sick time so we calculated out\nEvery single man based upon the city documents right eye then received the official sick leave sheets and\nI requested to see a couple of other documents to visually inspect it when I did the fire department ... the assistant fire chief came in and gave me these three big three ring binders and when I looked at him I was like\nOh my God this is Christmas they have hand written record of sick time every guy has a page and the secretary actually writes it all in pencil\nAnd they all cruel how much time they have in the bank by pencil and paper and hundreds of eraser mocks the white photographs\nAll those came home and ... all four official city documents and I found numerous mathematical Eris not ten not hundreds thousands of mathematical areas where numbers were all the numbers were change and people were getting paid when they should have got paid for example\nA guy will take a sick day so you're in the month of January but you'll also be paid that month for not taking a sick day when that happens the man is paid just regular salary of one day he's paid one point two five for an ... day\nThen a man comes in and called this summit time and a half so each time that happens we pay out three point seven five\n... how did they get to the point where they do one point two five rather than the Seventy five percent Seventy Seventy Seventy five percent is\nSeventy five so he ... his you Matt okay and that's why I don't want to confuse people with a simple you get one point six six days per month when they started to monetize this monthly you get Seventy five percent of one point six six which is one point two five days pay\n[laughter] you get more than ... yeah yeah and you called out sick so you got two and two two and a quarter a day's pay who\nWas with us Rob who makes the scheme up okay here's what has usually average criminal stuff this is a genius\nOh it's brilliant and they never thought anybody would figure it out\nUntil I started banging on the door and they didn't realize that you know are not everybody went to the war school systems where they still can't [laughter] so\nAnd this is what no let me tell you something and and here's where it becomes a conspiracy\nWhen they went from the fifty percent pay out two Seventy five percent pay out at the two thousand sixteen budget hearings when they had the new contract ratification I questions are nice ... who was the finance director vigorously because the line on them and two thousand Fifteen they\nPaid four hundred and forty three thousand dollars in unused sick pay that benefit now is being increased by fifty percent ... in my opinion authored\nA bogus fiscal note because the fiscal note he gave to the city council which I have in my profession right now indicated that during the cost of the three year new contract that increased this payout by fifty percent that it would have\nAn impact on that line item of two hundred and eleven thousand eight hundred dollars\nI questioned him and you can actually hear my testimony to go to the city archives\nI said early this can't be because if if it was four hundred and forty three thousand last year and you're increasing it by fifty percent you're going to see at least another two hundred and Twenty one five ... the odd you know that's the thing well ... was off the first year by six hundred and forty nine thousand dollars\nIt's my belief that that was done purposely so that the city council would not look into this issue because what's two hundred grand over three year period it's really pennies\nBut when we go from four hundred and forty three thousand two thousand Fifteen to one million Ninety two thousand four hundred and Twenty one in two thousand sixteen\nThat's the problem and that fact was sheltered from the city council\nDid not see this coming now\nAnd a half years ago I brought this to their attention I brought them the documents that I had at the time it said you got a problem they took it seriously I met with Joe Solomon the role at ... leads the McAllister sat down and show them the numbers and said you got a problem and at that time\nI said look just fix this make this go away fiction and I'll go away those two and a half years ago and to my math in my mouth is pretty damn good in the three year period I have documented two hundred and forty seven thousand\nEight hundred and fifty dollars sixty cents that was wrongfully paid up Justin last period of two thousand sixteen to Eighteen this goes back to two thousand and twelve where the percentage was actually bigger\nOne thirty\nSeven here in the ... I guess on the line he is a term of his front page during the\n... and they must work fire for another reason why I'm Talking about the you know it's one city invested in Rhode Island the entire region but I Wonder how many other places that this is going on right\nAh Robin Ewan I Know that you teamed up with a can block on this new some his data mining technology to kind of get some of these numbers rise how that worked\nWell after I did all the math by and they went to Ken and I said look can you help me with this and he said yeah let's digitize it all new digitized and can roll programs to extract data to basically check my analysis and check my math and speaking of checking that I I just want to clarify something for the record\nJust before you went to a break I gave you the example of the chief that took twenty four sick days but I gave you the wrong dollar amount so he took twenty four sick days but ... which means he was zeroed out he should have done any any sick time pay on you sick time pay but he was paid for three point seven five days upon you sick time\nPlus he went another foreign the whole right so he technically he was overpaid seven point seven five eight the amount of two thousand nine hundred and sixty six dollars and eighty six cents\nSo this is a stark example where the contracts says you can be paid Seventy five percent for your own used well he had zero on used but he was still paid right\nBecause he he your months where he was he did have one used\nRight so he actually because it says he or she shout at the end of the year it'd be paid not to exceed Seventy five percent he was paid a hundred and Thirteen point seven five percent\nSo simple math\nSo let me ask you this question so this seems to me that that this is the gym but use language in the contract Cajun because he was in the contract you say you your president in ... contract law says you supposed to go to the original intent was when it's when it's conflicting\nUh they didn't do that they went with this other way so at the end of the day when this when the article says the spokesperson for the money for his union says that there was a sign an agreement with the previous administration was married but ... what is he talking about what the side of humans just to go and do decide the month\nSo so evidently you when you have to understand we have a city solicitor who oversees the contract negotiations Peter Gerald\nRight Peter hero\nOversold these contract negotiations he's supposed to be an attorney and and you have a contract that has such loose language in it that they manipulated it so what the union president has said well we had a side deal with the mayor in other words you get them the mayor said that we could monetize a hundred percent of it\nWe had a verbal the city charter specifically prohibits any type of verbal contract\nWell I I noticed one thing you have to understand the other thing that's a little fishy\nWhen why can't some got involved in this and they started asking\nThat's ... that's the the the from the ...\nYou write that they wanted the payroll records right\nThe city would not give them any records the city wanted them to sign a nondisclosure agreement which I have in my possession cause I average that thought that that are as well stating\nThat they cannot disclose any information they can't talk to the media that this investigation goes to the city of war\nAnd no one can speak about it from now into perpetuity show again I asked the question that Peter ridge arrow if Rob Cody is wrong in his analysis and I'm just making stuff up and I've formulated all these official documents why would you need a non disclosure\nTo the firm that's investigating this why wouldn't you make this public right away\nAnd show that I'm wrong that can block is wrong and we're just a couple of\nBlow a city council say about that I mean we got a call ... who says he's the chairman\nNow right yes the president excuse me yes\nSo what what did you say about that we usually we this isn't going to be this isn't something as agreed to already saying listen we got to go ahead and we got to get this this this odd it's going to be public\nWell how to my moral has told me and given given his words to me that when they receive this that they will make this audit public\nNow\nThey're going to talk about we have sloppy contract language I'm you know this really come this contract language really wasn't put together and they're going to say well you know we had an accounting error time say whatever you want\nJust everybody reimburse the taxpayers go right down the list I have a list of every man what they were overpaid\nMove not writing on the court our decade well that's going to be done\nAnd and the fact of the matter is in the absence of that okay think about this for a moment if we say oh we discovered this big accounting era and we're going to fix it moving forward\nBut we're just gonna let it go back in the past that we're not going to go back what does that say about accountability on any administration I don't think that Joe Solomon who would do that but what would that if in fact that would\nHave committed ... one of those things don't bother getting permission just get it again forgive it that's what they'll do and then and then everybody's like okay whatever moving on we just don't get to do

B. R. O. Providence cumulus station [noise]\nAfternoon I'm a revolution soft wash new center on Paul's and Gary what the two o'clock WPRI news Drexel Korea with no apparent plans to leave the office of mayor in Fall River the twenty six year old today presenting a case before the assembled media including W bureau Steve ...\nThis ... including that Seventy four percent of the people between the ages of twenty four twenty nine years old Seventy nine percent of people under the age of twenty four now that doesn't surprise me because I think what's what's with this is what happens with generations you have a a pendulum right and the the millennials right now the older millennials\nAre so sickening league a left wing and and and just the social justice warrior nonsense that the younger millennials or whatever the next generation what's the next generation called the ... at dinner generation something but I used to know the name\nI'm fairly new term they are going to be more conservative and they're gonna be like screw you middle fingers in the air you guys suck dizzy or the Generation Z\nSo\nBut in this issue\nThe the way they way they talk about this this in this article they'd be authors it's funny in the first paragraph says that you when you look at social media can break down people did two two segments basically the woke\nNo social justice word types of the world who are all you know hip and whatever and then like the the the what's the word they use the um\nThe ... and the a\nTeam resentment team ... and the resentful [laughter] and so you know you break these all does but when it comes to political correctness\nTraditionally codified lying\nI'm there doesn't seem to be any support for it or very little\nAnd according to this article youth isn't a good indicator of political correctness support and neither is race as a matter of fact get this part whites are ever so slightly less likely than average to believe that political correctness is a problem in the country\nAt Seventy nine percent Asians eighty two\nPercent think it's a problem Hispanics eighty seven percent think it's a problem American Indians eighty eight percent their most like you had this I don't know if I conclude was born in ... who are most likely to oppose political correctness American Indians and as one four year old American indian and Oklahoma said [laughter]\nAnd his focus group according to report it seems like every day you wake up and something this change you said you you say Jewish is it a black guy is African American you're on your toes because you never know what to say so political correctness in that sense of scary\n\nSo I'm sitting here and I'm looking at this data and I'm thinking to myself this is incredible and then it break you break it down by the way three quarters of African Americans oppose political correctness Seventy five percent\nUm what's the data\nThey say one of the part of the state of narratives that data partially affirms that uh that uh the that African Americans are most likely to support political correctness but the difference between them and other groups as much smaller than generally generally suppose it gets Seventy five percent\nWhether everybody else is that the eighty percent or so it seems that black Americans according to the study anyway she seemed to be a thing to have political correctness is a little less of a problem than white people\nBut still Seventy five percent eighty three percent\nOf responded to make less than fifty thousand dollars a year dislike political correctness Seventy percent of those who make more than a hundred thousand dollars a year skeptical about it\nAnd one eighty seven percent of those who have never attended college thing for the political correctness has grown to be a problem only sixty six percent of those with postgraduate degrees share the sentiment so what's happening here is what I'm seeing by looking at this is basically political correctness\nIs a tool of the educated rich people white people\nAnd they go into that so what does this group look like compared with the rest of the nationally represented a polling sample progressive activists I'm Talking about progress is specifically because um\nSince obviously devoted conservatives Ninety seven percent devoted conservatives believe the political correctness has a problem traditional liberal sixty one percent think it's a problem progressive activists think it's the greatest thing ever according to but even then thirty percent think it's a problem so Seventy percent of progressive activists\nYou know people that like work for ... do they think that the that the political correctness is fantastic now what does that group look like I'm sure they're very diverse\nOr according to this progressive activists are much more likely to be rich highly educated and white they're nearly twice as likely as the average to make more than a hundred thousand dollars a year they're nearly three times as likely to have a post graduate degree and well twelve percent of the overall sample in the study is African American only three percent of progressive activists are\n\nWith the exception of the small tribe of devoted conservatives progressive activists are the most racially ... homogeneous group in the country\n[laughter]\nThat makes me laugh so all this stuff\nPolitical correctness the political the progressive activists look around ... folks look at our state look who the who the super progressive\nWho are they they're all they're all wealthy white people\nWho can't wait to tell everybody about how the the ah the ah the the person of color as oppressed\nState of Rhode Island looking I'm all\nEducational elites highly educated elites rich people trying to tell everybody else how to live [laughter] it was an article but the overall question I have about this which is fascinating this this is interesting information but\nWhat's interesting about this is that if eighty percent of people overall a vast majority of minority status people think the political correctness is horsemen newer than what the hell are we doing who's running this place\nIf you're if you're ... or you part of the exhausted majority\nAnd then why are we doing this ... this is I'm telling you I read this and all I think about is social media and how social media through mental manipulation biologically driven\nIntellectual manipulation through doping mean reaction has got us hooked on it they get these guys have ... I did a pod cast you got to listen to my podcast from last week Brian Lamb or oh\nHe's a social media attorney fascinating I talked to many times in the show we had to sit down for an hour and a half ... hour Fifteen minutes about social media and he quotes but you know if you can pull this up its right towards the end you can find it but he talks about the um\nThe tobacco lawsuits and the tobacco companies back in the eighties whenever it was that they did all those lawsuits in the back of a settlements and whatnot and they talked about um they find some information there that we're we're the tobacco companies were trying to find a handheld device\nThat would that could be used in marketed to children that would be easy to hold easy to use and deliver nicotine\nAnd he said I Swear to you got to pull the play the audio if you took out the nicotine part and just just looked at everything else you'd think they were talking about cell phones and about handheld devices and and I pads and whatnot\nBecause these things are are are absolutely easy at all we need is a smoking gun memo\nFrom some internal engineer at apple or something like that that they've created these things to mess with people's brains to make you want them more and more and I think there's been reports on it when it comes to social media that that's exactly what happens there's this Doberman reaction the satisfaction you get from owning the lives or smashing\nSome conservatives face on social media so that makes you go back for it again and again and again and it creates this extreme view of the world that\nThen uh is used to to separate us into these camps that we don't obviously don't even aren't even real\n\nSo this is fascinating to me and the idea of the exhausted majority\nAre you a member of the exhausted majority as defined here in this study my phone numbers for three eight WNPR oh the toll free number one eight hundred three two one WNPR oh you can email me mad at six three zero WPRI dot com and this study blows up or any sort of idea\nOf of some you know ... or I should say it exposes the idea of of diversity being a great strength among the liberals\nBecause most of them the hardcore progressive activists\nAre just rich educated white people trying to do whatever the hell there is they think that they supposed to do so I'd love to\nTalk to you about this and your perception of this of this information what you think it would just told you we come back we'll take your calls for three eight zero toll free number is one eight hundred three two one WPRI the day in your show coming up after after three o'clock as well it's all coming up next to stay right here on WPRI hello\n[noise]\nHi this is Karen ... and with the Chris fall weather here so many things to do like spring up your home inside and outside or you just might need some fast cash let's face it we all do make extra cash fast with Rome and jewelers go into the basement addict\nLook around your house and bringing your tarnished worn out silver plated hollow aware and flat where bring in the whole set bowls he said everything I promise you family no one's going to miss it you haven't used it ... and Michael say hello tell them I said hello and then I sent you Roman jewelers one thousand reservoir at in cramped\nFor insurance are financial services lately there are so many choices and decisions to make [noise] luckily there's a law into age it's safe to help make your decisions easy in your local insurance for finance\nAnd from either new thing coming up with customs solutions for over fifty years make the right decision has a lot of agency today for one nine for nine Fifteen the losses at one is therefore those Haitian nationwide is on your side nationwide mutual insurance company and affiliates Columbus ohio seventies the underwriting guidelines for the UN approval\nMet thanks not resigning as the message at the end of a long presentation was no questions from Fall River mayor Jason Korea he made the announcement afterward talk meant to show that the app at the center of federal charges against him was not a sham later today a rally calling for him to quit and tonight the council takes up his future or what they like to see him do\nTurkey's state run news agency says the Saudi ... left her home this hours after the census official residence would be searched in connection with the disappearance and likely death of Washington Post ... this on the same day secretary of state Mike Pompeo has met with the crown prince in Saudi\nAnd the candidate for governor says he would cut management at the Y.
