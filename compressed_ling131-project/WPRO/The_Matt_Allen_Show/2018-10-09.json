I mean you've got to be careful how about the story where where basically it was the the whole idea was that the the picture originally Brock Obama and some kind of like Middle Eastern garb\nAnd the idea or the idea of him not being a citizen was actually started by Clinton staffer\n\nWas promoted by a Clinton staffer I mean you've got to be kidding this is what this how will we ever they don't want to come together folks civility she doesn't want civility you can't be civil to somebody who wants to destroy everything you stand for there you go\n\nThere you go so you know I hear that and I think to myself you know what there is no amount so you take that into consideration here you have this is the presidential nominee for the Democratic party\n\nUm you know she's promoting the lack of or normal ordering the Merrick Garland if you don't think that that what happened was Brett Kavanaugh\nWas you know tit for tat when it came to do what happened with Merrick Garland and you can listen Merrick Garland was was this political as it gets right we have the power we're not going to take up your nominee we're going to skip you and we're going to give our guy the next pick\nWhoever it might be we're gonna take roll the dice and see what happens to even get a Republican in place that that that's what it was it was any a logical event that's what that's what the Supreme Court has become but to say that at all ... that the lack of civility in this country started with that is this is absurd as it gets\n\n'em and and Hillary Clinton being treated like like a certain way or twenty five years I mean you've got to be kidding me\n\nSo I don't know civility where it starts and where you know who drew first blood [laughter]\nAnd whether or not at this point does anybody even care about it\n\nYou know I care about it in the fact that it's a certain level of and and then by the way the idea that civility re starts when when Democrats when we get into the house and Congress civility ... I mean it is such a just that ... that thought process and that idiot logical statement in of itself\nIs is complete and total joke civility comes folks from shared values\nCivility comes from and understanding that the the intentions of the other person\nOr not automatically diseased\nJust by the fact that they ... they spoke in them you\nUnderstand what I'm saying you can't have that in modern politics because the only way one party delineate itself from the other party is by demonizing the other party\n\nI mean this is the entire platform of the left wing in this country today is that the ... everybody else bought them is somehow tyrannical patriarchal evil or or or or secretly racist if not overtly racist\nI don't you know you can't tell me it's about just about elections or just about you know destroying what everything we believe in you if the left in this country the far left in this country has created a paradigm where if you're not in lockstep with them then you can't even have a job\nYou shouldn't be allowed to be able to eat dinner in a restaurant\n\nAnd to say that that that has to do with the Republicans I mean it's just such a this woman is this is why she can't be ever be president she'll never be president because she lives in la la land\nShe lives in la la land and I'm telling us right now\nThe back and forth extremism that goes along with this Washington Power struggle\nIs like um [noise] it's kind of like a a imagine to imagine Godzilla fighting mall throw in Tokyo\n\nRight you and I are the ones on the streets getting stepped on you and I and the ones that are having our buildings knocked down in our cars crushed in our family you're demolished by the foot of the monster\nThat's where we are in this country and I don't know ... the the greatest joke that's been pulled on all of us in some way shape or form is that we somehow a have part and parcel of this whole thing like we're we're involved in it\nWe're we are used as pawns in the game of Thrones folks read the books the game of Thrones books read the the songs of ice and fire you want to talk about the demented politics of of of the United states you did say that it's it's a complete total metaphor for it\n\nWith a regular folks just get used like chattel by those who are the anointed ones and that is exactly what Hillary Clinton talking about their ... I mean to for her to say the civility will return itself from the Democrats win is as\nIndia logically disease the thing is you can simply as disease the thing is you could possibly say and that's where she lives\nThat's where a lot of these people live is that where you live so\nI Would love to hear from you or I Would love to hear from you know what a centrist Democrats when you hear that how do we as a society\n\nDo it first of all do we even wants civility number one do you go do you want stability or do you just want to destroy the other side number one\nI'm that's on both sides right you're going to anybody on any sort of eating a logical spectrum can answer that question\nBecause the in order for us to have civility you must have common values in order to have common values you must first believe that it's possible that other people can have different ideas and still have the same kind of basic values as you do and the only way I think that this is going to actually work\nThis little experiment of ours is is uh this this American experiment is to maintain a level of commonality between all of us and to focus on that rather than on the uh the logical differences and I don't know that it's possible I don't know I don't know how we do it\nSo he had an idea my numbers for three eight WNPR oh the toll free number one eight hundred three two one WPRI when we come
