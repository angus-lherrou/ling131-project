Clintons another one turned up in the mail room at the time Warner center in Manhattan Steve cast and bomb reports in the home of CNN's New York bureau in it didn't take long for viewers to find out what was happening\nThe loud alarm went off as CNN's puppy Harlow and Jim shoot or angering the news from the New Yorker heroes or\nTo have projectiles and then that's a [noise]\nExcuse me that sounds like a fire alarm air will keep you posted on that\nBut the staff were evacuated the building along with others who work at the time Warner centered on that includes the corporate offices of Time Warner and other cable channels the NYPD bomb squad was called in to deal with the suspicious packages they were treating it as a real explosive device\nBecause I guess there's an alternative we don't have to all live together [laughter]\nI don't know what the separation looks like\nI don't know how you do that but there's I guess that's an always an option\nAnd\nI think one of the things are a couple of different things that we can all kind of a ... we can come up with some fundamental first principles right things that we can all say hey you know what I'm\nLet's all ... let's start here right I think\n\nYou can paint we need to I'm listening to the receiving a band and just some sort of bandages going up on the fact that we could just use Google to try and find out if they're having an event or something here yeah I just want to know the original genesis of the gathering is because I saw his his daughters there is a bunch of people that show up at the ceremony if it's a an awards\nThing or something like that and then I Would imagine is going to go ahead and\n... about the presidents of special schedule as two o'clock is scheduled to deliver remarks on your stored progress in action to Trump about the opioid crisis\nOkay supposed to be an opioid event and whether or not he goes ahead and said something about what happened today we'll wait and see\n[noise] um\nBut you know there is a I think one of the main things one of the problems we have today and whether or not it is it is a um whether or not is it is a\n[noise]\nA sign of the division of our country that legitimate division or if it's a perception thing\nI don't know I don't know how you measure there are people out there smarter than me that maybe you know how to do it but we have to agree that there's a reality out there that's that's independent of all of our points of view right and you can go really deep down a rabbit hole\nYou want to get really philosophical about reality [laughter] which I'm not going to do but it it can go really really deep\nYou know there is a pragmatist the realists and all these other things things I've been reading about lately there's would just I have to read a page five times to understand what the hell they're talking about um\nBut the issue here is you have to have some commonality of perception of of reality in order for us to be able to link together some kind of shared something so that we stay together as a society and I think the more that we have\nWe've gone and we've given rise to the voice of the vocal minority er and crackpots get more of a more attention than they deserve\nThen we start to accept that there is\nObviously a thousand different ways to interpret reality and that they are all valid or no that's not true ... they're not all valid not all of them work you can look at a painting and see see at fifty different ways but not all of them are useful\nYou can look at a at a situation and you can have a you can look at gender you could look at the relationship between men and women you can look at all sorts of things you can look at people's opinions about about different words and this that and the other thing but not all of them are accurate not all of them are are valuable\n\nAnd value is determined over many many years of trial and error and this that and the other thing and so we're living in a time now where we've convinced ourselves that everything is just kind of made up and so why not just tear it all down\n\nSocial norms political norms are relationship\nNorms gender norm also just rip it apart because it's a bunch of garbage anyway ah that philosophy is going to be the destruction of us\nBecause some of those things are useful\n\nAnd so if you you can't run a nation when diversity is our greatest strength because diversity is just another way they said division division is not a strength it depends on what kind of diversity you're talking about diversity of ideas\nIn search of one goal or the and the ... and the search of a diversity of fought with the with the focus on one specific shared value beautiful\nThe kind of diversity that lets everybody do whatever the hell they want to at any point in time if they want to and and change the rules of the road and the rules of the game at any moment of any time not good\n\nSo we have to be specific about what the hell is we're talking about here and I want to live in a nation where we can all kinda you know wherever disagreements will do whatever but we're not going to bomb each other when we\nCan't figure out our stuff I don't want to live there you got kids I've got kids your people you love I've got people I Love\nInvested in this man we're all invested in this in ways you can't even imagine what you might not even understand to realize you're invested in it\nSo you know before we start throwing babies out in the bath water and saying screw the whole thing\nOr burn it all down or you may want to consider yourself a few minutes\nTo realize how much you benefit from the covered construct and figure out a way before you destroy what exists maybe see if we can fix it number one and if we can't fix it before you destroy it figure out a better alternative that's not going to be worse when you take away the old one\n\nYou know kind of like the was it the the the what is the Hippocratic Oath first do no harm and that the whole thing first do no harm\nAnd before you are rip the floor up you want to make sure that there's something underneath it that you can walk on how many more metaphors I Need to come up with you to get my point across I making sense to you I Hope I'm making sense to you because I worry that there is a\nVocal ... radical minority of people who are ready willing and able\nAnd right now in a post Trump world they're mostly on the left to destroy everything because they find certain few things wrong with would exist now and rhetoric about resistance and about fighting this war is that war against this war against that isn't\nHelpful and ... so there you go\nSo that's my take on it or you know and Donald Trump has contributed to it with his bombastic way of doing things in in in in a brand new way that got him elected\nAnd you know and and the fact that he was elected in this weird flu collection we've had has made a lot of people think the worst about other Americans\nAnd that's not the issue and that's not reality the president's walking into this and he's about to take the party makes them they can make some things um and I guess he's going to become a comment about this we want to take this live ... let's take it lives he takes the podium along the trumpet stepping are actually first let's take this\nA ceremony having to something to do
