L. C. S.\nUm so that's you know it's kind of our culture now is that we like to protest and you know in fact really don't matter um you know there's no more dialogue is no more logical position between people that really you know understand what's going on I'm In in the best example of that is if you know I cannot understand how any fair minded person could have listened\nTo the floor speech by Susan Collins and not conclude that it was the right thing to do to ... confirmed judge Kavanaugh I don't know how you could do that\nOr if you listen to what she said and and you you know you took it all in in in assuming it's actual which you know certainly have no reason to believe that it's not factual um that's what the Senate is supposed to do its advice and consent the Senate doesn't get to pick the nominee based on who they like uh they have to see if there is some overwhelming compelling reason to not confirmed\nA and if there isn't and it doesn't come up to and they're using the grand jury Stan more likely than not are then you get confirmed the president gets to pick you know ... once told me when he was the United states senator he said you know what the president gets to pick his team that's just the way it works\nUh and that's part of why you will elect a president and then a lot of people I Know voted\nFor Donald Trump you know it kind of held their nose and voted for Donald Trump they weren't John from wasn't her first choice but they voted for Donald Trump because they knew that he was going to have the ability to support a in a point you know conservative Supreme Court justices Gorsuch certainly could snap mold and and now Kevin uh uh we didn't see this kind of outpouring with Gorsuch\nI think largely because he was replacing Antonin Scalia\nOr was already a conservative votes so it didn't change the makeup of the court but now with Kavanaugh or if in fact you subscribe to the philosophy that he's a conservative now the court is decidedly more conservative than it was\nA and he's not a judicial activist he's a ... an originalist in constitutional interpretation so\nAh but that's the thing with protests I think we're gonna we're all going to get the Yankees fans up to Boston to protest the outcome in the last game\nOr out in front of Fenway Park for three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WPRI big protests going on at the state house if or anything else breaks there we will bring it you live I Will make sure that you're up to speed on that uh and when we come back on your phone calls like you tell me that somebody please tell me what the actual trailers doing\nA good cause you for not trying to win a gubernatorial race that's for sure that we've established a but if somebody can explain it to me I'd love to hear from four to eight nine seven seven six eight hundreds reach you on WB you're back with more after the cigarette [noise]\n\n\nSouthern New England we kept on TALK six thirty seven FM W.

P. R. O. or one eight hundred three two one WPRI oh\nMan it's twelve fifty one John often back with you on the John often radio broadcasts where you can be part of the show you know we were talking during the break is always happens right you you guys miss out on this because we end up talking during the break and we find out other interesting stuff you guys in the elevator yeah we got to tell me about the elevator\nI it's a freight elevator that we basically are using as a passenger elevators for the museum some panorama um we've got a special permit to do it we have the passenger elevated coming in um ... it looks like me of a twenty\nOne where do you get ... where do you find an elevator where you where do you shop for an hour you go on line it's\nNot cheap it's an asset and and there's only the problem right now is is only a few companies that it can actually handle putting the men so\nWith the demand it takes a while to get it and so all the wait till may yeah yeah it's going to we had a special or it because of the the chef size that that that don't fit in and right and also it just takes time for them to have to open up to be able to do the work\nThat's fascinating yeah ... you don't think about that it's a you know just people don't have elevated or some people I give them their homes but yeah most people don't but the ... just one of those old\nFashioned kind of you to him down and you're right it's it's rated for forty five hundred pounds writing so I really I have yeah we actually for those who are nervous we put a church Pew in it so they can sit down and say a prayer [laughter] and you know\nAt that time people seem to really love it and we we have an operator so it's not anything you're operating on your own writing them when their union operator I yeah I haven't I I didn't bring with me but I had my licence\nLicensed operate now I've got a pilot's license without on an elevator and I think the exams probably a little harder and actually it is [laughter]\nI bet it obviously I pass the pilot exams okay be that hard for three eight nine Seventy seven six or you get any question but the the um the cyber meal at Clark Kobe's really something to see they panorama as you were saying closes um Monday\nNight yeah and that's how you what what are your hours down there a nine to five so nine to five and you can get down there Monday it'd be a great day trip pack up the kids and and had to be blown away by New Bedford haven't been a long time are you going to be absolutely blown away my wife showed me a little um seafood place that\nSells retail seafood it's like a cooperative it's like the fisherman all got together and started this little cooperative thing and they bring the fish right off the boat yes just a wonderful as by clean I've never been in a fish market there was this clean is that it was incredible and just nice nice people in great prices you know so it's a good place to to just poke around\nAnd why they're taking the are taking the mill or in the panoramic because the panorama really people don't realize I think what a what a huge thing wailing was backing it said it uh it really was like the oil industry you know it was that big has\nAn ... everything ran off whale oil you know not cars obviously 'cause it didn't happen but all the lamps and everything like that ran off oil\nA and even here in Rhode Island we had uh people are familiar with a clinic island the very far typical couldn't have gotten this place called common fence point him back in the Eighteen hundreds it was filled with will run to replace they would they would get the the whale meat will blubber I guess you go out there and they would bring it to these places and it has to be rendered into usable loyal\nAnd those factories were everywhere so you know you had all of this huge industry and\nAnd that panorama really kind of brings you back in time to show you what it was like and everything back then there was no technology everything was manual you you know you had to get on a boat with put cameras up and sailed out into the ocean and find the whales and ... and what not to get them in so uh it's fascinating

throughout the day on Capitol Hill and at the Supreme Court\nI spoke to an organizer for the day to get a group or they said that there were injuries they certainly they rescue uh I did not see anybody arrested here in terms of what it was very safe for everybody how to protesters which much larger\nA called until we stopped that said how's the real a real race to rest and they they did they backed off\nArea that trade takes a great great problem it's\nLike uh they moved back ... yelled at each other for a while it was a coup or\nProviding security for their richness Marxism group just what they call themselves as John right a at again they're they're ... that's a nice word in fact I posted a really long video on our Facebook page if you order\nYou want to see some of the some of the people yelling at each other about cars because these charges are just are going to get it broke up a safe place to get where they were not messing around this time there was a similar gathering back in August and the raid\nA number of people were arrested the danger that rally at the police were looking for somebody who's bagging a bucket of thought of one of the week we didn't we didn't see

there was this marches and people claim that this is a free speech sort of uh\nThere's going to have for the rights to free speech\nA you know it's it's really hard to [laughter]\nThat's good\nFor protesting about it you know the ... a group that can they get it right they claim that they're All right sort of group in Philly it'd\nTake groups and things like that so yeah a lot of yelling screaming\nThere in the ocean state for in favor of hate group is is that group exist to\n[laughter] no I'm not aware of it no not not that I that that is every artist I talked to the organized they're very artist and they're feeling that they do not think that\nThis rhetoric belong here in Rhode Island and then the cook the risk is Marxism you know how many people John were you know I don't know professional protesters this the right word but you know certainly people it it's not their first rodeo [laughter] you know it's ... ... demonstrating a\nI mean who could be in favor of Marxism on the one side and be in favor of hate and the other side what am I missing\nIt's a you know it's hard [laughter] because in the market as society would not be able to protest against hate theoretically\nAre very they're very upset the state police they still going to get back to be taken into custody anybody or insurance so it looks like everything is the first one was hurt\nAnd I'd like to thank you and I\nThink that they know cats here and there was a book that went up I don't like it wasn't as I walked over there and I have a fact I have I have no idea what that was but you know it was ten they're yellow lab other I'll tell you that they don't like each other\n[laughter] ... thank you for covering that and and staying safe or in in in the bargain to it's a you don't want to get caught up in events over there and in a maintain your personal situational awareness and safety measures and I and I thank you for that report\nLearn learn from the best from your kind of\nA bill ... thank you very much our news director bill Hammond who was on the scene at the state of yeah so the one group claims that they're against Marxism\nOkay I get that is there a group in Rhode Island that's in favor of marks is Marxism as you know is the totalitarian communist beliefs that basically launched the Soviet Union um and you know Stalin and all those people and Carl Marx\nAnd Lenin not John Lennon but um\nYeah what was his first name was not John ... who was the beetle there'll be ... um ... uh I don't know\nAnyway some Russian guy a and so the other group against hate or which I I'm all for that I'm I'm pretty much against hate to I think we do is that right\nSide of me and you take like Nikolai Lenin flattening you sure that's what it's coming up and then then let's see I thought it was ... I don't know this has led me on landing in the revolutionary\nAll right well what do I know we're we're three six eight ... somebody could explain to me what's going on you know who's protesting what I I think they're both groups should be pretty much in agreement right I mean they the ... we don't like hate people should agree with that we don't like Marxism people\nBecause in March the society that we don't like eight people would not be allowed to protest they would they would just be\nYou know sent off to camps to be re educated um so um I I Would think to both camps would be in agreement I yeah I just don't get all the protesting that we do now a days and who has time for this and us time to go out and protest and you know and maybe that's the best way is is if we you know build up the economy the point where everybody's got jobs\nNobody will have time to go protest too busy making money or maybe that's the answer or who knows but uh it's it's fascinating to me that you actually have a group because you know begs the question if it's ocean state against hate is there an ocean state in favor of hate and in a\nWhile I bet those are fun meetings for three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WPRI and the other groups against Marxism which sounds on its face to be looked pretty credible um I Can't think of why we would want to have Marxist running around the state of Rhode Island\nUm unless it's Groucho Marx uh and you know so it seems to me the both group should be able to find a significant amount of common ground you know if they sat down around a table\nInstead of you know across the lawn at the state house yelling at each other what am I missing for three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WB or maybe a gym and tumbling can explain it to be Jim you're on the John ... thanks for calling\nI John actually taking my call I I I I I just turn the radio on and I just I don't I don't know exactly the full extent\nOf it I'll get up and said you know you get these two groups protesting at the state house and you got a little tense and do some yelling and a police in riot gear and all that in one group was called um I guess they they were against marches resist Marxism and the other group is called ocean state against hate or but apparently they disagree on major fundamental\nIssue [laughter] I'm not sure what those disagreements consist of and that's what we like to the bottom of\nThe reason I called is I I I thought I heard you ask a couple of questions like your paper Marxism will be paper eight right and I go out or when I agree I I don't know who would actually officially even if they work with your favorite hate but I'm telling you\nAh you know I'm I'm involved in theater kind of off the side and I have a lot of friends bushel media friends who I talk to you know even though I disagree politically with him [noise]\nBut when you when I go through my threat you know my rent there there's a lot of people who are ... ... talk to them a lot of ... professor the boxes and boxes but I I honestly this is my personal opinion I think half the Democrat Party\n[laughter] even though they don't even realize it or not\nTo ask them questions about their ideology in the world you would wind up then it's a ... like Eric\n... well maybe so I Know [laughter] you may\nYou may disagree but I that's my that's my opinion and I I'm telling you I don't know\nAbout this group that without their anti ... probably ... joined them yeah I mean back by that's my\nThanksgiving I appreciate that yeah maybe somebody can help us sort this out for me I mean it it's you know it occurs to me that that um people who sell profess in this day and age is marks is don't know what marches ms that's that's the only logical explanation for why somebody living in you know the greatest old most open society the world has ever seen\nWould be in favor of Marxism is somebody who doesn't understand what Marxism truly is\nUm in in you know the other group they hate group I I think there's a lot of common ground and I think if instead of protesting if they all you know maybe ordered Chinese or in sat around a big table um they could pass round egg rolls and find out that they agree on most of what they're talking about I I Can't imagine that\nYou know the the hate people are pro Marxism or the marches and people are pro hey you know the anti market I think it is getting very confusing\nIn so that that right away tells you that these are people probably more interested in protesting um and just trying to find a a a reason to protest than they are the specific cause because this makes absolutely no sense to me\nMore three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WPRI that is the toll free number you can also email a broadcast John L at six thirty W.

do it if you're an independent you've got to the last democratic votes and the only way you're gonna feel of democratic votes is to get prominent Democrats to stand next to you and say you work is because think about if you can't convince an elected official\nTo come out and stand with you to go against the sitting Democrat governor then how are you going to get the loyal democratic voters\nGoing to vote for that democratic governor because they're Democrats in because you can come and governor if you can't convince the elected officials you're not going to convince the end of

an extreme they telegraph to from day one what they would do to him I I think he he was damaged I I think his temperament why I I don't think it was quite there I think he could have component him so that I did\nBut but but that said I I if if I was putting the same shoes um perhaps\nMissed the Maxwell wouldn't give a clinical trial I wouldn't give a crap about his Ira she's got a short yeah I guess so okay he's Irish let's call it is okay here's you mean as he got his Irish half as good as Irish and that was my next thing okay\nSo let's senator Collins was the last holdout a main
