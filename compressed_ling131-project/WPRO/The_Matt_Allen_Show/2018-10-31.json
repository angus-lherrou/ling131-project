things get so bad that you can't support them anymore that you have to end them and now we have this thing where we know that there's been at least allegations gets one member of the general

right [laughter] it's\nThe only one that's still has this being the thing in my the only one wants truth injustice\nI don't know I mean I Try to be a boy scout dish or anything here but I'm just you know when it especially\nWhen it comes to inter personal relationships in the corporate environment and the stickiness that goes with you know relationships that their friendships and then somebody takes it too far and has assumptions those illicit human relationships especially those people who are of the opposite sex can be complex\nAnd signals can be missed frost and all this other stuff that's always possible and so there's all kinds of gray area\nIn this issue and ultimately\nYou know that's why you need to have truth that's why you need to find out what's going on their people to make their own judgments but in my mind when it comes down to the allegations like this the point where people can't be in the same room grown adults can't get along you know it's been years worth of harassment\nThat's got to that's the truth is going to come out about that she was going to come out about that\nI Will talk about we come back for three eight oh you'll be all over the toll free

B. R. O. over some inappropriate posts going back to his college days we\nOf of of ferocious this or at least of intensity you tell me but the key here is a state representative who may or may not come out and say anything she said so far he is confirmed that email is real and then says as said nothing else it speaks for itself\nBut you know in this day and age the people now are trying to figure out what happened here and I don't know about you I don't take this lately this is not this is not a joke\nI don't want to do you want to general assembly or any legislative body anywhere where people in charge allow for people to sexually harassed others and protect them\nI don't\nKnow contrary to popular belief about how all men are evil and uh you know where all us combat parts of the patriarchy or I don't like that\nI don't like losers\nWho uh you know for whatever reason I think it's the it's the females or the prerogative of the project she's me a burden to sit there and to get harassing phone calls or Texas or any others other crap\nOr if you do something like that and your abusive to women as far as I'm concerned your lower than the other piece of gum I picked up the bottom of my shoe last week\nAnd you don't\nSomething one way and mean at the other and all that stuff that happens all the time\n\nBut it seems to me in and not doing this in a way that is trying to victim blame anybody or say anything or try to victimize anybody twice if you are someone who is uh in in possession of evidence that your colleague\nA and you have proven you've gone to leadership about it at your colleague is somehow harassing you\nTo the point where you can't be don't want to be the only one year legislation in front of the person in the committee you have to bring it forward you have to tell that story now that it's public you have to tell that story and maybe use this opportunity is way to advocate for a legitimate constitutional process\nThrough which legislators who do things to one another\nHave redress in some way shape or form so that these allegations aren't use this political weapons they're not used to to to throw mud at people and then kind of go okay that's it\nBecause if allegations of sexual harassment start to become politicized than they will not be taken seriously\n\nAnd assuming the best intentions of every one which could be the worst thing I've ever done but let's go through with it anyway assuming the best intentions of every one I Can't imagine anybody wants that\n\nAlthough believe me I Know that there are ideologues out there who are real sick puppies who look at a political debate not as a chance to change minds into shift consensus but as but something about some things in the political debate to use as on defend double weapons\nTo destroy their political enemies to get their ideology through by hook or by crook believe me there are a progressive out there like that there are politicians of all stripes I like that but the ... the radicals on the progressive side have have absolutely no compunction\nIn\nLiving the ends justify the means type of type of attitude\nAnd\nThat being used on that that philosophy being made a parent's end or even just a left open as a possibility is a danger to the real victims of real abuse in real harassment that deserve\nJak says right we don't want that right justice for people to process\nI mean the only one no maybe write my numbers for three eight WNPR oh the toll free number one eight hundred three two one WNPR oh you can email me mad at six three zero WPRI dot com\nAnd the last hour laying out a lot of the case talking to Ted an easy given the latest on what's going on here so I Want to give you the ability to comment on this\nAnd I'll let you do that as long as people are interested but ultimately there is to me one way that we can get to the bottom of this is getting to the bottom of this is on anybody's list\nThat's for representative 'cause area to come forth and to tell people what happened\nAnd what she's alleging the ditch the text messages that as her colleagues have said there's no air and Reagan burgers quoted in the story today saying that he knows that she can she said things about this and do with this it's time to end it\nTime to bring it to the forefront time to stop people like this from doing what they do if it's a legit and\nThat's awful\nPolitics of destroying somebody for political gain is just it's is is ... it's basically like it like I said before it's like looking at your house doing something like that is like\nLooking at your house seen as a crack foundation radical and my friends over crack ex blowing up the house because let's start over again\nThat's not the way you do business you don't change the game by destroying the game especially not in the game works Ninety percent of the time right so that's what we need\nAnd it's not about you know ah yeah I understand the uh well intentioned idea of victims can deserve to\nCome forth and the way that they want to and how they want to and they don't have to whatever ... fine you don't have to do anything but at the end of the day if you want real change and you want people who are actual perpetrators to suffer the consequences for their perpetrators should you have to come\nForward you have to come forward\nYou do now unfortunately here represented ...\nIf you take the story for its face value most likely had nothing to do with this year though I don't think she leak this thing she confirmed it was real so once again we have a situation where somebody is suffering is being used\nAs a way to get this out without their permission you know she a willing participant or in a reluctant participant I don't know\nI don't know that answer again only she can answer that question and until that it's all um\nFoggy innuendo and uh you know and not all of it but some of its fog you and your window and wondering what's happening and some genes made and are going the shoe of a campaign\nAnd at the end of the day when it comes to making the plays a better place to live or calling out people were perpetrators we get nowhere\nThat's not good for anybody\nSo there you go that's my take when we come back we'll take yours my numbers for three eight WNPR oh the toll free number one eight hundred three two one WNPR oh you're next on the matter

tonight for five to nine six is a fascinating story you know we there was\nIt really there's sometimes when you watch the politics of something um you can see it for Strategic creates\nThe body as opposed to the the message itself when I first saw this mailer a bunch of Republicans had received a mailer that showed Joe turtles shaken hands with with Donald Trump in was basically\nIt rode the line\nIt was really just brilliantly done in terms of strategy\nIt rode the line of\nOf being a negative or positive mailer\nFor for Joe trauma\nYou know depending on your point of view of Donald Trump now this evidently the majority of these things were sent to Republicans so you would say ostensibly Republicans viewed Donald Trump in a positive way or at least not negative right\nSo if you get this for Republican households get this mailer and see Joe troll shaken hands with the president you would interpret it as a pro shrill oh\nMarilyn the thing is it was sent\nOut by the Democratic party in the state [noise] the Democratic party sent these mailers out to Republicans now why would they do that well if asked\n[laughter] you know if asked well we're we're tying Trump Detroit lower being negative against Joe trailer\nWhat'd you say that the Republicans\nWell we're just being ... well some Democrats go too I'm sure there's like two Democrats out there that got the damn thing but the fact of the matter is what the Democrats were doing\nIs they're trying to\nCreate discord\nAmongst the conservative voters out\nThere or in this case where you know likely Republican voters and get them to you know take siphon votes away from Alan ... and go for ... split the votes Gina Raimondo can get elected\nThat's what they're doing they are that they are the fun campaign is putting out this ah this this campaign finance filing that has basically the Democratic party in the state or claiming mailers as an incoming contribution\nTo the Raimondo campaign so the the actual Democrats out there have said you know we we basically spent now according to this Providence journal story about this today a Patrick Anderson writes that the um the ... the the state wide party which is basically the same thing is that that's the governor's campaign it's a bunch of horsemen or\nI'm as had to claim on financial disclosure forms that they made a ... you know in time contribution otherwise we didn't give you money but we did something on your behalf that's has value to it monetary value and it was a mailer\nNow why does a mailer\nSent to Republicans shake your joke trailer shaking hands with the president and and and and linking him to President Trump benefit Gina Raimondo 'cause it splits other votes besides her voters or ... ostensibly tries to do that creates chaos on the other side\nAnd uh and if if if ... wanted to a governor you should've got at the Republican race as simple as that\nWell you know normally I listen I have so many different arguments against that I can I
