shouldn't have put ... I can never sit right politics surrounding yeah people trying to please political and find sources for things that are new sources for\nAnd so we'll try and work that all out and is there anything we can physically or you know verbally do about it I don't know mhm I'm Bob ... said something interesting about the um right leaning candidates and the governor's race promising claw backs of pension reform he doesn't believe them\nAnd what was that would set off Michael rally or was it on a lively experimental I Love ... yeah yeah\nUm so that's going to be interesting to mask union folks about that and then we'll going to get into the governor's race a little bit one of his anybody's undecided yet\nYeah to allow she's a big old and I are wrong week in this whole coming out from channel twelve tonight five o'clock\nAnd then the you have some groups out there who are just um well they're just that I don't understand is a lot in a lot of ways the channel ten stories that they have about the sticker on the Providence Journal is driving me crazy yeah yeah I mean because just because\nA lot of us on on line [noise]\nHow much is that Israel tower\nWas on lines equal bugs in the

double the news the noontime several images of water spans are emerging off the vineyard alone is strong thunderstorms moving through the south and east of prominence is triggered a series of tornado warnings to some of the bureau accuweather meteorologist deep Samuel\nBut you know it's interesting I I Want to talk to a little bit about this uh this first hour the show anyway the idea that\nThe um [noise] that the the shooting that took place over the weekend in Pittsburgh said something about us and\nThere's a lot of uh politicizing what happened over the weekend there's a lot of soul searching I think which ultimately is a good thing I Hope well it depends what comes out of it anyway there is a lot of um questioning about you know the usual suspects\nThe Rhode Island coalition against gun violence today put out a press release that is so India logically damaged it's ... it's just it's\nUnbelievable I you know they'd taint the world to in the world for your political goals and politicizing the death of people is really just it's grotesque it's gross 'em and and you know there's nothing that you could have it just it's just so it's so but now to do the same thing over and over and over again\nIt's just enough so you know whatever with them but the idea that there is something that we could have done that there is something we can do a is\nOne that human beings Clinton too because we always want to prevent horrible things from happening happening and then that that in itself\nIs a great thing about us\nUm\nWhen I see people like this guy who\nWent into a synagogue where people innocent people sitting there and and participating in a sacred act whatever that act might have been where there was a I Know there was original reports were ... um well I think there's a naming ceremony or just a just just observing the Sabbath\nUm it it it I said when that happens when somebody does something like that we it shakes us to our core because there are places in our lives that we have deemed that is so sacred\nThat you know when evil perpetrate the penetrates them it's almost in and and exacerbate nation of the actual crime itself like murders bad enough when you do it in a holy place in a place of worship where individuals um are literally connecting with that very thing\nThat in my opinion makes us connects all of us right no matter where it is we're all searching for that thing that the giant unifier that giant um\nThat that source whenever you or whatever your source may be\nUm where where hopefully in there to try and find a connection to that together it's something I think\nThe most um most healthy human beings look for\nUm and so when you're healthy human being that's trying to figure out the cause most your place in it\nUm your and connect to other other people in your community as well as other humans in general trying to live a moral life\n... you know to to the lessons that have been taught by your ancestors for thousands of years there's a ... there's a level of that that when evil penetrates that\nThat it's a it's something that shakes us shakes his to our core and to me it's it's part of the normal healing process trying to figure out is there anything we could have done to stop this from happening uh and maybe sometimes it's not necessarily what we could have done to stop it from happening\nBut maybe make it so that a couple of things happen one that the result of it is it worse is you know the results of what happens afterwards is made worse by it but also\nI'm a find it easy to think that way and find it easy to live and to and to plan to perpetrate what they did\nAnd ultimately you have to first understand why they did what they did in order to get there and figure that all out so it's a very complex thing and that's what I think about but ultimately what I Do whenever I start to get ... get it started to get really um [noise] modeling\nWhen I start to see these things when they when they happen what do you see you know somebody who's so obviously filled with with just ... just hatred for a whole group of people that he is now deemed\nYou know in his mind corrupt for some strange reason what whatever the reason he's he's either taken in his brain or seen and as manifested in whatever it whatever his motivation was um you know he's created this motivation now can we ever understand it probably\nNot probably not\nBut I think what we can do is we can reject in our in our in our everyday lives in our conversations with each other anything that looks like what he did what he thought I should say\nAnd\nThe idea of judging an entire group of people who happened to belong or do I should say to judging individuals' by their membership in a in a in a group of people should be a boring no matter what side of the Ayelet comes from no matter who it is\n\nEither ... condemning demonizing or celebrating\nOr virtue signaling anybody\nOther than those who have individually earned it is something that we have got to eliminate from our conversations and this is in our society\n\nAnd one begets the other quite frankly right\n\nWhat this guy did the evil of what he did is not the besides the part of the ... going in and and killings human beings the extra part of the evils of the reason why it's so offensive to us is that he did so under the guys that every individual in there wasn't an individual\nThey were part of a group\nIn that group and author of itself was collectively hell bent on doing some whatever nefarious nonsense you came up with his mind\nDayton 'cause it's not only that he went in there and and and and took the lives of people but he also the reasons motivation for taking the lives of those people is that he sat there and he he condemned all of them\n\nFor being somebody that he determined on his own that they were without ever finding out if they actually were\n\nAnd that is something that we do all the time when I talk about identity politics that's what I'm Talking about\nThat's what I'm Talking about\nYou wouldn't want to get to the core of of ... which I should say the core of it because there's a lot of reasons why psychopaths do what's psychopaths due to say there's one thing we can do to stop all this from happening is not here's a way we can make it a little bit better here's one way we don't make it worse how 'bout that\nSomething that we can control\nIs to stop anybody from judging anybody based on some some form of group identity\n\nWhether it be somebody who's black who's Muslim sous Jewish shoes whatever but also who's white who's straight who's ... who's rich who's poor who's a all these things\n\nIf we can get back to where I don't know eighty five Ninety percent of the time we judge each other based on each other I have no problem with judging people\nBy the way by their actions by their words no problem with that but when you do it as as a group\n\nThat you're taking away the fundamental individuality of all these people that's all I could think about all weekend long it's how many individuals were in that place that were there were either wounded or killed that were ... they happened to all be Jewish faith right I Would imagine I actually I don't even know that to be true I've got to go ... go through I Know the identified all them\nThat could have been people there who weren't Jewish which just happened to be in the place I I don't know I assume that they all were\nBut to assume that everybody who walks around with either a Jew and an interesting about ... about being Jewish is that it's a an ethnicity it's a it's a um a it's a religion it's kind of a an amalgamation of a bunch of different things right\nUm and so you know to to judge an individual person based on that grouping is is it the\nWrong way to do anything it's a wrong way to do anything\nBecause you take away the spark from all those people\nYou take away what they may agree with what they might have stood for the good than it might have done now where you know they're the bad it is all part of it\nIs why no matter what your political out you know whatever your ideology happens to be whether you believe in small government big government little medium size whatever it is we can all rally around the idea\nThat the sacredness and the sanctity of the individual is necessary so that we all don't get grouped into little tribes\nConditions have changed since then a couple of high profile suspects in court today the accused democratic mail bomb or in the ...

B. R. prominence your election central headquarters\nGood afternoon and the revolution soft wash new center I'm Paul's and Gary what the one o'clock WPRI news\nAs we hear from officials in Pittsburgh that the suspect the synagogue shooter Robert Bowers is due in court this afternoon Rhode islanders plan to come together on the east side early this evening Adam ... who chairs the Rhode Island Jewish alliance tells WPRI rose to our grand a hand the local response to the outrage in Pittsburgh has been heartening\nWe've been so grateful for the outpouring of support from the entire Rhode Island community and and we really felt it was important to get the community an opportunity to come together to feel to it to pray for the victims\nPriority you'd think if you do have political sway in some way shape or form the only reason why you have political sway is the so that you can protect people's pay and benefits and whatever from from undue influence\nOr from unfairness working conditions\nWe as we know unions have become deeply political they are basically uh another arm of the Democratic party in Rhode Island specifically\nAnd they have 'em in some cases in my opinion anyway sold their souls for that fact\nAnd one of the cases that you may think that in because ... and shown that that there is not um at least the main concern your benefits and your pay is there the idea that they've now endorsed Gina Raimondo even though she has been a the leader of the pension movement of pension reform\nUm you know I think that looking back now at the pension reform issue of which I was very supportive at the time is that I I Believe gene are among those numbers\nAnd ah the union didn't the union so there's ways of doing this that you don't have to attack it the way it is and and then the subsequent a strategy of investment that you have the pension system and that tobacco\nWhich type ... estimates you could have cost and I say cost and the way that we didn't earn up to five hundred million dollars on how you know that and higher\nI you know you can pick and choose whatever that's hindsight is always twenty twenty\nBut the issue here is to me is that is at least some consistency and and and I don't know what people in unions are thinking right now um if you are truly if you're truly about\nUm about your pay your benefits and your union protecting those things how people like Bob Wolff can come up in public and defend\nGina Raimondo number one but then kinda laugh off the idea that Alan falling last week was the last I think it was last week that Allen Fung came out and said that he would uh it was last week was endorsed by Ted ... who the union by the way hired to look into and to do an investigation into the pension system\nWas endorsed by the guy they hired he worked for them\nHe was his promise to to look into it and to figure out and figure out a way to claw back some of the coal is and give money back to people joke trailer did the same thing and said he was gonna look at trying to get some people some cola money back and whether or not you think that they are Johnny come lately and all this other stuff\nAt least you know somebody who's trying to literally ... I say I should say literally but you know maybe it's a little depends on I was somebody's trying to give you something for something other words support me and we'll do this for you\nOr why wouldn't you at least go that way first or at least stay neutral so you don't take that person off or at least work towards somebody who is supposed to give you a better and more stable um benefits indoor pay\nSo this was brought up on a lively experiment this past weekend Jim almost like the litter the first question Huml asked um\nBubble she's on the panel um and and you ask Bob walls and there was ... Laymon was there it was a Lee in Selma Hayek who was a Republican a pet for from the Libertarian Party and so you'll hear the question from home\nAnd then the subsequent response from Bob Walsh and a pet for the Libertarian Party here or I think the kind of rounds out the conversations want to play him too and and then I'm going to ask the people out there who are members have used were retirees um again\nWhat you think of what the what the union is doing here that are endorsing a great in the union doesn't hold your hand walk into the voting booth with you and tell you what to do but this is your money and your resources and your leadership\nKind of you know taking a very in my opinion idiot logical view over a practical one listened to the response to the question the response and we'll talk about Bob\nI understand you know we haven't had you on for a while you finally decided on a candidate you're on the fence we did and ... uh we endorse Gina Raimondo for governor and happily so that way or the or not no I I think\nA subset of our members are still very pained by what happened in uh with the pensions and they'll never get over that and they're probably not going to vote for the governor but we looked at the broader we're not a single issue organization we looked at the broader palate of issues or support for the school construction bonds support for\nUniversal kindergarten working on universal pre K working on education funding um and and she spent a lot of time in the last year going around and meeting with groups of teachers in education and support professionals of folks we represent\nAn Israeli listening to my mind when you're way everything and the balance and you looked at the lineup of candidates\nI'm as a as I think I said at one of our meetings so we get to pick our dance partner or even though we've had our feet stepped on a couple of times or we think this is the right dance partner for us for the next four years to move forward island forward and move or education in public sector labor for\nAlan fall in the last couple of weeks is really starting to hone in on some of the witnesses with talking more about you have more recently about the pension situation 'cause as Bob Said there's some people who just aren't going to get over that\n... had found out that cannot fulfilled\nOver ... ... for the call is that like ... you know\nUm and actually let's not fool functioning foreign LA that let's find how ... how much of that money is coming to Washington fight is that if I don't care for people who can't be happening to her that it that that was made for baseball and I think that\nEspecially if I Need to look at it in nature and not just as fast\nPulling science kind of filing a mine\nAnd they go back out of order 'cause this I suppose is my topic and this is my way into my outrage unless I call an auto okay so we're we're worried that we've got and and and I like\nMarathon or offices and Cranston and and we we've always had a good relationship with him but both a Allan Fung joked furlough\nHave suddenly discovered the pension issue I'm folks suffered a great deal of pain on the pension issue and for them to suddenly say oh we're going to restore your coal is we are going to do there's going to that\nInterviewed as part of their fellow mayor ... and I and he mentioned that and I say you want to restore them\nIt's there's no credibility there and it's wrong to play with those people's emotions right into your point I think we're waiting for the next Kenny to announce that they're going to actually doubled the meat on free taco day I have a terrier that these claims but I'm going to take the opposite approach first of all pension reform needed to happen\nIt it remains to this day the only accomplishment genome I can actually points to her entire tenure as a governmental official\nIt needed to happen what didn't need to happen was hard to sell out the pension systems who're Wall Street interests\nAnd give away all that money that she took away from working families so it's a combination of factors ultimately politicians have and will continue to lie about the viability and the upper ability of pension systems defined pen than at the plant systems in a state\nThat is a state financially essentially these pension systems are one or two market corrections away from insolvency\nAnd that's the subject that needs to be discussed and it hasn't\nI was prepared for it in there because he comes down with a hammer of reality at the end with the you know like what four [laughter] when ... you're on the ah [noise] but anyway\nBut the issue there to me is that it's fascinating to me it's it's as if you're a union person right and you listen to Bob Walsh now this is ... you may think that they have no credibility okay you may think the guys like ... have no credibility okay\nBut they ... you have them telling you that they're going to work to get this done\nYou have the ability to offer up some kind of a political or support in exchange for getting that done\n\nI'm no you can ... Johnny ... political it's all political it's it's it's basically without actually buying somebody it's a political promise that they're making in order to get votes this is what happens in politics right you can pick it's cynical you can tickets hypocritical whatever it's fine\nBut when faced with somebody who is going to tell you\nThat it is what it is we screwed you that's it versus somebody like you got screwed and maybe we can work to fix it\nI'm unless you're just a democratic ideologue who wants to you know all the other crap that he mentioned there there were early childhood this that and the other whatever that nonsense that is\nUm why\nWould you care about that stuff and not have I mean it's it's fascinating to me what do you think about somebody you know or by the union whose mindset is about it seems to me that that Bob Walsh there are speaking on behalf of NEA our eyes kind of said that you can screw with our pensions\nAnd\nThat's not fine but it's something you can do because we won't ever leaves you anyway\nWe'll primary you will make you will make you pay ... will make you pay a little bit with the with a a a with a primary but we'll never leave the yard\nYou know we may pull on the chain a little bit we may dig holes we may be on your favorite bushes but we're a good dog will never leave the yard will never run away to somebody else's yard so don't worry as long as you uh play\nWPRI sports Boston planning a big party on Wednesday duck boat snow to celebrate the world series winning Red Sox and tonight ... buffalo you can hear it here on WNPR oh the pregame covered starts five forty five\nFrom the sea scape Christmas steak or whether center accuweather meteorologist stave Samuels says that tornado warning for block island now just a memory this afternoon breezy periods of brain and the thunderstorms it'll hire fifty nine\nClear in breezy tonight low thirty seven a sunny day tomorrow with a high a fifty one on Wednesday the sun mixes with clouds but a high up there around sixty degrees right now we do have fifty eight degrees here at the weather\nStation [noise] from the w._b. our road traffic center and enjoy Solano insurance agency in regional traffic\nSponsored by Burlington make Burlington coat headquarters for your family and save up to sixty five percent off other retailers prices everyday Burlington stores are packed with anorexia buffers and the hottest logo loves plus ... scarves and hats Burlington style for everyone\nThe old grist mill tavern three Ninety full river avenue in seekonk is offering a traditional dining experience with the Martin twist the old grist mill tavern on line at OGSM tavern dot com\nWouldn't it be great if you could get bottom home business lifetime retirement insurance from one agency well that's where the ... comes and they can help protect what's important in the in the wind simplify unite\nSeasons on line or agency in Greenville Cumberland North Providence and to pass it gives them a call today at four O. one nine point nine Fifteen Fifteen nationwide is on your side nationwide mutual insurance company in affiliates Columbus ohio underwriting guidelines for human in front of them\nHave you thought about hair restoration maybe looked into it but keep putting it off the final hair restoration center is individual graph technique or I G T alleviates many of the concerns people have about ... it's a highly advanced car free procedure that moves your own hair one\nFollicle at a time without the use of ... giving you a denser a more natural look\nThese the final hair restoration center is the only you practice in New England that performs this unique I.

know this you have to get the general assembly line you to get all this stuff\nUm it seems to me that if you're an organization that that is first and foremost about making sure that people\nGet the things that they were promised and that their contract means something supposedly it's one of those weird things man I don't understand that the union idea here this is why they get they get the rapid they get that they're an ideological group of people rather than actually are representing\nFirst and foremost the interest of workers and retirees specifically right so if you're a union member out there and you listen to this\nYou know the head of your unit they've actually endorsed governor among do she's the one that mess with your retirement and and\nAnd then you know and some you could say it was justified it gets there wasn't justify that some people when I'm arguing here I'm just arguing whether or not I'm shocked that was the white is that union members you know it's the one thing they won't do that a good dogs on the chain of poetry and a little bit they'll dig some holes in the yard but they won't go into anybody else's yard man\nThat's one thing they won't do know that the union leadership you pay for them you pay for their salaries you pay for their uh you know you pay your membership dues for all their their but sometimes you maybe you get to their political causes oh the jazz um\nBut the ... and the whole a house of cards come crumbling down when you walk away from from I Would think well I Would let me ask you do the walls come crumbling down on these
