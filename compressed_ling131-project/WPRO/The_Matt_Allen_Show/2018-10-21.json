by\nOur next lobbied all joined here in Chicago it matrix that coach Bill Belichick checking coach a sixty minute game for your guest Kansas City you guys went three in a row of what was the message message this week about getting it right when it on the road\nA there was everything that was the message is weak and um that's a good opportunity for the bears are excellent football than good in all three phases of the game and I'm a good good solid sixty minute effort from all three units went today\nThirty points thirty eight and of course forty three and when it gets Kansas City all federally seems like you guys are getting in a rhythm is that fair to say\nI'm well we'll see you know last week last week but um hopefully we can we can put something like on the board\nTo run again line of scrimmage or the building of the that's the line with us today and I then opens up the passing game for you guys sort of complementary football they're not that\nYeah so there's nothing better than being able to handle the ball and they get solid games and not being as long heritage situations I'm like we were in uh the Jacksonville Detroit game so hopefully we can avoid that\nRide on a Chicago here and talk to you this week about Maggie and of course his relationship with Andy Reid offensively when you watch them I Know the quarterback or a little bit different little more athletic quarterback this week with the leg but how much you had to city help your preparation for Chicago here today\nWhere you watch the homes warm up but it's off the back foot spin it this way that way arms lot it doesn't matter comes out like al way which is very rigid in his drop in his delivery\nUh but I think I'd be more concerned on thirty three and four today but this guy will pick up pick it up what his legs were run at reduction and they're going to try and go little power I rented that you're so we'll see what he does I don't think we're we're in for what we face last week with a Patrick miles\nSo what's the plan of attack here for the patriots against the bears defense\nAgainst us first of all run it again try and start trying to develop that run as they've been doing the last couple of weeks without Gronkowski being they're robbers really good on the edge but I mean twenty now is a really good romp blocker ah were disappointed in Hollister made the trip but he did not it was downgraded the out\nSo uh you know it's a guy that they kind of had some high hopes for to be sort of an H ... opposite Gronkowski yet the lung is she now he's got a hamstring it seems like he's the wrecks bark at apply to take it on to\nDo anything else a stand out here for ...\nI just think you know watch a Brady it's a lot more throws to element Gordon element Gordon Hogan back and forth a sort of where I don't want to say door set of getting phase out but\nYou know if they change the gambling game plan a week to week where your set might not snag one and it might be gored and it gets ... today I think you unveiled Josh four and a little bit more do they just based on what we've seen a warm up there so far\nThough and he sort of concern about the safety play last week and in Nobel jak was pretty forthright about that McCord is performance\nIf you if you ever see that skill set again I Would say yeah but I just\nToday you see a little bit similar stuff going back it'll come out of the backfield I'm Gabriel can fly Gabriel can fly here you have to try to burn new got you on the Phillies won the Superbowl he's the guy that through the holes that got got eight million bucks to come here to three years twenty four million God Bless him and uh you know they got some guys don't run those\nThose trick rounds on the outside beat all the same way Philly did it the rubber out with a double of articles of distress thought you were asking about gas for the safety so I just think they said back today keep you know minimize the big place over the top like you had last week\nThat was known as we get ready for patriots and bears in Chicago kickoff coming up at one o'clock I'm as you look at this game so who do you think it's a bigger game for our fence or the fence coming off last week when\nI think it's the past ... ... up to speed now I Know that what plays out there but at thirty eight thirty eight forty three [noise] you know they're starting to hit on all cylinders but with the tight end out\nI don't think it's that much of a big of a deal because he really hasn't been a focal point the last couple of weeks the fact that woman's there that's ready to go to today but the the pets it's got to sort of replicate what they did last week and the first half making a sixty minute game instead of a thirty minute game they need to play for game here today\nYeah there's no question about that I mean you know again I think that first hat's how well they played sort of got lost in the second half and giving up to thirty one points and to me that sort of been a story this even for the defense is inconsistent and you'd like to see them put it together you know today against the Chicago Bears and I\nThink this is a quarterback that you can fool and to some mistakes\nAnd I just say to that mean watching the pregame atmosphere it's a little more subdued I'm not a juice place here in Chicago in lotta patriots fan so it's going to be interesting to see if we get to lead the hottest crowds going to go a lot of patriots fan mail is ... ... ... yeah you see a lot of them around\nAnd soldiers to be a great city to visit I think oh yeah you know typically plays into it as to whether or not a grand is going to make the trip um do you think there's a bad spot for the patriots do considering bears coming off\nA loss to win and the patriots still have this thing hanging over them but I don't think it's that big of a deal and that is if they haven't won on the road I just think rain overall and their level of plays in a much different place now where it was a month ago well I think\nBecause of the way they came out of the gate on the road goes back to back away it's not good um they stress at this week so they should be focused it should be hitting on the hill as far as mental mistakes you shouldn't have many today uh Saddam out here and working with the Lyman early just get it going I'm mentally they got to be ready for the gecko come up because I think this is a team you could get up on a naked\nI don't see a packet in but I Know they're sitting here three and three you could say it's a bigger game for them I think it's a big one from New England I Do think it's a good spot for them or are you talking about maybe a tricky spot coming off a big win against Casey now you got to win on the road you're going anywhere and it's like you got to be able to win on the road this year two thousand I think it starts with them today\n\nOkay well that [laughter] no no no we're good yeah I'm back here to go over here trying to limit the trip uh clipping nails no I'm more I'm back here I got nothing else for you encountered it all alone and we're good man you know I I Would ask you about the field but I Can't feed back yeah you know what the ... real quick\nHere too we did talk about the grass multiple times they've replaces grass it's been chewed up longer than the normal natural surface because of the weather but it looks really good it looks really good in the middle\nWay so it's it's a longer meaning what like they let it grow they don't know how to type yeah it's not a Miami in Jacksonville um even here you know the New England ... really really short really tight like the Gulf green yeah they say they're like ... this is the patriots of two thousand three and four type track\nSo it's like an old high school field looks good it's good green it's good green grass\n... stadium about your feelings you checked do you like the music the music here is good\nYeah they got Jay ... he's a inhouse DJ so a lot to the two stadiums we've been to Miami which is a zoo to freaking nightclub to plan and now all of a sudden the Chicago Bears evident on the day which is sad\nThat I thought you were like the music I didn't see that wants to make deal that is a DJ so so so you just found out who posts Malone is which is great oh that's great yeah\nWait a minute he jumped on hearing where he lives here had no clue no clue even if he\nDidn't know who posed Malone was let's say\nThree months ago you didn't know who posed wrong was after the dramatic\nDay of his white having insurance stuff\nBob doesn't God that bombing one one took money he's right down the middle\nIt's nothing short of America that we are we're not in the post post Malone arrow we said this before and I'm just waiting for the next record to drop by the grace of God he was able to land on the runway Safeway that day and he's still with us because of that were there and\nHe said he needed a drink at two Percocet not to do it with me and put on land [laughter]\n\nUnbelievable that the rich get richer rely on a trip back from uh Denver back to that takes a lot of rotating supers beers we we can just get ... get out to the tarmac there are tours of beer open for him was plastic bags and\nNow that Romney owed them up and down ... Percocet there so that to beer like actually you know you know you got a kick out in your lap and no pets on what the hell out but [laughter]\n\nI tell you I'll tell you came back from about going to go to all this kind of [laughter] now that somebody\nGot almost cavity search through security in a way like they really for whatever reason the league put the straps on security as far as remember I was finished Gillette yeah I Want to try it out and say it's long security process itself the league has tightened up so I don't know if they're hearing chatter or they all this is a new one\nBut yeah we tightened up security pretty good here on the road hey go let me ask you a quick on drunk and it's just a one game thing are concerned\nI get to one game thing or somebody the hotel told me it was similar to Nicholas ... travel said yeah that worked on it that applied down himself and ended up playing down in Miami that there was a chance to play and I just thought you know what\nIf we're not good enough to win this type of game without him then we're not really we are so\nGet through it you got you got out on them like I said yeah they got got James why caught when did they get in a while just takes a little money off the table for the big guy though\nThat's that's a healthy part of it I used to make me dance that's right\nThanks so free site is always thought to Scottsdale lack\nYou will be on the caller Bob so see coming up just minutes from now they treated in Chicago to take on the bears this portion of patriots breed you brought you by the New England carpet Jersey union it's time to build to learn more visit N.

I think this could be a one week thing they think the potential it'd be a two to three week thing\nAnd you never know all the back injuries respond ah is is injuries are caught a cold you know the surgeries that he's had but it seems function well while without um and what a Super Bowl without 'em so concerned not immediate because you have guys like Josh court now where I think you could start to build a little bit more bread machine the plant for spots\nThat he had gotten the post Rob develop that situation where it's not ready to go to more so I tried to go to them early in the game last week but I don't want to go to guys\nThat that was your ... ... it's what Sony Michel potentially get another hundred yard game\nA really good ... going up against but he got Michelle got changed white user back complement the other guy that you have a lot better they just they will be fine\nIt is an excellent one defense in a deep and that also has gotten to the quarterback with regularity nobody more so than ... Mac and for the ... they have him here today he's in uniform we watch them go through warm ups but he is still somewhat of a question mark because of ...\nHe looked like he was about forty to fifty percent of warm ups meeting he's going to do what he has to do to make sure he's right again time doesn't want to put any stress on that ankle so it was kind of lollygag around out there the way you watch the movie but you know here journal ... balls kicked off we'll see what it's like but you ought to get his ... got his start fast\nYou look at the two wrote Martha [noise] thirty four to six or up stores that first first half so you've got to be able to respond you've got to do something good to start this football game because I think you're a tip for team especially I think that's when you play with that lead when you play from ahead yeah it's an open things aren't lawyers and\nAllow him to get a little more aggressive what his calls but keep the St Louis recording brothers need to play better than they did last week I Know coach sort of ... haven't given up the only one point to a three way that's a rarity for coach to really address somebody was on that one person [noise]\nImportant is it that the patriots played\nAnd he read off in the last week and now go against and Andrew Read this ... this week trying to improve on some of their vulnerabilities defensively especially they're giving out the big\nWas going to lie to a from a lot of sand point [noise]\nYou know you're going to be able to line up it's the things I Can't say but you're not facing the same animal meaning which are basically you watch um warm up to talk to you know about this or the free games\nHere's a looked like Patrick malls they they I think he joined us to not to say this can't play but I think you know thirty three served four he's going to look to run up more than he has to throw it sort of a ... player if you know what I'm saying\nSo I think you know their beliefs a stay at home on the outside continue that porch cranked up for clay born with why uh let's see butler in the middle of the things you can do to get somebody with your front I thought I got her from a lot of ... especially in a restaurant last week was really good\nYou know as well as anybody that's the third phase for most is really a priority for Bill Belichick and a key last week for Kansas City as
