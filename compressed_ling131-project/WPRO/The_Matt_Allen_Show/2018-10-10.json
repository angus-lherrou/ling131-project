I talked to a low I call them up and say what's this other one\nHe says well they might have been a situation back in the minority office like ten years ago maybe that's what they're talking about so I said you want to come and tell the story and until you said All right let me think about it called me back I'll come in and tell a story well he said you want to come on tell the story says I Want to come in and tell the story so he's got to come in and tell us the story coming up at one o'clock\nBecause I'm not going to give you all the details 'cause I was I didn't live at and I'm not going to re can't I'm not going to be ah I Can't read it All right what was told me because I don't know the details and I don't want to get it wrong that's one o'clock he's going to come in and tell the story about another situation that happened\nA as a way to get everybody on you know I guess full disclosure type of situation I guess so here about but this one I mean to me I don't know\nNow this mock\nGoing back and then he brings up the situation by the way I'm not a negative side for George for what he does is he goes full born a you know atomic bomb and brings up the island following a car accident thing from back in the as revenge for to reimburse for heat what do you think ... you know fun minions bringing this up and I'm sitting there listening to that I'm cringing over that because\nIt seems to me that that's not something you want to give up you want to politicize\nA unless you just trying to throw mud at somebody\nAnd the more you try to throw mud less people believe you actually want to be governor you are in and the more they believe you just want to ruin it for around ... or at least or give Gina Raimondo in office will talk to Joe true about that ... that idea but you know there's no doubt in my mind I'm Gina Raimondo is tap dancing today\nShe's realizing that there's really no serious candidate against her that either eat a serious with ability or be serious with the with the fund age and the and whatever um and that they're going to fight over whatever the anti Gina vote is out there and then she's she's clear sandwich she's gonna she's going to be quiet she's going to make little announcements\nAnd uh the progressive left are going to get a foothold in this state more than they have it now and uh and you know and I ... and this is listen this is a blue state I saw the those are the uh public radio ABC News whatever poll that they did\n[noise] while the methodologies in question and the numbers might be in question there's no doubt in my mind that even if it was by himself Allen falling against you normally do he would have an uphill battle with with her in the state you have the national\nClimate you have the uh the blue wave climate you have a the fact of the state of Rhode Island and it's it sounds really good to be progressive\nIt sounds good it's not really good but people don't understand that yet and are you remember you live in the blue is to blue if the primary was any indication of what the mood is of the people out there to do something different or to stay with the status quo the status quo is uh is what they want\n\nSo while you might be you know you might be a little bit more than you think are a little bit more a little a little bit less of a a of a of a gap between the leader and the followers and all this other stuff there that you can argue that\nAh but I don't have a hard time believing that who who is ahead is ahead\nSo you know and according to that poll you know models got what fourteen point difference over Allen phone and jokes we'll get five percent so that doesn't even make up close to half of the difference\nYou know in this case you got to go ahead and you're going to go and you know try and get the people who are undecided to come over to your side and and and go over these and I don't know if dropping or you know a bombs about uh about silly things that happened in the seventies\nUm you know especially after especially if you're a Republican after the cabinet I'm saying\n[laughter] people walked around shaking their head about thirty five year old allegations where to go to this nonsense\nOr which has been corroborated quite frankly but still it's like okay we're early\nAnd then you know then the and then to go the other ... than under ... to go after Ireland falling for something though that this was at the time Nineteen years old no political influence none of that stuff was was meted out to the courts on through the legal system and found to be nothing they're tragic situation terrible and to bring that up as a political slight to me it's just not smart\nSo here I Am here you are and what do we do now have no idea [laughter]\nI don't know\nSo I don't know it seems to me like this whole story about the Nick Matty yellow Joe Joe ... little thing is kind of a funny or a funny only in Rhode Island situation not necessarily a damning story\nUm
