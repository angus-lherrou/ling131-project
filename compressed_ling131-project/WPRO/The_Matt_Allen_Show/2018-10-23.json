get you the two hours but the thing is this\nOne point six billion dollars is a life sentence I don't think anybody can appreciate how much out what this does and how fundamentally your life is because you don't understand\nHow much of your life is all you do but I don't think you understand how much you know 'cause you live and what do you understand how much your every day motivation to get out of bed is based on your need to go survive\nAnd if you take that basic needle way than your\nLife is going to go through in a in a hold of you think you're going to have a stressful is life\nThen you're not ... you're not thinking this through\nYou're not thinking it through um\nI mean you think that there's any time you've ever seen these stories done you've seen documentaries and who's telling me about the documentary like there's a Netflix documentaries on Netflix is a documentary done about about a lottery winners and how they were all miserable\nWe had a lottery winner from Rhode Island called me one time and talk about our father seasonally buddies old up in a I mean so I don't know or you know\nYou go to like I did some research on this yes I'm Still doing a wormhole on the Internet and\nYou really are locked lock everything down you when that thing you don't tell anybody you're going to get a lawyer who is not like your family lawyer you know what I mean you go to the biggest city near you you find the biggest law firms right when you go you demand the managing partner he says look at one one point six billion\nYour wife or is it pretty much get a cut everybody out\nYou and your decide what are you going to spend on home and then stick to it and then you're going to insulate yourself from everybody\nYou're thinking about that I'm fine with that [laughter] okay [laughter] than what everybody tells me that what they do they all say about a vacation\nOkay then you're on vacation and then you're off vacation then what\nDo you understand that this is what's weird the only reason why vacations or big trips are nice things are nice is because they're happening\nOnce in a while once they become every day then it becomes every day and at that point it's monotony\nAnd then when you've reached this pinnacle of what we consider to be you know\nThe relaxation or or meaningful\nLife or whatever else like folks there are people out there who are right now billionaires who are drug addicts missile robs mentally ill they're insane people they live the life that you supposedly want to live yet they have all kinds of miserable stresses that it makes it even worse because nobody can even everybody rolled their eyes it\nThem right that's what I Love about all these liberal celebrities that crack me up you start talking about the poor people is that the other thing what they should do would Amy Schumer say she's going to do I'm not going to take a Super Bowl commercial [laughter]\nReally\nOh gee nobody kids when she says she's fat and happy and living life right but she knows you know human being human beings are miserable you need this this listen don't you learn the lessons from the from the matrix\nRemember the good story the matrix that movie the matrix one of the great things about that story is the first movie the wrestling with terrible [noise]\nUm they were just the second three with terrible because the first the first one was such a hit because it was he spoke to the true nature of of human beings which is\nThe ... and made a like a paradise they put a human beings into the matrix the matrix was uh paradise in the whole thing crashed\nEverybody's hoping fell apart all the dreams came true people had there you are biologically driven to overcome obstacles\nYou are biologically ... thinking about this you are evolutionarily created right through the through the process of evolution you have been created to have obstacles putting your way to survive\nYour very existence depends on it and all the times that we've taken away the work to survive a for different parts of survival specifically like gathering food and whatnot we have suffered physically sick about it\nThat's why we have so many diseases because the food stuff so we have the western food diet as terrible or you know we'd all these metabolic disorders like like a like a diabetes and obesity and heart disease and all that stuff\nThe beat us [laughter] [noise] so the growth of Burmese everyone\nAll because of the plentiful nature of all this stuff it's taken away you look at the the the the the ... the crisis of men in this country today is because meanings been taken away from them right in an effort to destroy the patriarchy we've decided to take away the meaning that men have had\nAnd so now you have young men who are biologically driven to have a certain type of meaning whether it be a warrior provider or whatever and we did falling apart\nLiterally falling apart around you behind\nAnd everything they just oh we've taken the masculinity out of the world and so people are you look at the statistics\nYou see that happening if you do not take into consideration what happens to human beings when they don't have to survive anymore you better have a radical change in what drives you and it better be enough because otherwise you're going to suffer\nAnd I think one point six billion dollars over night is not going to be all sunshine and roses for\nPeople you got to think about this that's what I'm saying you're going to do it you're going to go out there like fifty people split it up\nI don't know man I think you could\n[noise] you don't want to believe this\nGo round and do good things for people the people you know what good can be done is the question\nWhat would you go round your your pay off or your parents or your friends mortgages you pay for their kids are education's do nice things you don't have to you know you don't have to give them a two hundred million dollars but you know nice little thing make ... you know they're they're still working but it makes their lives nice yeah but\nIt makes it doesn't make their life and as you could give more why couldn't give more with my own selfish you see them why would you help them\nYou know what what what he's so rich you could go up and pay somebody else's mortgage but why couldn't you pay mine and we just paid mind just be in my kids' school\nBut now what and that's enough I think oh you think it's enough or do they think it's enough because really do you've changed\nAfter all that money your attitudes changed your all change\nAnd you know it's just not the same guy anymore\n[laughter] ah\nBecause you're not the same guy anymore so this is weird I don't people don't think this through I look at one point six billion for one person has a disaster\nThat's just as there's a part of me it's just like you know I don't know I\nDon't know man I Know it helped me work through this because I think this is interesting it's a human condition I Know I Know the majority of people going to call in and be like a problem ... observe and handle Paul isn't Johnston polio WPRI Paula\nYet I followed that one I went to the store yesterday\nAnd the girl at the register said\nWow she said you're really lucky I said why she said the lenient friendly you bought sixty nine Powerball tickets\nAnd she said she was Seventy five making millions I really I said I was glad it wasn't but guess what what you need one ticket to win so maybe I got that kick it after she\nBought a new imagine [laughter] you're right and that's something that that's the woman she hears that SARS you know jump on a window [laughter] okay\nHave you watched Seventy five a mega millions tickets and and you didn't win but he came from that store Apollo beach you\n[laughter] alright politics at all and he's in riverside any WPRI any\nClaim that you can do with money\nWell I Know there's a lot you can deal with them yeah I Know he'll be at least ten percent\nAnd you're given a million dollars\nYou know your closest friends and family yep and then they go on and on the way I always wanted to find out their country oh they they and that is so I you know and there's a lot of people that are on how\nLong that will find that funny they don't know what I mean they wanted to do\nYeah okay but I mean I I ... you might that's the positive side okay that's the good stuff you do but I don't know if you know what happens on the ... uh besides that\nAnd then another thing is like I said the people that don't call me that I don't yeah yeah that's my immediate many like oh this bombing like short when my mother and my sister the one that I that I talk to them that they they said that was on my family but I won't have to separate\n... and you don't think they change in your relationship\nAnd that will give that money that money will be all\nRight well I'm not saying that you don't see any do you do you recognize that there could be problems though\nI don't think they're going to be a crime because I think that\nEveryone it I don't like it all the time\nIt was like the woman who won the um [noise] she won the lottery over Newport

a Stanley Cup as many times as possible and that's it huh\nThat's what I Would do and what do it so that that's that's your things the Stanley Cup\nIt's based on cool to do it would be timeless it'd be something I'd leave after I was gone it'd be a way for me to not get hooked on cocaine or [laughter]\nSomething do you play for the team I just want to own it\nNo I just own a team and I try to build dominant hockey club in Rhode Island\nIt'd be a lifelong hobby\nYeah why not I guess that would be a lot of why not so I guess when you get that kind of money right why not All right ... ... you go hey listen everybody's got their thing maybe that's my problem if you don't have my thing I don't know what the hell do with it\nOr the standard make everybody's deco away right away people's you can see that go away then what about this place I don't want this place [laughter] I don't want to own a radio station so by it and burned down why would I Want to do that I don't want to destroy

you care about today you're you're not as victims most people I don't think I'm a vindictive does what what does that do it does nothing to\nDo a lot of there's nothing that you have that you would

no\nNot really I'm just on a\nScrew with someone who's really been bad to you there is some no I don't know there's not been that many people have been really bad to me I guess\nYou know I\nI think that there's anybody that's out there that I think has been bad to me or bad or the people they are at that point they become such an irrelevant in my life I don't care about them I really don't care what they're doing I don't care about them into the theory relevant you know what I'm saying\n[noise] probably but you know it must be fun to do is the universe stuff to do that's on them to do [laughter]\nWell that's what I mean you start looking for stuff to do and that's the way your brain goes you shouldn't have a billion dollars\nFor a little while 'cause the eventually something all union come home to roost [noise]\nAnd then you're going to be like ah what's his face and be like rose borrowed [noise]\nBacks reality next hour the [noise] the ah the situation in war it deserves answers for the public from the people who help run it in the city council president will give us some answers when we come back after the news next [noise]\nThe way from the New England truck solution studios pointing away from the general election this is talk Ninety nine seven AM six thirty somebody we are oh\nYour lunch in central and voters [noise]\nGood afternoon in the revolution soft washed news center I'm Paul's and Gary what the one the clock WPRI news no word yet if covered in high school will be open tomorrow after students sent home today the reason dust somehow got underway heating ventilating system being worked on and it got blown into places where students and teachers were breathing\nFire department came to us in the air all air quality tests can test came back negative so no harm we brought in an expert from the Mason every company that talking about what the dust is she is a shorter said nothing harmful isn't that dust quality\nBut even though it may not be toxic superintendent Peter ... says it's irritated members of the temperature and high population the goals now cleaning it out of the H ... system and making sure it doesn't comeback\n\nOf the unbelievable the\nUnbelievable abuse that could take place\nIf you get a bunch a union or a you know the leadership or whatever just any collective bargaining agency you have a ... organization of any kind\nComes together and make deals with administration officials in or administrations for political support for whatever\nAnd ... and it doesn't and has no oversight and all this is a disaster\nThat is waiting to happen what's happened in war there they changed the way that they are they give the people they're sick time\nPay back\nTo the point where they're getting more than they were supposed to get according to the contract and you know the mayor says I didn't know anything about this nobody knows anything about it they're blamed the in the in the journal story they they seem to kind of point to the fire chief of the fire jeep did this on his own although the city solicitors signatures on it\nYou seem to be like I don't know\nNow we have to schedule this hour to talk to Steve I'm a roll of who's there's the city council president trying to get a hold of him in a he's not picking up his phone all of a sudden I arrange with him earlier today to come on so if you know Steve role is home are looking for him\nAnd declared his voice mail because ah we're trying to leave a message I talk to them and everything else\nBecause it seems to me that there is I mean Steve ... is a longtime councilman he's the president of the city council the current mayor\nMayor Solomon is\nBut we used to be the city council president these guys all their authority was was basically a usurped\n[laughter] they were given the runaround\nIf you believe the story if they didn't you didn't know anything about it now I followed council person I'm On that city council in war and I find out that ... or ... or ... workers at work to underneath him were making deals and and he has the other thing and this is brought up by a by somebody called the show leave yesterday\nOr or the the ... maybe the day before and talking about this last couple of days and try to keep updated on the story um\nHow does nobody noticed this broad Tony noticed that Rob ... he's a citizen or a watchdog and more he noticed it\nHe looked at the numbers and how is it that this is this number doesn't match that number\nWise the overtime this high but the ... times is nobody's using sick time but it was the overtime what's going on here\nHe looked into it can block assistant him in and digitizing this whole thing to talk about this and and and [laughter] but nobody working in the administration saw this that's why the entire idea this would have been gossip was talking about yesterday\nHe mentioned that you know you'd have to prove some kind of intent\nFor the people in the administration\nOr the people there to circumvent the actual legal process here even though\nThis is not a I'm by any stretch the imagination but based on what it looks like anyway this is not a legal binding site agreed in other words this site agreement is garbage because it wasn't ratified the proper fashion\nAnd so you can sit there and say you got it that is wonderful you got it's fantastic everybody can their grandmother can grab a hold of this a piece of paper and point to it but it didn't go through the proper process so it's like in the city award I could basically go and make it inside agreement with the with the chief of police uh or whatever or whoever the fried the fire chief\nMake things up and as long as everybody kind of a you know we can we can and nodding each other we can just go ahead and do it and it doesn't matter if it's legit or not I mean that's this is unbelievable\nIt's an Enron or on the council the council wasn't ... if you believe the story the way it's been presented the board of the council hasn't been able to do its job because it was never provided with the ability to look at something to vet it\nTo take questions and comments on it and to do the right thing the man who leads\nThat counts for right now is the role he's the city council president award miss Merle how are you sir good how are you\nGood thank you um so when you heard over the weekend I'm Glad you could join me Texas I think over the weekend we saw the story of Saturday's paper uh where where mark Reynolds tells a story about how not only or do we we we talked after the ... the the site agreement was acknowledged by the fire union but now they actually have it in writing\nUm and I had been ... on the show yesterday labor attorney I'm sure you know who he is\nA sense that any sort of side agreement that is not ratified by the ratifying body doesn't count\nAnd so when you hear this information what's your reaction as a as the the ratifying body here that should have been at least consulted in and had vote on this stuff what's your reaction\nVery upset very upset that this was\nDone that the council didn't have an opportunity to examine it we have an ordinance on the books that requires all contracts and collective bargain bargaining agreements to be ratified a police in municipal\nOr come before us and give us the full picture and it was deceiving\nDo you feel you were intentionally deceived\nYou know [laughter] [noise]\nThat that's a good question because uh\nI hate to put words in other people's mouths mhm uh you know and those are decisions for\nUh other agencies not not the city council but uh that's it I can tell you that\nIf you're coming before the council and you know\nYou are a had decided agreements and we voted on and other collective bargaining agreement in two thousand sixteen\nThis one was an amendment to a collective bargaining agreement that was voted on a two thousand twelve right how you can come before the council and not have\nA a come before us and told us that there was this item ... significantly impacted or what we believed was the compensation package is unconscionable\nWho presented it to you the fire chief\nUh the fire chief and the ... it seems to me yeah now\nNow I read in the paper that may arrive the Asian had no knowledge of this yet the administration paid out the the the money that goes along with the amendment\nRight what does that tell you\nSo I don't know how that occurs it seems to me and\nYou know we're we're a part time legislative body when people come before us and gives it give us fiscal notes and tell us the impact on our budget we assume that telling us the truth mhm\nAnd somebody lied to hear\nWell it wasn't you know you can call it a lie certainly wasn't the truth\nThe intent is the issue right I talked to the dry out a little you know I've talked to a guy about it you know I Can't\nAsk I Can't oh sue what the intent was what I can tell you [laughter]\nEverybody damn well knows what they're supposed to do when they become when they called before the city Council on a collective bargaining ugly and I expect people to tell us the truth\nWell that's the issue and I talked to move in regards to yesterday said well some people are ignorant to this I have a\nI have a zero ability to believe that ... that that I don't know why your legs\nAre into it if they paid out\n... right I'm I'm Talking about ... ignorant to the fact that this stuff has to be um that has to be ratified um there's no way anybody in the ... century absolutely\nNo and it was witnessed by the um the city solicitor for the city a wallet who reports directly to the mayor\n... yeah yeah\n... is there any ability for you and desire for you at the council to call for an investigative body to come in and look at this as a result well\nObviously we have and now uh you know when you say investigative body we've hired in accounting firm and every day it seems like a war accurately every week uh the\nThe task that CPA for changes as their investigation goes deeper and deeper and more and more as uncovered\nWhat about law enforcement ...\nEvery time we start an investigation to look at something that you know Mr ... wants to block brought us those documents are a few months back\nWe provided those the CPA firms were not auditors are they went in a ... and started looking at it and as they requested records are more and more information started to come out um\nAnd uh it was very upsetting\nSteam role as a city council president ... so what about law enforcement here at this point the attorney general's office state police is there some are going to be some kind of ah you know recognition yeah I\nDon't I'm not going to jeopardize any investigations but he's talking about what may or may not be going on that's not my role my role is to approve things\nUh and there are other agencies are that look at this and make determinations as to impact and uh I don't think it's in the best interest of the citizens of wall word that I\nTurn around and said that uh\nAttorney and I'm not going to it and I'm not going to jeopardize uh any investigations by making statements

acknowledging that there's some kind of you know as the reason why I kept focusing and trying to get a specific answer as to whether or not law enforcement's looking into this is because he already said that there's an investigation going on by auditors auditors one thing auditors are great law enforcement agencies are different situation\nA and looking at something that way is different than looking at it with a bunch of people getting going through the books should try and figure out what happened so I you take that for what it's worth I'd like to be able to tell you that counts mineral just confirm the one for some is looking at it I think he kind of did but he didn't actually\nSay I'm it sounds to me like there's ... there's there's a serious investigation he sounds pest quite

called them\n\nUm you could take those yes maybe they maybe they didn't have to be called maybe they're already looking at it maybe he's been seems to me it sounds like he's been contacted so I don't

can bring 'em up at a public meeting I mean this is unbelievable to me\nThis is this is like playground and unfortunately there are people out there you know you can block to was visited by the fire inspector as as a result of all this and you\nKnow these side agreements now he's put in a a a public information request\nA I guess to get all the site agreements or you know it it paperwork how many are there that we are not ratified no if there's a site agreements out there that ratified and they're just the dentist the contract and you know you base them on you know the veracity of them based on you know the the judgment that was put into them and the decision making process that was put into them\nYou judge them accordingly do what you got to do\nWith the fact of the matter is if they weren't ... if they weren't approved properly isn't like can you imagine these people these are people that would literally set themselves on fire and I would probably too if Donald Trump just decided to start making law by himself\nAnd didn't get anything you know just I'm going to make these deals outside the purview of Congress and I'm gonna do whatever I Want to do and I'm does all executive order stuff and that's that\nAnd good luck to you\nIt's going to cost us a billion dollars and you know it's it's basically you'd lose your mind and rightly so\n\nThe legislative branch in the city of ... by ... are based\nOn a a evidently a a a law that was passed in order so it was past years ago gets the right to ratify contracts\nBecause the mayor should not be sitting there using taxpayer dollars to feather anybody and I mean any ... any man I mean I'm not saying just married Asian any mayor should never be able to sit there and trade or have the ability to trade\nPolitical favors from any collective bargaining agency which are very politically active especially firefighters\nAnd a ... for for special deals\nYou need to have somebody or many people in this case looking over their shoulder and making sure that what they're doing is proper and at least the vetting it in public and letting everybody know\nAnd when it comes to pay checks and so the issue is quite frankly\nThere should be an investigation somebody and it it should be looking at this from a law enforcement perspective and find out whether or not this was done intentionally to supersede the will of the people to go around the the the the the ... the city law and a and people should either you know legally fry for it\n\nOr legally or at least at the very least if you can't prove it criminally or or or you know find a way to get around it or something like that to let people know that this kind of thing went on and then they can they can judge accordingly if anybody ever happens to come up through another public the point of view are public or a job\nBut I mean it's unbelievable to me\nAnd this could be happening in your town this is what's amazing to me it's so Rhode Island by the way isn't it what's a side deal [laughter]\nAh I can you imagine sitting there getting away with this and anybody if people just going on and by the way the other thing that ... to mention if they think that we have that's that part where he talks about uh about the the a willful ignorance the ignorance of it or not knowing and then goes off and he has these he has these forums where he talks to people um\nAnd mentions that\nYou know do you have to be careful here because you gotta make sure that this stuff is legal there's no way in any way shape or form that I Would buy that anybody who was involved in this piece of paper here had anything to do with this and then and it's it's coming from a that had anything to do this is coming from a place of ignorance is no way\nAnybody by that by the way anybody by that\nMy numbers for three eight WNPR oh the toll free number as one eight hundred three two one WNPR oh you can email me mad at six three zero WPRI dot com\nI mean really anybody by that\nAnd now my question becomes if it's happening in east Greenwich supposedly which by the way it was because it was like an afterthought mentioned in the in the Providence Journal story which is weird\nI don't know what that was about oh yeah by the way there's a couple of agreements that they talked about suicide agreements that uh you know they said we're right we're we're we're unlawfully are acting up and say maybe the council might want her out of fun [laughter] oh yeah okay\nGreat\nSo you got that I guarantee you counsel people and executive branch people that had these things all over Rhode Island is sitting there with their little fingers all puck it up you know go do\nBecause if it didn't pass and it was opposed to pass a legislative body assuming that's the way that you're operation works there then or\nAre you got problems man and absolutely they should get the money back because what are we running here you know what do\n... they don't worry about it and we'll get away with it and everybody would be fine I Can't wait to see the newer that's that's a that's shoveled around here and I'll tell you what\nIf everybody in ... city governments is\nKind of going home and having a having a having a I don't know what's next I don't know what's next\nI don't have to tell ya\nI hear you guys are you watching coming up I don't know as I better alternatives you tell me you have that don't you know the ... the clip where he talks about\nAbout the idea that it's possible that people don't know that the stuff is illegal listen to this\nSite agreements can be negotiated but they have to come to this or they have to be presented oftentimes ah issues arise during the life of say a three year collective bargaining agreement and the party need to collectively bargain a a side agreement or a memorandum of agreement\nOr a memorandum of understanding or in some cases they stipulate to an arbitration award which is a form of an agreement mhm can send a green and if you will an arbitration the point is\nThose agreement you know to be valid must be that it by the city or town council or the ratifying body and if they're not than they are not valid collective bargaining\n... we got cut off\nAnd it's because remember even though they may be single subject matter agreement they still are in the nature of collective bargaining agreements they struck between a union and administer palate and as such they have to be ratified\nThere's a part in there that we actually says that you know unless you can figure out some level and I mean I heard that there's no way there's absolutely no way that these people didn't know that they're supposed to do this there's no way and so people who are going to circumvent\nUm you know circumvent the the law and pretend that they didn't know um yeah this this this is going to be an\nEthic and ethnic spin job\nAnd the idea of the ... and didn't know nobody knew anything and nobody and by the way nobody knew and nobody was paying attention after the fact let's just say even let's say you swallow the pokey\nRight\nSwallow the pope you swallow the whole fraud okay they didn't know\nOh and then nobody was watching the store and just watching this this this money go and not nobody knew nobody paid attention to understand the contract\nOut come on come on\nThere's nothing worse than when there is a there are people out there who I let me tell you I have a great deal of respect for people and how much money how much how much work they wouldn't give me their tax but it took to earn their money to pay their taxes and it's not like it's cheap\nA you know it just climbs climbs climbs I'm not sure exactly where it's at right now but uh there was a figure in earlier today talking about how many
