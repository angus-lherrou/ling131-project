were telling me a story about correct can you can you share that with us to just just tell us about that 'cause that was at her I mean I I Know what's going to be a fly here but it's a it's actually really a good story\nSo well you know you're my friend ... came in about a year ago you know and he had an a financial advisor he liked\nHe reached out to me because she was nervous his financial advisor didn't understand how Social Security worked\nAnd he felt he was getting some bad advice so I asked credit to come in sit down let's talk about it over some coffee and just a ... you know and before crack had come in to see us his financial advisor had told him he should trigger Social Security when he turned sixty two and collect it while he's still worked\nYou know so I asked him what his plans were for work we talked about how we really enjoyed his job and what he thought working till sixty six is what he really wanted to do\nAs we talked about the consequences of taking your Social Security early the different penalties the caps and all the problems that could cause a down the road for him after hearing all this correct stop dead in his tracks that he looked at me with confusion and said why would I take it early and not wait until I was ready to retire\nYou know he went on to say his financial advisor never told them anything about his Social Security in actually how it worked\nSo you know Craig is now claim that you can financial services and we have a Social Security plan for him he's now going to take it at sixty six you know and I just saw a correct the other day and he couldn't be happier so you know if you need Social Security retirement planning help\nI Want you to give us a call here today you can financial services you know credit sure glad he did and it's four oh one Seventy seven to seven to seven again that's for one Seventy seven to seven to seven\nYeah Jay I Love that story about Greg 'cause I remember when he was down with him you went through the the retirement income report with him it\nPoint blank showed him exactly how much he was going to save\nA by taking your Social Security at sixty six verse taking it sixty two\nOr more importantly it also showed them how the rest of his accounts lined up to it how the three rules of money we're actually the biggest component of making his decision with his Social Security he knew exactly where is his bank accounts were supposed to be where he was after offers day to day income\nHe knew where his income was going to come in from Social Security and his four one K. and the small mentioned that he had\n... it was amazing I I that's one of my favorite stories there\nYeah let's give away to more of these uh retirement income reports not justice so security at all\nBut his income it's an amazing report you have to have a\nRetirement income report is what you're going to ask for it focuses on Social Security it focuses on whatever your income process needs to be so give us a call for one seven to seven to seven to seven once again that's four oh one seven to seven to seven to ...\nYou know what I Love about that report is the fact that it actually shows you how to maximize your income so that actually winds up to the goals you have in retirement because remember this is all about you\nIt doesn't matter what we think it matters what are you trying to accomplish and does the components and tools and accounts you already own line up to that and if it doesn't\nHow do you make it work so that you can have enough income and now over paying taxes and just have that weird birds\nYou know we we all know the guy down the street who's always complaining about kids get off my lawn or why it's so difficult wars right the government's taking my paycheck\nNo it's because the snow lined up and it's it's just understanding where's your money coming from and how does it work and it's an absolutely amazing\nYou know in in ... well Mandy what that report what it also does it points out where the pitfalls could and will happen if you're not careful if you don't have the proper plan put together you know is it gonna you know where you're going to fall into a attacks bond that we talk about we've talked about that on other shows\nYou know or is it going to be that you're just gonna run out of money it shows you all those types of scenarios\nAnd with that you can actually put together and have a plan that you're confident about\nAnd understand how Social Security and your other incomes work and how it's going to last year entire retirement\nYeah some of the ah some of the things I Want to jump off here is a pitfalls\nI Want to go back to pitfalls so when we're talking about pitfalls about Social Security\nSome people don't realize that Social Security is calculating the last thirty five years not your entire lifetime thirty five years so it they and they wait differently that's right so when it's weighed or the the latter years the the older years\nYour last year's in your career or wait heavier\nThan say a regional paper route and and I love when people say well I have a financial planner I really like them\nWell that's great give

and I had a young daughter at the time I was very concerned I didn't know how bad or how serious it was and I just went over there and and basically got involved\nI guess the the the powers that be whoever they might be I don't know who did this but you know we decided to get this push their story out there to\nTo show us some guy who's in a rational guy and a who's you know bombastic and goes off the handle it can't be trusted because he's got a bad temperament and whatnot so this morning I'm listening to radio much people call up and you get when we have the political season every season that happen\nIt's like the inside political people calling the shows they say well I Know this and I know that and the guy called in Paris showed said well if you don't you don't know about the other one so I called you said what's the other one and I said is there another one or you know what what is if there's another one what is it\nWell you know as long as we got the skeletons coming out of the closet [laughter] we might as well open up the whole closet so there's only really one of the things that I can think of\nThat they could hit me with and let's see if this is all coming out of the fun campaign I I just want to say this to the people are disgusted listening to this stuff and I didn't choose to go in this direction\nI Would much I Will be much happier talking about the issues that are important to the people but this is where we are at this point in time and I'm not the kind of guy that just sits back and doesn't defend myself that's not my personality\nOr use of this story coming out as an attack oh this is my family and attack\nThe way you think that this story coming out was pushed by the funk people to attack you really\nOh yeah yeah I mean you heard Allen fun today and that that how he's he's whatever and he hit the Thirteen year old a twelve year old kid and it really wasn't like that at all I mean there was no harm caused to him he didn't end up hurt or anything it was just an incident where I was\nVery vociferous which I I can get waving my arms around and telling these kids you know get the heck out of here and and go home to where you live and leave these kids alone in the house\nSo the new situation the one that you're saying that there's another another one possibly that you could think people will be talking about uh how long ago that did this go on\nAnd this was about ten years ago what happened was a I was serving in the general assembly and we were in the minority office and we were in a back room of the minority office which is attached where the where the staff is it's just outside the door but the doors open\nAnd I'm In an argument a face to face with Larry ... who is all to a state representative and he was he's not at the time he was and we're in a very heated argument and uh we read each other's face there's no question about it\nAnd all of a sudden out of nowhere Larry goes to poke me the eyes with his two fingers well when he did that I slapped them back\nSo it became well known within the minority office that we had this incident uh you know police report was ever filed a when I came out of the room I ... I they they heard the the rock is the Stafford it you know I said I didn't hear them first he he pulled\nMe in the eyes he actually contacted you've ... like this double think it in the eyes like Three Stooges type rights and that's the kind of in the middle of the I caught me off guard when he did it because I I didn't expect that but Larry's language not a bad guy\nHe's he's really not a bad guy mean since then and we we we mend and a disagreements\nBut what he can do is he can get when he gets really upset he starts to shake\nAnd he was at that level and the and he his I guess the first reaction was pulled me the eyes so\nYou think it was an intentional poking it wasn't like him just pointing his finger at you and got too close jak made contact us we actually did he thought he absolutely and when you slapped and just like his hand away to slap in the face what'd you do\nYou know I don't remember I just I just open handed Lee slapped Adam about four or five times and he started hollering and uh\nI stopped so you've had him a couple of times yeah maybe four or five times I mean it was a quick big big big big big bang\nAnd you can say that to be defending yourself in that\nMoment I'm singling absolutely I Would you know I Would do it today you put me in the eyes show and I'm an old guy\n[laughter]\nSo [noise] I don't know if you call that an assault sounds to me like self defense if you're what you're telling me utterly ugly it is you're right it is self defense\nYeah and and I you know and I reached out to Larry are hard today to let them know what I'm Talking about this and\nHe may he says going to be listening he doesn't he didn't seem to think um that this was a big deal\nI didn't think it was a big deal in the butt of them the excuse me the members of the minority caucus Brian Newberry in company we're aware that this incident happened there ought to get me at any cost so\nI worked at for foreign you know ... if they're working\nThat give you a chance to clear therapeutic I talked to my boss you can call yourself so that we can we can hear you\nI'm so this is I'm Sorry you back now\nYeah they're working for fun and um you know they're out there to get me these members of the minority caught us right now that I Know are supporting me for governor and they can't publically come out and say it because the phone camp\nIs so bound and determined to destroy any buddy and anybody that gas support means it's a Republican\nAnd yesterday a damn your cat on the show a woman who worked for a Patricia Morgan who came in Studio to tell and show her text messages from this person who's running against a hand a gal oh I forgot his name off the top of my head ...\n[noise] but helium Republicans you should probably\nDozens removing her but it's not so much that they were removing her and I think one of the things that got lost in the discussion yesterday\nWas it seems like it turns into the fact that the young Republicans were removing her from her executive position\nOn the board that to me that wasn't the story the story was that the Republicans directed by Alan ... and his minions with threatening this girl total ruin her political life\nAnd that was in the text messages which includes the name of Brian Newberry who's the house now really let me tell you something about Brian do very\nWell we're doing tell the truth\nBrian Newberry and I served together I was the whip he was the minority leader\nI went into at the end of every session we'd go into the speaker's office to try to get bills passed for our caucus and we would sit with the speaker and discuss what bills that the that the members wanted\nI went into that office within three years in a row\nBrian do very sold his caucus so every time we went in there\nEvery time we went in there he had already he we would go in I Would go into negotiate in brain Newberry would say well you know we know we're not going to get any bills passed\nAnd he would just accept it as the norm and the ... and and I've come out of there and say Brian what the hell are you doing and we would go the next year and I would ... trying to get him fired up and say let's go in there and fight for these people\nAnd he sold his caucus I've never talked about this publicly but it's all out war I mean you want to let me draw the line it's dirty line Let's talk\nAbout that for a second we come back take a break come back on TALK about the all out war I Want to ask you a few more questions about the incident with Larry ...

Latin represented ... or whatever\nThere was no big deal we're free will over it later on and yelling at each other smacking each other in the face hitting each other in the chest [laughter]\nAnd they go [noise]\nAnd you know and later on in the hour I asked them about this this you know to me it was the story that came out this morning with ... was to me it actually\nMade jokes we'll look good because he stepped in and tried to stop something some ... boys are doing a hurrying and some young woman\nAnd so that made him look good but then he goes in the wax Alan ... for the ... car accident and he said that last hour and Alan ... car accident or for all intents and purposes was an accident\nYou've ... you've dealt with his back to the city council days he dealt with this last time for governor he came out he had a very tearful press conference about it uh and they are lacking any sort of evidence of the contrary there was the the uh the grand I guess it was a grand jury to\nCharge was nearly the campaign was was a stickler for the actual charge a charge of the time was I'm driving to endanger deaths resulting\nNot vehicular homicide\nGrinding to endanger death for death resulting at the end of the day he was found nothing was going was it was just there was no charge was there in terms of there was no\nI'm I'm there was no ... litigation was done was dropped\nAnd just get the kids Nineteen years old\nThe terrible situation and I think that you know while Joe as a fighter and everything is what he says I think he went overboard with this with that one I don't think he needed to do that especially not with a with a kind of Rhode Island silly story but that's what's going on here that's why I pushed them a little bit on this idea of you know going after Alan falling rather than Gina Raimondo and this is what I hear from people all the time\nThis is a this is a ... at least I don't know what to tell you this is what Joe things Joe things Allen's\nA bad guy for whatever reason and um\nYou know it's going to ensure that Gina Raimondo gets gets put into office\nIt's or it's going to be easier for her now I don't know about polls and whatnot the polls are are are there or not and they're they're legitimate or not who knows\nMore often than not they're they're legitimate\nSo you know this is a situation if this latest poll is legitimate and actually is a snapshot in time then it doesn't matter what Joe Miller does 'cause he's got five percent of the support in that poll\nAnd a and Allen fungus is fourteen points behind governor Raimondo which I wouldn't be surprised if that's the case by the way I'd be surprised if there was a five percent but I wouldn't be surprised if that's the case\nBecause listen we're in we're in a a you know Donald Trump has has the entire left wing of the world or anybody who can be virtue virtue signal by joining a left wing are ready to go there motivated they're ready to rock and General Motors got more money than God she's throwing money and everything to the Democratic\nGovernors Association so tin tin easy just just treated other things an extra million dollars that's being spent on her behalf\nUm so this is one of those things\nAnd I don't know what else to tell you\n\nAnd this is one of those things that to me it's a you know it is what it is you're going to make a decision and what is your decision when you hear the stuff I got to tell you man I well I here's an email from somebody said we just got to go back to the to the beginning and reset get a whole bunch of different people that get in here and there's a lot of people that that honestly that I think\nAre are there there there there are they are in that in mind\nWhere there is\nThat mindset where they just they're done with it the back and forth\nThey're done with it\nAnd you know I think that the cabin or thing for people who tend to be right ... right leaning this kind of stuff was exhausting they don't want to see this crap anymore\nI don't know I don't know I don't know what to tell you\nSo you tell me when I don't know what to tell you you tell me my phone numbers for three eight WNPR oh the toll free number one eight hundred three two one WPRI you can email me mad at six three zero WPRI dot com I look at the progressive movement as a danger to to to individual rights and liberties to individual sanity to the ability to the danger to free speech\nI see all that and I see Gina Raimondo as a foothold in this in even more for the progressive or ideology\nI'm going to be from the New England truck solutions to the top of him than I Am six or WBRC accumulate station [noise]\nMissing journalist hurricane Michael I man can't Saudi Arabia has pushed back against the threat of economic sanctions over the

wouldn't be front and Center for you right now because of the immediate problems logistical fixing this uh this commute to school for the kids that's something that's got to be looked at it from that with ... with any entity going forward\nYeah and it was discussed actually at the city council education committee as well so I think it's absolutely something that people are aware of the top of mind\nWhat was the consensus\nDon't think there is one I think they have to figure out you know what what they're going to do when they renegotiate the contract I mean it'll be part of the R P\nWhen these are these you know you you know the school board put out three our piece last night one for the full the full boat to full service the other one just to like Lisa fleet buses and and then cut it by for creating the full contract with the management drivers with the other one I think the idea is to try last time you know there was only one qualified better\nAs well I mean that's kind of the the challenge I mean as I understand that\nYou know the city in the district of their own buses for over three decades um and ah you know when you lose some control when you do that you have to figure out how to get qualified better is if you're going to rely on private partners to provide the transportation so from our perspective and I think the school board's perspective last night and\nThe the the direction that they gave me is way let's look at this in every way possible so that we can have a you know a number of different butters potentially on the table to provide service for our students\nHere we're talking with Chris Martin the superintendent of schools in Providence so explain to me what you think the dynamics differences between that which was hey we shopped around and couldn't find anybody to to to to to step in here at the beginning of this job action\nNow\nUnderstanding that question you feel like these are the do you think there's ... ... ... I asked a question for me was there the the effort um you know\nTwo weeks ago was interim this seems like it's interim or more in this more fertile opportunity for other companies to bid jobs you're thinking\nYeah yeah and you know and I think I think that we're looking at every possible solution I mean before this thing happened you know we talked to ride we talked to rip that we talk to every bus company we could find up and down the east coast you know there were a city that buses a significant percentage of our students then uh you know we were looking when when when\nThey started coming down the pike we looked at every other place that had that had this issue in Seattle had a bus strike of similar nature uh earlier and in the year and I think it was February [noise]\nAnd um you know they have a\nProbably over twice as many students as we do and uh we both about nine thousand uh Ninety five hundred and eight bus eleven thousand so it it it goes to show you're like well we are ... you know some people have asked us\nOh this could have a regional impact quite frankly this could have a a a national impact but what I Want to do is what we're doing like you said controlling what we can control\nAnd the school department you know we don't control the strike we control our response to it and we're just trying to do is made our families wherever we can you know last night I announced and we've been doing this already we are going to put work on line for students\nWere going to and if the students can don't have Internet access for going to send home our pockets and if they can't and no one can get to school to pick 'em up we're going to hand deliver them we're going to do whatever we can to minimize the impact on our students because they're the ones the students and families are the ones that are suffering and um I mean there have been around forty students then that have missed every day of the strike\nUm ah the that have only been absent during the strike so but one student ... and so\nThose mostly I ... in students with disabilities\nNow I mean I think people have this idea about the students with disabilities that all these students have physical disability [noise] most of the overwhelming majority of our students with disabilities\nTheir transportation accommodation is you get a drop on the corner instead of at the bus stop you get a drop of your at your door and in some cases it's not indicating physical I'm a disability it's more anyone with an ... with a learning disability is where most of the the overwhelming majority of those kids are but\nAs I said you know one student is too many one days too many and the fact that we have almost forty kids that have only missed school during the strike is you know it's twenty four thousand kids but we are going to do everything we can to make those families wherever they are\nSo let me ask you this was was\nThe hesitancy to do this and this seems like a pretty smart comprehensive are the three fold let's see what comes in based on three different solutions I'm a interim or or or full time was it was it wasn't a feeling you know a couple of weeks up until\nThe strike in the early started to strike that this thing had to resolve that like this is like come on just had to resolve it so I mean let's see these three options seem to be very smart but they seem to be\nIn some people's eyes party\n[noise] um I mean I think\nThat's possible I think that does have tumors that we we did want it to resolve and everyone thought it was ... you know what I thought it would resolve but we were looking at all these options beforehand as well you know we have a process where you have to follow in terms of putting them in front of the school board and you know that being said we will look at emergency preterm it if that's what's necessary to get this done I mean what does that mean\nWell and I don't want to get into the ... I don't want to get over my skis on procurement them but what I Will say as as I understand that we have a significant\nBleed link the permit process that involves multiple layers of government but in times of crisis in times of emergency we can a speed that up and if we have\nQualified providers that are available we will be using this bill that those emergency for camera procedures and I know that there's alignment I'm across the government agencies to that\nWell you guys would be nuts to put out this kind of a or if he were a series of three if you didn't feel like they would be some response you must you must have\nFound a way to match competitive or alternatives um\nEntity stepping in here with the R D process I I I'm guessing you guys did that ... that there will be a response to these on west\nYes yes but I Do think that what we did find out beforehand is that the way that the uh the the whole solution or they were limited limited options that was one qualified\nBetter right and so the idea is to try to break it up and see what we can't we've talked to other people we know that there's that there's interest um income into Providence to city where people will come the question is you know right now it's not you know how do we make it more attractive for more better to be able to enter into the conversation so that our kids\nCan get to school I mean we're we're missing you know we have kids that are it's not just kids that aren't going to school by the way we're not we don't have field trips we don't have a middle school athletics or are happening right now I Want\nTo you know publicly fact many of the other districts in the state superintendents are called to say hey can we switch the schedules around so that we can how our kids can hosts so that they're not missing\nYou know out on games we varsity athletes you know we don't have buses we don't have athletes and\nAh other school districts throughout the state of really really stuffed up and then they said there's a\nHuge administrative mess I'm absolutely oh uh I I Am I'm certain that everything you're saying in more is is part of your your current best by the way what's the cash flow in this well first students not performing ... is that money being returned indoor held or it never will be paid you know what the logistics are there\nUm it's as I understand it that it will never will be paid so whatever their whatever they would be paid for those runs they won't be paid\nCandy if somebody responds to the larger or if he which is you know you're in you're out uh do you does the city feel more comfortable\nYou're only ... just you know kiss them to buy I'm Sorry I didn't hear that yeah you do you think you can just simply replace for students in one fell swoop urine legal ground they'd be able to do that\n[noise] yeah no I mean we don't have the absolutely um you know and what our hope is still here or that they're going to come together and resolve this with the Teamsters I mean this is the daytime and I know that their ongoing ... conversations and uh you know with the number of different pressure points\nHave been applied by a number of different entities and that still gonna be the best solution for us in the immediate term\nBut but I guess the question however we can get our ... our students to school safely and securely as soon as possible will be our best solution\nAnd so I guess just one one business question then one student question in ... the the the idea that it was more mature language in this agreement seems to protect for students from the ... were the jumped strike had than you'd replace them with these other or if he's and he thought that out\nWell Daraa fees are being you know last night the school board actually voted on them happening and then what we're going to do is work with the administration to ensure that whatever language needed to be included in those to ensure the best situation for the city of moving forward is included\nAnd I just don't understand how for student gets moved aside if in fact they thought they were protected by job action is just kind of a nonstarter for them that they did that that they were there seems to me if I understand what happened here is that the that ... that that that waves non performance but liabilities that the job action specifically so I'm not sure\nI think the protest I I'm not a lawyer so I don't want to give you an official opinion on this but my understanding of it is that it just probably protects them from suit [laughter] it doesn't it doesn't protect them from not getting paid or from us moving on\nGotcha and finally the the us federal um issues um mandates that are being violated with some of these uh these these kids and I ... I get emails on that I just you have complications with federal regulations\nYeah I mean the students are students with disabilities it's more more of a ... if I'm at a understand the question it's the students with disabilities who have transportation is part of their plans and you know we're working we will be working with the ACLU and others who have filed suit to come you know what we were doing a number of the things they suggest\nAnd uh and the things and we're sitting down with him I rented a Steve Browne at a community event um after he sent sent a letter to us and I said hey let's sit down if you guys have ideas we haven't thought of let's let's figure out if we can do them in the best interest in it and\nWhich is why the records or we can see it yeah thank you yeah I'm I'm also one wild\nUm sensational part is one of the witnesses claim that Mr Grillo use of racial slur in a threatening to get a some guys to come and beat them up now I have reached out to the ... campaign or for response I\nDid get 'em an email back from his spokesperson said well we'll get back here so we're still waiting to hear a from Mr Grillo about these new development\nYeah there's a it's hard to ... ...\nThe handwriting is hard to read but it's about two thirds of the way down Dan of what you're looking at yeah on the secondary statement not Nick ... was\nThe ... the one that says we were ... next door we were at ... ... lives next door neighbors and some spelling problems or we\nWere making Illinois ... so that's that's the friend right [noise]\nYeah no that is we were at in the intro that's Nick ... further down and says it hit me three times in the head so that would be\n... the other one is presumably his buddy or an a or a witness\nThe one that says you trying to scare me but coming close to me with the car and almost hit me is that many ... okay ... you know and then ... you're listening to two guys and the media doing some work here um and then there's the other one is a is a kid and I I I've heard what the alleged word is is it written in here\nI'm Sorry I said I heard that heat the racial slur yeah it is it's misspelled but it's in there is it the N. word yes it is okay\nAlright them um let's take a deep breath ...\nWhat's your uh what's your repertory all analysis hear about this\nWell one thing I'm you know it it it to everybody listening or this is you know silly and and I'm full Rhode Island all that\nI just I don't mean to sound like a journalism professor here Dan but this is why reporting it out is so important like if we just went on the he said he said stuff\nI don't think we'd have the full picture and now I think we have it's coming a little bit more into focus granted it is forty years ago um and the documents we should note to your listeners they did come redacted\nWith witnesses and victims names were moved there but to me even stories big or small this is why you know I I've joked on your show before the old saying and journalism is when your mother so she loves to check it out and this is why write a because we had varying ... stories on this and it's good to get what the police account\nA of what actually happened went down the other thing is obviously as I stated at the beginning of our conversation uh this is conflict\nWith the tail that Mr Grillo had pulled all of us and uh now I'd like to get a little clarification from him as to why he provided the narrative and maybe he'll stick by it maybe he'll say the police report is wrong and the witness statements they're all they're lying or\nI mean he has found he's found\nNiceville not guilty we don't know why we weren't at the trial right in the court records or\n... as far as I could that's why I was in ... tuck it at the judicial record center earlier this week they're gone there was just one clerks entry about found not guilty so\nBut then again he actually said he admitted to it\nUm when it before I had found that that clerks no he said he admitted to 'em and admitted in a no contest plea which\nSo everyone understands that is you're not actually convicted since it's a misdemeanor um you admit that there is probably enough evidence to be found guilty right and\nIt's a weird kind of middle ground up ... up but that you know so that was his recollection of what had happened\nUm and that isn't that isn't the case according to what has been jotted down here as you point out he was found not guilty\nOkay this is just\nAnother day in the life I guess a gubernatorial campaign I I\nI Want to be able to process this thing and and obviously we're going to hear from Joe in ... I'm sure he'll call and tell them I'm guessing he'll be on the line momentarily to explain this but uh you know my my thinking is that maybe there was another situation you know with the with\nThe young girl of the house I mean I don't know how you make up the young girl in the house in the in the house and the kids that you know I don't know how you do that\nWell it and let's just as we're kind of talking it through and again I I Hope we hear from Mr trailer the um\nHis claim is that they these kids\nAre at least ... yellow a young ... were problems for a while and so maybe he was thinking of it earlier\nOr incident and he blew is top and you know whatever led to this altercation so you're right I mean there could have been some incident that he recalls an event conflated the two of them\nAll right Jim Lewis thank you and good work and we'll look forward to your reports on this and stay in touch with us you never know who's going to talk to Joe All right Jim White the targets worlds helps with that\nSees gave Christmas Day cold weather center here's your exclusive you one of the forecast of\nA good deal of sunshine forward today Honda fifty nine this afternoon and we'll start out clear signs have been ... throughout the night a low down to forty three and a lot of clowns round for tomorrow's couple showers I sixty four was the arrows exclusive accuweather somebody ...\nAccuweather on the voice of some of the New England news talk Ninety nine seven of them and I am six thirty WPRI [noise]\nIf\nYou work hard for your money why not send it was just the way they treat you should stay job ... most of us left sign chocolate and Hank died like chocolate bars has three or four dollars each ... will sound you find\nThat guy that chocolate bars for ten dollars then we'll give you a dollar a crazy gift cards for me that's\nLike getting your guy chastised for nothing how about energy bars side energy bars for ten dollars and we'll give you I can dollar crazy deal gift card free\nScience hand among organic now sprayed ten dollars and we'll give you ten dollars crazy tailgate scarring free we know what the retailer offering crazy deals like bees you can also get your money back in the form of a gift card when you buy sell for ... ...\nIt's like shopping for free\nIf he seems to be true he's not too bad she gained a lot of\nWhat happened you used to go hours without visiting the bathroom now it seems like you're constantly getting up to ... listen the makers of super beta prostate or introducing a new wonder pill super beta prostate piece three advanced with three key ingredients that are great for your prostate to celebrate your first thirty days supplies free\nShipping and handling get pi three advanced free call one eight hundred two one five nine three six zero one eight hundred two one five nine\nSix zero one eight hundred two one five nine three six zero [laughter]\nI'm a ... so I have one job I Can't pass so science or being John some guy who does a ton more like give you twenty four seven\nThousands of life is aging only been around for over Seventy five years and as a Ninety seven percent customer satisfaction eating five just mediocre and he says ... also has an award winning [laughter]\n\n\nGeico expect great savings in a whole lot more Mexican native ... individual results Mayberry see ...

retirement approaching you need to gain the shore and say your financial professional is looking at the entire retirement puzzle not just one piece of it\nI firmly believe that at least in most cases pre retirees and retirees too for that matter need someone with the knowledge and experience to understand how all the various pieces of your financial life it together\nAnd to actually put together a coordinated comprehensive financial strategy that incorporates all of those different puzzle pieces\nNow that's something not all financial professionals are qualified or prepared to do\nYou know some have a narrow focus maybe they're sweet spot is more insurance but they don't look at the investment side of things or maybe their focus on just investments but can't really offer much help with the insurance side of things\nYou want to avoid situations where you're getting advice about a certain aspect of retirement\nFrom a professional who maybe it's an experience in that aspect of retirement you also want to avoid situations where the advice or getting may not be on target because the financial professional who is providing that advice isn't seeing the entire picture I have a simple analogy for this\nYou know if you just do insurance based products or if you just to invest\nAnd it's like hopping into a boxing ring with one arm tied behind your back and you can only swing with one hand\nAnd maintain you'll be fine but what about your four one K. or your investments\nYour retirement into the stock market is that a great run the last few years but just the market turmoil make you

A. S. S. E. Y. Massey on money dot com\nToday Justin walking us through a checklist that he's made a seven items we need to be clear about to help determine if we are indeed getting the right financial advice for our own transitioned retirement have yet to number five what is that that died um\nHomosexual we've touched on a little bit already you know you're following a written strategies or a plane that's put in place that is well thought out that's that's encompassing all the different retirement puzzle pieces that are out there\nThat also has some flexibility to adjust what might change in the future or if there are unforeseen circumstances\nNow I'm Talking about something that that sets out the details and the substance strategies you plan to implement to get you to him for retirement while working towards your goals all along the way\nNo with this type of written strategies can pull off the shelf will pull it up on the computer screen this is a compass that can keep you on the right path in terms of the approaches that you use to help grow preserve and spend down the retirement resources that\nYou have those assets where your income is et cetera essentially the path I'm Talking about connects her retirement resources to your goals\nIt should answer all the big financial questions about your income about tax efficiency about managing your retirement accounts about your different types of insurance and what you should or maybe don't need to have\nAnd then it should also handle wealth transfer it should handle cash flow your cash reserves you know that's one item near the cash reserves so we see so many people that I think you're doing it wrong they only have five or ten thousand in the bank we feel that that's nowhere near enough\nFor cash reserves you know and it needs to be handled so all of those types of things are kind of tied up in a nice little package so that you know you can turn to it and say All right this is what we're doing and we know this is how things are going to unfold as we go forward this is how we're going to take our income as we move forward et cetera\nSaid yeah you really do believe that having that actual formal strategy it makes a difference\nIt sure does and I mean it starts with all the mouse and that's that's a key point let's do the analysis let's determine what your risks level is and what your tolerance would be and then we build the playing around that\nAnd we have some interesting software now that\nI'm Will show us probabilities of you getting through your retirement years and we plug in what you currently have her assets what your current level of expenses are what your income is it going to change in the future we can plug all this them\nAnd we ask you what your life expectancy would be you know how old do you think you might live now I Know it's a weird question are you know the answer but we try to get people to consider that they may live up to age Ninety and then this software\nWill run up to ten thousand different variations to determine the probability of you reaching life expectancy\nWith enough into and there's it's pretty cool and when we show people how we can just do some little tweaks to the investment strategy overall and ended up with a much different outcome\nIt's great to to watch their face and they see they look at it go up so yeah so we've got a pretty good plan there because we have a high probability of success no if you don't have a high probability of success will then we need to get to work and try to figure out how to tweak your plan\nTo get you to the higher probability\nGap we're talking about your tech less today verifying if we're getting good financial advice for transitioning their retirement what's the next item\nThe six item on that checklist is to gauge whether you're getting skilled trance parents service from the financial professional that you're working with\nThe way I see it financial professionals have to earn the right to advise you guys you with your finances in your retirement\nWhen you trust me with your finances I view that as an honor and privilege I Believe I earned the right to serve an advisor by treat you as I Would want myself to be treated and how I Want my finances to be treated with the utmost care\nWith transparency and honesty and integrity with all the skill resources and tools that we here at our from have at our disposal\nAnd for those folks that come in and meet with us and go through our proprietary process the mass money retirement road map they get a chance to look at all of this\nAnd decide for themselves if we fit the bill for them\nSo that sounds of interest to you and you'd like to take advantage of our\nComplimentary offer for our complete process to do a full evaluation of first we start with your goals and do we think we can help you with the goals going forward\nThen we gather your statements we we do an in depth analysis we come back with a report we take you through the report and ... there's a ton of information in it\nWe make it simple and understandable and you will likely know more about your investments after that second meeting then you ever did at least that's the feedback that we get\nFrom our listeners when they come in and meet with us and go through our process and they can see where all too often they have way too much risk and their portfolio especially if they are in close proximity to retirement or worse if they're already enriched time\nBecause let's face it the market has been on an absolute run for the last like ten years so\nUm do category another ten years well theoretically it could but that that's kind of a gamble in my opinion to think that the market will continue to grow up like it has been for the last ten years and we want to take some strategies and bring those to the table that will help preserve those assets that you've earned over the last\nTen years gas from the client's perspective what exactly does it mean to have transparency from your financial professional\nSo it's about our team you're amassing associates I being up front so you know exactly what we're recommending and how we're recommending it it's about us being transparent\nAnd leaving no mystery about how we're being compensated because we lay that all out for our listeners when they come in\nBecause it's important for you to know that\nAnd it's about us being ethical and having integrity in every aspect of our dealings with your listeners\nAnd it's also about being readily accessible to you know I Do have a lot of daily meetings so we have a team here so if I Can't get back to one of our team members might get back to you and we we try to get back with everybody in the same day\nNow I Will say we don't always get to do that because we are very busy\nBut we are looking at trying to make sure that we return those calls as quickly as we can with the right information that you're looking to hear back\nYet glad you mentioned what you did there I Want to just clarify a little bit more they'll how exactly in the financial professional someone like you how are you compensated\nSo some professionals such as investment advisor representatives are compensated by clients sued the fees that they charge\nSo we are investment advisor represented so when we handle assets there is an advisory see that's charged what we hear from our from our listeners when they come in the middle of this is their amazed that we can bring so much to the table\nFor the level of fees that were charging\nSo that's I Love your on that because we know that we are absolutely providing a huge amount of value", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Matt Allen Show", "city": "Providence", "day": "14"}
