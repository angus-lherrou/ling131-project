of your phone intervening into police on behalf of friends and now\nWe should change we [noise]\nWe knew that that sounded like a oh that's scary music for when you listen when you watch on TV and

police had to come in there was a huge state police\nA report on Alan song and his police department Cranston and it was better known as ticket gate and and it's been brought up it's been brought up many many times it was brought up in the first debate is the second debate tonight on channel ten\nAre they doing a debate the gubernatorial debate I thought that I Know what the Tuesday for some reason it maybe tonight I'm so this ad aired for the first time today and last\nNight I was watching I Can't remember if I take it or not because I Do record a jeopardy and just try to keep my brain cells alive and um\nIf there weren't four or five I think in that half hour both governor and ... and Alan ... a presence there going back and forth with their ads against each other now this is a new one it's thirty seconds obviously why did the state police take over the grants and police department I Know those that were in that\nLast race hot and heavy when can block was involved and it was a real split in the Republican voters\nIf it got pretty nasty we're all receiving you know just weird information in the mail and trying to you know really play dirty politics I ignored it I don't know if anyone else talked about it I I was an substantiated it was nasty it was just ridiculous and um and in in\nThis uh I'm I'm I'm feeling it's coming around again in the final weeks I think when we hit the one month market really going to see it uh some of the national\nUm groups have put some more money into Allen song on the Republican side and as we all know what's been said a million times\nAnd for a million reasons because the government does sitting on millions still she spent at least probably five million already and she may go up she may break the or the last\nA threshold that she had I think she spent between eight and ten million dollars on her first wrong definitely eight and she's I guess in line to spend that as well because now the ads are really coming out so uh we'll see it's um\nAnd then the phone campaign put out a a response after that attack ad it said the idea that Gina Raimondo who exchanges campaign donations for support projects and get smacked down by the ethics commission after attempting to circumvent revolving door laws\nIs talking about corruption is laughable\nThis governor so out of touch with reality it's a spectacle Alan's on takes

stepped into it he said he was responsible them the officers were saying that he was harassing them and he retaliated against those that I'm at work at a following his lead so I don't mind is a little

fifty we're turning them the or the crank on the phone\nActually and here it is yes that's true with the last bastion of\nHigh tech over here the wreck it says are for the record ... has never met this guy I'm going to say his name matter of fact I shouldn't say his name because I don't even know who knows this guy is actually walking around with that name it's not even him\nSo please stop calling our house and asking for him the phone call started around nine pm Wednesday night to Murray locus woman Newport one of them was a robocall saying blank blank you blanket ... piece of blank\nAnd the guy's name your piece of blank oh my God you should've heard them you're a drug addict crawling from under a rock I don't know if that was somebody disguising their voice but it sounds like a robocall probably that's honorable cause a probably a robot voice voice changer\nI'm as poor woman who's who's gonna who's sick\nShe's getting finally get to sleep or on two AM people calling her up she doesn't even know this guy's name the name on a Twitter account singled out during the judiciary hearing Tuesday into Tuesday with Brett Kavanaugh\nUm and it goes to this whole thing so she's got her landline six years ago\nThis is I'm telling you something's going on here I think Senator Whitehouse\nNeeds to talk more about this person and he took it needs to know how this whole thing went on that was this just a phone call we voted on hey so to me this person grabbed a number do did they even do anything to find out this person was a real person is this some kind of plant\nAnd it's like the fish yes left out in the sun yes every additional day sips out in the sun it stinks more yes\nThis is true this whole does anybody this by I don't even think this person's real\nI don't even know if there's a real person we've never seen the person that I Know of I don't I'd unless I'm missing something I Would know the ... the Twitter account as a bunch of tweets on it but there's no pictures\nThat I've seen this is a mystery and you know somebody who's\nVery much aware of fake news trolls on box somebody was somebody who was on Twitter and they were talking about this being a a report it as a bought their report it is about now is this a prank to the senator was this a prank to the let me tell you what this was this is the story in the journal\nPropaganda fake news trolls and\nBox [laughter] Ryan amoral story in the journal today White House Kavanaugh source in Rhode Island do apology\n\nAngrily denied allegations of sexual misconduct on Thursday Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh said some accusations including one stemming from an hour last minute smears that has destroyed his family his good name crazy stuff gangs illegitimate children fights on boats in Rhode Island\nAnd this is what's\nThe White House had to say Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse said it's his kids constituent a quote regular guy who's owed an apology\nThey're trying to throw him onto the bus I think as a demonstration that other people come forward will be treated very roughly what I was told reporters after Joe Biden's visit to Rhode Island convention center on Sunday before the Rhode Island man came forward Kavanaugh had been accused by Christine Blasey Ford blah blah blah blah\nI'm\nThrow it out man who based on details from his Twitter account has been identified as such and such of Tiernan contact the White House's office last week about a sexual assault to a female friend he said that occurred in Nineteen eighty five in Newport a fight then ensued leaving the Senate with significant injuries according to the man\nWhen I was also the FBI give her reporters contact information to ... to the guy according to a letter from White House is really White House released by the committee\nHe did so the constituents request a spokesman for white out said Monday no media reports ever came out of it White House said a spokesman for White House could not identify could not identify the constituent or would not excuse me would not identify the constituents important a spokesman for the White House for White House would not identify the constituent\nNone of this is good yeah so this person could not be reached for comment by multiple media sources now I don't is it this is very interesting because number one\nIf you come forward and want to level the allegations against a Supreme Court nominee or through your senator chances are you may have to go public so that comes into the calculus of whether or not you actually come forward right\nSo I guess there's a loose point to be made by Sheldon Whitehouse that a person trying to make a confidential accusation\nOr you know should be able to do that but at the same time they want to give somebody a contact information reporter unless you want that story out\n\nSo it's a very least shut the White House is guilty of trying to get somebody to go ahead and tell their story to a reporter\nEven though the story is you know may not even have anywhere near or close to truth to it how much of a vetting of this kind of stuff there's a senator do they just take it okay and passed them all on at this and let the Judiciary Committee take care of it I don't bring the facts to light yes\nAnd so\nYou have shown the White House he goes on what's both saying\nThe roam the animal spirits in the room and then\nLindsey Graham versus out you say that and I just went on his own explosive statement we're not just entirely logical people there aren't animal spirits of humanity love that\nDon't know what it is\n[noise] the way senator White House is not a it's not the way he sounds it's the it's the the words he chooses the guy cracks me up I don't know what it is\nThere is a popular legend of the emperor ...

like does he support roe v Wade [laughter]\n[laughter] oh my God\nThis is a fascinating Wilbur was throwing [laughter]\n\nToads place that you'll be for the concert [laughter] ah but the question

for an apology to somebody that even exists at this point do we have confirmation that anybody you know we've got the call center White House's office and ask them whether or not there's any confirmation that this then they check this guy out at all\nManipulated truths false news stories and conspiracies [laughter]\nJust want to know if the guy's real some poor guy with this was some person person with this person this guy's name is probably Ninety five years old watching a Red Sox going huh\nI don't know what the allegations were specifically so the guy call but Senator Whitehouse Ford's this stuff off to the FBI the investigation and then he goes ahead and and\nOffers a muscle reporter on top of it and I mean nobody nobody did the story I don't know who the reporter was a show the White House\nOr offer it up to him or not but this guy is only identified through his backtracking through a Twitter account which has no picture on it that's kind of just there and has been reported as a ... a bunch of different times phone number that he got called called a woman's house was like sixty eight with cancers getting harassed by people\nThis is a weird story that needs

shed you may have I noticed some of the stuff is starting to form in the back side of my house that doesn't get hit by son very often\nUm you know with walkways and patios can make it slippery can make a dangerous you take you take so much pride in your property and you look up your roof ... streaks ... don't power wash that stuff I see sometimes people get the power wash the siding you're going to damage it\nCalled revolution soft washed they'll come and literally soft wash the thing with a formula that kills the stuff that the roots when you when you power wash it it cuts the tops often just grows back next year do yourself a favor they've got a five year a guarantee that will keep that stuff off you don't have to do whatever again\nRight within that five years now you're

off the right way with revolution soft wash\nMy math talent show news talk Ninety nine seven after him and I am six thirty WPRI\nOh yeah I was reading an article in order to earlier today about the gender gap when it comes to this election\n[noise] Frank Lloyd ...\nHistoric gender gap in modern American flows wide scale gender gap in modern American history\n[noise] vote your genitalia [noise]\nI'm gonna ask you about this when we come back to this is one I got I got to get to the bottom of this one will talk about that\nThe governor has put out an ad going after Alan phone overs Cranston police scandal will that stick we'll talk about that and we'll take your calls we come back my numbers for three eight oh you'll be all of this whole free number one eight hundred three two one WPRI ... and if you know there's the ah the the guy who supposedly poll Sheldon about\nBrett Kavanaugh [noise] you know tell them I'm looking for them to want to talk to him right your next to them I don't show [noise]\nSomebody a NSM we from the New England truck solution studio this is a station you count on for news traffic whether we can talk Ninety nine seven AM six thirty W. B. R. O. prominence cumulus station [noise]\nAfternoon and the revolution soft wash new center I'm pause and Gary what the one o'clock WPRI news\nA lot of angles to covering the Providence School bus strike now one day for but negotiations not one of them city officials going public today to apply pressure on the Teamsters and first student to get back to the bargaining table senator Harold ... saying it's wrong to have kids caught in the middle\n... years both parties to get together as prayer for\nWe don't want our students to be used as scores during the deliberations\nAny sort of acknowledgement\nIs anything but a horrible\nTo get mentioned never get never gets tickets spoke enough and so this\nIdea that one side versus the other one's why because they they demagogue the fake pay a a fair pay nonsense\nWhich is by the way folks do little research equal pay this concept that equal pay no they're now they're pushing I saw any time I see the the attorney\nGeneral more Healy from from Massachusetts pushing any political agenda I gave vehemently ill I Am I oh forget it because I don't I think she is a radical partisan slash a leftist that is has no desire to look at the real world\nBut rather a desire to push unity logical goal\nAnd she's promoting this whole idea of comparable work rather than an equal work and you start to get into that nonsense and I'm telling you that is a road to hell\nBecause that's nothing but uh you know trying to control people's outcomes rather than their opportunities and when you start to start to take radical of governmental action to control the outcomes of things rather than just the opportunities you don't want to go down that road folks\nThat's the road to destruction\nBecause that's when you start having everything control them playing by the government and it is a disaster history has shown over and over and over again equality of outcome equals disaster\n\nBecause when you leave people to their own devices\nThey may choose things you don't necessarily think are good for them\n\nYou understand what I'm saying most of the pay gap we talk about in this country today has to do with choices\nChoices that women make versus what men make choices in their lives choices and their jobs choices in their professions choices and how long they work choices to have children not to have children these are things that exist not as not as a\nTool of the patriarchy but things that exist as natural consequence of both biology\nAnd just reality and and and ...\nAnd a lotta times of um of your orientation to the world and you're um um the proclivities that you know biology helps to influence\nUm there's lots of science that that that talks about that talked about uh women have different personalities they have different ... different wants and desires probably coming stemming from I Would imagine their biological um make up to have children\nAnd so therefore those things\nThey build little you know construct the way I look at it as like this picture you are you are born with a palette of\nPaints you know based on where you're born who you're born to your talents your\nUh your education level you associate you don't control any of this stuff right\nI consider myself to hit that he had to have hit the lottery that I'm born in the United states of America in two thousand Eighteen or you could have been born in Iraq someplace I could have been born in a in a in a in a hot in the Amazon I don't know\nUm and so those things give you a parameter through which you live your life so there's a certain level of control that I had in a certain level of control they don't have and one of those things that\nImpacts my everyday perception of the world and understanding of the world\nIs the fact of the men\nAnd women will have the same situation basically then those those things you know they have those ... there's some in not every woman most women will have these parameters\nAnd so those parameters tend to put women in different places than with men and those different places tend to be more things like health care related you're teaching dealing with children dealing with people who need dealing with people who are\nUm who need help a lot with health care\nWill tend to gravitate more towards engineering those types of stem things that we're\nTrying to get women involved in more now why I have no idea um because automatically what the woman and being involved in something means that automatically is better what if they're not suited for it or if they don't like it\nThese are all questions you can ask because or gender or urge\n[noise]\nSo I read this article about this genders big gender gap this Brett Kavanaugh thing is going to be so tell me about this I Want to know from you I Love to talk to real life people about this stuff because\nWhat you see in polls and what you see in the political a discussion doesn't automatically mean that it's real and it doesn't automatically mean that means everybody which is why I up for the identity politics and the dehumanizing impacted has an individual's\nSo ladies I'd love to speak with you about this\nAnd about how much do you actually put it what's interesting is that when you focus too much on one side\nYou get a reactionary reaction from the other side reactionary action from the other side and so all this focus on women's issues and about how women do this and women need that and we're against women women the war on women all this nonsense starts to create a reactionary force than the\nOther side I find myself doing this the other day that Mazie Hirono when she started talking about how um\nAbout how many to step up shut up and step up up up up up up\nSort of what you just completely broad brushing all men and and it denigrating all men because you know why not you can we're supposed to just ... sit there and and you know shut up and take it\nUm I I started to think to myself you know something why would any man ever vote for that woman you'd have to be a crazy person\nWhy would any mass so to think about this why would if you're gonna make broad brush statements like that why would any man ever ever ever ever vote for anybody that considers himself to be one of these new wave third wave feminists\nYou'd be like a turkey who puts his head on the stump waiting for the former to come along\nWhy would any man ever do that why would you ever what would you ever touch your nose to spite your\nSon makes no sense and because that ... it's like because that is unless you're a complete\nA you know there's some guys out there that just a lot of young guys trying to score chicks basically a who go out there and they wanna they wanna completely and totally a virtue signal like you wouldn't believe you know\nYou know that I Love that that's a a K yeah uh-huh ah right you know trying to show how well they are\n... ah you're an ally your uh\nYour your like e Gore is what you are\nI mean this is the ... and and this is the battleground that's been set up they loved the gender wars when I say hey politicians people struggling for power they loved\nThe stuff they love it\nAnd so for ladies out there I'd love to hear from you how much of you are actually going to be going in voting for your gender and what that means today\nRight now in this time and this and this place and my numbers for three eight WNPR oh the toll free number one eight hundred three two one WNPR oh Karen is a more caring your WPRI camera\nNow I'm not a parent or not but when you got that right around ... or more I\nDon't know I said so that's why you didn't say that I said this is why women and men have to see overall have different interests and that's why you see more men in engineering than women right now\nOr are you wrong on it and I don't go away or to gather and I'm not going to monitor from and I are trying to go there for about a on a credit not a good or not mhm correct the record or an hour and I thought wow I Wonder where that come I got that one\nIs a lot of people out there that are having those are the printing him up and pass them around but\nYou look like on the ... song and all that and I said to her\nAnd her mom and I want one but now I'm a fire in fact now I'm not going to jump in on line we're buying around or not that bad\nOr what about voting though are picketing I'm Talking about voting are you going into the polls were making about what's best for women\nNow for better or Rhode Island or ... better job or I'm not for type ... on the back on and the\nClub you know they're now on I'm voting for a better Rhode Island\nYeah and it's interesting Karen thank you for the call I mean I think that's most most people like that I mean I don't you know I mean if if for all intents and purposes\nIf there is a you know a candidate after that it's better for women and there should be a candidate out there that's better for men what does that mean what does that mean what is that even look like Ron doesn't Fall River runs a urine WPRI Rhonda\nHow ... how I Am thank you I just wanted to get like a shot a little background on that

women\nCare about and then push that and so everybody kind of believe that and they go for it or 'cause I knew I could tell you it's one of the the the pro life pro choice thing is very interesting to me because\nI Know a lot of women who are would\n\nThey just wouldn't I Know them they wouldn't do it\nThey just would they wouldn't ditch they wouldn't ever do it\nThey fight like hell for somebody else to do it but they would never do it on their own so I often wonder like what are you fighting for now I get the concept of the privacy and the whatever the the philosophical concept of it I think it's kind of like you know back off me leave me when I got to do my own thing here quite get that part of it\nBut there's a lot of that stuff like that there's a there's I Know that the you know most women I Know know that the pay gap\nOr stuff is nonsense\nThat they don't they don't receive the thing I hear from the women that I Know most about their pay is that they have a hard time advocating\nTo thinking that they cause you have to have a certain level of screw you I'm outta here\nRock the boat mentality which\nA lot of people don't have not just women but overall women tend not to have it because they like things to be chill\nAnd they work\nAnd they just want to be recognized and they just if they want their hard work to show for itself that's just the way it works in the business environment or the work environment you're gonna go advocate for yourself and there's a lot of people have a hard time with that that's why that hold the seat was a CFO of Facebook was at a Sheryl I'm Kevin Kevin ... name um\n[noise] she wrote that book lean in 'cause that's all about you know women deciding to take a to take chances of women deciding to put themselves up for promotions to to advocate for themselves more to speak up in the workplace and that's a show Sandberg thank you and so those are things that are\nHappening more often because you know there's been focused on women do more that\nThat doesn't come natural to a lot of people so the women I Know know that the the pay gap thing isn't necessarily a ... and they it's not necessarily about or not at all about\nOr very little about discrimination I'm sure that exist someplace as discriminate ... nation for all different reasons will exist in some places this anti male discrimination out there um\nYou know they exist these things exist but when you when you actually take into consideration the types of jobs are women take or and the the amount of hours at a work the types of jobs a dangerous nature of jobs and things like things like that the the the pay gap disappears\nKUHF it disappears and so\nYou know you have the women I Know that but they will they supposedly they'll buy into the fact that the pay gap as a thing and that politicians who ... were you know want to create phony pieces of legislation that do nothing to really help a pay gap the real\nYou realize what you're talking about right 'cause you create this situation where you would use a war you better take a side and you know if it's like I'm trying to think of when\nWe come back we'll give you an

having having them ... be a viable perspective on how to look at the world look\nAt them as some kind of an attack on one another is the problem\nRight there's getting yanked symbols what you're talking about ready to get that content of the two different energies that the two different types of the union the yang right and it's like a male and female it's everywhere in the universe ordering

... anybody who's claims to speak for sexual males you don't want speaking for you\nBecause we're generally accepted to be individuals with individual points of view so why can't we think that about every body I thought that was the whole point and by the way when you think about everybody your compassion level goes through the roof\nAnd see what I'm saying\nBecause when you look at everybody not as some you know down trodden um when you look at everybody has some kind of a member of a downtrodden sub group\nThen you'd get to pick out the worst among those people and and blanket everybody with it because look this this person did that and so therefore that means everybody else is responsible for it when you start looking at everybody as individuals\nWith their own lives their own experiences their own way of looking at the world they're their own\nLosses their own loves their own hates their own whatever pains and mistakes then you realize that everybody has a story to tell\nThat you can't really judge anybody based on where they've been what they've done a what's happened to them and what they should do what they looked like it can judgment based on what they've done while they've reacted what's happened to them things like this and uh and everybody is is unique and therefore their opinion\nIn Internet granted you you try to look at research about general feelings for population so that you can you know get trends and if something's happening to one group of people you can point that out and and what not but overall when it comes to governmental forces when it comes to the law it should be about the individual\nComes to politics or should be about in the individual that's the best thing about our system quite frankly the best thing about our about our uh our\nOur individual the recognition of our individuals individuality should save of individuals in our law is that you know the individuals\nSacred and at the right to protect you from everybody else it's beautiful thing there's no mob rule it can't be Marlboro you know if you want to give that up in in in uh in exchange for the safety of the mob God Bless I don't want it\nThe reason why I'm even mentioned in this is because last hour we're talking about this whole idea of the gender gap in the elections and ... and all that nonsense people speak for and then the president was asked as he's off don't use this marine one or is this going there was a marine one's going to the helicopter\nUm because you can barely hear anything in the background with when people ask the questions you that when they stopped the roar of the engine and his answering questions I wasn't on the tarmac so I think is a marine one and uh he\nAsked is being asked about the presumption of innocence about the capital proceedings then it gets into you know what you have a message for young but one of the reporters that you have a message for young men in America\n\nAnd so listen this is Donald Trump\nAnd uh and and you know I'm sure people will give them credit for this but listen to what he had to say\nIt's a tough thing going on as you can be a headache blurry versus the thirty five years and then somebody comes as they say you did this or\nThat and they give free which is just as easy for you with that this voice do not corroborate what you were saying at the very scary\nSituation where you're guilty until proven innocent my whole life my whole life I've heard your innocence until proven guilty but now you're guilty until proven and it says that is a very very difficult than\nThan what\nI say that it's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be a sea of something that you may not be guilty of sleep is a very very very difficult time\nWhat's happening here has much more to do that even the appointment of it's a free for just it really does you could be somebody that was perfect yours higher life somebody should've his you up stuff that\nDoesn't necessarily have to be a woman as everybody say what somebody could accuse you of something you're automatically guilty but it's just well you are truly guilty until proven innocent that's one of the very very bad thing to Second Life right\nYou listen to that that's that's the the the president getting onto it looks sounds marine won the helicopter and so you you you hear him say that and how can you disagree with that\nUm\nObviously coming from a guy who's been accused of many things that's going to be something that some people are gonna roll their eyes at\n'em\nBut you know for me I look at that and I said you know it it it shouldn't be it shouldn't be about anything else but nominating somebody to the Supreme Court\nBut what happens\nIt's dangerous to do that because you have to you again once you make one thing about everything else then it stops people from looking at each individual situation it's own particular contacts and its own particular situation it's own particular uh a light that's supposed to be looked in\nYou know you had those those people who are who are cornering Jeff Flake and that day in the in the elevator last week\nOr talking about how how could you do this to victims how could you do this to women and I've heard this over and over again and this isn't I mean if you can make it it's convenient politically to do something like that 'cause it allows you to paint your your opponent to wherever they may be into a corner I'm\nTo say that your your actions one specific case you speak to everybody about everything but you have any idea how stupid that is\n\nYou have any idea how bad that is now if you see a pattern\nOf somebody doing this over and over and over and over and over and over again then one thing you know you can start to get that there's a pattern there and you can start to question whether or not somebody has an overall philosophy on something but one individual moving very contextual point of view when it comes to suspicious specifically to a Supreme Court justice in in a case that is\nUm [noise]\nThat is obviously highly politically charged and therefore opens itself up into all sorts of possibilities you can't sit there and say something like that\nYou can't have that because you you nobody would be able to do\nAnything ever if my opinion about one specific thing automatically in your mind makes you think that I Believe something about everything else [laughter]\nIt's such laziness I don't know to tell you it means it stop you from having to sink\nIt stops you from having to look at the situation to understand and to to reach out into thinking to put yourself in somebody else's position it stops you from having to do anything just allows you to blankets somebody and really fundamentally put them in a box\nThat are then allows you to either act against them to hate them to to label them either fairly or unfairly doesn't matter\nFair to screw famous I just want to put you in this little box where I can get them when I got to get done this is this is a very sick way to look at human life folks\nBecause again it goes back to where there's no such thing as cooperation there is no such thing as anybody having the best of intentions there's no such thing as any person any wherever trying to get through this world\nWith their head up and and I try to do the best thing for themselves and their community new it's just all about power struggles know there might be a reason as to why people believe that because in their world that's what is real and the world of Washington DC that's what it is in the world of Hollywood that's what it is\nAnd they project their garbage on to the rest of us\nI've never seen him or\nDemented group of individuals more and more um insanely incest Jewish we can't herbalist a group of individuals than people in Hollywood and they assume their reality they deliver to using each other like a bunch of tissues a ... is is the way to you and I work out here in this world\n\nThey forget themselves they're so used to being used and abused\nBy Hollywood moguls and executives and everything else and uh in in ... bucks that they think everybody opera operate that way no it's really just\nYou it's really just you\nSame thing in politics the rest of us are out here trying to you know cooperate and live life together and build a family of build a business build a relationship build whatever\nAnd while you guys are over there swapping\nYou sell your grand but most of us love our grandmothers\n\nYou know that's the behavior I see so you know\nThis was this weird things\nSo should should boys be scared out there right now I think everybody should be scared\nEverybody should be scared\nIn terms of the of the ability\nTo just make accusations and not have anything to back it up and then have it stick and and take away opportunity from you or possibly end up in a in a a you know a place where you get prosecuted for the wrong reason\nUm I think everybody ... and by the way boys in general in this country should be scared for a lot of different things because they're behind in almost in\nAn almost ... are heading bad stuff from behind the good stuff in almost every measurable way possible\nSo if you want to start getting into that I'd love to get into that not just because of this but because
