charged with simple assaults the he said originally\nYou played no low according to the court records that was a not guilty thing there's some confusion as to whether or not that actually means what it means\nUm so anyway nothing came of it um and then all of a sudden the police report comes up the ... port puts in some more details the details being that according to the um\nAccording to the to the to the the witness statements I guess what happened was the police it seems to me from based on what the police report was\nThat the police went down there it was they went to the scene told everybody go leave each other alone because I guess it was originally was ... father was and it was in a back and forth with furlough over this issue and then they end up coming to the police report police station later on to file a complaint\nAnd two young kids and no one I think make Matty oh and the other one I Believe was just like a witness a child witness\nA told a story about how they were making some noise playing football fields that they were swearing or whatever\nYou can read the whole thing at our website six thirty WPRI dot com one of the allegations that's made in there's that he was hitting the head and it was it and they had three times the talking gun and\nThe other allegation why it's just part of the allegation out or if it was that at the time it was the focus was that Joe said at the time that he was going to if they didn't leave him alone they're going to you know going to kick his ads or something like that are killing him or whatever and then get a bunch of a get a couple of N. words racial epithets\nTo come over and crush their bones now on\nFriday and then your show Joe ... says I never remember seeing anything like that I didn't talk like that it didn't make any sense to me I wouldn't say that\nI'm blah blah blah\nAnd I got to tell you I saw this stuff and heard about this stuff on friday and I'm sitting there going to help you deal with this what what what is the proper place for all this information right because it was first seemed to be like a funny bygone era or I mean that's the way I took it originally was speaker of the house when he was a kid\nWas a little bit of a ... in the neighborhood gun into little kerfuffle and there was a thing and then they'll get everybody made up afterwards and then uh you know the speaker wasn't offended by their friends now and it was like this you know things happen when you're younger and you do stupid stuff and so what\nIn back in the day you know a neighbor your ... some kid upside the head was not uh the the the end all that wouldn't be the end of the world to get his today and do something that happened\nBack then you know it was it was what it was and people change over time they mellow while they do whatever whatever that's the way I took those extra story about the Larry Earhart thing which was you know that was like you stupid guy stuff and they just kind of brushed it all off and ...\nEven with the with the allegations of of somebody yelling the saying the N word even that I you know this is the third is to kids saying this stuff in and by the way the way that the police described the behavior even the police station\nOf the young ... of of mc nabb yell at the time if I'm reading the report correctly I it's hard to read because all the names redacted um\nGoes to show that there was like the thing that I get a guy was out of control people change by the way who you are when you're a teenager you know Thirteen year old kid is not who you are when you're forty\nFive years old thank God if you are able to tell you\nUm and so you know Nick ... barest I can understand why but I you know I don't hold that against him for being a little bit of a healthy and so what so if you're not one now\nUm\nBut the fact of the matter is you know to the kid ... have exaggerated it was it said I don't know what are we going to do them take the way back machine go try to find out\nIf that's the kind of language if somebody uses today in two thousand and Eighteen and thinks that way and says that stuff it's an abhorrent thing it's not welcome in civil society it's not a it's not something we any of us want or condone I think it's grotesque\nSo whatever the thing that bothers me that bothered me to over the weekend is looking at the quote from Joe trailer and Kathy Greg's story which is obviously had been to cause some kind of a A R consternation of the ... campaign\nAnd the quote is basically because of the anger\nThat uh that I guess Joe felt as a result of this this information coming out he blames it on this whole thing on the phone campaign\nUm the last quote and Kathy Greg's story from the journal which I Believe was posted on friday but was in the paper and it was also in Mandeville commit suicide by the way my apologies um\nThe last line in the story is quote I'll stay\nIn this if I've got two points as long as I take them away from him now fellow said I don't ever want him to want to see him become governor\nNow that's been the rap on Joe ... since day one he announced on this show in Studio with me and I have told you and I have said that said this about Bob Healy I said this about everybody who runs in a third party type thing\nYou have the legal right to run and you have a moral right to run if you want the job\n\nIf you want to be governor and you think\nAn opportunity to be a serious candidate however if you're getting into it or at some point have no state in it or have\n\nYou've lost the moral right to my in my mind because ultimately this governor's race is about you [noise] it's about the state it's about\nThe nonsense that goes on around here from corruption to using taxpayer dollars to give away

S. for following up on your show these presumed death\nIs one thing for the Russians were adversarial contest with them but for someone who is dependent on us support US military support particularly to do this is outrageous\nAnd Senator Sheldon Whitehouse unimpressed with the Saudi news service making threatening noises if the U.S presidents that case\nRight they're independent contract right and so you set the feed between the person I mean it's set legislatively but between so it's a ... it's a transaction and usually it's gonna be cash and I'm sure if the person wants to get out and he asked you know we can't leave until he pays the conditioners feet\nHe find fifty dollars a two hundred dollars to people that so people that are listening to understand that I get I get\nJammed up for something that could be or whatever whatever you harass men or something like that you're in you're in Providence and they take in if you want to get out of jail that night\nYou can say can you call the bell commissioner or call they call the justice of peace haven't come down here and do what I was in the rain is and\nIt's an arraignment he ... he said as a judge in effect he can and I can\nIf I had the money I can pay him to come in the rain me yes if I don't have the money that you'd\nJust going to either stay at the police station or sent the ... states have police station overnight which police stations were for not to have the person there and then goes to court the next day\nSo he will take now as soon as Sally sat and this is true sometimes they don't get paid if somebody has a probation via later oh look you've got a record you're going to jail that person's not going to pay him\nHe's just whatever reason doesn't have the cash and so there is sometimes he doesn't get paid but a lot of the times he does [noise]\nI used to say get rich thing I don't think so but I also think there's something having that on your record so he's trying to rebuild a law practice and he see I mean he spoke very confident with me about I mean it's very up front I had to you know have any kids come to visit him in prison it was tough and all I mean I Can't imagine as a parrot\nHe says I'm putting it all back together and ah so his bail commissioner in my mind I think if you have that on your resume that's just one more little building block of getting myself\nBack together plus the fact you get a ... you get a stream of clientele like a you know it's like if you're if you are it's kind of like a imagine a police officer who on the side owned a tone company or oh to an auto body company and he was the new traffic division you know I understand I'm here to write the report about your accident by the way\nWell hard he's he was a real estate lawyer I don't think he's he's not like a terminal opened like ... or they'll let me just say hey if John junior fat John as we call him could get his licence back I mean he screwed client instilled the Supreme Court it was a big hoo ha\nMust sell these argument was look it's bank fraud I didn't really hurt anybody other than I inflated my income\nIt wasn't he was ripping clients off that type of thing and the Supreme Court was very clear and its decision we don't see any impediment we think of Serbia time get back on but get back on your feet\nAll right so the so the issue here the controversy if there is one is that this was the guy's a former state senator he's a connected guy to a certain extent right 'cause he's he played the center for four years sure he gets jammed up on something else and all of a sudden he's on this list how do you get on this list you gotta get appointed by who\nThe chief judge of the district court gene ... right ah she'd been there a while\nUm she have connections to him in terms of ice as senators and he got Johnston\nThere don't know we do know her husband George Mason is a top policy person in or was I didn't even if he's still there but for years he was there\nIn the Senate and it's worked in the center for a long time I we didn't put that in the story because I had no evidence that that played into it look it could have been as easy as a state rappers or a or a\nSenator calling the judge and saying hey what do you think about this now their argument to me was we can't we only giving we can't give lip service to saying giving people second chance justice reinvestment in a reinvestment re entry programs without you know giving people a second chance so\nNot only did she defended than the chief judge pulse to tell who's the chief judge of the justices Supreme Court he said I totally support judge will fall as he is\nUm [noise] decision in the statement though I went back to her two weeks after I got the ... through ... got all the original stuff\nCould work he's a spokesperson spokesperson she said\nIt's unfortunate that a media in query is the first complaint that we've had about Mr ms Sally in the past year mhm\nSo he's doing his job they don't have any complaints about it what the court doesn't seem to get is the optics not that this guy's doing a badge I mean they would've heard obviously if he was not doing the right thing but you call the state police and I heard from somebody yesterday Steve O'Donnell when he was the ... when he was the colonel\nThere was a guy who got appointed to record the he remembered from Twenty years earlier O'Donnell's called up the judge and said he's not coming into our barracks this guy is a criminal record I don't like the optics right Chris Johnson none of these places new before situated he's he's assigned or rotation then they all said really this is like late at\nNight you know it's either after hours or it's overnight and some guy shows up on the mission of the cops are you OK whoever does know who he is he's goes and does this thing and they'll move on about their business\nRight and he goes to court the next morning and does you know I had I had a cop do tell me I look these stories people drop times there were people this was pretty well known in the law enforcement and legal community but what do you do if you're a lawyer you're going to go complained to a judge who then you know everybody's worried about the backlash\nSomebody said to me three finger Louis gets popped and he brought him to form a cell and he goes hey don't I Know you're from Fort Dix where they don't spend a little time down there together not that that would happen but it could happen\nBut you know what's interesting is it seemed to me it speaks to this idea of the reason why I thought the story was interesting is about you know you have to balance somebody being able to reintegrate into society truck which is what you want them to do but at the same time crimes have to have consequences and the consequences um I think\nAlso need to reverberate past whatever your sentences right I mean there's there's there's gonna be it's what you do in life speaks about you\nUnless we're already for that out the window I I think you can have a change of heart but a lot of times you know I don't know and so at the at the same time you also wants to advocate for those people who follow the rules and so if there's a special little hey I Know a guy little Lincoln an odd thing going on and\nThere's patronage and there's all you know when you have any so you have any sort of public official that's allowed to appoint somebody to do something you want to make sure those people are above above reproach in my opinion\nJohn Marion of common cause said the courts are based on crossed right we trust that the people there are going to be making the right decisions and doing the right thing and he said the optics of this make you a question\nIt it may erode your trust a little bit in the court system for doing this and again he he got his license back he can practice he can make a living and you can go have a nice life\nAnd and get clients and that's the I paid my price now I can move on and the reason we did this story as it takes it one step further and you will hear people on the east side I saw it on Facebook all weekend oh you don't know Christmas LA's the greatest guy in the world is stories you know nothing and then I heard people like are you kidding me I mean\nMost of the people I told this story about leading up to they burst out laughing or they're like no\nCome on you know really he's really is come up with a story you talked about John ... a former congressman spread it from a man's brother um she actually used his law practice\nTo create grown clients over ... to to the steel used a legal system to to do to create a whole fraudulent thing\nThat got his license and they got it back and when you laugh at it when he was he was working at the federal rapper remember making the sandwich right and what he\nDid when he went and got that he had all kinds of Rhode Island big wigs write letters to the judge\nAdvocating for people to Patrick Lynch Bill Murphy I Believe was like his ah his his his guardian or whatever it was at the time a former speaker of the house and so this kind of stuff goes on and Rhode Island all the time\nAnd so this is a smaller versions wasn't public corruption it wasn't didn't use like you said then use is legal license to to to fraud anybody whatever you had a personal issue that he dealt with and whatever and he paid his paid his dues now he's doing this\nBut why does he need to get rewarded for it why does it get to ... to say a former state senator Dan gets appointed by a judge to something there's a special relationship there\nOf all the hard they're hard cases out there and legal community that do you just go out I got a bunch of 'em and throw them in their ...\nRussia I mean there's got to be a thing that says that you know we especially when it comes to dealing with the legal system\nLike you're a judge you're technically kind of like a judge right there's nobody else\nSo that's that's that's the thing that there's this is like a perception thing and it's also a making a statement to society what's acceptable what's not acceptable what we embrace them what we don't embrace\nIt it's not and I told Mr ... on friday I said look nothing personal although I said either I understand this is very personal for years you're going to be on the front page of the journal is going to get rehashing all over again the reason I'm doing this story is that a wake up one day and think oh let me go after Christmas Eli\nPeople had expressed to me the concern of the optics optics is the is the main word in this story well in optics is something for\nYou and me because we understand the PR of it right the optics are um something needs to be taken into consideration because you want to send a message to the public that this is not\nYou don't want to give people an excuse especially in the state because the reputation and we have an excuse to doubt what you said the trust of John married to the trust to doubt that the court is not strict on them\nAnd you remember in the eighties and nineties is John Marion pointed out we had tremendous problems remember the slush fund on us with a Matty Smith and all of that and then a judge all media getting popped for a felony and so it's taken\n... years if not decades to try to rebuild that and I think there's a ... just my opinion on all other judges if the chief judge just doing this and she can have a reasons but then everybody gets ... you know like you get lumped in with the media doesn't matter who it is all your media people\nJames skipper

I think you're that's the issue\nThat's the issue I'm flat out of time for this hour next hour\nThere was a DNA test taken by Senator Warren what does it say it may say that she could be um\nWhat was it one one thousand possibly Native American possibly Hispanic [laughter] oh no we'll talk about that devoured and what it means a ...\n[noise] somebody a NFL and we should be from the New England truck solution studio this is the station you count on for news traffic weather standpoint hand news talk Ninety nine seven FM and am six thirty feet are prominent cumulus vicious [noise]\nGood afternoon and the revolution soft wash new center on Paul's and Gary what the two o'clock WB our news Saturday in Turkish investigators checking up the Saudi constantly in Ankara that's the place missing journalist ... entering almost two weeks ago and no one song leave\nThis President Trump says he spoke with the Saudi king and he firmly denied any knowledge of the disappearance of presidents to president says he doesn't want to get into king someone's mind but says it sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers\nAnd not to suddenly veiled threat to oil prices and the U.S economy and the Saudi press if the U.S presidents to harden response and some some Sheldon Whitehouse says that's ...\nThis guy was a reporter for one of our great newspapers and the idea that our government gets to murder\nA a reporter [noise] um we want operating for the Washington Post that America newspaper [noise] no no no I cannot accept\nWere you raised as a Native American were you sitting there I mean it is and I believe about how stupid this is and the left wing hardcore left is I keep saying oh progressive media in this country is eating at a bench Shapiro has a phenomenal column\nOn this today I think it's hysterical marina ... just a couple of seconds over here for you because it's ... it's so true is it the headline is Warren releases studies show she Supreme Lee White media that's\n\nEvidently they did some kind of screw up at the map they had a correction the Boston Globe today\nShe could be anywhere between one ... one thirty second\nAnd one one thousand and twenty fourth\nDNA and me is that genetic service that can help some or find out exactly who you're an sensors where you might be surprised I thought I was just a standard white guy [laughter] like DNA and me so that I actually for forty two percent Cherokee Indian [noise]\nNot just me and my mom's not heighten or the Asian even some of it you're not Russian [laughter]\nUh\nI mean it is unbelievable and have a great thing or this this is the fantastic part adventure bureau so the same media who say that to X chromosomes they'll make you a woman now so that Native American ancestors ten generations go to make you a Native American\n[laughter] [noise] oh\nAnd she claimed by the way do you didn't she claims specifically originally that her parents couldn't get married\nBecause there was some kind of discrimination like your parents had to get married or they'd go scape and be married someplace else and so the issue here is an obvious blue blonde hair blue eyes white woman\nClaiming some form of minority status to get the minority status that was the issue not whether or not she might have brushed up against a a a Native American ancestors someplace\nI have no idea what my DNA says no clue no idea\nI mean I can be I don't I wouldn't be surprised to get some ... probably most of us get some Native American in their Native American African Americans Hispanic American who\nKnows quite frankly who gives a flying you know what their genes\nResenting them I'm Twenty one prevent victim order now and bite\n[laughter]\nWho cares I mean it's interesting you know it's interesting my my inlaws did this and what's fascinating for them because they actually found um they did the twenty three main thing I think they did that somewhere I don't know how they do in the DNA tests and they found cousins that they didn't know about\nLike direct relatives who'd done it as well like literally they had a evidently an aunt or uncle that nobody knew some kinda illegitimate child someplace and so you would you go up to and you on the website you can find people you might not know and find out about family history which is interesting\nBut your heritage nobody sat there and fought that Elizabeth Warren didn't have some tiny portion of genetic material from somebody by the way the way that they do is they can't find\nI guess it's a thing for Native Americans they they can't find enough in Native American DNA to compare to so they had to go get DNA samples from people from\nPeru where was that was the country's they're all Hispanic countries\nAnd they say because all those people came through the bearing straight they all shared it so that you can you can tease out\nThat that uh that information from their genetics so we don't even know\nYou don't even know there was this is so stupid and the people are going crazy that traumatic give a million dollars he's not going to do it this is the W. stuff\nIs exactly what she did what she did was pretend to be something she's not in order to get the street cred this is the intersection Audi stupidity that goes on on the on the ... on the hardcore left wing they try to clean things because you victims status is status\nThat you are based on whatever sort of intersection all um I used to say a joke about this when I was a kid that the most depressed person on the plane that was a gay lesbian was I was a a black lesbian in a wheelchair that couldn't read\n\nAnd because they had to get everybody together and if you had to get all these little or intersection ... at the intersection now where where you're victims status intersects the more intersections you have the more aggrieved you are and therefore in some cases you might be better and more um\nUh in more valuable in terms of your moral compass\nBecause you're a grief status has put you in a place where you are ultimately empathetic to all the place of everybody and if you've ever seen this stuff in work it's hysterical to watch these virtual signaling lunatics have their heads pop off their shoulders\nWhen you could sit there and let her have seen videos online folks it's hysterical go to YouTube you watch a thousand these things where a woman an obvious woman will sit there talk to one of these people and say how dare you call me a woman I'm a man and they sit there in order to live there baloney will sit there and go\n... ... ... oh okay so like yeah\nI'm I'm In and you're not at all but just say it and you claim it and you you put it in it\n[laughter]\nBecause when you have to bend reality to focus to to to serve a political agenda there is no end to it and that's why progressive are as dangerous as against because they liked to bend reality for a political agenda\nGood luck with that folks good luck with that so this is hysterical I got to tell you\nIt's turning into a digital video that she put out I guess the five minute video of her walking around with her family and her brothers who are supposedly Republicans they come out and they're like yeah it's crazy ...\nAnd and [laughter] she says she has\nGot some kind of sliver of of and they completely goes by Trump says my mom's ... is a liar\nNow you're the lawyer that your mom you're the liar Bob's award Bob WPRI Bob\nHey Matt how's it going uh it's\nCrazy how you doing\nI'm doing just fine but I just want to know that I'm related eighth [noise]\nOh how'd you know that cause your mom told you know I think one of those things that may or may in uh jeeze\n[laughter] since you have to say no supposedly didn't have any kids I'm curious how that happened\nWell you know with a wife [laughter] can you imagine that\nI'll tell you you know what it really it's really it's sticking with the Democrats stuff I Know they're like so desperate it's like and they why and limits lie and then fly and you know what nobody even kids now they're lying and they just kill or yeah what kind of just believe anyway even then you lie and\nOh that that's not the best thing about this then it's going to be Trump's fault because he promised to give up this money and she took the test and show she's\nShe what do you mean she's an Indian what does that mean\nDoes that mean people's like real people\nWho actually were raised in tribes and actually live on the reservation they must be ... were raised in the culture and have their their whole thing they must be sitting there going to head and their hands going what the hell's going on here why are we being used this way it's unbelievable Bob thanks for the call\n'cause she's she's living the truth [laughter] believe will will\n\nPrivilege you on TALK of a white privilege white privilege with a dose of intersection out on top of it Elizabeth Warren and they're you know what the ribs in the bay state will fall for it again because they're so India logically or insane\nAnd demanded that they just they don't care they just don't care if they really just don't care it's amazing to me\nThat something that should disqualify anybody from any sort of normalcy you'll this idiocy is just unbelievable here we go\nI got a DNA test done I'm One one can you imagine what you must be one one thousand twenty fourth of here we go again here we go again is it may have\nDone this DNA test stuff that you did you did it change you when you saw where you ... you might be\n[laughter] what are
