people put the silicone of course that's how I don't want to do that so I wait till spring take the windshield out and fix it right and put it back altogether but\nThat you'd have to wait till the

south you're our guy you pay attention\nUnfortunately you know one guy but Rhode Island might get what they deserve [laughter]\nYeah sadly I think yeah what a lot of people aren't realizing it's gonna

great gauge how they ... she had to call for three eight nine seven seven six\nEight hundred three two one do you get a little south of little companies\nHe is the absolute best he does uh he does a great job\nUh we got apparently there's multiple fatalities in that shooting if you're just tuning in ... the mass shooting in Pittsburgh at the tree of life synagogue a which is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania or their apparently three officers shot um we don't know about other casualties the shooter\nIs in custody or they were able to not have the guy and he went on an anti Semitic rent before

bring you more details on that as they become available and wants to keep you up to speed on uh the north east or if you will as it makes its way towards the north east I don't know why they can't say north east or what what's the problem you know do they it is it like a character limit of something that we ...\nYou know I think that whole trend of acronyms like nobody can take full words anymore\nI Know I Know it's a northeastern why do we have to say nor'easter man and now you know it's it's supposed to be like the old\nDown home main thing and I picked her bunnies eight ... ... you know\nAbout a north eastern storm just from North eastern shore and Rob [laughter] we're three nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WPRI right now it looks like pretty much a rain event but the wind is going to start to pick up so we want to keep a weather eye on that as well so a lot going on\nActually today we were supposed to be at a Brown University football or they were going to do in an area that being outdoors there and\nWisely they decided to cancel it in the in the basement storm it or postpone it so I Will be doing that again and and that's always like doing the live shows because then you can come out and say alone and that's always fun to do\nA so we'll take a good look at that when that comes up for three eight nine seven seven sixty eight hundred three two one WPRI that is the toll free number you are listening to the gym often radio broadcast ... back with more after this [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise] I'm brushing studio away from the general election dog kind of an imam next door to me are\nQuarters [noise]\nFrom the revolution solved wash news center this is the W. P. R. O. news at twelve o'clock\nBlown Douglas ... breaking news from Pittsburgh at this hour police reporting a suspect is in custody after a shooting that has caused at least four deaths\nAt least twelve people shot at a Pittsburgh synagogues all happening less than two hours ago three police officers also been shot\nThis happened at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh squirrel hill neighborhood about ten minutes from downtown Pittsburgh squirrel hill is the hub of that city's Jewish community the president of the local Jewish Federation just commented on the shooting\nMy heart goes out to all these families um the should not be happening at\nA tremendous amount of attention or is the race for secretary of state and then the secretary of state's race or you've got the incumbent ... uh who beat Doug Williams do our ...\nIn the primary back uh back four years ago or to become the Democratic nominee and I'm trying to remember she beat on the Republican side to become served as they don't have to remember\nA but she became secretary of state uh and she is you know pretty\nYeah I'm In favor of um you know doing away with voter id in uh in making voting more accessible and asking less questions about who's actually voting\nOn I think that's a fair statement running against or on the Republican side is long time a political operative pat corn or less a A N patch joined us on the show and pat you were telling me earlier that um it was an article in the Providence Journal which I can only read the beginning of 'cause I don't have I don't subscribe to the stupid electronic\nNewspaper um yeah but it's about a ... I guess removing dates of birth from the voter database\nOh that's true a giant and that's a it's a it's mind boggling what she's doing that are that are office and especially regarding the election wars in Rhode Island she's watered down and as a cloak and dagger operation or they don't want it\nTo be able to get information out to the general public she's trying to keep voting rolls wrapped up quietly\nAnd there is no checks and balances down there\nAnd like I was talking to you about this the other day\nA week almost eight hundred thousand registered voters on the rolls and my God that's too many people in this country that don't vote for maybe fifty sixty years why are they keeping these people on the rolls what's their motive\nAnd ah if I become secretary of State John that you know I Believe in Ronald Reagan's approach trust in verify and um I watched that if I become the secretary's day right now I feel very confident and they can't pay a lot of grassroots we're on Facebook\nOr on a Twitter we at ...\nUh well yeah we're really focused on the Trump Democrat in the understand we ate it they seem to really focused\nUh regarding these major issues on the election was and um you know we're here to protect Rhode Island is to make sure you can set up the elections off pristine and honorable and that's my job and I I I reach out to your listeners have faith in the ... the hopefully we can clean up that office poison more will\nNot let me ask you this um you know be used to be the story that was in the Providence Journal and I would give the reporter a credit but again I Can't see the story because of the table um but ah what's the harm in removing dates of birth from the voter database\nYou can't have ... or the or the valley the city a voter um that's that's the checks and balances system minutes and technically a ... just public public record and it's in in common court Rhode Island and other states now that's something that we can feel that the new secretary of the of the voting rolls\nAnd people have confidence in your system ... well that if the nation\nWell how do you want to clarify what validate what voters are you just can't think of a a non existent that's that's the questioning and block what up a lot of great things on is what I think um he hid under I found that by the way\nYeah I mean I I Know that um you know having run political campaigns that frequently I Would download and you used to be I don't know if you still can be ... back then you would get a disc or of all of the voters in your particular district and then you could short\nThe data based on the age field or because you know that some issues are going to be more important to older voters and younger voters I'm In your evil you were able to short based on that I'm against that that ability will be gone if if we lose all of the date of birth information\nThat's correct you know it's basically um you know voter her position they were voted privacy but I I Believe it's more voter integrity voter integrity pro border um\nWell what do I mean what are you talking about voter primacy you still got the person's name right the legal name their address the city that they live in in many cases the phone number so uh what are we what are we protecting with the data birds we just want to shield them from German told commercials\nI haven't I haven't like heard perception of of where she's going with it but it's a it's a combination of many other issues that she she she's a enforced or a change or white or with the board of elections slash secretary of state's office Johnny goes back to the definition of emergency Ballard\nThat illegal but you know what I think it's the one filed a an injunction against that that's an issue what she's doing now to many of those basically early voting for like eight and I think I think it will get probably between ten and twelve thousand American boats ballot this year\nYeah and I always thought that was you know I mean obviously if you have a valid emergency you got called out to go to Cincinnati for last minute business trip uh and it's going to be over election day I think that's a legitimate need to go out and\nYou know cast your ballot early but and the whole early voting thing disturbs me because you never know what's gonna happen in the final week of a an election cycle and if you've already voted\nOr in something dramatic happens that like for example we have a ... a gubernatorial debate coming up Monday um and so you know what could happen in that debate decreed completely change your mind about who you wanted to vote for a while you've already early voters are sorry\nUm I never understood the early voting thing\nWhile she ... she is the way they operate surely changed the definition of issue from really voting so technically that that's against the for the for like you all that that's in the books\nBut now when I go into early vote right if I go into the gym in town hall and I go up to the to the town clerk and say look I've got to an emergency I've got to vote early and my required to show my photo ID I Would think so right\nAbsolutely not no absolutely not well they do seem signed the ah the ballot\nThat amazing so I don't have to ... you just you would think it would be two seconds for the clerk to let me see your driver's license just absolutely do ... yep yep you're pacman less than ...\nThat's correct that's illegal practically and I think so much challenged in court I already spoke to the phones campaign and the ... campaign you know pay the twelve thousand ... slash\nReally voting votes could make a difference in a close election good and I I my my personal opinion is that one of the major party candidates ... injunction freeze those ballots people on the side and it's all a judge makes a determination if they are valley if that war is not in certain events that\nAre the way she changed the definition of a lot of things speeds things going on down there you're on somebody's got to keep an eye on it that's why I'm ... ...\nWhat uh what other issues in addition to the voter integrity in in election integrity what are the things that would have had quarter lessen his secretary said me\nWhile I Would I Would probably um you know\nGo back into the historical archives um I I Love the military history I'm a firm believer in that is as many as ... in the study on that so\nOf course the archives would be something very special to me to look into that and to make that much to both\nTo the voters in ... in the residents of Rhode Island maybe open the open up the office on Saturday with people who do you know can't do that during the week it can go on a Saturday enjoy the history of Rhode Island read up on it and also there's um the business climate\nA lower those those fees down the week we spoke to who spoke about it before why should you have to pay twenty five thirty dollars just to win the annual report\nActually yesterday and I always forget so I end up doing Seventy or Seventy five I don't think that's correct me if we can wait wait that but it doesn't make any sense\nThere is no report all I Do is verify yes it's been my business and uh yes I'm Still here is still alive that's it exactly there's no you don't get no services for that fifty bucks\nThere's some you know I Believe I think the budget is like seven eight million dollars a year I Believe some of those ones that go out of the country might be some type of humanitarian issues but I was going to be locally not globally ... I Want to focus on Rhode Island is suffering we need help\nAnd you know set up whatever those issues are in the communities have an awesome job very poor outreach programs that have suffered\nThis secretary's day for whatever reason it's focused on your rifle\n... legal ... whatever the case may be they have people chasing a in certain areas in what was his ... and having people standing room explanation for what about the Rhode Island is will be two or three generations who edition franchise\nWell we've got four more years to look forward to just say that I don't think it now at forbids\nYou know it's gonna be four more years certainly but Gina Raimondo next door ...\nI Hope I Hope I Hope it just can't be you know\n... to ... to go for three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WNPR oh\nYeah I mean that's you don't have to be I had a couple of weeks ago I had a a first year political science student I'm On the radio would never even been to Rhode Island doesn't know anybody in Rhode Island uh and she was able to pretty accurately predict the results and I think that's where you're going to see Gina Raimondo I mean six million dollars gets you forty three forty four percent of the vote so that leads fifty eight percent of the vote left the split\nA and you don't have to be you know Albert Schweitzer to figure out what happens if you got some guy that takes you know ten Fifteen Percent of that vote a in off the fifty eight where that leaves the other guy so\nYou know that's that's kind of just the reality you know it's it's a it's an unfortunate situation and I'm In ... I don't know if there's no there's no reasoning with Joan ... there's no talking to ... do you convince\nAnd I don't think he's smart guy he's convinced he's not going to win he knows he's in this race to spoil Alan ... and he said as much or to Kathy Gregory the Providence Journal or when he said I don't care if I only get two percent as long as I get it from my own phone well there you go is there's your answer right there ... broadcast from uh north provolone then I say right to same\nOh thank you [laughter]\n[laughter] I'm On a farm okay because I Do not want I didn't want me for a while now\nAnd and a B gee person right anybody but Gina\n[noise] now that's not true okay it's just I don't know why\nI cannot crap right and I think just like what's the FAA it's\nA waste of oh yeah yeah and it's like Jean\nWhat my appreciation to call ... thank you very much an hour they have out there in North provolone or three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WBFO uh where are we on time a rate is just let him so we need to we got another minute before we need to break out\nOkay let's grab one more phone call let's grab a bomb in a work in a Bob you are on the ...\n... every week I think you owe me draw it away and I really don't want to vote on but I don't want to show fungus on Michael ... she said it just\nIt is that's the way it got to go you know I think Joe out a way that\nI mean it's pretty obvious thank you bye appreciate the call about\nYou're listening to the John ... job will be back with more after this the ground [noise]\n\nW.

Florida to me is out of the ... with all due respect to Florida and you know cause I spent a year in Boca Raton working for a software company so I Know the area pretty well not well not great I mean the east coast\nAnd and to me Florida is it's kind of like it's just too many old people with all due respect to old people you know when you agree\nYeah it's super depressing it is is just a lot a lot of old which again there's nothing wrong with that because like the movie cocoon down there [laughter]\nKnow I heard somebody called God's waiting room [laughter]\nNext exactly and so I ... and when I worked for the space program I spend a lot of time in Houston and when not in Houston but a suburb of Houston where the Johnson Space center is called clearly and and I love that area but like any place else it's got its downsides if you get like rains and floods\nThen you have poisonous snakes and spiders floating around in your living room which is probably not a good thing or they have those fire ants which you'd be stepping on fire and he'll build like consume even ten minutes they're like little Peron a it's a they get killer bees are and I'm already allergic to bees things I Can't even imagine to kill or be probably drop dead from just see it and\nUh but I Do like the weather the weather is hot and speak and humid all the time I mean it's always hot and sticky humid which I Love\nI Love him and you know I tell people I went back in the mission control days um I used to you have to walk from the public affairs building which is building too over to building\nWhich was were mission control was it or they had they were the first of the bicycles yet bicycles all the way you just dumping a bike you ride it to where you're going to leave it the next guy grabs it um and I can remember it was like two o'clock in the morning going to shift at mission control\nAnd it's like Ninety five Ninety six degrees in about like eighty nine percent humidity and I'm just thinking this is great this is the best weather ever I'll take white lumpy rain\nIt's all yours are more through eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WPRI Allen has dial the beautiful broadcast really beautiful city of Cranston as Ellen welcome to the gym also Joe good to have you\nGot your ... I'm going to be a whole week reasonably quick here and I'll take your time I wanted to tell\nYour go mark my doctor for a previous races including where I think it's convenience I guess anybody here where we can do the best with the cost of health care because I think that'll help us All right oh excuse me so for the governor's race ... farm you would be my first choice because\nWhat he's done and crafts and just kept already moving moving moving and that's what we need we need somebody that's got some kind of ... and we got a a district will be termination ... right I can definitely my first choice\nAnd and I will vote for a for a for a pet that would be a guest who had a report or if he's he's found just wonderful I definitely vote for him\nRight I'm sure it'd be happy to hear that\nYeah oh yeah we need we need to write the everybody's got to order right they just waits too many chances to work it was something wrong as to what you don't have an interest in excuse that we should put out a way we eat voter id we need to keep our in our politics and as\nFar as the other four guys that we are not representative there are a obstruction none of them ... ... or ... in the middle class so I Would definitely go for the yard and I hope that everybody else does also we've got his start changing I think the tightest turn\nI think you can talk you out with your secretary of state nominee he he's good he's the owners are a lot of folks out there and I think there are also\nSo we can get everybody out to vote on short order with that and got jobs are asked them one really wants to talk about yes we are terrorist show or through very quickly\nWhen I go to a with the pension part if you could explain that\nYeah apparently there's this guy ... he's a up orange contributor I Believe he's an attorney um and he writes extensively about the pensions and apparently there's the lawsuit making its way I think it's Pennsylvania could be wrong\nOr where they're suing um the state because they took the pension funds and dumped him into hedge funds are which may which have to you have to pay ... high fees war\nOr in the case of the phones the Gina put an edge means don't get didn't get the return\nThat they would have gotten if they just you know stick to the traditional are investing guidelines and put them in the market um and so there's also some question of a quid pro quo in other words or if let's say it was the Alan from Cranston hedge fund\nA and I divert a whole bunch of money from the state pension funds into your hedge fund you get to take a chunk of it to keep yourself because that's you feed 'em and then you turn around and you make a contribution to my campaign or and you get everybody else in your office to make a contribution in my campaign so there's some question of that too and I'm not saying that happened in this case\nAre but certainly some question and then it ... the guy that it's been bringing a lot of that to the surface\nBut and and the question since North Korea had a great is that he does he stay where you can get some of that money back for our parents and your\nWell it depends I mean if it's a if there's a lawsuit and a judgment than you know you gotta figure out where does the money come from um and so I don't know a\n... and the and the and the absolute worst thing you said also that you weren't able to work at the curio a more you get a different governor or every attorney general in there why can't why are so there are are not\nWell because I Believe those hedge fund um arrangements are governed by confidentiality agreements and they do that on purpose to shield them so yeah so they you need a new governor to say you know what we don't care about the confidentiality agreement we are going to go out and disclose other reasons\nWhere there's not a reason to bring the government\nYeah I'm with you lay around thank you for the call or three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WPRI Oh yes I Do those kind of a a bomb thrower a bit but uh but he's a smart guy\nOr anybody makes you know you make some interesting points and I would love to see it play out but you know you're never going to see an investigation on the way the pension funds were handled if you have governor Raimondo you're just not going to have it because you would never open an investigation on herself she wouldn't even investigate Curt shilling for thirty eight studios even after she promised to do it during the election\nSo if you vote for either Joe ... lower Gina Raimondo then you're going to keep all of this stuff are buried and and make sure that the pension he was never really understand what happened um and so that's that's kind of thing and when I say I always lumped Gina and Joe together because the two of them\nAre for all intents and purposes appear to be includes um I think I saw my first comment by George low against Gina Raimondo he probably had to ask permission\nOr to make it the guy every time he opens his mouth blasts sound fun because he's\nYou know he's he's publicly stated he's trying to take votes from Alan ... and that's his goal in life and I said even if it's to present as long as I get them from Allan Fung I'm happy so you know that's that's kinda why I always say that in um together I always say if you're voting for ... or ... or Gina Raimondo\nA either one either want to get you there for three eight nine seven seven six eight hundreds reaching one WPRI that is the toll free number some uh some thoughts on the gubernatorial race you know the other thing too is I suggested I still do that you made this be a good day or the checkout ya Maria we just had a Mike Wells on the broadcast and Mike Wells is the proprietor there\nUm he's got a ... it's a really a hidden gem or in terms of prepared food that you can get to go bring home and then read for the family a and you ought to check him out today because ah today's a perfect day for the rainiest icky\nSwing by their pick up some nice stuff peppers and then like I said during the interview I had like the fat guy's nightmare waiting in line\nAnd right ahead of me this lady decides to buy the last two stuff ... and I I did I had my eye on them or I was all set the order of ... and then they were going you know so\nThat was an old Mel Brooks thing that was used to say that was his worst nightmare as being a pastry shop and there's like nine hundred people that he's got a ticket number nine Ninety nine and he goes through the whole line in by the time it's finally eastern is a giant woman in front of them devise every pastry and a place in leaves\nIt does remind me of that episode of Seinfeld at the braided Brad [laughter] that's all I could pick any like chasing somebody down the street when I\nWas three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WB Allen is now the broadcast from the beautiful city of east Providence where we happen to be right now\nAlan how why I'm good how are you ready and have to do with the ... yes indeed\nYeah and I just wanted to call in combat I Know it's a little off topic like uh I just want to register my absolute discussed with\nAt work and go ... or when I was rolling this election or whatever ... patio personal reasons is of course later in life or basketball because I really think I\nKnow is left there was only ...\nCould take this rate and I think the numbers are bearing that out so you know I I that's the first point I just I mean I Can't believe what was it off at school they did it and I think that what a loss again or you could see where this has added another forty to forty two percent\nVote total for the God what are ... you know it's it's a it's unfortunate that you know jokes goals\nThat we go out I don't think ... out of it uh it doesn't look good does like yeah like\n... or it's just it's really a matter of this stuff and it's so distasteful did they decide but I mean by day and all that long ... what other personal peccadilloes they may have with the more that if they have anti\nI think in the case of Joe Joe is upset it down for reasons that aren't abundantly clear ah I don't understand pat Morgan um I've known her for a long time at a lot of respect for her she was chairman of the republic Rhode Island Republican Party for crying out loud and she can't bring yourself to support the republic\nOver and a lot of good how are you go when I was stationed in Mississippi\nOh I'm a lawyer air force base where you're at her\nAnd uh they don't they call the\nRaw fish but not pot roast you didn't see people running around with pottery and [laughter] I I mean I go to the north east England in northeast Yankee tie this back right yeah like that's why it's called ... ... exactly\nYou know but it was mainly known or\nAre there are all the pot roast that they put that in the actual pot roast [laughter]\nWhere are you a great a great weekend\n[laughter] it does it is a guy who apparently they weren't home and pot roast that mothers down there in Mississippi yeah but I don't I just like to know how how it is if they get to lay claim to this\nIs every Yankee pot roast that yeah that's the traditional one where you put it in a pan and you throw in some potatoes and some carrots and onions and he turned the heat on and you come back after a couple of days I\nFigured it out but the whole north and south thing they already had Yankee pot roast like we're not going to eat that down here when I was real hot really proficient yeah shells and all my mom actually just texted and said hey ya\n[laughter] I Wonder if that you could probably take the whole crawfish and we're right in the crock pot I did tiny crash it's like a miniature lobster yeah southern mobster [laughter] it was thrown all in their own right after I get with\nThe with the meat and they'll eat the meat though that's a problem well yeah yeah like knock 'em out friday got a stunned them somehow in his foot one thing I think we're the only ones that have that cruel thing we do the broiled live lobster oh that's a ... as terrible for the lobster yeah\nYeah I always used at the theory of the the frog and the ... because that way they get used to it a little black and before they realized hey it's getting hot in here to lay somebody turned down the hot kept that have gone\nBut other people say you're not supposed to do that because the I'm ... I'm not a lobster expert but they say that when the lobsters get like scared they release adrenaline into the lobster meat and it changes the characteristics of the lobster meat ... so they say is supposed to just drop 'em right in the boiling water all at once and bingo bingo\nAnd they scream that's weird way I don't know that that's true I I think so it's not airs gaping they shall not feel bad for eating them for that [laughter] but you know a lot roast the cameras and how's the number of people where I come from South there unless you know\nOr three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one do we get off on this uh this day I Know your hosts a moron easy or three\nIn the uh we'll be back with more after this to try and keep it somewhat on topic is so we're not talking about Mississippi law I don't know I don't know they tell me that's important\n\nFrom the sea skates Christmas Day cold weather center here's your exclusive you weather forecast\nRain tapering off not before it's heading a time when justice forty to fifty miles per hour down trees and power lines five fifty for rain to bring to a shower late tonight and breezy the clouds tomorrow with other you appear owes exclusive accuweather I'm Kerry sweating hammer\nAccuweather on the voice of some of the New England loose talk six thirty seven F.
