I don't hear as being figurative listen to this is the broader it's brought a part of the of the of the commentary want to talk to you about it\nThey have to use the powers that may have gotten some\nPoor form the wrong things they want to keep themselves in that they want to cater to the special interests you just time for us as Democrats to be as tough as they are to be an dedicated as they are being committed as they are Michele always says it's all over the ...\nAnd my wife like really high winds slowly ...\nI was always says you know when they go low we [laughter]\nThey go low we [noise]\nWas just give it credit for and he was proud of Democrats will know fight the ideals of the Democratic party with outta my history was out of our president of the future that we can create for this country and we're not even just to make a state we in this way yeah\nAll right so that's that's that's kinda the sitting there in front of some volunteers and then you hear the people out there and fight fight fight fight now did the people they are mean literally fight like physically fight people\nUm are they probably depends on who you're talking to\nSee I I I made a an offhand comment the other day about uh about Hillary Clinton about this and that you have guys like Eric\nHolder who never by the way feel the ramification of his words right he's probably surrounded by bodyguards and all kinds of security apparatus much like Michelle in Iraq and I and Donald in Milan ya and a bill and Hillary you know they're all surrounded in the ivory tower and so they can afford to\n\nThrow their their words around irresponsibly in say outlandish things like that that ... things up um but at the same time the people who would deal with the fallout should there ever be a turn towards a violent outrage of some kind or some kind of public display or whatever\nWould be people like you and me and this is like a a\nA game of Thrones type of thing where where or I as I refer to it the other day like mall for versus Godzilla\nAnd where the people getting stepped on and our buildings are being crushed and knocked over\nAnd I've said this to be for many times of people out there who almost seemed to be begging foreign hoping for some sort of a violent outbreak or some kind of a civil ... violent war or some kind of like there's some kind of separation or or extra system of all this this ackroyd um then we have for people who disagree with us\nAnd I don't think anybody's thinking this through\n\nUm you know the sense of duty that you would hope that American patriots would have\nPeople who are in positions you might have different ideologies and different points of view still would think you know there's there's a general sense that of things that you had can and can't say or do not do a in order to keep the republic together\nUm even if that means I have to sacrifice my ability to move myself from my party forward we don't have American loyalty in this country anymore we have party loyalty\nIn India logical loyalty and when you hard when you are the result when you have gone through a couple of decades worth of de construction of institutions and values and norms that holds people together this kind of talk becomes more and more\nUm effective to divide and conquer no I'm asking you to look into the crystal ball where does this go\nWhere does this go I was I I whenever I get into situations like this and start to think about these situations I Would say to people when I was ... when they're listening to the show that sometimes I think in movie quotes I always think of what's his face as a test CEO\nFrom the godfather when he's talking to Michael is a test CEO or is it the other guy who's sitting down in the um [noise] out he's his name I can never I never remember whether it's tests the or the other guy who was which one is which\nIn the godfather is able to go to ... and what's the other guy's name can never remember that I don't know why some like it just one thing I can never grass was so what's the other guy's name the little pudgy guy says leave the guns take the kind of always\nBut anyway\nSo that guy's downstairs in the base with Michael showing them how to use the gun it's untraceable you know the one's going to be put behind the or the toilet and I need to watch the godfather again I Love when it comes on ... thank you you downstairs in the basement with Cal amends\nAnd Clemens is showing them how to do this goes hey you know you're going to be All right you're going to take a little vacation the rest of us going to take the health for it you know this is going to happen every five ten years Fifteen Years how good the bad blood out\n\nHe's talking about a war between the families of the guy holding on to do this is my second third one it's going to happen every Fifteen Years ten years and I'm thinking about this ... this is is that we've got going on here that needs\nTo be some kind of a political blood letting in order for everybody to kind of calmed down and remember 'cause we are suffering from many different things but one thing is we're suffering one of the things we're suffering from in this country is a lack of political context um excuse me historical context for our politics\nThe historical context is extremely important I was watching the video this morning with a a you know public commentator and philosopher Camille ... who's a professor she's brilliant uh although I'm sure we don't disagree on that we don't agree on everything but she's a she's a brilliant thinker and she's talking about\nCan textual a judgment for society's in the ... in in terms of history and how brutal history has been and how you know especially in antiquity and tyrannical and and ... and the suffering that's going on in human history and how good we have\nIt today\nHow good we have it how amazing we all have it even when she was listening\nTo the other day or the statistic there we're talking about um African at the African American I'm a population that America is like the Eighteenth wealthiest nation in the world if you looked at it as a nation the Eighteenth wealthiest people group of people in the world\nUm you know so and the reason why you bring that up is because you have a political context which which are in this in America I think that those people are suffering or an immeasurably with the fact of the matter is compared to the rest of the of the world\nYou know not doing so bad now obviously compared to the rest of the country you might start to think about other things so there's everything is ... and when you have no contact other than what's happening now\nVersus what happened maybe ten Fifteen Twenty years ago or or what should be based on that then you you start to see things that are very distorted way\nBut overall when you look at American society it bans greatly towards justice greatly towards the ability for people to go off into into a reef the fruits of their labor [noise]\nUm the justice system works great a grass majority of the time most police officers are not beating people and killing people\nUpward mobility for those out there

people\nLike that um you know ... this is ... we had a lot of conversations about civil war here whatever that looks like what that means you don't have to have an all out war to have a lot of a lot of civil unrest and uh you know the disruption of that folks that life\nThat we could would cause an everyday Americans life is not something you want to play with and I I don't understand what people are doing here I don't get tons of his car time you're WPRI ...\nThank you but\nI just want to make a distinction we've got to get ...\nWe have a long history you know it'd be it in this country ... started with the Tea Party for\nSo I think it's important obviously this needs to try to talk about is it all concept to go back a long way mhm but you have to look at the difference in terms of\nWhat people are identified as civil disobedience as a civil war mhm well never been to war we saw why we're never going back there again I Hope not but I think that when you have a ... ...\n... ... or if they look what would you add some really wants to pursue you get a book that's about ... ... all of it\nRequires us to go and that's what it's all about but that's not quite\nWhat Matt waters about

happened in Charlottesville somebody went crazy and and and I drove a car it to somebody killing them because they were not see 'em\nAnd Maxine Waters did was set those circumstances up with her words or try to advocating for those circumstances almost like the ... foot powder keg all around and see what happens I had to run for the news will come back we'll do want to continue this we're also

life your friends don't get together around the campfire or wherever you are doing on the weekends Evan ... dinner parties and sit there and break off into it gender groups in ... in plot ways to get over on each other it doesn't exist\nIt doesn't exist is probably one of the biggest power grab forces that it's ever been perpetuated on the population\nAnd it just doesn't exist not on mass anyway I'm sure there's some demented people out there to think that way trying to live that way but most of the time men and women have relationships of cooperation again\nThat's the vast majority of them\nAnd men and women have been cooperating in relationships for centuries\nBased on whatever it is that they bring to the table centuries and\nUltimately if you don't think that and you don't see that history and you think if you look at this this demented power struggle thing then you know you have you ... you want to see it you can find this power struggle thing wherever you want to find it if that's the way you want to look at the world\nIf you're somebody that wants to be able to have systems in place institutions in place that create more and more importantly the political or economics or security\nSocial social or stability on the Social Security 'cause of the different things social stability social um normalcy\nFoundational institutions that make it ... that we have ...

thought and diversity of ideas as helpful but is is obviously helpful so is by the way a certain degree of ... or ... depending on how you want to pronounce it a certain degree of this is what we all believe in\nThat was the greatness of America right was the melting pot many different people's came together and they all kinda conformed around this one idea the sanctity of the individual individual rights the ability to go off into earn to have a ... and it's this is the idea of whether or not it actually got achieved is a different thing but the idea was\nThat basically we had on his dealings with each other\nWe talk to each other we offer up services for goods good for services we offer each other cooperation we all for each other a I'm\nA societal and I mean this into personally not a not governmental societal safety net we go we see each other in our institutions of of of religious\nWorship wherever they might be we create communities in neighborhoods where watch out for each other's kids there's expectations of behavior and there's also those expectations of behavior were hard fought\nDecades and centuries worth of death and destruction\n\nWe figured things out this is the proper way you should be looking at life or you should be acting in life so that we can all get along here\nSomewhere along the lines somebody convinced somewhere somebody somewhere a lotta times has happened in the universities back in the day that the that those systems were all perverted power struggles and that was all about keeping people down all the time and so systemically one by one they've decided to pick them off\nTo throw the baby out with the bath water where they were deficient they decided you know what the whole thing it's like you oh look at my roof is broken I instead of putting a new roof on the house let's burn\nThe house down so we can start over again and that's the end it seems to be that's the attitude of the hardcore left in this country right now and I mean extreme is left which tend to be which in this country right now as a result of the Trump election has become I think more and more prevalent\n\nThat America and enough itself is made up of these systems and these institutions that have completely corrupted themselves from the inside out and rather than you know try to fix them or recognize an advocate for the good parts of them and cut the bad parts out they want to burn it all down\nYou can do that and you can advocate for that you better ... ... if you're gonna do that you better have a system that you know is going to work\n\nYou better have a system that you know is going to work because I don't know if you want to be responsible for the fallout that happens afterwards\nAnd so all these people walking around talking about kicking people talking about confronting people in their faces and all this other nonsense if you want to do that that's great because once you start down that dark\nPast for ever will determine if you're just distribute we're forever it will do that and that's it goes to a dog spot and\nYou know you want to talk about disruption you want to talk about the bill I mean this is a group that we're talking about a group of people who have their iPhone doesn't work properly and they don't have\nA free why fi lose their minds you have any idea go do some reading about the history of what Abigail

kids about it you want to talk about these these these these coddled mush brains have no idea what they're asking for\nBut they they have been romance by\nAny a logical I'm a idiot logical\nExtremists they've been romance to think that this is like some kind of a beautiful thing that\nThis is going to be a fight that's going to be glorious and we'll win and guys like Eric Holder or Hillary Clinton who no matter what happens in this country are going to be okay\n\nYou know what there's no amount of white privilege that's going to help that's going to help you win ... that that that's going to take anything from\nEric Holder when when the blank hits the fan around here so when they start talking like that they come from a very safe space something tells me he's going to be okay if there's ever some kind of a violent uprising in the middle of the street\n\nSo when people start to talk like this and they flip Italy talk about civil war civil civil book violence in the streets you have no idea if you had any idea what it was like if any if you lived anywhere with this kind of thing happen if you had any concept of what this was like\nAny sense of history\nOriented experience or even had the ... the ability to put yourself in that place you would not be advocating for you'd be doing everything you could to run from it\n\nWhich is why spend whenever this comes up I spent time talking about it because I'm going to do my damned is to make people think twice before they such viewing this nonsense\n\nBecause I don't know about you I got kids in my family that I Want to leave a better country than they've then I then I found it\nAnd we better start you know uniting ourselves around what better means and figuring out some kind of commonality of the definition of better before we all start burning everything down to the ground because why not some people just want to watch the world burn\n\nUnbelievable to me so you know Eric Holder now and then and all these people just they've got to come out now so I talk about kicking people or we'll see watch what happens because what it's called escalation folks when one person to start something and the other person goes a little more than a little more extreme the other person cross that line much have vigil line staffers\nAnd then when they when the wind gets crossed and you're the you're either in the crowd or you're the direct object of it\nOr you remember what it is that you did read gulag archipelago and watch the Alexander soldier nuts and talks about what he went back to his life and figures out and tried to figure out what some of them about the process to start reading it myself but when I understand he talks about the idea of what he did to allow for the for the gulag Serbia to appear in Russia\nAnd what he allowed and what he lets the decisions he made in his life you know\nStart thinking about the things that we're all contributing to to allow for this kind of nonsense that happened because I'm

the national attention\nAway from what we've SARS meteorologist developing into the Gulf of Mexico\nAh we knew this thing was going to have to pass over what is known as the loop current which in the Gulf of Mexico is an extremely warm current of water that provides a lot of fuel mhm uh if there was anything that was under forecast it was that this thing was going to be near category five intensity landfall\nA early in the week um Monday Sunday Monday or we begin to see the hurricane center forecast the intensity to about a category three\nUm and I think after Florence is experience I think people had an expectation\nOf what that damage might look like ... uh but it continue to rapidly intensify it went through a couple of cycles of\nYou know remarkable drops in central pressure or to the point where it looks like Andrew if you ask me well the wind damage looks like the scope that we had an Andrew and uh as we get more drones up there and you begin to see more aerial footage or you're going to walk parts of the coastline looked like Mexico beach\nWhat's interesting to me about this is that when I heard that uh the meteorologist from ABC talk about ... years popping\nNot
