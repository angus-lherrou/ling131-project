department to talk about that and find out what people think should be done about it that's coming up\nWow any anything coming out of work\nNow to the mayor today yes it it wasn't aware of the issue until earlier today which I highly doubt but anyway he said he he's in the middle of doing a debate today so he's going to join me probably tomorrow about that we'll see yeah ah we talked to the Senate the Senate hill to us city council president yesterday a steam roller he was didn't know what you just heard about it\nUm there's some stuff going on their ... and I called to see if he'll come

it was that low is twenty nine years ago and it Nineteen eighty nine and I was five years\nAnd but you can't sell it politically you find 'em hidden ways to give the money now if it's in the contracting you do it and everybody looks at it recognizes it for what it is and approves it ... to the taxpayer it might be something that is not necessarily the greatest thing in the world but it's not illegal\nYou know it's one of those things and you got to vote accordingly right\nWell\nHere's one of the interesting things for me in this case the reason why I thought this is interesting is that there should never be anything close to\nA side deal for anything\nThe deal that you're making with the collective bargaining unit of any kind should be this is what we're offering this is what you've agreed to this is what's presented to the council for ratification they ratified we all signed it and here we go\nTo say for the firefighter unions that we had a side deal with the former executive executive the city of Warwick says that basically the former mayor ... did something that's completely illegal\nAnd those those monies that were obtained were done so we legally now I don't know what the legal ramifications other of our of that because it depends on the legal arguments that are made but at the end of the day that's not supposed to happen\nThat shady\nScott every decision depending on how this whole thing with may have a problem here I don't know law enforcement may have a problem there doing an audit right now we had a the council president or the moral on yesterday and he said I have no problem that if I get this audit and there's evidence that shows that somebody did something intentionally\nAnd was doing it to ah to be to be dishonest they're both send it to the proper law enforcement agencies now if that if is very very very important because what will a an audit from a bunch of accountants tell you they'll tell you what the exes ... those are and what the you know what the money is where it was how it was spent and all that stuff\nThey will not if I Can't imagine maybe it will I don't know but I Can't imagine it's going to go out there to show you what the intent was\nAnd if a bunch of people\nIn that in that city start talking about how this is a an accidental situation where it was a mistake I mean that's going to be a that's going to just can be held to pay for that because that's\nA yeah anyway\nYou know to stop by mistake we'll see we'll see what the results are\nBut some talking esteem are all about this yesterday the reason why I'm

because I think it's interesting that the twelve million dollars you just mentioned about ah when it comes to the expense of that is that going to be something that you that that will delight will pay for is that is that state cost\nI Believe that they cost because what it was was a few minutes straight ahead elected summer of ... to that big contract for the snap program um and you know we're getting close out uh August thirtieth a letter that we found out the state's website ironically yeah\nAh and they were chastised for many a contract amendment so late or you know USDA's world view and

quote on it starts going and then you say well we need to do this and then it get these change orders and as things develop an evolving problems pop up more and more things and more and more money gets spent I mean I I and I believe most of this is federal money but some of its state money right away to bring\nThat's correct 'cause I remember that the winds are going to be our obligation\nAnd this is where it's so tricky and deceptive what the government keeps saying oh it's not going to cost us like Beloit picking a nose the voice only taken up some of the cause she's not being honest

you and that's why it's so foreign to call her out on this because ah it wasn't anything that we're holding back and uh one of the things that we just found you know we called her out because you have has been an issue that you've heard me\nOn numerous occasions because my family was caught up in that process for long term care benefits as well uh so I Know what people are going through this has to be fixed it has to be a priority because you know whether it's state or federal dollars it's costing all of us very\nWell let me ask you this question a whistle blower so they come into the hedge around he was last Saturday they came to the headquarters\nYeah did you did you talk to them personally or\nNot me I had a number of individuals 'cause there'll be perfectly honest uh now we get a lot of\nUh people coming in with a lot of stories about a lot of different departments spell out a team of individuals a neat\nWay to go see the ... ... so ...\nSo they did to them it was seemed credible these are people who worked at the department or or used to work there I Do now\nOne one used to work there they were what happened was this was remember when it was really going to ... ... and had to get more people through one used to work there are and one still work yeah\nSo what they had was this team of individuals from deal lack department of administration mhm going in there on a temporary based right\nSo some think he kind of came of cost and then when all of a sudden\nA ... they get these emails not for their work email address\nBut to the personal email address and that's one of the document that we show we had to wait out the first name because she's still afraid I'm you know and the off the inspector general they relate back to us pulled them\nI don't speak to the fries we need time to interview you see what you have that so we agreed to just like white outer name or that way you know her confidentiality until he gets off but it's clear show to Gmail address right and that was where the first time in\nI was supposed to be\nAnd then from there once you get there um\nYou know they end up start performing this data entry and they would come upon by cases where someone didn't have a Social Security number mhm and\nThe staff has told them hey just click through it and it auto populated like a Social Security number up there and\nI can remember the stories or something close to this be happening where they were just trying to get these people their benefits and just in a band incomplete information and was just going in and doing I'm\nInterested in just putting something in there to get the value to to have something initial ... get the system do through so your criticism of that is not so much that it wasn't getting people weren't getting what we did just that you don't know if these people were eligible rail even if they were related real Social Security numbers\nExactly in that part of the you know uh when we heard about what's happened it was ... populated and the way they were describing it to the team was it wasn't just like this random number one two three four five six seven eight nine or or just zero want you know that way you can keep track of it\nThe way it was described them as it seems like it was a real Social Security number so they can\nJust get through it and if that's the case is this individual hopefully getting the benefit of the eligible or you know why don't they have Social Security numbers\nYeah that's weird thing Rachel ... what was the concern of the people when they when the people you talk to the ... campaign headquarters and they told the story what was their concern with that that that there was fraud do do do you do that could have been perpetrated\nYeah exactly and that's one of the things that you know when they kept hearing about what the governor kept saying all things are going better the snap programs getting that you know all the stuff they you know from based upon their experience\nThey were very nervous to come forward you know back and you know that's why you know we hold them well\nThis sounds bad let the proper authorities do it and that's from my you know it's funny generals background ... I'd rather have the right people working at this\nUltimately it's part of why I called the press conference or because it's not just that issue but everything was going to ride there is you know despite what the governor is talking about saying things that are improving it's not true\nIt's costing us more money\nThan ever ratios that are happening or even you know the chase after so many dollars on the state side\nYou know there are a lot of issues that are still going on and the governor is being so disingenuous as we've seen a consistent pattern and more people are still getting hurt and not in the school facts about what's going on at a ... you were up system\nWe're talking to Alan fun are starting to get a press conference earlier today we're with regards to the you have situations so when you get in their ... gone I mean even if the let's see if he gets his system up and running a fix it uh and by the time you get if you get elected by the time you get in there and it's basically running okay um I mean do you keep the system what do you do\nA ... definitely is going to be on\nA I think what I called for and it's going to be needed is the oh I see to come in and do a full author of the snap program or any of these uh whether it makes it termination while the what's the white was doing was even you know it's totally appropriate or inappropriate to kind of get through this type of uh\nUh it can't be any more sugar coated it's the bottom line and the other thing that we're going to do is make sure that if we are going to scrap the system\nI don't want to but if they can't operate the way it was originally intended why are we are continuing to dig in court as well or sports a billion dollars that so I'd rather they even go\nBack to pen and pencil or pen and paper pencil safer or get the appropriate fun like how people can get food we've already seen it on nursing home they'll wander\nWe split home care services go on to you know a lot of the um employers are still struggling to get bullied and now you've got you know it's just people saying oh we want that money back that was only supposed to be alone and not five months and they're like what are you talking about well\nI guess the response from the spokesman for for the governor is basically saying that this is your your your your press conference today as a political stunt according to him\nThese accusations are nothing without offering evidence that uh we don't even know if you know basically basically saying that these whistle blowers ... may or may not even exist were you ever see with with those people ever be coming forward ever\nAfter the oh I speak with them because what I can tell you this man the evidence that existed is their own letter of ... million dollar increase that we've found out in the state website you know\nUh so that is most definitely a rail and post ah we also expanded a outs at a press a copyright and you know\nAlthough we read jak if the person's um NO NAME on the personal email it showed her personal email with their assignment to where it goes towards\nOur well that's the other question that I had about that 'cause it's interesting I mean was that was that done and I'm trying to trying to figure it out and think of as a reasonable explanation for it so to play devil's advocate here is if they don't need an advocate but anyway the um\nIs that something we're because they're doing outside work of their of their original state job but they get those emails to their personal emails ... how did that happen did they explain who were they concerned about that too\nYeah it it was very uh concerning to them why they sent me a swap personally about you know why they ask us for that\nBecause it's just kind of waste the whole thing raised a red flag to uh these two individuals and you know like I said that one of them still working or they are so I'm obviously they're concerned about their job but they're whistle blowers\nIn

right I have no idea what you do about it no idea you're going to have a cop now stationed supposedly according to mayor twenty four seven uh outside this guy's house in Providence everybody knows where he lives\nAnd so there's going to be people on edge and God Forbid somebody does if somebody does something stupid\nUm you know and I say stupid\nOr not I mean that an irrational way or a bad way I mean something stupid for their future prospects um\nYou know then you're gonna you're gonna have a situation here we are going to have people who are or just protecting themselves and they brought in their children end up getting prosecuted this how many of you have somebody living in your neighborhood like this this is amazing to me\nThe ... the the the lack of severity in seriousness with which we take these types of crimes or through our statutes\nAmazing this guy originally we looked at this the situation we early did he get like seven years a couple of times on multiple occasions heinous heinous heinous crime I mean this is ... pretty much done the same thing\nOver and over again five years were to you too you know you just unbelievable horrific things and you don't want in Massachusetts is according to the to the story from the from the Patriot ledger Massachusetts he was sentenced in Nineteen eighty nine to two ten to Fifteen year terms the attack on Iraq one boy\nIn Ninety One he was sentenced to seven and a half to two two ten year terms for driving in Rhode Island boy over state lines to nor well these two sentence will be conserved can currently\nBut only after the Rhode Island citizens have been served so\nMultiple states multiple multiple offenses multiple states\nIt's almost like he did something in Rhode Island and went to mass and like he knew enough to go back and forth it's just a horrific\nIn Nineteen Ninety three of the garden for other people to hundred Ninety year Rhode Island sentence which shouldn't have fifty years with Thirty years to be served\nUnbelievable\nAnd so now the question you know what I'm sitting there and I'm thinking myself I was looking at the story\nI think this kind of gets out of jail and it puts a whole neighborhood in prison who neighborhoods in prison really because you can't know granted there may be people\nUm that listen sexual predators are everywhere right they're all over the place in all walks of life I should I or shouldn't be over dramatic than not everywhere but there you don't know who they are most of the time\nAnd most of the time it's a family member or somebody close to somebody that's usually what happens ah statistically in this case this isn't the guy who who builds a relationship pleasing guard your kid and say listen adults I mean I have this conversation with my kid every couple of weeks\nReminding him he's in control of his body anybody ever says anything I mean that it didn't seem that I Do\nNot insane I I Do it so that he knows he's in he's in charge of his body nobody else about him\nAnd that nobody has to be touching them anywhere anyhow because these people weasel their way to kids' lives so it's hard enough to guard against that\nNever mind somebody who will literally break into your home and take your child what can you do against that\nMiddle of the night you know Elizabeth Smart type style type thing to screen door through whatever you're gonna live the people in this neighborhood to live with that harm the fact that they went to a meeting and then it meant picketed this house to me is I'm shocked at the at the restraint\nThey deserve credit for that restraint\nBut legally I mean how many have you had\nThe situation I've had the situation I found out a couple of years ago my old neighborhood I Lived in we had a guy and it was because the neighbor told me it was like somebody punched me in the gut that a guy to houses down was on the registry I looked it up sure enough there he was it was an old charge from years ago down south\nOr a sexual assault of somebody at the age of fourteen and this guy used to walk by my house all the time I called the cops I said what do I need to know about this guy\nAnd he said nothing the police officer said nothing new police officer was very zipped up\nAnd he said nothing and I just got to let you know that you know just just do what you would normally do used on everything you supposed to do within the law he's registered ... their nose or I should tell me he goes no you can't tell you think about the case because well you'd have to go petition the court for that that's the other state\nWill you can't tell me anything would with this with the story was what happened\nNope can't tell you the thing on the only thing I have to tell you though is that if you said anything to him or if you can find him in any way to do this you can be charged with a hate crime\nOkay\nWhy don't we just set ... loose in the neighborhoods why don't we just go ahead and take wild animals and let them free in people's backyards and then put pictures of the animals up all over the telephone poles and send people mail and say look out for this this thing it's in your neighborhood I\nMean it's so patently stupid I don't even know what to tell you\nAnd so you know you're gonna have a neighbor who's going to be completely on edge\nAnd then you can have a bunch of children are going be completely on the edge because I Can't imagine that the parents are going through your audio inform your kid at this thing what do you do about this and I mean quite frankly I'm\nWithin there's the the the legal constraints that we have an illegal or whatever is we have here it seems to me the only thing you can do is to literally have a police escort there the whole time every day\nTwenty four seven um what else can you do [laughter]\nYou know you're going to have tickets outside this guy in the house now matter of fact I think that um there was one of the things was promising the Providence Journal article one of the act ... every day\nAnd we did I see and I believe that that you're a woman yes Lisa Scorpio is a community activists that's going to be organizing this stuff is going to be on with Dan York this afternoon five o'clock to talk about what the plant makes you tune in for that\nBut this is going to take a lot of restraint in a lot of a lot of control and the other part of the public because you know what are you going to do it I Would love to know what we can do what laws can\nBe changed to make this to to make this kind of thing never
