they're seeing fire trucks in Warwick from other town\n... floors maybe that's what I'm hearing about that coming up as well what's going on with the fire trucks are more what's wrong with them [noise] saw after they want us there was no matter ...\nSomebody a NFL ways you're from New England solutions to the oh this is a station you count on for news traffic whether it's half point hand

Turkey's state run news agency says prosecutors are questioning a number of employees of the Saudi constantly ... all over the disappearance of Saudi journalist your mouth to show Jake a private TV channels there's as many as Fifteen employees were being question today\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo is denying a report from ABC News the Turkish officials shared with him an audio recording in a transcript of the alleged murder of cush raunchy Hervey\nYeah the the the front a front\nDoor bell is wrong we opened it up it was the awe inspiring specter was a very nice gentleman a walked in and said that the department have received and anonymous complaint something to do about safety lightning or something like that and that they needed to inspect the premise is when I was like okay\nSo you know we walked through and didn't really find anything a\nLawyer in the back of my office so there's a rear an emergency exit door he said he needed to look at the light on the back of the building and when we open the door and looked up lo and behold that light\nA was the the little plastic arm that holds the light out from the law was broken and it was just sort of hang in there a mine was the only one in the whole building that was like that [laughter] so anyway they just sort of said oh that's going to have to be fixed and it was like okay and and he basically left but\nSo so that's a situation where do you think somebody did you think that because yours is the only one that was like that that somebody came over and vandalized the the the building\nI don't know it would be pure conjecture on my part I I Know that they could have been broken like that for ten years for a while and I didn't even know that was back there ah on the other hand it could have you know because all the lights were fine\nIt was like no tree branches or anything anywhere near you know I mean it's weird that mine would be broken and no one else has was but you know the the bottom line is all that stuff's noise the important thing is this visit literally occurred\nHours after I submitted an open records request for every side deals that any that to the city or made with any union over the last decade mhm so it's that timing of that visit\nThat's a problem for me and it should be a problem for everybody because it's not the job of first responders to be harassing and intimidating the\nTaxpayers to pay their salaries [noise]\nYeah I think weaponized recognizing fire inspection is about is as low as it gets I mean you cannot do that you can't have it in the city you can now you want to talk about you want to have a I see things like this is why I Wonder why there's not an automatic business association revolt\nAgainst against the city government I mean the business owners in that city should come together as a result this kind of garbage and inundate city hall with with with with righteous anger because their next\nYeah there was there's no doubt and and I've heard from some of them who insist on anonymity who say yeah I'd been leaned on like that so you know there's there's a ... there there's there was a challenge for a lot of business owners that I don't have because you\nKnow I can call you up and I can out the situation like I did write a I can get a hold of other journalists to print the story 'cause it's a story 'cause it happened to me mhm whereas somebody who doesn't have the same visibility\nDoesn't necessarily have the ability to get the story out and for them it's easier to keep their neck tucked tucked in right then too you know stir things up yeah but you know what\n[laughter] I got to be careful to not start swearing here that's absolutely utterly wrong yeah right the business owners shouldn't be living in fear of any\nPublic servant first responder elected appointed whatever who white\nCake out on them some kind of retribution for something that they did or didn't do right right and I hear it all the time from\nDifferent people all over the years got vocal about something or other and then all of a sudden you know they ended up with a surprise inspection air attacks or their whatever right um that's not the kind that's not what government is supposed to do you know and that's not what public servants are suppose that's not the service that tax\n... and I go to ... I've been I've been shocked at seeing some of the reaction on Facebook you know it's like oh well if you get to the he'd get out of the kitchen if your kid\nBy the way that comment came from a firefighter\nOh really I didn't I didn't see who it was yeah ... ... yeah yeah I mean\n... yeah it's amazing it's it's it's the dichotomy is incredible you have people who put themselves at risk running into a burning building to grab to see people were some of the most simplest human beings planted but then when it comes to this issue these kinds of issues the trend\nIt's bizarre to me yeah and I don't know what it is\nIt's a ... it's it's a shame\nIt's also shameful at the same time yeah I mean look I the last thing in the world I Want to be talking about right now is that is this kind of stuff\nRight what does it so we have you heard from the city anybody what's going on with this\nYeah actually I was I was very pleasantly surprised that this morning a there was another knock on my door and everybody was like oh God you know [laughter] who's here from the fire department now a but it was actually mayor Solomon himself\nWho ah came on announced knocked on the door and wanted to walk through the the building with me and recreate my interactions with the fire inspector which we did\nA he expressed his personal outreach to me mhm on what had happened uh and he assured me that they are actively investigating it well and if there is evidence of wrongdoing he uh he indicated in some a pretty interesting graphical terms\nThat you know there there was someone to have their head chopped off basically so\nYou know so I I see that as a as a as a good sign because you know I was hoping that someone from the city we get to me because you know I'd say some pretty big taxes here even though I don't own this building I I still pay my share of the property taxes for the building and uh nobody\nRight and and look if if the guy's next door were being lean on instead to me\nThe story would never have come out right right right uh ... and their song and made a point of saying look you know I'm not here just because it happened to you\nI'm here because it should never have happened and shouldn't happen to anybody\nNow that's a sentiment I was hoping to hear you know and I am hopeful that mare Solomon follows through\nAnd that they investigate this and if this was\nA really ill considered form of of intimidation that they take whatever steps are necessary to eradicate whoever participated in this and if they ensure it never happened again because it is the last time we talked I really didn't want this to be the story you know but you know what\nIt is important to be really don't yeah I mean listen it's important this is not whatever the issues are and I'm sure there are issues that the firefighters have may have with some of the stuff you've talked about in the past with fire fire closings are closing firehouses and whatnot that they can argue with statistics indeed and their point of view and their expertise and that's all fine\nOr when you start school somebody's livelihood for doing what citizens should do\nWhich is to point out in you know inefficiencies or or outright corruption or whatever or or just just wrong full a use of abuse of the law\nUm ... you have no moral or legal right to do anything to that person and and anybody who does is a rotten coward and should be fired yep\nIt'd be blown out tomorrow so\nI don't know what the house the mayor about a good for him good for ... for doing that that is fantastic and ah and I don't know what that what what kind of investigation they're talking about what they can do to get into any of that with you or no\nNo I didn't expect it into ... and uh you know he he didn't he definitely agitated when when he was speaking yeah\nUh he definitely was I'm sure you know\nMen hold on hold on one so your phone I going to hold on one second ...\nLet's see if we should be reconnect

I would think you know the manner\nIf for whatever reason we find out that there was improper payment made these firefighters for for sick time will you seek restitution from them\nWell not it it's tough to say at this time simply because um that would be reaching a conclusion a conclusion that I cannot make at this point we're not having all the facts before me if there's a ... it's\nNot just the numerical number or that there are other factors involved relatives illegality and I wait the findings of the APA trader and and nobody want to paint any finding or or a or a hypothetical actions\nOn a finding a are you going all over again would you support an advocate for these order to be made public\nOh I there there's nothing or listen as far as I'm concerned it\nAll documents should be public accepts something that uh that hip all related to things of that nature Mm that an individual uh is entitled to their privacy for right but uh [noise] you know I I Am all for open government and you know\nI Know there was a question about there being a non disclosure thing with the audit firms where they can't disclose this stuff so I mean\nWell well maybe there's a non disclosure ah ah I don't know what the nondisclosure agreement maybe but uh I Would say that uh that may be between the parties that commissioned the audit but\nI think the party that receives the audit enjoys the benefit of the results of those audits to whoever wants to see them otherwise what's the purpose of an audit\nRight I mean to keep it private nah I thought\nIt would make any sense right what is the right so if what if you find that there is a you know there's there's evidence that this was wrongly given out to firefighters for whatever reason will you then seek for either state police or some law enforcement agency to figure out who made the deal how we're against against city law\nWell you know the thing is this going out for a legal enforcement of such a thing in a criminal nature ah requires intent if there is criminal intent involved\nIf it's a civil nature there's a different way to approach it for restitution and again I Can't make a conclusion on either side of that without seeing all the facts and the results of those facts\nAs they come back rubber that's why I Can't imagine I mean I I I Can't commit to you know we're gonna hang everybody higher I Can't commit to we're going to get all that money back again\nUm you have to look at a uh all factors to recipients the participation or the intent of individuals' there's there's many many\nAs you expect to get the evidence of intense from an audit\nI Know but that would probably uh I I Would think that uh any findings of a um\nArbitration would give you some factual information that if there was any indication of some sort of malicious intent\nOr are you know criminal intent or something of that nature ... that are at that point the responsible parties would turn that over to legal authorities for for a summit late you know as a criminal thing right but you can't\nYou proceed on hypothetical basis what if what you know I might buy a mega million tickets and I went on you know I I don't know what number I'm going to play right but I'd like to win it [noise] yeah\nI just think that you know just knowing where your mindset is going into and what you're predisposed to do is
