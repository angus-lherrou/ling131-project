I mean the ... can you ever see have you ever seen anything like this\nUnbelievable it's really unbelievable that somebody can spend millions of dollars millions of dollars and barely move the needle\n\nGovernor among does like nine million dollars in this whole thing and she's was moved three or four points\nHoly Moses ... can't get to have the more than half the close\nForty five a minority of people in this day Rhode Island want her to stay governor approval what she's doing and she can't it there's no amount of rubbing that can shine that tired\n\nYou know the old adage you can rubbish rubbish you just can't trying to get the administration she can't shy and yet she can't shy and her governorship\nChant shine it up I don't know what it is this something that people don't like it but I was talking about a little bit later on\nThis is the story had an easy channel twelve breaks the story last night that there is a been a an allegation years' old allegation of sexual harassment and the speaker of the house according to a now many others have and they didn't do enough\nTo stop this person who's been ... who's been alleged to have done this from staying off a committee in our leadership position I here's a story we'll talk about next\nTarget twelve recently obtained a march eleventh email from representative Catherine ... to Rhode Island's most powerful lawmaker house speaker Nicholas Matty yellow 'cause airing confirmed the emails authenticity any she shared her concern about how a key committee would handle her legislation writing\nAs we have discussed I have endured years of sexual harassment by House Judiciary chairperson kill cable last year you did not grant my request to have the bills move to a different committee\nBecause Erian added I Do not wish to be put in that position again and she wasn't we found the video on Capitol TV archives when that hearing took place in April chairman keep all was present at the start but within about Fifteen minutes he was gone and write as cars area and sat down to testify representative comparing\nMatty yellow confirms he told ... not to be present when she arrived because they're in declined to discuss people's behavior in detail but told target twelve quote the email speaks for itself and all I wanted was a fair hearing\n... lawyer has so far declined our request for an interview but dismissed the claims as quote unsubstantiated years' old allegations and pointed out ... never filed a complaint with the Rhode Island commission for human rights\nAfter becoming aware of the sexual harassment allegations Monday ... law firm placed on administrative leave until quote these allegations are clarified and within Ninety minutes of our first report Matty yellow removed cable as chairman of the house Judiciary Committee Matty I'll also insists he repeatedly took action in response to ... concerns\nWe did reach out to ... lawyer tonight for reaction to the evenings developments so far we have not heard back for now at the target twelve investigator's eye ... eye witness news\nSo you have the removal of the of a representative cable as\nThe chairman a judiciary right um and from what I understand from\nThe speaker of the house they have since ... since the the the story's been somewhat added to on the online version of the WPRI ... on WPRI dot com where the speaker put out a statement yesterday I'm gonna read that you can hear what he said I'm\nFour years ago I became aware that a that a close personal and professional relationship between represented ... had ended during a non state also event in which I was not present\nBased on what I learned after the fact I asked both of them to separate not interact with one another in two thousand Seventeen representatives Aaron requested a meeting which I accommodated she wanted to discuss her bill assignments in hearings on those bills before the house Judiciary Committee I had my policy director Lynn or Bonnie\nA company representatives there into the hearings and those bills representatives area was satisfied with his arrangement\nAnd twenty Eighteen represented ... a request of the meeting which I get accommodated as in this previous years she wanted to discuss with Bill assignments and hearings on those bills before the house Judiciary Committee I suggested that represent a key will not be president for these hearings representatives hearing expressed repeatedly are enthusiastic satisfaction with this agreement\nThis arrangement excuse me I have not heard anything from representatives airing to indicate that she was unhappy with these accommodations\nIn every session there arises conflicts of many kinds between representatives\nWhen I made aware of issues I pride myself and trying to resolve them expeditiously I find a suspicious that one week before an election reports a surfacing about events which date back many years involving these representatives this is clearly another attempt by the ultra progressive impact as elections like election cycle now\nThat may be the case because if Catherine ... has been I'm satisfied with the arrangement\nAnd has not taken these so called um sexual harassment\nUm allegations that she suffered for years to anyone else\nI mean if you're getting harassed by fellow legislators are really the only thing that can happen in order to ultimately stop it is that you have to come public and you have to arrange for a start or advocate for or start the ball rolling\nFor removal from office which happens I Believe only by the general assembly the house would have to then tell to expel him from the from the house\n\nAnd you know to me that's where my mind goes if somebody's actually literally sexually harassing you\nNow if you have some personal relationship that went south and you don't think you can get a fair hearing because the chairman\nUm you know is is either scorned or mad or hold a grudge or whatever\nThen it seems to me are moving to a guy from the hearing so you can get a fair hearing and do whatever is ah is is all the speaker can do\nNow remember this represented ... so far publicly has not said anything about this hasn't commented publicly that the speaker didn't take advantage or didn't excuse me do it what does she wanted to do it seems to me that the speaker\nDid everything that she asked as far as we know\nAnd so with this story now people saying you know this guy's got to go you've got to have the Republicans want him to get out of the race\nUm you have you know the ... the the the does the fries as the speakers a opponent in his district race to say you know we have another scandal here\nUm what I Want is I Want there to be a situation where and I think you'd probably want this too\nSo what

and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell declined to join the president citing scheduling conflicts well house minority leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer also decided not to attend\nYou know\nYou're hopefully going to be more critical of a political ad than somebody telling you to eat your Wheaties\n... he's like oh yeah once in ...\nOh that's cool oh well that the that might taste good me try that well that's a cool shirt they'll check that out oh it's a new phone that'll feature that's fantastic you don't think much about\nYour your interest is peaked in it\nIn a political ads you have to think about it determine whether or not it's true and whether or not is legit and ask questions and research it and hopefully you do that\nBut\nYou know I always I always wonder how these ads are playing out and spend but it seems to me the Gina Raimondo spent a ton of money on negative ads round fun and he's he's taken a little hit was percentage here but not I mean it seems that they've they haven't really moved all that much the governors come up a little bit depending on what your benchmark is\nBut she's always I mean she when she won last time what was her her race when she won\nUm with about forty eight percent of the vote so she's moved a couple of points but she can't get over fifty percent she may be over fifty percent election\nBut approval rating in the polls and and and you know now who you're going to vote for the polls she stuck it like loaded mid fifties low to mid forties\nThe majority of Rhode islanders don't care for her\nThey never have\nSo you know you're going to have this or you have the set up between you know does does Allen Fung take every vote from Joe furlough if Joe ...\nThe race you know I guess the comment believe would be yes okay so the added up and it's a dead heat\nRises you have thirty four plus nine is what are those forty F is ah is is that it was nice forty three so within the margin of error there\nSo you have kind of like a neck and neck race you have eight percent undecided and so does Alan ... have a chance to take enough votes from Joe furlough\nIf the if the support for Joe ... who is soft is what is what the you know words what or half of his supporters soft is what a Joe Fleming is saying and then you know take all the eight percent of the undecideds which is virtually impossible\nIt looks as though this this if you believe the numbers that you see here that Alan ... has a slim little opportunity to take this home\nSo then what we do is we have again another situation where we have a governor's race or governors like somebody occupying the governor's seat\nAgain for the third election in a row who does not have fifty percent of the vote if everything plays out if this is accurate if this is whether the whole thing which which it probably won't be bitterly clubs\nAnd so I'm sitting here and I'm looking at this and going you know this is ... and it's not like we have a history so far this happening very often and on top of that\nIt's not like the people who have occupied those seats with minority votes have just have acted like governor among who hasn't acted like it don't achieve he didn't act like it they roll in there like they're the uh you know they say they they they have a mandate which they do not\n\nAnd so I mean that that is a you know they'll sit there and listen at the end of the day to the Victor goes the spoils so if you're in the office you're in the office and you when you when they were going to do about it but you know for anybody who wants to walk around and talked about the greatness of Gina Raimondo nobody's buying that\n\nNobody there's the ... or should put it this way the ... majority of the state of Rhode Island is not buying the greatness of Gina Raimondo\nForty five percent of likely voters are buying that they would like to have her over everybody else and that's the best you can say\nThat's it\nAnd so that you know that does not mean we're going to have this great next four years\nBy any stretch of the imagination that's horrendous quite frankly [laughter] it's not good\nIt was not or what they say it was a big Virginia nine million dollars or something like that of ridiculous amount of money for paying these paying for this it's unbelievable\nSo now you're going to buy the elections you can't buy the election is not gonna buy the majority anyway\nShe may buy more votes than everybody else might get enough votes in the anywhere else not what's what's gonna happen is um the people on the other side are going to split the vote to a certain extent\nAnd uh just what people thought was going to happen is gonna end up happening that's where the you know you got to see what's going to happen now you have to you have to think into the you have to think about the um uh the get out the vote efforts you have to think about all this stuff\nBut I'm fascinated by the eight percent eight percent of people are still trying to figure out what it is that with Alan ... having to do basically the impossible but try to get to those eight percent 'em\nAnd sell a double message that if you're undecided I'm your guy and at the same time if you're voting for ... trailer but you're not really sold on him come move me\nThat's a hell of a needle to thread\nBut you gotta know who they are and what they're about and so that's when I ask you if you're undecided right now\n\nIf you're undecided you're the eight percent or you want to the ... percenters what is going on with you now that actually have a number to put to you what's going on with you and if you're one of these people that's malleable\nThat is ready to jump ship all for your chosen candidate because you're just holding on there I don't know I could move\nI could change\nWhat do you what are you looking for what is it what is it about the person that you're actually saying that you're going to vote for but would change your mind what's holding you there\nThat's what's that's what's food or or if you if you think you have a window into the minds of these people what's going on here\n\nNow we have that uh that part of the channel twelve pack of Joe forming talks about the the the ah the the the amount of the cementing of the vote whether who has a cemented voted who doesn't\nHave that Nick you said you had one right where you know\nWho's who's from Indira who's with how who has the the most cemented in support and who's ready to to walk away and uh if if given a proper\nMotivation because I think it's fascinating\nHow many of you are out there still you know saying yeah I'm going to vote for this person but I'm Still open minded I could change my mind\nThose are the people that fascinate me\nOr maybe you understand their mindset so this is my phone numbers for three eight WPRI the toll free number one eight hundred three to wind up your own that can be played up everybody and we'll come back we'll talk about it\nMost voters octave for the governor I don't see a great deal of her support moving away from her the same thing can be selling Allen fun\nI Hope I'm going to play the whole thing I Would put the whole package for everybody because you kind of a gift for Joe Fleming flushes it all out the question and how it was answered listeners\nFour hundred and sixteen likely voters in our exclusive eye witness news Roger Williams university poll give incumbent governor Gina Raimondo and eleven point lead over Republican Allen Fung breaking down Raimondo voters Seventy percent say they are definitely voting for her\nFifteen Percent say it is unlikely they will change their mind but eleven percent said there is a good chance they could change their mind\nMost voters octave for the governor I don't see a great deal of her support moving away from her the same thing can be selling Allen fun\nSong has slightly stronger support from his voters Seventy three percent say they are definitely voting for him sixteen percent say they probably won't change their mind nine percent say there is a good chance they could change their mind\nIt would be very tough at this point I Witness news political analyst impulse or Joe Fleming says for those who pick Republican turned independent Joe ... below his support is softer\nAbout thirty six percent of the voters said there's a good chance they could change who they're voting for and the election eight days from now and there's also another twelve percent who said that weren't sure what they're gonna do that is almost half of Joe ... voters that couldn't move away from him\nSo the question is if those votes move away from Joe ... where do they go I can stand in the conventional wisdom is those votes would go to Republican Allen phone\nFor ten our fourth poll over him back on their mind in February the governor's race live upper layer of course than the airwaves had been in a way I\nAm writing a political candidate for that whole story for coverage on cell what happened from ...\nIn the story I think here is the governor has been able to improve her numbers well Allen Fung just hasn't moved the needle he had thirty six percent support in February the pull you just talked about and it's at thirty four percent today that's where the margin of error for ... percent then governor went from thirty eight percent to forty five percent\nSays that's the that's the change in the governor's I mean I ... I I have to go back and look and see what the original when that time frame was that I think that's probably pulling in the beginning of the year um and so yes she is improved their numbers but nowhere near what they have to be\nOr I should say that I shouldn't say that 'cause they they don't really need to be anything more than than more than everybody else but nowhere near over fifty percent\nAnd there's just she just doesn't have it she just doesn't have it she just doesn't have enough to bring everybody along with her and that's not good for the state quite frankly it's not good\nAnd so you know I'm sitting here looking at the people that are undecided there are people that I can move their candidate and I'm trying to get to a base line this is my my the the the reason why I'm asking this question is I'm trying to get a pulse of what it is that people are dealing with when making their decision on this race\n\nWhen you're trying to make a decision as to who to support and the governor's race and you're trying to make a decision as to you know what\nYou're looking into what do you know who's represents me accurately and you're having either you're thinking about it and you're like you're undecided but at the same time or if you pick somebody I could move away I could be I could change my my\nWas in the process of being transferred to a new facility it

go to high school so I was going to sit and laugh at myself being done was stupid or whatever while you're in that um I spend saying that stupid now you just didn't have that in the case and everybody else\nDeborah and believe me I met a lot of highly educated people they're not that bright either [laughter] All right Mary I got to run for the news now thank God but God Bless shall thank you very much\nAll right the idea that we're going to use an executive order to change the fourteenth amendment well we'll throw that out there we come back in the next hour the ... state of\nThe way we literally one solution studios seven away from the general election news talk Ninety nine seven AM six or somebody who we are\nFrom Europe Central and corners\nAfternoon in revolution soft wash new center I'm calls and carry with two o'clock WBAL reduce\nMy boss James Whitey Bolger is deadly eighty nine year old Dorchester native report until today in the west Virginia prison while being transferred to a new facility\nBolger was serving two life sentences this last conviction five years ago it was convicted of eleven murders from the Nineteen seventies through eighties and steadfastly denied FBI reports he was an and former and their effort to get dirt on Providence is patriarch a crime family\nLocal and national officials declining to appear with President Trump during his visit to a grieving Pittsburgh were funerals for those killed at the tree of life synagogue are being held Caitlin Collins reports the president's going to be in the city about four hours a company by the first lady his daughter Ivanka Trump and son in law and advisor Jared Kushner\nAs always for some reason that that's always appeal to me for some reason I don't know why\nI'm going to go about people like from Cuba ... who literally Jerry ... a\nA I'm a Nineteen fifty seven Chevy into a boat\nDo everything they can to get here and then like you know they come over and\nAnd you know maybe they their children to automatically citizens things like\nThis I mean listen there's a part of me that likes that kind of thing we have to have control over it we have to be careful because you know it's one thing political persecution is one thing I'm\nComing up because there's better jobs here and just doing it willy nilly is another so you don't you're not going to hear from me somebody was just like open open borders type of thing but you know if you're born in the United states and you're in the family\nIt's all\nWell yea or babies I Know which is why we get the border under control\nNow originally this was an amendment that was created specifically to delineate or to create a solution to a problem that was that was created when I'm or one of the ramifications of things that was created when a slavery ended\nYou know\nNow they're they weren't property any more than a human beings are they citizens that they are they are the how would they be counted\nAnd we you know the the constitution at the saying the citizens and so that's what it was ultimately created for 'em but\nYou know it's in there and there's a process you see this is what is what drives me crazy about people we have created such a fraction allies society that we can't come to a consensus on anything so we have to wait for these majorities to show up\nTo get anything big done or to get anything or impactful done and we've done\nWe've we've we've created whole political parties in in machines dedicated to creating little subterfuge is and workarounds 'em to floor consensus\nAnd so this is you know the the executive the proliferation of executive orders in the past several administrations is one of those things\n... I kid a compromise to get what I Want I'm going to do by executive order nobody's going to remind them doing it\nCreating fake a gun control legislation that does nothing\nThrough executive ... any claiming victory for it it's a political tool it's not good it's not good for us the process exists folks so that we have\nFirst of all the consensus in order to change the constitution you have to have it's a big process Congress has to either create the amendment and has to be ratified or by the people in thirty eight states we have to have a constitutional convention\nAnd get it done that way similar way and so you have those ways ... it takes a lot and so if you're going to have the fundamental values of the United states of America change most the overwhelming majority of people better be on board\nAnd you don't do this through executive order you don't you don't try and have an impact that through executive order have the debate make to make to make the or the argument put it up for a vote and see if we can get it done\n\nSo you know this is not the way to do it\nNot at all on my phone numbers for three eight WNPR oh the toll free number one eight hundred three two one WNPR oh you can email me mad at six three zero WPRI dot com Charles come from the bunker Charles your WPRI Charles\nCriticized chase his house or a bully\nFried oh Charles hello down freedom friend hello sorry you're wrong\n[laughter] how'd I Know this is going to happen to even you\nKnow are you ready times and it's never going to end the call or come signed that executive order and he is the song ... is probably at that point that I've always loved [noise]\nBasically I this is the ... it's a one pack of fourteenth amendment people bought it from out of our country we're not said if it's in reality it wasn't until Nineteen Eighteen court case came up that are they fought for citizenship and stuff that was that says you hold on a pilot caught Nineteen Eighteen okay\nIt's it's so that's where the genesis of this so that really stands out but there were\nAll right let's let's say you're correct okay let's say I haven't researched that part of it but let me say you're correct Hank you have a Supreme Court decision which sets the precedent and that's how they get constitutions be interpreted if you're born in American soil which is exactly what it says a than you are you are assist in the United states nobody\nAnd even you Charles freedom friend should support the executive branch changing that without even vote from Congress\nOh by Ken I'm On the calendar that first one\nRight you gotta think you'd think logically alright man a country without the United states yeah even I got paid already Ken I'm In Ireland all along yelling God it's something you shouldn't be going to put on your head when you become I'd be like can you set up the United states several times that I stay connected\nOkay you're upset I said you're not you know a lot of our state and yet I I'm kinda I wouldn't tell Puerto Rican going about it and I said if it's for territory\nOkay we did that's that's not what this is the ... you're sitting there you're arguing you're arguing and you are arguing whether or not it should happen that's fine I'm telling you the way you change it\nFrom where is is not with an executive order\nThat that's why a product that the Senate said I'm not a country boy states well outside of the country and I said that if it ever got if\nA if you go about sort of set the crock pot okay they just send you run the country doesn't make him and said if it automatically it doesn't happen at any other country and it shouldn't happen here\nAll right Charles thanks for the call arguing to things Steve Mumford Steve you're WPRI Steve\nIf I could add a little calmer tone of this discussion yes I'm thirty three other countries of the same process of people a trail is one of those countries are citizens mhm the man is incorrect on that point\nUh I Would be terrified\nWell he's being told supposedly that he has White House lawyers say you can do it now that doesn't mean by the way that there's some lawyer that can twist the world and back in time and make it seem like it can happen and try and make a ... a legal argument to do it but you know if you're somebody who says I'm Talking about people out there who are citizens\nWho are where you're supposed to construction is who would sit there and tell you that the a well regulated militia being necessary need be necessary to the security the free state doesn't matter in the second amendment an agri them by the way because the active part of that is that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\nIf you're going to argue that case based on a construction this thing with the constitution says you can't sit here and say that except for this one\nBecause the intent is all this that the other thing\nWell this president ice seriously believe and I don't know I'm trying to stir up on that sense but I think this man is a a fascist sympathizer\nNow come on now he loves having Davis who does the ... you know higher praise and the media\nThe insurgency Mexico is a fascist please stop it already just\nStop stop it\nAnd this is this is the the TBS comes out you know it's just it's unbelievable just stop at the fascism nonsense please the love of God this is about process process maintains order in fairness the process now\nIf you want to make an argument to me as to whether or not you think that we shouldn't have this is ridiculous people shouldn't like that you know throw their um\nTheir universes over the border so that they can have children and you know just like the cross that border so I can I can give birth real quick and then we'll go back home and American citizen I get it I get it can it can be abused which is why I'm thinking you get this immigration system under control he wants to worry about this thing it takes care of itself\nUm however I Will not support somebody trying to change a constitutional construct\nThrough an executive order I wouldn't say I would supportive Brock Obama did it was supportive of George Bush did it you don't support these things\n\nI don't support when they make the when they make or when we sit here and argue over you know creating machinations like a ... like ridiculous process is we just went through with Brett Kavanaugh to make the to make the Supreme Court like the American idol judge is\n\nYou know based on their ideology we can get through we want to get through without actually creating consensus and actually you know if you want to change the constitution actually changing it because words have to mean things folks if we all live in a world where words don't really mean things we can all just you know figure out whatever we want to interpret everything the whole thing goes to how\nThe whole thing goes to hell\nDon't want to live in hell you want to live in hell I don't want to live in hell hell's bad last I heard all unless you can change the definition\nWhich is technically Matt function the actual word ... which is the sun\nThe sun the Greek silly also son is actually a nice warm place as the giver of life and so technically what hell's the place where everything is is that life happens so you're wrong man you got to know your history\nRight\n[laughter]\n\nI don't want\n\nTo [laughter]\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[laughter]\n\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n[laughter]\n\n\n[laughter] [laughter]\n\n[noise]\n[laughter]\n\n\n[laughter]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nI don't know why\n[laughter]\n\n\n\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\n\n[laughter] [laughter]\n\n[noise]\n\nAnd Alan show news talk Ninety
