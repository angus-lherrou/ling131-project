I'm ... now my phone is like blowing up would that gives you would cause him you're going back and usually if you guys going back and forth and I'm looking at my phone like who is this\nOh by the end anyway so that's the problem the other problem is that a a reminder victory this time is going to put us in a situation where it's going to be even more difficult to elect a Republican governor for years from now\nUm and so it's not even just this for years that we're going to have to deal with the gene a to point I was I like to call it is actually my regret in coined that phrase you can hear to our show from nine to noon every weekday here on WBFO a gene a to point no um it's not only the gene that you know but it's going to be there\nThe fact that the Democrats will have a tremendous leg up\nIn the next ... election it twenty twenty two because you know she's going to have an open seat you kind of an era parents or she's going to have the high road she's going to be controlling the debate a and so it'll be probably if I ever a long time before we have an opportunity to elect a Republican governor in what do we have in this race well we've got Alan ...\nWho was a Republican mayor Cranston and we get jokes are low who's a Republican turned independent running to the right of the Republican or the stated purpose of keeping Allen outta the governor's house or out of like say the governor's mansion we don't have a governor's mansion\nAnd he wouldn't want to be welcome in the governor's house anyway probably because it's their own personal anyway that's not the point the point if given the governor's office and so the result is that we're going to get Gina to point out and we'll have ... knows this he knows that he doesn't care\nLays in jail and he really doesn't care his goal is pretty simple his goal is to Dr Alan ... make sure Alan ... doesn't get in\nA he said it's a journal unfairness he tried to backtrack it's all I was angry and I got anger management issues oh that's a great qualification for governor wants somebody with anger may declare war on Massachusetts one day you get mad about something\nUh but uh you know that's that's kind of been his goal let's see oh that's the truth sentiment is to to basically drive make sure Alan doesn't win in the alternative is of Alan Wednesday when so Joe ... has an opportunity to be a real hero in the way it would be a hero's me to drop out of the race indoors Alan from\nThat makes him a hero all of a sudden people are going to be looking at George Wallace and you know what it was a guy who spent his own money which is debatable or in his own time to try and be governor and he's recognized the danger of a gene a to point out and he did the right thing and I think a lot of people would favorably remember him for that conversely\nWhen Gina wins because it's math is no way to get around the map when gene or wins everybody's going to be looking at Joe ... I'm Sorry they are they're all going to be looking at jokes reload saint Joe you made this happened you made this happened\nAnd that is going to be unfortunate but I I don't think he cares I really don't think it gives a applying for Judy about it\nUh and so you know he's gonna he's going to take off and go to Florida and go on a nice cruise after the election and laugh all the way about how he messed up Alan falling and we're stuck with Gina to point out two or three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WPRI Steve I'm a logging that guy is dial the broadcast from or what\n[laughter] what is the ... good lawyer John your morning I I Am a retired state\nEmployee and when I heard that he pulled on friday\nA going after the entrances we're All right I was insulted I was I was so angry because that that's a big deal in my family yeah call and it's a big deal in a lot of people a life that every state\nAnd for him to use that as a political tool now\nYeah now that the only reason is using it now is because the you know the let the cat out of the bag it to the Providence Journal when he said\nI don't care if I get to present as long as they come from Allan Fung so now he's kind of backed into a corner so now because the cat's out of the bags of well I better do some Democrats stuff that they like they like pensions right Democrats or we're going to Poland ...\nHow can anybody it'd be so delusional ... he's going to\nVote for this guy he it didn't work whatever he was trying to do maybe it will push people walk towards a more which people away from him\nYeah and you know and I tell people an Alan phone he was not my first choice to be honest with you in in four years ago I was in favor of block I'm In this time around I I was in favor of Patti Morgan until she decided to endorse joke furlough for reasons that aren't\nAbundantly either why that's why I voted for the president\nBut honestly I Would vote for almost anybody that would keep us from having Gina to point no because\nExactly we're progressive agenda is going to be brutal set it maybe the only one in the race I vote for him [laughter] and I just\nThink it's an insult to itself or tell them to do that thinking it's going to just give people a six hundred dollar check to vote for me yeah I'm Sorry it's a cool most it's something I'm\nNot exactly like that but he brought up some pension reform one right before the election right\nBack with the election you know when you had a rather when is it are always twenty\nTwenty something percent yeah a John I'm going to start eating um Oregon\n[laughter] that's good for the blades maybe it's good for you to you know who knows a stalemate you for the call appreciate it for three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WPRI you know if that makes us you and I that makes us collateral damage for Joe ... personal vendetta\nThat simple we are the collateral damage this state those of us who are stuck here and can't get on a yacht and driving away rocks not presented with standing down to Florida\nWhere are the ones that are going to be stuck with for years of gene a to point out and Joe doesn't care about that he doesn't he really doesn't care but he's got an opportunity to be a hero to really be somebody that's remembered and revered for a long time if somebody who did the right thing the question is does he have an Indian to do it\nCan be overcome his personal vendetta enough to say you know what I care about the state\nI Know that to point out of Gina is going to be more progressive ism I Can't subject my fellow Rhode Island is to that and as much as it pains me I'm going to drop out of the race and I'm gonna say you know what I'm voting for John Allen Fung do whatever you want and and see what happens\nAh but that's that's the only thing that's going to save us from that and I just don't know if he's got the intestinal fortitude to do it Charles his dial from a dump guy Kraus welcome you are on the John Lawson show good to have you\nWhat do you top what's going on [noise] All right well I Can't get through because of the ... weren't okay\nAll right [laughter] my parents taught him out of it is corrupt and why do you say the first of all white people you know we want that was owned by\nWhy so why is Alan Alan corrupt wise Allen\nI walked out of that I'd say please please stop\nI find that hard to believe but if you have some evidence that other people don't have you should you should just like go put it out there [noise] before you start calling people corrupt\nOkay right [noise] it's just you know done good cheap and their state and the Republicans are no different than the Democrats\nAlright I enjoy it you know it was completely got pregnant and the Republican Democrat so I Hope you're Charles sixteen\nYears and the general assembly easy outsider yet right thanks jai Thanks Charles ... forgery eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three do

years yelled fundraisers and you went to many of them at the crown plaza with a pasta station\nWhere he's taking money from lobbyists so now maybe he's not taking money from ... but that doesn't mean you never had it in the past but it just it it's an opportunity to really be a hero and to do what's right and and uh you know it current courses speed I mean this is this is the way this this is going to end we're Thelma and Louise and he's driving the car\nAnd the cars going to go straight over the top of that cliff and you know I I don't know what to tell you but ... is not going to be

he's still may be if he if he um if he goes pullout it'd be fully endorses\nAllen fun and and the reason that you didn't mention before that I wanted to add in it was because\nI'm sure that Washington is watching this you know they're watching all the states closely watching all every election closely and if they could get Joe trouble ever dropped out and really truly support behind Alan ... and he did win\n... and then they knocked off the um they stopped the sanctuary state stuff\nYou know where that wasn't an issue here anymore I'm sure that he would have this president so darn gratitude of

I just find this very ironic that now all of a sudden we are still ways before the election oh by the way we're going to be ... to his first that discovered the suburbs and failing the whistle blower ... spent under the\nEspecially the guy but you know again the or the new wave is to instead of running on your own merits is to is to just formulate your own your own cabinet them in a tent approach um which is\nOne of the team approach worked well for the red Sox resolutions by the way of making the world and I tell you what I let's let's\nLet's go right into I didn't go there I didn't give them much hope after Chris' sale I'm kind of for mysteriously ah pooped his parents and the first uh start then we wound up in the hospital or then you had David Price and you've got some issues there with you know those guys collected all making sixty eighty million dollars a year\nBut these guys have pulled it together and um [noise] I tell you what are the Houston Astros were legacy team that's a team that many thought would run the table\nFor the next three four maybe years with their pitching staff uh with that defense with those those guys were absolutely lights are dangerous last year and looked like they were\nThe red Sox would have met their match again in this series they took these guys out very very handily an easily reminds me of of the greatest show on tour of the uh the uh the St Louis rams was Kurt Warner which was another team that looked like they were going to build a dynasty and go a couple of two or three superbowls and\nAnd Tom Brady in the end and company a two thousand one took them out and they they never recovered and and you wonder about Houston if uh if it were they're going to be but that major major a defeat for the red Sox it's going to be a fun or next ten days or to see\nWhat I'd love to see Milwaukee and then I went to the White House and and you know what I almost want to see Milwaukee before I got I almost want to see LA before Milwaukee anything of Milwaukee pose more of a chance us eliminates might the why I\nKnow it's not a ... but those teams out there\nNever get to the show now they don't get big attendance and the ticket prices you know the major league baseball a few years ago just like just like football yeah how do they go into what they call a leak sharing and the price of the tickets\nSo there was no fixed price anymore so if you had tickets to Fenway they used to be Ninety dollars a piece of the season they get to know who they played adjusted the price of tickets\nSo you you take a team like Milwaukee they can't get the high and high in town because they don't have Ninety dollar ticket prices\nYou know and then they get twenty dollar thirty dollar ticket prices so it's nice to see like and I hate to call them and underdog team because they've done very very well but I like to see you know\nA nice nice team like that you know make it to the world series and hopefully you know brush smaller market teams yeah small market teams absolutely you know and and do very well I I don't want them to win no I'd like to see the soccer when selfishly what I mean but if they if they did win that would be okay to okay 'cause it's all fairness of the game but\nI think it I I think it'd be more intriguing series at the end of the I always look here's the way I look I\nI always look at it if the team you want to win it was a Red Sox doesn't win who do you want to when I had like I'd rather much rather get beat by Milwaukee and have those ... or ... you know have a World Series although they already do have one back in eighty three I think it is I'd much rather see a if we're not going to win I'd much rather see a Milwaukee ticket\nAccidents than LA it's nice to see it's not the same old routine down and we don't want to foreign team uh LA taken it you know because that's a foreign country\nSo well we just hope Nevada fault lines is nothing ... hoping we'll\nThey're they're trying to secede anyway California yeah they want to\nIt'd be just one Key West tries to type you know so I think we're going to go after the break you do with them [noise]\nYeah yeah it's it's it's a different way of a company that's what the\nReal power is not right now it's so that's why\nI Know what it's not about what they say it's when\nIt's so gross sir\nYeah it does it could be Joe thank you as always eighty two cents right Tommy we're going to take your next bill hang out please feel you have to really are going to take some time if you're under the brick Tommy go ahead\nYou guys have in our county growing up\nSo you know I called last week and I was a very concerned that good actually a couple of people said\nThat they heard me on and they were like I don't understand why they're not ... by the truckers are doing what you said and what I said was twenty five twenty thousand altogether little at least twenty five thousand truckers\nAnd [noise] as a Rhode Island all my life I got to tell you something I drive around I don't see any truckers which I get the science on this thing saying you know ... vote for a phone I don't I don't hear in the media a boat or any of fundraisers at the truckers are doing\n'em I mean what what does it take a [noise] she's she's raping the truck is the truckers say well we're we're we're we're we're going to you know we're concerned do you know we're going to do our part but we've got to go home and you know watch cable and drink beer\nNow and it's not that's not the case at all and because maybe somebody got misconstrued here\nOr that ms misinformed so let me explain to you because who gets elected governor right they're not taking the told you know\nGet a drug so he ...\nHe can because it's still going to go through mc nabb yellow house and it's still going to go through Dominic Virginia's Senate\nNow it's the law he could slow it down and ... you know he could silk hell so darn thing for indirectly the truck is as a truck that we're not supporting politicians\nOut money is right now in a lawsuit right okay and with high priced lawyers and everything to beat them in court and that's that's where our focus is so win lose or draw and we're not saying by any means we want you to remind do back in let's be perfectly clear about\nThat what we're gonna lose or draw were hedging on the last you\nKnow the loss or just going to make it so that they can put it on everybody but\nNo no no no well we're talking about our lawsuit now you've got a backup now Mickey Mantle yellow swears and then we got recordings I Would never have done it will never going to cause according to him now is he told the truth will find out [laughter]\nWe'll find out as Tommy you know listen ... women\nIndustry or twenty five dollars in Rhode Island we spent a lot of money over the last couple of years right\nAt the beginning of title it's still there it's going around indirectly we're not running around with us on our trucks because it doesn't do anything for the fact that we that way we handle you know a lot of other ways as we as always thanks for the call appreciate it gets on they'll hunt hang on 'til we got back from the break and then
