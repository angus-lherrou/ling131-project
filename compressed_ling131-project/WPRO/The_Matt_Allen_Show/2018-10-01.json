Cody our WPRI who'd taken aback from Cody\nOh I think we're taking it taking it back from Donald Trump I Would imagine Donald Trump took the country\nAh yeah I mean I guess because like if you think about it the Democrats really can't even get through it they rip out putting a Bernanke Trump you know\nYeah but I I I just wanted I wanted to do people to realize I guess take it back from Trump Trump doesn't have the country Trump was was put into leadership by an election\nThat's my point I mean my point bringing this up is that these people are acting like ... and really it's been from the beginning that we're fighting some sort of rebellious er you know in certain insurgency that ah that snuck in invaded the nation the fact of the matter is\nOur politics have gotten so terrible in this country and so but now and and and really\nBecause it's not it's not it's not damaging to the republic into the democracy or the or the moral fabric of the country too picky legitimately elected president and turn him into an invader\nWas only ... only he does that when talking about people who break into the country illegally illegally immigrate in this place that's right that's that's or somebody is legitimately elected to office for good or bad but did the work the process in one that's an invader\n... it's so patently stupid\nAnd this is our politics and I just you know when you think about the political divide in this country folks that's why but they don't even hear themselves they don't hear themselves Gina Raimondo is up there she's bringing in the Joe Biden committed to stump for all the Democrats and they're you know he's the most populous guy that they could figure out to to come in and\nSpeak working class to the rest of the people because the rest of 'em

and then it's up to vote again to get up their vote again in the afternoon\nYou know the direct service to vote and then they complain about what's going on and yet it's there are people that are controlling everything but yet they're expecting a different outcome it's like\nI I it it drives me nuts I'm hearing Biden today talk about that you're putting it is very eloquently because what's next another civil war because\nThat that's what's gonna happen who are we going to take ... and we're from and if you haven't noticed the way the economy's trucking along the way everything is going right now who are you going to take ... from the problem is the Democrats don't have anybody to put up against Trump and the next election\nWell they might but let me just tell you this dog or a Joe Biden you might be the guy that goes up against Trump in the next election and he can give me your ... you'll give 'em a run for his money but I'll tell you this for Joe Biden to sit there and to act like he's this angel\nWhen it comes to the division in politics and that he's now he's going to reach across the aisle while he's sitting there talking to a room full of Democrats\nOr your blather ring on about taking the country back these guys don't even hear themselves they really don't hear themselves they don't even realize that their actions eight years of identity politics when it comes

rest of the show I've I've gone away from it is there's so much virtues ... throw up sometimes I C colon jokes in this\nLittle either soy superstar here\nIt was a kind of a non political things were really funny for the driver to or maybe I'll watch it\nWe come back Sheldon Whitehouse is animal spirits we come back next\nWeek from New England truck solution studio proud to be the most prominent college friars basketball [noise] this is talk of Ninety nine seven FM I Am six thirty WPRI prominence accumulate station [noise]\nAfternoon and the revolution soft wash new center I'm pause and Garry was the one o'clock WPRI news at least one socket confirming Sundays deadly incidents of murder suicide here's WB hours ...\nPolice chief Tom ... says this email victim was shot to death at the home of Iraq as she was picking up a couple of seven year old son from visitation late Sunday Morning in one socket\nStill awful tragic situation for that you would it be placed in we had a medically evaluated on a scene as soon as we can could and then got 'em reunited with some family members\nChief ... says the child to not witnessed the incident which is believed to have occurred before large law enforcement presence descended on blue stone drive a SWAT Team found both men and women get inside the home do have remained WTO run news\nI don't know anything about our politics but that tells me a whole bunch about what a big it she is and so you know I don't like big it's so far as I'm concerned\nAre going to sit there and talk about how all men are somehow responsible for such certain things I mean\nIt is as demanded a thought process as it gets and one that I thought we weren't supposed to have right\nI thought we were supposed to be moving our society away from blanket judgements about people based on what they look like in the kind of ... and how they were born isn't that supposedly the liberal way right isn't that supposedly the liberal way that you're judging individual based on an individual's character and individuals accomplishments individuals' worth\nAnd that the great thing about America is that in in in the constitution is a recognition of the individual\nThat each individual person is born with the spark of God within them and therefore should be protected by law with rights that they are in it they are actually in dealt with by their creator\nRight\nBut when that happens and you start getting into this intersection Audi nonsense and this whole theory of you know\nSwapping um where we swapping swapping victim mode and the agreed to process and that certain people can have opinions on certain things\nAnd that certain people should be excluded from the process I don't know how that works folks 'cause I don't know whether the war's been fought over that haven't ... haven't there been civil rights movements and all sorts of things meant to stop that from happening I guess we're gonna have to do it again\n\nBut the funny part of all this\nIs one Sheldon Whitehouse starts talking about animal spirits and they're they're asking he and Mazie Hirono\nI guess about the uh about the the mood in the room how judge Kavanaugh was angry and and yelling and and then Senator Graham went crazy and started yelling and going great and getting emotional and then you listen to show their way to listen to what he said go ahead\nWith it was really quite astonishing how the tone in the room changed when judge Kavanaugh came out explosively confrontational\nThis confirmation process has become a national disgrace what you want to do is destroyed this guy's life\nAnd then Lindsey Graham first out\nYou said that and I just went on his own explosive statement this is going to destroy the ability of good people to come forward because of this crap\nNot just entirely logical people there are animal spirits in humans and that's true and senators this man is not a monster so and so when somebody goes into the brain in full on battle mode is or not to make\nThe full of themselves if say rallying point and I think you saw that happen in the runs\nI Am fascinated\nBy the way that that meant talks I ... is anybody else's as fascinated by Sheldon Whitehouse his choice of words and and that [laughter] is it just me\nIt's like I it's like I Can't look away we go W where did he grow up was born in New York City yeah um because that accent when he says roam\nThe son of a says Rome\nI'm [laughter]\nKind of a mixture of all over the place well the New Yorker went through a St Paul's school in Concord New Hampshire in ... in a topic and knowing order\nBy any stretch women's Virginia school of law\nYou think so thing they say Rome down there\nThat's the one that called me the is sitting there saying you know into the breach again with the spirit animals animal spirits and in senators and\nYou can feel that in the room\n[laughter]\nThis is the thing that happens to me and I had it probably just me the way people say certain words gets in my head and I will now for the rest of the day we saying roam\nRoam instead of room\nRubbed it was really quite astonishing how the tone in the room change from\nJesus nobody noticed though the room [noise]\nThe talk of a beer made him one of the rings ... what\nIs your spirit animal folks\n\nThe animal spirits of the senators and they go into the breach like this is ... ... ... what is that what is the once more into the breach dear friends wants more what does that King Lear was it's just it's a Shakespeare right\nI've read like five Shakespearean plays I and then none of 'em are was hamlet Macbeth or what's the the uh the merchant of Venice maybe three let's see other whenever it goes from Henry the fifth the fifth excuse me once more into the breach dear friends once more\nOr close of a war with our English did\nIn peace there is nothing so becomes a man is modest illness and humility\nAnd when the blast of war blows in our ears and I mean between the action of

confrontation inside but they weren't in time\nBut it has been shot and killed a ... a who stopped over there to actually pick up the child if they hadn't come and they are in turn to them so\nThe couple of seven year old son was inside of the time not physically injured the chief says the boy was at a different part of the house and did not see the tragic events of Cranston state rep voicing concern about electric rate hikes the start today here's WB hours bill ...\nThey represented above Lindsey agrees the national grid is passing along the increases in power cause much does the utility getting the best deal for that power\nAnd drinking once in awhile I mean it's just all depends on what you're talking about what somebody's tolerance is for how much booze is there\nYou know your desk and see I grew up in the house my father would drink a six pack a pony bottles of Budweiser every six months watching\nA Red Sox game to me that's drinking as if you have more in my mind if you have more than like a a if you have one more more than one session of drinking a week then I think you're a heavy drinker\nIf you go home and how many people out there right now listening to this show habit have one ... at least one drink\nOf alcohol a day because to me that's a lot\nSome people it's normal that's what they do\n\nIf you have a day a week\nI mean I Can't tell you the level because I don't\nBut even before that I mean I go months without even sipping any alcohol\nUm I haven't had anything alcoholic drinks in in in almost a year probably ... yeah probably about a year while not maybe not that much maybe nine months and months\nAnd that's not abnormal for me I go months and months without having anything to drink and that's always been the case for\nMe but I when I was younger and that was even say I wouldn't dream just to sit there and tasted it would be weeks or could be when I was in college would probably be a whole seven days and we drink once a week maybe twice a week but it was a lot\nAnd when he did it you did it a lot and then after that you didn't drink anymore so I you ... you ... your own\nOf what that is depends and so I don't know how valuable that is you're going to talk to the FBI about it so I don't know what this guy's standard of drinking a lot is I don't know what the standard is of swearing words and whatever\nI'm [laughter] versus what Brett Kavanaugh says so how valuable as this so this is the kind of garbage we're going to get from now until friday in this so called investigation\nOr whether it's basically a background this investigation that the FBI is going to go talk to people by the way if you change your if you change your story from what the already on the record statements have been\nRight under the penalty of perjury already or ... or ... ... penalty of of a threat of of of felony\nFor not telling the whole story not telling the truth you could possibly be thrown under the bus so you have the FBI thing is going to go onto the next couple of days the Democrats according to CNN just saw a headline pop up they're gonna have to they will have a list of twenty five people that they're going to be\nAnd talk to or that they want to I haven't talked to which is just incredible\nAnd uh and and and so\nHow is this going to be some kind of big bipartisan move to save the country it's just delaying the inevitable\nAnd so at the end of the day until enough of these things like this gale guy and you know maybe you get somebody else who saw him stumbling not fall back on the floor one point or whatever or comes around\nAnd starts chipping away and chipping away to the point where some senator peels off at the or some or one or two senators pills often stops this nomination from happening I'm\nJust going to be more and more of the same politicking back and forth I mean this weekend listening to the uh the sixty minutes stuff last night actually I was when it was uh when it was aired I'm you know Chris Coons and and Jeff Flake you know ... it was like let's also where these guys gonna run together for ... for a president and vice president next next the term\nTwenty twenty we're going to have a mixed ticket\nThe two bipartisan guys and save the world with the with the judicial nominating process here\n\nThis is amazing to me to watch this process and I mean and ultimately I mean how much of this stuff ends up becoming valuable to ... to ... to determining whether or not somebody actually should be in the Supreme Court or not\nVersus becoming valuable to partisans to stop somebody who they think is a danger to their ideology from sitting on the court I mean that's what ultimately all this is let's be honest with each other\nLet's be honest with each other\nI mean how much of this do you think is actually about getting to the bottom of whether or not this is a bad guy going to sit on a court versus stopping somebody\nFrom taking that seat for the rest of their lives again that is against the left wing ideology in this case just like it was would Merrick Garland Merrick Garland was left wing pick to the court the Republicans had the ability to stop it they just didn't have a hearing on it they stopped that\nWhy because he's a bad judge no because he wouldn't match with the ideology that they want to see on the court and they had the ability to do it\n\n\nThey've gone they they've used a a ... or if there's even a such thing as a degree of nuclear option an extra nuclear option here where they're going to turn this into a meat to thing I mean you think about the proxy wars that are going on with this case folks\nAnd how people are taking this I mean it really is dangerous\nIt's dangerous when you see what people are reading into this you see the ad I'm an activist that corner Jeff Flake in the in the end of the elevator and the Senate building the other day\nTalking about their their own victimization and what you're telling people and what you're doing to people what you're saying to women I mean you're dealing with a very specific situation\nIn a very specific very politically charged context and then you have those people\nOut there who have been
