throwing you know minorities and women and that that that that hall that crap\nYou are so All right the the word [laughter] well it's known that want to know that Alan shows next they'll happened with your headlines have a great Wednesday\n[noise] somebody from the New England solutions to this position you count on for news traffic weather boy hanging dog seven AM six or someone you be our problem cumulus\nFrom the revolution soft Washington centered this is the news in New York Times President Trump says we need the Saudis help them fight on terrorism and keeping the ayatollah and check over in Iran has jumped at the White House\nSaudi Arabia in terms of a a fight against all of the terrorism everything's just happening in Iran and other places but Iran's been the leader of Iran has been set back very big one I knocked out the Iran deal you know it's a different country than it was\nThat uh one of the the a\nProposal from the council president is to\nUh and I believe um create a commission would oversee and try to make sure that\nFolks who do own businesses who maybe could help the city who could be an on contracts things like that are made I'm more aware and more brought into the process it's it's very much kind of a fairly straightforward legislation um it's moved really slowly and from my understanding and I'll admit to you this is one of those examples or one of those times\nWhen I was not in city hall for what\nUh and so my understanding of the city law department I'm asked the for the ordinance to be\nA table for a short time I'm I'm told her for about a week um while they reviewed some changes that were being made this is like a lot of you know in the weeds minutiae hum and or the ... president very much a wanted to uh\nTo pass it out of committee and and eventually pass it uh for the council and uh and and it's seemingly had a a fairly loud exchange with a couple of his colleagues who\nI'll remind you are on the opposite side of his um in the current council presidents fight which is a ... they're lining up largely behind some macho so there are politics at play here I'm In addition to that the you know the argument over policy\nOh yeah you think I'm gonna cause the issue is I mean the idea that his name is so much about the night you know we can talk about uh later on the actual veracity the idea right supposed to do and all that stuff but this is all about a press releases then released complaining about bullying tactics and then about um\nI think the quote was bullying was in fact ... or something like that or or being abusive\nTo women specifically I Believe was mentioned by us was being a man who knows\nUm this is going to be I I Believe it's still the case or at least potentially the case this is going to be a female majority council coming up after the election\nIt will be with unless there is some sort of a major upset in the general election you will have a female council members which will be a majority of the council\n[noise] All right so you get the majority of the Fifteen right that's right but I Try Fifteen members of council eight will be female and so\nThis ah you know it's obviously this this is going to be some kind of a of what's being a match us being the there's a there's a move to get her to to get the majority of the people on the on the council to put her in the in the presidency correct\nThat's right and indeed remember there's a long standing rivalry now between a councilman macho some council president Salvador because last year council president Salvador of course kind of\nA put together the votes that took away her presidency um and then there was that to you and I talked about this at the time or earlier this year there was a back and forth about uh the councilwoman ... excuse me husband who was the chairman of the prominence Democratic Party\nA man who posted a medium that offended some of the Italian American members of the council right they sought to sort of capitalize on that and I think there's\nA there's certainly appears to be a level of kind of retribution playing out here\nUm GMOs since he had the president on earlier today and he revealed everybody with stories of of past instances where where he was yelled at or was was there when other people in these when these individuals who are complaining were yelling and screaming how is that something that happens on a regular basis I mean it's not nothing new\nYeah I mean the city council I mean I think any legislative body but ... but certainly the the one that I cover um it is not uncommon for them to have\nA heated arguments and and argue with each other now typically does happen behind closed doors\nUm and you know very rarely does it end up making it into the press or you know into press releases that go out to the entire media that's where some of the politics that comes into play but it is by no means uncommon for um a couple of folks to disagree with each other over policy\nAnd it happens all the time absolutely on all levels yeah well I mean you look you had a judge for low in er and er Larry Earhart smacking each other [laughter] that's right yeah let's minority of the\nThe uh sausage making of of you know policy and and things like that is is not always but the brightest and clean is a thing that happens I think the tensions are are incredibly high here because there's this fight for council president for the council presidency and so\nA lot of things become more public than they would normally\nWhere did I see the the statement from ... and she says to the ... the um\nI Believe she sent it out to everybody you know a guy or media\nAll right so that's that's this is one of those weird things that you know when I start to see this stuff where it's you know this is what the when you start involved women and men and\nAnd the you know the idea of bullying and all this nonsense that goes along with it um and and you politicize it right I mean it's one thing if it's really happening in everybody's offended by it and he's like listen in something sexist or whatever\nBut it's just because you're involved in a back and forth either you know this is my my take on this either you want to be equal you don't if you want to be equal you gonna get yelled at guys yell at each other right and that's just the way it goes I mean that's that's the situation and\nYou know you can be offended by it and that's fine but he stuck to bring in this whole idea of it being a extra extra um rude or extra out of the ... an extraordinarily I'm I'm over the top because you know try and play this game of of of victimizing women almost right and that's when it starts to become ridiculous and then you start to\nUh in my opinion you start to weaken\nWhat it is you're supposed to be fighting for but anyway so that's so in this case or it wouldn't use in in terms of of the actual fight for ... a council the president you see you hear any which way this is going to\nReport it a little bit ah not that I expect you to read every single thing I I I tried everything I counsel when my toes has and it certainly seems to be the front runner she she seems to put together um it it appears today that she has eight votes you may have\nMore going forward a there's a long way to go because you can't actually\nUm votes for council president until the first meeting of the new year um and so you know anything can happen but it's certainly she has a leg up and I think that's where again um when when I see sort of who was involved in how people are handling it but on both sides by the way I mean the council president statement\nVery much kind of attacked all three of the women involved in this case that I've you know publicly criticized him um there's a there's a presidency fight playing out that's what this is about\nRights is not not any really sort of issue that's that's important interest that no yeah well that's important but you know what I mean it's and I think if\nYou know the thing is while you are not a by any means wrong to to you know be a to see the statements and say all and they do they really need to go to that and to go there with that you know the flip side of course is um\nIt doesn't sound reasonable for the law department largely controlled by the mayor's office to say hey can you put the brakes on this for a week\nA while we review things\nUm and ... it seems I Would say uncharacteristic of the council president to a reactor that emotionally so again I think that one more time on their scores than tension that's overall it's playing out in city hall right now I'm more so than just the individual incident\nYou think it's a situation where they're trying to I'm In a stall this before the election so we can't take election credit for that kind of thing you\nKnow honestly no I think it's usually these things play out like the you know a change here or there gets made and then folks get worried about how to enforce things and and and\nYou know there's it's just a lot and like in the weeds kind of stuff and so no I don't think it's about credit or anything like that I think it was literally hey this isn't ready for prime time just yet um I I don't think if you were to ask the mayor\nIf he opposes the ordinance I I I think he would say no of course I support it I just want to make it right\nUm and I think that's what that's what happened here which is again why I think it was a little bit uncharacteristic of the council president to react the way he did\nInteresting or I didn't excellent as always we appreciate it thanks so much may not have a good and You're welcome\nDamage ... and DOMA WPRI that common endemic ... province politics when we come back in the in the break from the break\nI Will read to you the uh the the the statement from council president pro tem Sabina Matos and out she decided to make this about women and dealing with women and\nHow this idea of of ... bullying or or or anger issues and all this other nonsense and this is this is exactly what women in this country need today right we're going to start talking about women as a whole\nIs nothing that will that will end deer or the the plight of women to everybody like a like having fake victimization politicizing weaponized against people\nThat does that does nothing but actually legitimize the real struggles a real people is when something is used as a political bludgeon in a tool rather than a legitimate criticism I Love that don't you love that don't you love that\nSo thirty has a

talk to somebody to write a report they're not gonna just gonna sit there and wait and react so they see somebody doing something shady they're going to wait to commit a crime because they're not gonna bother to talk to the guy\nThat's what's happening in the city of Providence tonight what did I say let 'em have it\nI said the police officers and you know what I see less work for you to do just don't bother ... they want to have a world where the police don't get involved and things don't you know try to stop things from happening or whatever that's fine I understand it let them have it\nAnd when the places a dump overrun by crime and there's people that are running around the city literally robbing places for two days straight you know or or or and one story I heard of this guy

reports that for now the president wants to hear more even some on Capitol Hill are ready to punish the kingdom\nIn a second interview with Fox Business network in as many days President Trump laying off one reason he's reluctant to punish the Saudis over the ... she controversy\nWe need Saudi Arabia in terms of our fight against all of the terrorism everything's is happening in Iran and other places\nThat's the case in most cities in the works city council president right now is Stephen ... he's he's on the line with me to talk about this kind of get some and updating to get an orientation from him what he thinks is is going on here ... welcome to the show thank you\nThank you at All right so talk to me about this um in your mind you know I see this and you know doing what I've done for a long time here I see shenanigans\nUm when you look at this you see what accounting error mistake miscommunication or is it shenanigans what are you ...\n... ... well you know this was brought to our attention by as you mentioned a Mr Cody missed a block and a Mr Cody had\nUm had several months if not ... it was over a year of research that he had done to piece together what he thought was happening and it was disconcerting to me a sense of the council members and\nWe had hired in accounting firm to uh go back a look at the book too\nIt's in payroll records I'm In the meantime a mayor adhesion or had just left\nA mayor Solomon is credit when he came in a ... had some concerns also\nAnd wanted to examine this and suspended the sick pay bonuses while this a while all the things you just mentioned that a war a war going on and ... and we had concerns also\nWell I mean the issue and you know that\nThere's been as you also mentioned I think it was also mentioned in the paper\nThat there were several grievances filed and and you just mentioned past practices or what they're going to argue so um yeah I Can't speak the litigation matters right but I think that you hit the nail on the head of the ... ah what everybody was concerned about and why\nI'm the mayor took the step of\nSuspending us until we get to the bottom of it\nWell the issue here is going to be when you should get to the bottom of what is this accounting firm looking for and they just looking for the wild they weren't going to\nCome air the research that Cody had done and also look at our own records and the contracts to make sure that the accounting methodology that was used by uh the fire department was accurate at that time was accurately cap\nAnd that time was a you know accurately pay\nWell that's the issue right is there is there this can not confuse anybody\nThat could be multiple interpretation of the words of the contract right right okay so not to mention if there are things that you mention that were on written that we weren't aware of\nWell if that's the case I mean you hear ... was that the first time you've seen that in this article where the where the union a representative said something about a side agreement with the former mayor and you've ever heard anything like that before\n[noise] ... you know you I was in in ah the office wouldn't use contract with written or they would just\nPresented to the council in a written format or I have no idea what the ...\nWhat does that the first time you've heard about a side deal\n... you always hear about what had happened and negotiations or what people thought were happening and\nWas always speculation I I always find fifty percent of the stuff that you hear in politics is true and fifty percent is not true and you always wonder which is what\nUh so uh have you heard rumors about side deals are yeah there were a lot of rumors out there but I Try base my opinions on what the facts are and and what the contract says and what a we're obligated to pay\nTalk to me about the about the your your time is a city councilman when you get this contract in front of you and you see this language that is now being ... or ... ... ... your ... interpreted uh in multiple ways did they did it raised flags you at the time there was a kind of something that just by everybody\n[noise] well I mean I was concerned about the contracts for other reasons um and uh I had to be quite honest with you voted no for other reasons other than ...\nOught to say that people knew what was going on behind the scenes as to how sick sick pay was being calculated I I think would you know be be inaccurate I don't think anyone\nKnew I had an inclination that that uh there was\nAccounting error as possible accounting error is going on and uh\nAnd so I don't think that that was an issue that was ever brought up before the ... ... and that the council had any knowledge of but not to mention that you would just spoke about which is mayor having to use and possibly having less ideal\nRight which then take it for which then being not anyway right which would which then takes the idea\nOf an ... an error and kind of throws out the window if it's done on purpose is not an error right\nAnd so if you don't know what I'm saying I don't\nWant to have to talk of complement a mayor Solomon for for political hold on everything and stopping the payments when this came to fruition a that was back in ... you\nKnow the way this works is that people understand the inner workings of the city we're talking with Stephen ... city council president I'm to the inner workings of the city is what do you have this agreement and then the fire department itself keeps track of all this stuff in runs this stuff and pays these people\nAre in the you know within the with contain where there's not a centralized yeah yeah they're they're\nTheir own department so\nObviously it goes to the uh treasures office and uh to\nVerify a you know that something's being paid but uh you know reports that given from department heads to the treasury\nAre based on the assumption that the reporting of time uh of employees is accurate\nUm and it's being accurately reflected a minute's sick pay was not being accurately reflected a that's you know\nYeah so that was so nobody in the treasury office or in in ... in the city government outside the fire department is double checking the fire departments work\nWell I mean I don't you know if somebody comes in and they say to their supervisor I had an eight hour shift and I worked eight hours and then you would assume that that's an accurate right a reflection of the time and lost somebody lived out differently and if somebody says that I was out sick and the supervisor signs off that the person was out sick\nYou assume that that's accurately were flat\nRate I'm Talking more about what's not yeah\nI was talking to the right and so I was talking more about the implementation of the contract itself so that's just a fire for anything we're implementing the contract the way we see it and therefore so if you've seen it so this do you expect that this audience\nThat's going to come out of this accounting firm is going to give you a perspective as to whether or not this was done intentionally or not\nJust give you a scope of what was done\nYou know I I that's you know there's a big difference between somebody doing something intentionally as you know Matt and somebody claiming that they were interpreting the contract and the language a different way\nUm so I I'm not going to have to pay one way or the other uh whether the accounting firms a report\nA implies one thing or another I don't I don't know that uh if inaccuracies of fine found that you can that necessarily turns out to be a an intentional matter I think that that's the subject for\nOthers it not the accounting\nFor well who are those others are you is this is\nAll I I Would think ah it would be\nA ministry ration after they get back a report to determine that and there are other branches of government that look into a you know matters of intent that are outside the council obviously I'm a other agencies that look at things\nWould you ... if none of those agencies are none of those in the executive branch in this case does not move forward would you depending on what's in that report be are supportive of of creating a council based resolution to call the state police and to look into this\nI I I have to do is Sherry obligation to the people that I represent
