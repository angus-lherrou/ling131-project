experts we're broadcasting from the ... problem we have the entire team here manning the matter is ending I everybody and I'm Josh well as a form of getting used to and through your entire retirement if you are striving to protect preserve and pass along your money then turn this radio up grab\nYour yoga no pets it's time to talk about Medicare we are addressing\nMedicare part a B C and D we're walking people through exactly how to get it done through retirement this is the insurance you're going to take through your entire life\nAfter you turn sixty five so getting some terms under the table really does matter to your retirement if you are looking to retire gives a team here you go to call we're trying to get you to and through your retirement\nFor one Seventy seven to seven to seven that again is for one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven let's get talking about\nMedicare Josh just dive right into this now when you mentioned that Jay is on assignment all I can pitchers in wearing a trench coat oppressed that taking notes somewhere about taxes\nNo ... we're we're the kind of people that would send Jason out in a hurricane ... and he would either it's like the weather channel he's the guy standing out there like the winds are like eight hundred miles an hour and we say get closer to the poll getting closer and closer to the sea we can't see out there that's that's the kind of assignment\nYes yes that's where you are but ah but let's let's pull back and focus for a second so before the break not sure I can I Know I Know Bob before the break we were talking about what to do with your original Medicare senior party and your heartbeat so I Want to pick up what happens\nAfter you've turned sixty five you've blown up the cake you've gotten your red white and blue card in the mail and you've officially retired and gone into the sunset now we have to pick out\nThe next tier of Medicare right 'cause we've already talked about a and B now we gotta talk about just supplemental your seat in the coverage and that's your regular health care companies like Blue Cross Blue Shield your United\nYeah when you're talking about supplemental let's actually defined that so if you are already retired\nThere are a lot of terms for this there's met a gap there supplemental there's parts see there's all of this is all the same thing if that is super confusing to you and I'm Talking super confusing to give me a call for one\nSeventy seven to seven to seven once again it's four oh one Seventy seven to seven twenty seven twenty seven\nWe will walk you through exactly what that means those are just marketing terms for the combined or supplemental or additional from a and B it's see\nIt's just the additional coverage it is Blue Cross like man he was saying it is United it is the ... the Humanae the you name a company it's out\nThere they're they're trying to sell more so\nWhen it comes down to what plan is right for you there's nine plans out there\nThey're all the same the names are different to protect the the innocent but they're literally the same so when you go buy them find the one that works for you by the services you need not by the alphabetical letter that\nIt that are portrayed you can have a bigger letter doesn't mean it's better for you just find the services you need the one thing I think I Want to talk about the supplemental that comes in the office lot is what if I picked the wrong supplemental Mm I Want to address that for a little bit many\nAnd well actually this is a conversation that I was actually having at one of our dedication meetings I I was talking with Wayne and Kathy last week and as we were sitting down to go through our annual dedication meeting\nThis is different they were both ready to retire this year ... he was finally had enough of the hospitals ready to lead and so our goals to walk through all the time lines of when they switched from being employed to fully retired and so as we were talking they can from their retirement date but they do seem to be as excited about as I Would have expected\nSo I turned to them and they said well is everything okay is this something else we need to cover and they looked at each other for a moment and Kathy spoke first she said I'm worried that our medical coverage won't cover is completely and we won't have the money to pay for it now this is a valid fear\nWhat caffeine and when we're feeling is all baby boomers go through when they realize are actually retiring\nOutside of income medical expenses or the number one for you're heading into retirement so the easiest way to overcome it is to walk in what you need for coverage and then lining up to what your income is going to be and so I looked at them and I said I understand what you're going through let's walk through what your coverage will actually\nBe so once you both retire your primary coverage is going to be original Medicare part a and B this'll be paid directly from your Social Security benefits\nNext we'll be supplemental coverage and that will be your Blue Cross a United and this will fill\nIn what your original Medicare doesn't cover what's your prescriptions and this will be paid with the income we budgeted from your Social Security benefits and you're I erase because we can pick the plans based on your medical history and your needs we can predict the cost of premiums co pays and deductibles last if there's any out of pocket expenses that we talked about that are planned\nFor we have flexible money to be used so it doesn't disrupt your entire income plant as we went through the steps and review the original plan I can see when I gather relax they were actually able to focus on being excited for retirement\nLook here you could financial services\nWe believe knowing exactly how much you can spend every week and retirement is extremely important that you know without a shadow of doubt how much money you have and that will actually last no matter how long you live so we want to make sure that you always get those answers before you retire while there's still time to be prepared so make sure your money last as long as you and your retirement does\nThe team here you could financial services were giving away\nCustomize financial stress tests just for you to take advantage of this off of there were only two of these financial stress tests left so make sure that you are at least fifty five years old and are ready to be ready for retirement and be one of the next two callers right now at four zero one\nSeven to seven to

the New England trucks allusions to the this is talk of him and I am six thirty WPRI accumulation\n[noise] pollens explains or go to New York limo crash kills twenty I'm Christopher cruise Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins said this morning she doesn't think Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when the two were in high school but I\nFound doctor for its testimony to the heart wrenching paying fall compelling and I believe that she believes what she testified to\nI don't think she was coming forward with a political motive although I Do not think that she was treated well I'd buy those who who branched her confidant and\nThis morning Hawaii democratic senator Mazie Hirono told ABC that capital should not be on the court\nTook on the on the Supreme Court with a fish tank and they asked us after has grown and on their part of that stuff that he showed allies I found out and out of a a a ... law\nWe shouldn't have meaning creep with words I mean there are\nPeople going around I said this uh many times and it's it's it's appalling\nPeople go around and they throw the word rape and sexual assault around like those words don't mean anything and uh and they just they just let it mean literally people going around and I don't know if there's anybody in public the like this I'm sure they have I just don't get off the top of my head but you know people talk about this stuff\nUm and they let go Brett Brett Kavanaugh serial rapist watch what\nWhat are you talking about\nI mean do you have any idea the difference between what a rapist is and what this guy's even just been accused of\n\nNot that it's a great thing to do the thing if he was found you know if it was true that he did any of these things not that great but the difference between him and like Bill Cosby what Bill Cosby was convicted of and evidently what are what are your Harvey Weinstein has been accused of all the things he he's a big difference there\n\nBut the modern politics this is what we do we just take one little thing we conflated with a bunch of other things we make one thing stand for everything else and so therefore it's all one big pile of terror\n\nAnd so you know I got to step back and start to understand it's a small example of it but I saw this today and I sit and listen to the audio and over and over and again and you know as far as Trump goes is it very presidential no is this something that he should even be kind of flippant about or be litigating at a at a rally when we're in the\nMidst of this and it's a very delicate negotiations in a delicate process no when you have a I mean he's he's sitting there and they're at a rally where was he yesterday's and Mississippi he's in Mississippi to uh you know obviously red meat crowd Heathrow in red meat to the crowd in Republican circles right now they find doctor for it to be completely\nUm ludicrous in terms of her ... her viability in in in veracity and I will tell you that's on top of that you know this whole Supreme Court nomination has become something of a um [noise]\nIt's it's it's a symbolic victory rather than an actual discussion about whether or not a person would make a good justice you know the idea of being a good justice or not is you know it's it's like second or third on the list\nNow you've created so that's one team versus another and losing is a is a shot and not in not like oh we lost this guy okay we got to find somebody else it's if you lose\nThat's not the worst thing in the world the worst thing in the world that the other side would win and so it's become like this political Rorschach test you can make the cabinet appointment about what ever a horrible thing you want it to be about\nWhether or not it's actually about that doesn't matter it's about whatever you want it to be about whatever your cause celebrities whatever your cause does your is whatever it is you're you're the thing that you're most upset about more angry about it can be whatever you want it to be\n\nBecause you know when somebody says words you can take those words and as long as they're loosely kind of created an loosely connected you can make them out to be whatever it is you want them to be\n\nReading the story with Cory Booker was it yesterday afternoon talking about you know even ultimately I read the court to us from the daily wire\nUltimately not whether he's innocent or guilty this is not a trial said Booker but ultimately have enough questions have been raised that we should not move on to another candidate the people on the Supreme Court or should preserve the integrity of the court and be beyond the report to these difficult partisan times\nHe wants to get rid of the guy now and get a new candidate because there's too much stuff around it\nSo you know to me I'm\nSitting here and I'm watching this old it's it's it's really got into an absurd level everybody's got now I was reading the story of his last night about the uh the FBI investigation that could wrap up at some point today supposedly\nUm and\nYou know they have it usually with this kind of uh things background investigation they give it to a junior agents who are just trying to learn how to get to learn the ropes and do the the\nProper um [noise] uh you know paperwork and things like that\nAnd so what's happening now is they get these guys and they're going out there to get to agents going out there usually be probably be like one now they get to agents is a supervisor because you know God Forbid there going to be they're gonna be crucified no matter what comes out of this thing the question of whether or not they should be made public has been out there\nOr they'll say no it's going to go to the senator's only 'cause that's what they've always done but it'll be leaked it about three Thirteen seconds\nOr and everybody will be able to read it\nOf course it'll just be a bunch of this is what they said this is what was told to us this is the information we found will be no different than we were a week ago today or we could go friday and everyone's going to have to go ahead and decide what they think\nAnd the acrimony the um symbolic nature of the vote will then take its course people will make accusations about what a vote for\nDoes to this person does to the does says about the individual senator they'll they'll use it to deeply divide the people going into the mid term elections and ultimately one of those two parties really to prevail or lose and you and me will be sitting here with the wreckage\nThe social political inter family inter societal wreckage where you know the idea that people walk and we have some form of rape culture in the United states and that you know we put a rapist on the on the Supreme Court without any sort of consideration for evidence or anything like this is going to be now\nCommonly thrown about whether or not that's a reality whether or not it's it's real doesn't matter\nReality doesn't matter\nIt's whatever perception they can hammer into your forehead about an individual about a party about a situation about a person\nWhat actually happened doesn't matter\nIn in this case the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh has now become a a a an eight blocks north ... like everybody knows what it means\nYou don't you think everybody knows what he brushed ... than a blood test you know what do you see and it's like when you're a little kitten you standing lay there and the ground and look up at the sky and you say oh that cloud looks like this that looks like that you can still do that by the way probably not 'cause not a computer screen 'em they probably have an app for that\nBut you laid out to the dog looks like a dinosaur oh really I think it looks like Idaho\nOkay so that's pretty much of this has become it's the patriarchy rape culture\nThat is what it is now though it's there's no evidence that as a matter of having it doesn't matter guilt or innocence doesn't matter it's the it's it's whatever ... whatever for form of of of political manipulation\nWe can achieve on a mass basis that's reality doesn't matter which true or not\nSo you know\nThis is what I see today a you know Donald Trump making a great strategic move with that not really as he mocking a victim of sexual assault that is yet to be determined number one whether or not she actually was or not\nOr you know I tend to believe somebody says they are because those types of things are very serious and I think it only took a deprived human beings to lie about them but some people live on them so it happens um and on top of that you know sitting there and and making fun of somebody would make it funny was poking holes in the argument haggling me here sorry\n\nThat's the way I see it you want to look at the block and tell me what you see my phone numbers for three eight WNPR oh the toll free number one eight hundred three two one WPRI this portion of the show sponsored by guilt appliances hills appliances Columbus Day sale September twenty six through October tenth and joined basing saving showrooms are personal in Middletown or online and kills appliances dot com\nAnd I have people on Facebook saying that you're always anti Trump and I got other people calling saying come on Matt wake up he was mocking her\n\nSo there you go let's look at the ... together you and I we can sit down and can analyze each other's insanity flush toilets flatulence as well speaking of which\nOf of him anyway not of which I'm next hour Kim calling in from channel twelve going to join us I Want to know she came as close as I can tell from anybody else to actually seeing face to face the person who may have called shell the White House's office about beating and Brett Kavanaugh\nKind of like somebody who's seen big foot that's coming up in the matter and she'll stay right there\nSouthern New England weekends on TALK six thirty seven FM W. A. R. O. these [laughter] these days on a lunch of all families on the radio Saturday mornings at eleven AM\nAt the White House seen since you about whether or not they they do is this like the by rote thing they do offer me comes when he was voted on we don't do any sort of work on Iran to determine whether or not legit we just for that and that's it\nSo he and he expressed to me that he thought he had done the proper thing you know I got this complaint we wanted to make sure that was bought for the proper channels and he was frustrated and upset that it had been sort of a bird right before it was properly\nThat's why I wanted an apology because he said to to to put this stuff out there with the identifying or the ability to identify the Twitter account anyway right on right that was something that wasn't a problem because this guy was just a regular guy was just a regular constituents is\nRight and and if you've seen the transcripts you know that his name is redacted from your transcript but those are the ... and the Twitter bio are are identifiable um and as we also know from that Twitter account this man has said publicly we're attracted a story that he supposedly told us that are White House so\nUm it's been an interesting thought I got to try and thought well I I Wish that ah someone ah preferably me to talk to this\nGuy [laughter] I have a person that I was\nThe one outside of your door you know I think he had an interesting story to tell a regardless of what that story it\nYeah I mean it seems so\nAssuming that you know obviously\nThere is that that Twitter feed Twitter name belongs to him and that he was the one who made the phone call um the the ... the name of the door and the Twitter name match\nYeah yeah that's about all we know so somebody using that name has at the same name as a person who lives in that apartment\n[noise] it's like you know actually we really need a human [laughter] yes has\nForward and say hello to me yes that's my Twitter account yes and the same person who called senator White House right now it's all sort of you know we're trying to connect the dots um but I think it\nYou know we haven't really been able to pin that down yet and until we have a person of board um and and talk to us face to face a I don't think we can ever really know for sure\nI'm even though all signs point yes that at this person a this Rhode Island ban is connected with his Twitter account and with that complaint that with me\nAnd being a dog a reporter that we know you are you've obviously tried other messages well I Would imagine right to try and get some kind of confirmation of connection to this guy to no avail though huh\nYeah yeah of course I mean like I said we we tried calling him an an emailing him we've looked on social media for relatives or some of whom have responded to us but\nUh some of them have and and it's been a it's been really tricky to even try and break through a I think the closest that we've gotten again it's just going to the department knowing that he called down to his supervisor and said I don't want to talk of the media which to me is a good sign that were on the right track of of someone who\nIs not confused about why the news is outside of his door\n... right right okay yeah because ultimately if you're if you're confused you open the door and go what's this all about right\nSo a ... who are you what are you doing here [laughter]\n... facts may may seem as though that this might be the person who did it and we just don't know why\n[noise] oh right right and that's really why we went and knock on his door because by the time friday morning both around he had already seemingly taken to the Twitter account and said the story I told is not true um I've been getting them boarded with sweet\nAnd so what we really wanted to do with not question the validity of his story anymore but\nQuestion him on why he felt it was necessary to make that kind of call and\nRight and if people can recant stores for all different reasons right does not for me because it was made a mistake or it wasn't true it could be I made a mistake by even bringing this up is now part of this morass that I Want nothing to be part of you know I don't want any part of it so I when I mean over my head and I want to get out and um\nSo it's interesting All right so I Know this far as I knew you were the only one that actually tried to get a face to face with that person in terms of\nPhysically being there that you talked about it publicly anyway I'm sure other people maybe you've tried so I wanted to kinda see where you were in and um and so you're still available should the person who want to reach out and talk to the lady who knocked on his door\nAbsolutely lady who was at your door if you if you wanna get in touch with me I can just do on Twitter\nIf that's convenient [laughter] so yeah I think I think he has an important an interesting story to tell you just get it as the if he's willing to tell it\nCan thank you for everything I appreciate it thanks Matt or ... a\nGentleman channel twelve sleep you know is this a situation where the simplest explanation is the correct one right don't use of this to me early today is usually the simplest is the simplest explanation is that is the right one\nGuy call center White House in the White House's here if you want to go tell your story you know it's in your story of to the kid to the committee they're gonna investigated\nAnd just in case you want to go ahead and tell the media about this go right ahead here soon so and then you know whatever\nUm\nAnd then for whatever reason this person and he could be a very viable explanations person doesn't um [noise]\nSee I was when I was wondering if we couldn't find anybody if nobody's come forward nobody you know is this is a person who's who's phone number was was on you know wrongly assigned\nOn the Internet\nAnd we don't even know there is no picture on the Twitter feed is nothing like this was this person even a real person who was just somebody screwing around on the Internet now the Kim's been to adore someplace in ...\nWith the guy's name that matches the Twitter account on the front door it leads a little bit more credibility to the fact that there might be actually a human being behind this now what they were trying to achieve if anything is still the mystery is this is one of those things where somebody has a memory and they go oh\nThis must have been the same thing and then realizes later on oh no that was not it was somebody trying to pull a prank or somebody's trying to get involved in something you know people do there are so I'm not saying this happening here but then some kids situations people actually tried to go ahead and get involved in things that they're not involved in\nOrder to get attention to to be able to you know puzzle chaos or whatever reasons that they have\nBut um you know the idea that some of the White House is now seems person should get an apology or something like this to me\nUm you know when you if you make a a you know when somebody says hey we can't something I made a mistake to me that is you know they they screwed up and they made a false allegation\nIt doesn't have to mean that that's what I take it is and\nSo for me this has become now part of this uh this Kavanaugh um [noise]\nYou know do do they call the last hour the or the ink blot test right there ... test where you know ultimately my mind on your mind goes is that there's partisan politics at work here and that you have either somebody who's a willing volunteer or somebody's ... knowing a participant\nA partisan war between the Democrats and Republicans when it comes to the Supreme Court justice and if there's anybody on this earth we can say is a virulent partisan it Sheldon Whitehouse and as Bob ... points out the other day\nIf you're going to sit there and talk about uh in in in in a an offer of people who complain\nMedia contacts and you can order reporters um you're you're I Would say that you are in my mind back to what I think your motivations can be called into question and all sorts of\nFashion the right wing outrage machine

these jobs and then I'll just let these guys kicked the living crap out of each other which is exactly\nWhat happened oh my goodness if you have comments about the um [noise]\nThe Senate the development I'm not going to exclude them from the shower although I Would like to I'd like to move the conversation to last night's channel twelve debate\nA bulletin this debate was viewed by more than ... by about double\nThe normal television debate audience it had an average six household rating and I'm told in the last half had a seven and a half household wearing bits of rating point and\nI'm gonna tell you exactly what that means in this market it's a round figure about sixty five\nHundred households parading point so you do the math on that at the end there were nearly fifty thousand homes that were glued to this thing and you know over the course of of\nOf the evening and then that that doesn't mean fifty thousand people there's a lot of people watch TV in pairs in threes and fours a there could have been\nNear a hundred thousand people watching that they that debate last night\n[noise] which is again I that's my interpretation that's not any representation of channel twelve or whatever um but I Do believe the six household rating in the seven point five reading are accurate there overnight um [noise] you know I work during sometimes and get this into\nA that's a big big number they were in the debate was the number one show in its time slot last night\nFrom seven eight which again is pretty phenomenal based on a lot of the people just like to watch entertainment television sports television and there was this little thing called the cabinet hearing that was wreaking havoc in America last night so kudos to channel twelve for its image marketing an execution ... she did the usual terrific job\nUm and Joe ... no doubt in my mind\nOne man's opinion I don't know why I feel like after qualify that big you guys you get an you you guys are getting chip here in ... out there these days so I figure [laughter] so I figured I'd just say this you know let me go let me state the obvious there's this one man's opinion behind a microphone on a radio show take it for what it's worth\nI bet you judge will agree at three or four or five points last night\n\nI bet you grab three or four or five points last night now you can say you grew up to four or five points from seven you can see grab three or four or five points from sixteen you're just as it has to call them Johnson ... joke a\nI think ... true low is only going to get tougher in the channel tend to abate maybe channel six debate and I'm sure as hell hoping that we're having one here I'm a stay tuned\nUh\nBut I think his effort there last night is going to carry some weight now if you put some money into this race raises or puts his own dough into this race I think he has a chance to be formidable and change the dynamics of the whole thing\nBut if he's going to hope that his performances and debates in some uh some other wacky types of terrestrial I I should say I'm guerilla marketing I I think he's pulling himself and has two or as to reevaluate this whole thing\nUm but let me tell you something I'm looking at the debate last night and I'm thinking that one's fun just can't he just can't get it\nDone\nCliches\nThirty eight studios reliance I mean ... is the weakest thing I've ever\nSeen is that all you got brother and at the end\nUm I don't want to show my wife out because she's she's not very political\n\nShy so my wife uh he's driving on right now for more than ... leave me out of this thank you very much you idiot\nBut I'm going to sell around even she sheds\nA I didn't ask you to grab this one did I ask you read this one at the end the insider remark do you have that with all this stuff at the end Alex I mean you've got a lot of great audio were charged today that you should be pointed at the end you know\nThis is what we don't need a couple of insight as\nTo think you're kidding Alan Cranston for two terms you play the insider game like no wonder\nThe same operators\nThat she wants that you would like to watch for your campaign or working for others or you're drilling over them are complaining you\nSwim in the same circles and nobody\nBuys it nobody\nAround here is plainly oh insider ... there's no constituent in Rhode Island that has a consciousness over insider outsider the same old tire cliches it is just it's like what you stop\nStop\nBut he's got nothing that he's got nothing to deliver\nTo agree with ... on a handful of things but it I mean he just read the authentic you may say bombastic no doubt\nA little over the top a little ah excited about getting some more action yeah for the most part he sounds like a guy that's like a you know what let me ... all my sleeves up and fix things\nOh just fix things\nAnd she is her she is she she stuck\nAnd as long as these guys swim underneath her she's happy as a pagan\nMud right you find it the inside of thing you're going to be ... good\nYou know we don't need more state house insiders like miss the Grillo and especially not even in this election for governor isn't about what's going on in Washington DC as people want to frame it [laughter] it's about what's going on in Washington park in West Philly sitting with Zach with\nWe'll end on the context of the ... the insiders ...\nCome out with that is it really does is the this this like all the little cliches not listening All right let's jump sold out and I'm probably going to be in trouble and I go\nBut it was just one person's gut reaction by the way she doesn't have she doesn't have any predisposition about the candidate and she's just going on really\nWhat this is science thing right\nAnd so remind do kind of ... about a couple of things but she said\nWell you know true low didn't have all the answers\nOn the ... thing they all fail cello and falling have ... ... they're they're full of crap neither one of them had any idea how to solve this situation and remind do booted it so that's not a gubernatorial issue\nFor three eight zero is the number of building Johnston you're on WNPR oh hello\n[noise] [noise] [noise] oh and yes bill you All right everything okay yeah I'm not saying All right let's step\nUm\nYou know I like the fact that they get right into it although true was kinda like a wallflower for the first three or four minutes\nMaybe five I could tell he was going to bust [noise]\nBut it wasn't hurting them because there was nothing really going on between the two\nUh\nWhen I see nothing going on I Want to come away listen I Want to come away from gubernatorial or even president to the beach\nWith a with a feeling\nOf purposeful miss an identity\n\nA feeling of purpose fullness and identity\nWe're are you taking me where are you taking me\n\nAnd what is your stretch I laugh when I see what is your strategy because I've told you this before I have a friend all great friend of mine who were used to uh worked for a Japanese company\nAnd he's a sales guy and he used to complain all the time that he would have meetings and and he would be called into these meetings for the boss and and the ... sponsored the\nRichard what is your strategy what is your strategy\nAnd and he would [laughter]\nIt's like well I'm trying to sell it to this guy who's got yes but what is your strategy it's like I look at the I look at these debates and I and I want to know what ... what is your strategy I mean I Know Gina Raimondo strategy I I Know it she's gonna she's picking winners and losers economically\nRight\nShe's she's gonna she's going to ride this sucker out she's going to be the changes you but you know what after four years you're now the status quo so you've got to give us something more and she's got nothing more to give she's just holding onto this thing she'll be gone and\nTwo years especially if they flip it down there should at least you'll find some thing to do in Washington or hook up with uh the former mayor of New York and they'll start their two year\nUm you know presidential bid in twenty twenty two\nYeah the only thing which was what\nDoes it twenty one's going you know should we go in her mind you began in her mind should be done in the Carolinas you'll be gone and Washington she can't wait to get the hell out of here and I I just see it all over his feel it\n\nYou know and Alan's just like I Want to be the\nGuy I\nWant to be like I mean it's not going to be the governor\nOkay I Know you want to be\nYou know you should shut\nUp over there you know I don't mind and\nBy the way the corruption thought stuffer Cranston is a non starter I mean he had big police troubles over there he's over there was the last election\nSo Gina trying to put corruption on an fungus that is a is a complete non starter I blame I mean\nHe fixed it he thinks he's got a good chief leaving for that leave him alone but the thing not sing and true\nWas it was an all those good guy I'm a smart guy I Know how the inside the government works I'm going to go in there and I'm going to take no prisoners and I'll be the number but nobody and so what the hell that is what his hold that just think someone will get all three of them I say\nWell you know what what do I want\nRight now voting for Trump to change\nI mean if that would actually bring something am I going okay you know whatever\nYou want to\nBe I Want to be my guy I Want to be the that's it\nChris you're on your own [laughter]\nAnd what kind of slow it was that\nThat's how I see it out for\nA while and other underwhelming display feuding adolescence um there there was nothing inspirational there was no and the\nInnovation present there there was you know nothing of value to the voter in what we could anticipate would either operational style government\nHowever I Will tell you a ... it was interesting because truly was bringing it and the number the rating number one from a six household there was seven and a half which means that people didn't get bored which means ... got their attention which means ... had to move up\nWell well ... are up to the course of will suffer so yes I like watching a traffic accident but self to fiction as Rhode Island and be man and his unbridled love for Trump I don't think really helps them in regard to Mr fun he's consistently been Allen's lightning\nAnd I've always had the impression of Alan Kurdi the double a pitcher attempting major league ball and he doesn't have the stuff\nSo if you go like an adult and a sports metaphor\nYeah yeah sure he's just he's just he's just bringing a eighty mile an hour straight fastball that's it\nExactly yeah but it got no change of not a and I you know\nWhat you mean she's which means she's going to win this thing in a walk absolutely I make disagree with Seventy percent of again as a\nI'm a political ideology and certainly sixty percent of what she claims to be victories are totally erroneous but in her silence she seemed gubernatorial\nAbsolutely did did she she couldn't stop smiling lead you to if we take a look I'm going to do this we'll take a look at the the debate for years ago or her smile was nervous smile\nLast night she was ... I actually read it out I ended up something like ... standing in the middle east will go and go Joe it's your birthday it's your birthday go joke\nBecause she was she she was enjoying herself because she had nothing to worry about\nShe was the teacher who hold monitor and the school cafeteria and she was watching the food supply and smile\nWithout a doubt without a doubt and I don't know I don't know what's\nGoing to change that Chris thanks for three eight zero toll free one eight hundred three two one zero what's going to change that\nI don't know what's going to change is I I don't know I I don't know I don't know what rabbit Ellen phone's gonna pull out of his hat\nThat gives me a sense of purpose in identity for for his campaign and the ... especially if we're if we're if we're looking at this campaign from a people\nPoint of view you know\nWhat does he stand for you know there may there's good reason why he didn't want to debate in the primary season because he sucks at it\nHe sucked at it he's terrible at it\nHe he can't find a place of comfort and he can't find a place\nTo to just say All right look\nI'm going to command the floor for a couple of minutes and you're going to listen and you're going to understand and you're going to visualize a different Rhode Island with me you just can't do it let me hit some ceiling in moments I'm not saying that he can't put two words together I mean he's the city mayor Cranston\nThat's why I say he's a C. plus ... none of none another failure I mean it downgraded I'm from be managed to see plus\nThe last week that's my that's my Moody's rating for C. plus\nIn June and you have to read run a different scale because she is the governor and she's got six million dollars and I'll tell ya they put out they put out Warren piece today I mean they're they they they're despicable people running the Raimondo a campaign despicable despicable\nBut I got to give them credit\nRaimondo clear winner tonight's debate and then a fact check for every assertion that song made every I mean this is how many of these ... or there's like ten of them\nI mean they went and they work their tails off overnight and dished out you know under what they consider to be the ... the debate fact jak by the way\nFrom the trucks illusions loose on whenever I'm a I'm six thirty WPRI accumulation [noise]\nKevin ... record meeting with North Korea I man came by Kavanaugh begins his first day tomorrow is a U.S Supreme Court justice answer after bruising confirmation fight Ohio governor John Capetown CNN's State of the union that the country must move on it's\nNot about ... matter of happy I mean he's on the Supreme Court we have to respect the fact that the Senate made that decision or we have two people who I deeply respect Murkowski and Collins two Republican senators have sought differently I have not had a chance to read that report as have the rest of Americans but the decision has been made\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo has had a face to face session much North Korea's Kim Jong on correspondent Alexander ... reports the U.S will compare notes with South Korean leader\nMay have been very much engaged with the idea of talks between the U.S North Korea and of course brokering the talks when they have come to an impasse over the last few months so they are very much going to be motivated by any signs of progress and certainly we're hearing some indication of progress from secretary of state Mike Pompeo who seemed to be characterizing this trip that successful to some extent\nWhat might that impact be on your portfolio\nIf you save two hundred thousand or more for your retirement our number here is for one three three three eight thousand easy and I'm going to remember three three three eight thousand\nYou're not calling a one eight hundred who knows where number you're talking to local people right here in the ... state of Rhode Island\nAnd you are right Jeff talk about an easy number to remember you've had that number a long time now yeah very long time\nFor zero one three three three eight thousand and the website if you'd like to learn a bit more about Jack and his team simply go too nasty and money dot com you mentioned you'd help people take a look at their mix in their portfolio in your estimation Jeff what would an ideal next look like\nOf course it is subjective to each a client that we're working with because everybody's situation is different\nYou know I Know that might sound cliche to our listeners a little bit but everybody really does have some little thing that is different from other people and so we always make sure that we Taylor what we do specifically so the couple that were working with or individual that we're working with the help them achieve their their financial goals for retirement\nSo that makes it really depends on the overall goal\nLook at a time when we look at overall makeup of the financial portfolio and then how comfortable is the person we're working with with risk you know the\nMore conservative or more aggressive type or we're on the relative to the final workday so to speak with a ... you know go through that door of retirement you know expecting a whole life change there at that point\nSo the closer you get to retirement just in general you ought to become more and more conservative because at that point if you're say within five years of retirement\nAnd that's just a general rule of thumb that I use if you're within five years of retirement you really need to dial down your risk so that you don't give up money either just before retirement or worse right after retirement when you have started to draw from that\nInvestment bucket if you will\nAnd because that is the worst thing that could happen we call that the sequence of returns\nI'm simply put if you retire and the market tanks and you're drawing from that investment you're making that value go down even faster and then you have less than that bucket to recover with when the market ultimately comes back in the future\nSo it's so important to circle the wagons around your money as you get closer to retirement to avoid any big drops in the market because that to me is the worst thing that can happen to so there's a lot of different things that goes into building that portfolio what is most important is that\nYou have a manager

A. S. S. E. Y. nasty on many\nDot com jak and I are discussing some of those what apps and worrisome scenarios that could turn your retirement hopes and dreams upside down and we're getting you ways to help protect your retirement savings against those what at\nWhat the next what if that bring us some concern\nWell that would be what if Social Security benefits get reduced in the future you know that is not a very happy thought for anybody to think about\nWild Social Security's financial outlook\nHas certainly some uncertainty they're\nCurrently we can we predict the benefits may be lower than expected\nThe reduction in benefits can be contributing to what's called the worker to beneficiary ratio today which is only about three to one when compared to a ratio about Fifteen or sixteen to one in the early years of the program\nNo it was signed into being in Nineteen thirty five but it really didn't get implemented and started until around Nineteen thirty nine or so\nThe reason why we like to make the most of the benefits even if it turns out to be a little bit lower than expected is because it's guaranteed by the federal government and with that guaranteed income we liked it to cover as much of our essential expenses you know those housing food transportation health care\nAs much of that is possible now this helps protect our retirement from a number of risk that we've touched on today\nSo how do we maximize our benefits then\nYou know many American style retirement at age sixty two because it's the earliest stage they can start collecting Social Security benefit\nHowever this may not be the best course of action for everybody\nNow you might be asking why not I want to enjoy my retirement as soon as possible well first Medicare the health coverage doesn't become available to until your age sixty five\nNow if you're one of the fortunate people that can work at sixty two and have your former employer pay that health care expense until sixty five well that's certainly in your favor but a lot of folks that don't have any health insurance\nYou know that could cause some eight nine hundred thousand dollars a month for each person until eight sixty five well that's a big drawdown of assets that a lot of people really can't afford to do you know and secondly\nYou know how much savings you really have set aside to general expectation is to replace and this is all over the billboard magazine as you know to replace Seventy to Ninety percent of your annual pre retirement income with your own savings into your Social Security benefits\nYou know are you ready to do that for two decades maybe more you know it and those kind of weird measurement upsets his before that you know when I'm preparing to do a seminar I Will look at the obituaries and just count the number of people that are each Ninety or above\nAnd when I did that just recently there were six people that were over the age of Ninety the Elvis was Ninety seven so as a society we are absolutely living longer so you don't want to have what we call an ostrich plan\nYou know sticking your head in the sand going up that's not going to happen to me I'll be okay you want to have a well thought out plan so that you can build\nSome income that you can be assured of that will last for the rest of your life and we are able to do that with certain insurance based products\nNow those are assurances and guarantees are always backed up by the claims paying ability of that insurance companies so we always want to work with solid or you know financially solid companies\nSo although many people will take their benefit early most of us should probably consider waiting until your full retirement age which for most was the sixty six if you were born in Nineteen sixty or after its age sixty seven and if that makes sense for you and only the map will tell us that\nPotentially defer taking your benefit until late seventies now that does not work for everybody but it can be useful and helpful for some\nOf the benefit of waiting beyond your full retirement age is that for each year that you defer you receive another eight percent so if you end up if you're a full retirement age of sixty six you can get thirty two percent more money by waiting until late Seventy now keep in mind you've left that benefit on the table for four years\nSo you get a higher benefits sunny and Seventy ... there's a payback period for you to\nKind of catch up with the money you left on the table between eight sixty six in Seventy and that's why I say it's all about the math and we have the analysis tools that we do to show people what that might look like\nWell needless to say trying to determine what I refer to as a sweet spot for you and if you're married for you and your spouse on Social Security is what makes the most sense for you are a number of years for one three three three eight thousand if you have questions about upcoming decisions on Social Security\nAnd because in if you haven't started your benefits yet that's the best time to do it you can undo your benefit if you haven't received twelve checks so maybe it's worth it even if you've been on it for just a short time to see if maybe there was a better way of strategizing\nUltimately put more money in your pocket between you and your spouse potentially our number here against for one three three three eight thousand if you have questions about Social Security police costs will have one of our advisors chat with you to see if we might be able to help you\n... if you'd like to learn more about him his team his brand new book head over to ... on money dot com at N. A. S. S. E. Y. Massey and money dot com get let's say there is a gap in coverage are there other sources and guaranteed income that we can be considering\nYeah anytime that there's a gap between the income that you have coming in and your lifestyle expense you know it's important to try to fill that with some other form of guaranteed income so very natural fit for that\nIn the wall Street Journal talks about this a lot just to use an annuity that will be able to guarantee that pay out for the rest of your life\nNow that being said there are many different ways of doing that so many different types of products to do that with\n... there was an old car commercial I think it was a dodge and they they said this is not your daddy's Dodger I forgot what the car was but let's just say was dodge just like that the old cars are far different than the new cars of today they've advance so much the same thing is happening in the annuity industry\nNow there are two major types this variable annuities which I Do not care for\nTheir it's too often that we call these companies signed with the fees are people who are paying two per cent three plus percent four percent it gets to be very outrageous in my opinion when you don't need to spend that kind of money to get that kind of a benefit their better and less expensive ways of doing it and that's where the fixed annuities come into play\nNow a lot of people have misconceptions about annuities and it's really unfortunate\nBecause in the right place a portion let me repeat a portion of your money\nShould be considered for an annuity because of what it can provide you it can provide you safety against stock market downturns it can provide you're guaranteed lifetime income you can't get that anywhere else but in those types of guaranteed insurance products\nBecause guarantees are always by the claims fang ability of that insurance company so you want to work with a good company now our listeners they might be real sharp with what they're doing but\nYou cannot go directly to an insurance company and buy a product you have to go through an advisor so it just makes sense that you work for the professional because then you've got to everybody you know as a as a professional taking it like having arrows and your quiver\nI have a lot more arrows and Mike wherever then you have access to\nBecause of our licensing that allows us to do certain things that you as an individual can't do so it's important to work with a professional that you feel comfortable with that you feel you can trust you know ask your friends who are they working with get a referral\nOr give us a call we'd be happy to give you a second opinion as to what your uh current advisors has been doing and are you on the right track and you might very well be and on occasion we do an analysis and we say you know what you're in great shape you may be tweak this week that but you're good to go", "show_name": "The Matt Allen Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "07"}
