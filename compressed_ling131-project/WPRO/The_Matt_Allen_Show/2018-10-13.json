Joe ... made that happen\nMore three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one W if you if you disagree with me call but I'm telling ya that's what's gonna happen and that's whose fault it it's the visit more Steve you are on the drum up when Joe\nOh John how are you a month to that though\nIt's it's pretty obvious I mean it's it's ... fault and people need to understand that Joe ... is actively promoting Gina Raimondo being re elected because he knows he can't win Patricia Morgan who's no do knows he can't win but she's all over Twitter saying vote for the whole picture of overture though she needs to change that has\nTo have to vote for Gina vote for ... because that's one of the new one\nI Know it's it's cutting off their nose to spite the\nSpikes my face you cut off to know about your own damn face but don't cut off my nose is big enough as it is but that's not the problem\nI have a court when gene called and before I wanted I wanted\nTo ask a question sure he had he has the director on every well used to have the director on every Thursday I as the director right Peter out meeting him\n... weeks ago somebody called and asked about the Natick a bridge in in a war of grass and it says why are we doing this again\nIt was done in two thousand Thirteen but seven million dollars and give it all the structural integrity or why are we doing it again right and he said uh I'll get back to you next week\nNext week I'm listening to the show gene comes out and says oh we're not going to do as a director until after the election\nAnd I I'm of San Diego [laughter] what what has won't have to do what they are well I mean I guess that I'm ingenious trying to be monitored on what is the answer the question I called he's only I mean it wasn't really to tell you [laughter] if that\nWere being done that doesn't mean they're all over the bridge is being done that don't need it just because they wanted the money or more\nWell you know I mean I don't know what to tell you but I'm all I can suggest as the to touch base with DOD and and uh both memory I Will be successful\nYeah exactly exactly and chickens will fly you thanks for the call appreciate it more three eight nine seven seven six eight under three two one WBFO I mean ladies and gentlemen it doesn't make me happy to tell you this in fact it makes me deeply troubled but you are basically if you're supporting jokes real oh you\nAre supporting Gina Raimondo and that's a fact that the fact that in it's not my opinion it's not it's it's a bold fact\nAnd I just wish that these Republicans that are all over Facebook and all over Twitter would be honest and say we support Gina Raimondo\nInstead of this ridiculous hashtags joke furlough for governor joke Grillo can not win even if you gave him the higher Seventeen percent that he got into go local poll which I think is is off I I think my eleven point or ten point one I think I came up with\nA whereas I got to look it up here I did all his homework that a lot of homework I'm homework guy uh can't find out here to ah\nThe number I came up with which I think is a little bit more accurate is Joe ... lives in probably ten point seven\nThose your balance on votes pure and simple\nOr and if you get some of the undecideds is thirty percent undecided to break his way we don't have to put up with another four years of Gina Raimondo but because of people like Patricia Morgan a joke fellow we do thank you Patricia Morgan thank you drove furlough four more years of Gina Raimondo bombs in North Smithfield Bob you are on the John Cho\nHey John how are you today good thanks how are you right back your I agree with your family or am I waiting the selection yep cars cars are shrill oh\nYes yes I'm ... right\nBut but here's something that I I really wonder about why all the effort to combat governor of the state of Rhode Island doesn't have any real our\nActually it does uh it's got more power than than you realize a and and I would just stick to just if you don't think it does drive down to south county drive under ... ...\nWell because the rest of the ... go in right after election day ah and then it's not long before we start told and cars which is what she talked about you know a lot of people just got overlooked by the media\nUm for first budget she did a press avail in in the press avail she said we talked about a lot of things like totally cars all over the state so that's what they want to do and because of Joe ... and Patricia Morgan and all these other so called Republicans that's what's gonna happen and that's the people you need to think\nBut John attacked by all of that to happen\nOf course but if you're the governor you can put a lot of pressure on the speaker the house and that's how the separation of powers past which they didn't want a that's how the number of things now so yes the governor is not as powerful but it's powerful enough to get a lot of damage done throughout I'm an ex only are\nWe still make a Republican and not on a cell phone or\nAlan ... may not be perfect I get that I get a lot of people don't like them a lot of people have problems with Alan ... I Will tell you as I live and breathe I Would rather have Allen Fung for the next four years then Gina Raimondo for the next four years Alan phone is not going to try and research locals zoning\nFor social justice reason Allan Fung is not going to hold my car is I drive around the state\nAllen phone is not going to to pad the state payroll and come up with more ridiculous ways to spend so that we can get to ten billion dollars he may not be perfect but he's a heck of a lot better than what we're facing thanks to you Joe drill Oh thank you Bye bye machine to call Sandy is it more Sandy you're on the jump off the show\nI ... a good afternoon or good afternoon\nI'm my husband and I were both\nTrailer support is till about a week and a half ago now we are absolutely vote in far flung\nHe's you know he's not perfect I mean\nI Know now I Know when they're not perfect but I Do not we do not\nWant ... we just don't like ...\nYeah well and it's it's a way I put it is if you had to cross the Mojave Desert and you had a choice between a bicycle and Hyundai which would you pick\nExactly I'll take the Hyundai I'll take the Hyundai [laughter] absolutely well driller just took the gas out of the Hyundai\nWell they don't want I think Joe ... and the white jokes\nTo I've known him for I literally I sat next to them for six years in the general assembly\nClaiming some very very nice man he is an intelligent but I feel great now he's acting like a child of about six years\nOld he's blinded by them some hatred that he has for for Alan fun and he's willing to take it out on you Sandy and me and Linda for more enriching from summer well not from summers that but you know people from everywhere on the state of Rhode Island by doing as to four more years of Gina Raimondo that's how petite this man is\nWell that's that's another reason why we we've talked and talked about it and we that's another reason why we do want him as our governor I Hope people wake up John\nI I doubt they will ah but I Do to make you any regime to call\nI mean it it really is he's going to be joked pillows fault and they need to understand that\nUh and I love these Republicans that are out there saying well you just you should have picked a better candidate yeah maybe but I'll take Alan ... every day all day and twice on Sunday to Gina Raimondo for four more years I don't need social justice I don't need a progressive agenda I don't need ... all over the state\nIn Allen phone may not be perfect but I'm telling you right now is I live and breathe\nFurlough is going to be responsible Regina being reelected and you need to understand that and if you're like so thick headed they say well he's a real Republican opponents fine go vote for Joe ... but when you walk in that polling place and you cross the filling the little bubble next to Joan ... realize that you re electing Gina Raimondo just know that\nAnd if you're OK with that if you're OK with re electing Gina Raimondo then by all means both for junk fellow all you want\nLet's grab Richard in Somerset Richard I wish I lived in Somerset you're going to jump in Loveland show\nUp 'cause we got to grab Richard ... they are gotcha\nYeah John all what I'm Wondering about the stroller too I mean I was a Rhode Island are all my life as seven years ago I match but um [noise]\nCan't but what do you can do is you can keep him from being governor you won't you\nDon't you think this is a in some in cahoots with Gina because of the judge ship for the stepdaughter\nI don't I don't have any information on that in fact I mean you could be right Tom you could very well be right I I don't know I don't know I Would if I were Allen I Would ask them in the next debate and I thought it would add a point blank is\nVery says why were they all started becoming independent oh\nHas he hates Allen falling and he hates you Tom you\nHate you [laughter] and I hated him he he wants you to suffer through four more years of Gina Raimondo that's what he might have been like in ...

Mike welcome dying of my\nBack illicit every week and I found him\nI just like jump in on what the element of that and about a reminder believe me I'm not are among those and I want her out\nWe know you're not by the late ...\nThat that that was not in the stadium were costing the state power through going down our yes that we had up on that\nSo why wait want a better word that what that Fox is funny I ... in the face by going ... to be quite honest\nBut I you know what I ... I listen I have a tendency to agree with you I don't think the states should have got involved in a partnership I mean it's all said and done it's going to wisdom anyways but I've been saying for years that they were going to listen to me and my counterpart he had that argument weekly and they said they were going\nThrough their going but I think you are right now they they were going because I was ... was in Portland and\nNow what ... ... why would they want I myself I'm not a big sports fan but why would you want a bomb in the bay in Rhode Island why and what you want the Boston Red Sox the big bomb in in that you're the one\nI'm I'm I think it was a tradition here don't forget now you know on one thing when the mind when ... mom door on that okay um the state loan the money to read a rehab the stadium everybody knows that that was public knowledge he paid back to one and it in the sixties and seventies and eighties there was a good venue to take the boy scouts outings everything else like that\nPeople had those tickets you going to give them away a lot of times I right now and and and you know a friend walked McLaughlin prime example Walter always said won't have the best he could see the house he\nWas one of the all the second season ticket holders are right and then we'll have to say my God you start from trying to give them away yeah and and the traditional now the younger generation doesn't attend the events they don't go to sports of of even major league baseball right now as a declining enrollment\nYou know and like I like that\nBut when I was trying to say is the cost to take the child or a family to a sports event right now because of the salaries of a hundred plus dollars a ticket\nAnd then you got it for ... for a couple of days ago to Fenway you got a five hundred dollar bills for the day fifty sixty bucks to park your car out to dinner the whole I don't a lot of people can't afford that so\nBut you know like on another guy to understand now when they had all the hiring please put it in Rhode Island if Iran we could not all of them and they don't want to stay\nRight and that was my point I\nI I I Can't I Can't I I I'm not a die in the world but you can't sell\nLike you'll get Bill a prominent like ball but now you don't want to bring in five is right and I don't know that well\nThat's what I say it's only finished when it's going so that that five hundred dollar bills to Fenway you think the cheaper alternative to take a kid to a ball game would have been the boss sucks\nRight right but they going to get more than twenty five hundred people in that stadium and then they got this somebody watches uh the movie with Kevin Kevin Costner they build it and they will come with a ball field right and and I think I think that they're gonna put me in malls and restaurants that are like listen I'll ended on this note\nThe hero in this whole thing is Don gravity and I got to give that guy granted because he went to bat for city just like CNC did\nUnfortunately he lost the team he didn't get what he needed but you know you got to commend the guy for standing up for what he did\nYou know but Bob thanks for the call we appreciate all we have time for Joe in Providence welcome to the show joke enough of them\nAre you doing guys on politics nap island south politics not okay\nSo I grew up you know started going to school in Nineteen fifty one and we think we can see your ... your ... and ... there are just\n...

O. one eight hundred three two one WPRI oh no here we are all\nMy college course Maxwell [noise]\nAll right so we're back with independent mayoral candidate for Providence a\nDuty Whitman we went to to break a I started discussing a journal editorial piece\nBy David talent who's running for a promise city council\nAnd a duty as I was saying he ... he wrote a very thoughtful and I think something of a provocative piece on a you know with this near brush with the school bus a issue in the striking\nYou know what the longer term issues here do we start looking I Know the first and foremost on on your genders may would be Mitt to cities of prominence in the ... the the streets are much safer in in light of what's happened recently\nUh obviously that plays into this conversation but\nAre we to relying upon buses and you know he he writes here why on earth are nine thousand students riding the bus when every one of them lives within walking distance to a neighborhood elementary and middle school now I I Know we I walked to school you probably walk to school making\nIt's a different world and we were talking about an urban a place where you don't necessarily want kids ... walking certain distance but do we really need to look at\nThe whole from a holistic three cells are for the point of view are we are we becoming too reliant on every little kid getting picked up by a school bus I Know I travelled to high school buses and it's almost like they stop it every house nowadays so your thoughts there\nOh I'm so glad you brought that up David may have taken that from ... my plate book I've been talking about that ... percent yup you need to go and that Chile will examine\nI absolutely would like to go back and neighborhood schools every thing for parents more involved kids don't have to get on a bus at seven six thirty in the morning to travel around the city for two hours\nAnd more importantly you'd have twenty five million right then and they are to throw into the school absolutely periods no no a hundred percent I think the ah the kids\nOr should you should have the option of a neighborhood school in any has looked at that it's\nGood for kids to get out and walk I mean with all my childhood obesity and all these things to for kids to get up and get out and and and and walk in the community and and you know on snow you know obviously you're not going to have the uh you know the issues with with fall weather as much uh with with buses and and all that stuff so I think\nIt's a wink wink maybe we'd\nBe compelled to catch to plow are straight\n[laughter] a little bit better yeah maybe that's the only I\nThink it's a terrific idea and you get to know your neighbors you get the Europe where you live yeah where you live\nWe always walk to school we have an older one either older siblings are older somebody else ... with us\nAnd I share with you wrote earlier and you know we we we went to everybody and we picked up if it gets along the way in everybody\nTook care of each other and maybe society you know children need a little bit more that\nKnow it's a ... you know what the the helicopter bombs and and the ... the ... parents they call you know let's get back to this from at twenty five dollars have twenty five million dollars to the city of Providence is like a billion dollars and that's when they find that does that twenty five million\nOr it could be either hey if if the teachers are behind what they're entitled to some of that money could be allocated across this money could satisfy a lot of different problems he's good\nThey they need to put a little bit\nThere is no question about it you know again should I be fortunate enough to be elected I Would have a a time sensitive\nOr a time allotted study done but look at that is the what schools are in different neighborhoods that can sense as to where the kids come from\nAnd yes you've got to have changed and times change throughout life\nIs at one time Thirty years ago we needed to do last thing than we did busing but times have changed and if kids live near a school and there is the sense is that schools should be open and serving the kids there's just no question about it\nYou know it's ludicrous that if I made for a second ago on this and I remember you know and as I told you before the I grew up in Providence\nYeah I I grew up not far from what would be the old ... school which I think it's done if Kennedy right now yeah there were there were kids in the neighborhood now that are actually children of of children of my friends yeah we're getting bussed across town\nAll right when when Kennedy's you know half a mile from the house\nCan you imagine registration is just absolutely made no sense okay again\nIf you go to school in your neighborhood it builds community it only\n... again if God Forbid there is a problem you you know who your neighbor it you know who lives down the street I mean I remember walking because it really in the olden days walking to I'm a school we walked at least two miles and we can't get them grow I was five years old walking kindergarten\nYou know if it's awful you brought up the point this is a different time\nRight and with and you know you're a little older than I Am but both within that same but what I'm saying is within that same generation will fifties and sixties births okay\nWell let's let's let's call it was it was they was racial cultural divide throughout the city and stuff like that right okay and and and and ... and I'd be by no means means is that any insult anybody but you had\nWhite Irish Catholic over here in LA and her to have the Jewish people on the side you had the Italians on federal al and we all had our own little cliques\nWell the the city now is it's become so racially diverse was and then this is the point there is no longer the need to send your kid halfway across the school because you interact with anybody you show through\nRight now and and I and I think this is all going to change and and and you know that that would be a big undertaking if somehow knows the back of get done you'd save a lot of money right off the bat\nUp absolutely and the wonderful it wouldn't be wonderful to be able to accomplish I mean this is people say how do we have heard this is one way we differ\nYes it is yeah and it's ... and and I think it's still creates a divide amongst people and and it needs to be it needs to be addressed it needs to be straightened out\nUm you know the Providence is ... it's a good city it's a great city when it's running it functionally had it's cleaned up and and and I hope I hope the fact that you're a breath of fresh air that you get in there and then you can bring the ... back into the city", "show_name": "The Matt
