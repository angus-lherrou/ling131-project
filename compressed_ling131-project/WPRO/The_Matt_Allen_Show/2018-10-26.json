sex or someone that you really are from central and voters the\nRevolution self Washington centered this is NPR News the noontime and arrested in the series is suspicious packages center prominent Democrats and critics of the president who's or the suspects is in his fifties he was arrested in South Florida here CNN investigative correspondent ...\nDiscovered the sorting facility where some of these packages came through they discovered what they believe could be a person of interest the person who could be responsible and they worked off of that\nOr they have people at their homes and screen this stuff and never actually may I don't think any of these packages made it to their intended\nTargets um and so nobody's been hurt these haven't gone off\nThere's speculation and I notice as as a result of some of the er the law enforcement briefing that took place yesterday\nDuring Dan your show time slot there was one and they they they have yet to be able to be clarified as to whether or not these are hoax type devices or if they're actually were meant to explode\nHurt people um so I don't know either way the man arrested in connection with us today according to CNN anyway\nHas a criminal history as well as a a a is also a Florida address and ties to New York um I saw one thing that said that his criminal history is also indicative of other terrorist type of threats\nUm and so this could be a guy who's just you know it was a bad seed who's\nWho's got some crazy ideas and wants to terrorize people in his obviously are done his job here\nThe situation is you know what I'm sitting here looking at this obviously this difference between\nUm you know being able to talk about what you're seeing giving you the the latest in the news that's the latest in the news the conversation is kind of come out of this is the idea of the you know whether or not the political conversation the political debate in this country causes something like this um\nYou know without knowing the specific motivations of the person I don't know that any conversation can cause somebody to do this or I don't know if you can pointed at one specific individual and say it's their fault this happened because you know people are responsible for their own actions\nPeople responsible for their own actions but to a certain extent there's an atmosphere right in the atmosphere is not one that's conducive\nTo giving people the ability to find consensus and I think that's the more important conversation you're always going to have cracked pots and crackpots going to do ... things whether you give them an excuse to or not\nAnd so while it can have an influence it's not a control you understand what I'm saying\nThe atmosphere can give people a little lead level of agitation to go ahead and to make that judgment that doesn't necessarily mean that the atmosphere is responsible for the bad judgment ultimately it's always that individual that's responsible\nBut the atmosphere can can create a whole bunch of other less severe side effects that are that are that are not good\n\nAnd I think that's what we're all this is kind of like a a a focal point for us to kind of pay attention to that\nAnd the idea that you know a ratcheting up the violent rhetoric arrested the ratcheting up of any rhetoric\nUm is is something that has become\nI think over the top in terms of uh in in terms of its impact it's become almost comical like at this point not comical funny but comical in the way it's like a caricature it's it's ridiculous it's really fundamentally ridiculous and it's\nWe we have gone away from the ability to say the evidence makes my opinion versus my opinion makes the evidence and that's where we are in a lot of places in the most extreme places that really most of you out there listening well Sara what's the evidence here\nBut you are and you look at it you go okay understand you don't believe what you see what you hear what you read\nBut there are some of you out there that already know what happened to you\nYou already know\nAnd no matter what evidence is presented on a ... you know to you by officials or news reports or whatever it is you will not let go of what you have already created in your head and as a matter of fact you will twist and turn your interpretation of what's presented\nTo match what's already in your head\n\nAnd that's when things go sideways because if we can't agree on what's real right and you can't agree on what is a ticket for what it is then we don't have anything to stand on together we have no grounds to being together on\n\nAnd so I you know a presumption of innocence I mean what we talked a lot about the presumption of innocence not only as a as a legal aspect of you know the whole Kavanaugh situation but also as a as an ethic\nRight I think the present we we have obviously the constitution has a bunch of legal prescriptions in it where we talk about free speech and we talk about the ability for people to say what they got to say that uh that uh and granted those are the legal rights\nTo where the federal government can't do certain things but so some of those things have transcended legality and our transcended the way we we we should treat each other they become almost\nRather than just legal limitations they should become almost moral codes\nBecause they're not harmful as moral codes right allowing for\nCreating an environment where people can speak freely there's very little downside to that other than having to hear things you don't like and that's and that's a child's down side\nYou know what I'm saying\nI mean if you think people speaking certain ways manifest itself automatically in some kind of reality without any sort of human intervention then you're like a your child who believes in spells and magic you're like ancient man who thinks that the uh you know the son died just rows and he's angry because the earth ship\n\nYou know words are just symbols of ideas and people acting on them gives them or their their meaning\n\nAnd so you know free speech is not only a legal tenant it should be a moral code\n\nInnocent until proven guilty is not only a legal tentative should be a moral code the burden of proof should be something that we should walk around with every day and believe in living our lives well do you think\n\nThe idea that there's so in this case the the thing that I see that comes out of these these male bombings and whatnot and and and what's happening with all this is that there are people who are already writing political narratives in their heads\nOr even in press releases I'm sure there's all sorts of communication specialist out there for politicians who are who are not sitting here going Oh thank God they find a guy who might be not trying to hurt somebody there actually sitting there going how are we going to spend this to our advantage\n\nHow are we going to start throwing blame rocks at each other\n\nRather than a food they gotta they caught a whack do\nIt's what sort of political angle is here what way is somebody trying to get power over me how can we take somebody down with this what what what political ideology can we blame all these things\n\nNow that is something that is that it means everything this is one I have a ... and the fact that everything's become political when you make everything political\nEverything's political I Know that's a very profound statement but if you think about it I might be a little bit profound\nWhen everything is laid out to be political then everything from the breakfast cereal you choose to the socks you where in the morning to the Halloween costume you put on your kids hopefully just send your kids 'cause if any adult ways whereas a Halloween costume you'd have your head examined your time's over always for kids\nThat's different that's a different topic um you know all these things for political so everything's political and when everything's political policy political you know politics becomes the new religion look out\n\nSo as we wait for the president to say what he's got to say on this or comment on this waiting for more information as to what this fifty something year old man that has been arrested here ah for suspected us I guess I get in connection with the mailing of these suspected or explosive devices in the mail\nEvidently this person has a criminal history or lives or has an address in Florida and ties to New York\nUm we'll find out more and we'll bring it to you\nBut you know even some of the conversation and the way that things have ... the media it's amazing how they um the biases incredible\nIt just really is incredible you know\nAbsolutely sent to people who are against Trump [laughter] there's so many more oh these bombs were sent to critics of the president\nWell okay I guess that's one way you can look at it just that's one way that is one way you could say it or you could say\nParcells now to more of them were found today they were mailed to New Jersey Democrat representative Cory Booker and former intelligence director James Clapper stay with us here on WPRI there is a briefing expected to two thirty in the president could have more to say even before that\nJoe drillers says he wishes he chose his words better but he has no regrets flashing the Rockefeller salute that's also known just flipping the bird to an extent\n[noise]\nOkay which like we have something breaking right now let's let's take it too [laughter]\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nIs a great great honor to have you on the White House thank you very much [noise]\n\nAs you know this is young black leadership that is the summit and to have you here is truly a my privilege and we're going to have a lot of fun we're gonna talk

devices that had been male too high profile figures throughout our country\nAnd a media organization I Am pleased to inform you that law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody\n[noise] credible\nJob by law for us we've carried out a far\nReaching federal state and local investigation to find the person or persons responsible for these events these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country [noise]\nI've instructed authorities to spare no resource are expensive and finding those responsible and bringing them to swift and certain justice [laughter]\nWe will prosecute\nThem him her whoever it may be\nTo the fullest extent of the law [laughter]\nMuch never allow political violence to take root in America cannot let that happen and I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it I just got our\n\nI've just concluded a briefing with the department of justice following the apprehension of the suspect\nI Want to applaud the FBI Secret Service department of justice the U.S attorney's office for the southern district of New York the NYPD and all law enforcement throughout the entire country credible partners these people that worked so hard and to have\nDone it so quickly it's looking like a a you're looking it's a needle in a haystack how do you do this so quickly they've done an incredible incredible job but I Want to congratulate you know [noise]\n\nWhat a bottom line is that Americans must unify and we want to show the world that we are United together in peace and love and harmony as fellow American citizens\nThere is no country like our country and every day we are showing the world just how truly great we are [noise] so you are really very special people I wanted to say that before a little talk\nAnd I appreciate the time you've given me and\nBoy one of one day one of you is going to be standing it could be three or four of you actually [noise]\nI have no doubt that seems\nTo be from the president's I wanted to make sure to get anything else to say about the about the rest of the suspect I'm speaking to a group of young black Republicans were cheering him\nHe's having a pet reason pep rally more but just mentioned the fact that he is going to obviously that he's the suspect according to him and his old them or does anybody else or has been arrested to the cheers of people in the room obviously saying that they you know political violence like this is no place in this country and what not\nUm so as far as I Know that's all the the president had to say there and

this whole thing what's happening is\nUm the F ... somebody must have called the FBI let them know that the cameras are on it so they grabbed the tarp and they covered the van so of course once you've

when the things on it though\nI mean I can see where have you ever proclivity to believe this ... this the the the conspiracy theories that this whole thing is set up a politically motivated thing ... it it's almost like people are doing it on purpose just to stoke those people's fire right like it's a conspiracy to stoke the conspiracy\nConspiracies or I haven't heard yet a given that are going to get one now is that general ... who are working together forces to happen to get the story of the uh\nThey heard the Allen phone was having his big illegal immigrants thing you know especially in France today so Gina Raimondo in the end or Joe ... came together and Jews middle finger video and they created a middle finger video thing\nOne of the video that this was to give the ... the middle finger video out of the oh I see I see in ... whenever\n[laughter] that's coming next so I I'm just I'm I'm Amazed by this\nThat there is\nA good people already my Facebook page I mean I got to my Facebook followers are just I'm just going to shut it down I really do it really there's nothing good going on there\nThere really isn't that the comments the comments section is just I you know get the popcorn boys you know what I mean Joe writes in worst right wing extremist ever like that guy in Chicago that caught the fair ball during the world series but\nWhat\nAre the two dogs and one's going to ask her for interfering in\nThe media will most likely his one of those was from two hours ago the media will most likely be portraying the suspect as of right wing extremists was a Trump supporter despite no proof well living proof now so much for that one\n\nI just it to me I just I I I've been trying to kind of understand the minds of people\nI'm\nYour first mistake minds of people who are automatically go to the conspiracy theories like there's some kind of a an overarching thing here is the one thing that keeps me from bleep relieving over arching conspiracy theories is that I don't have enough faith in\nPeople I don't have I don't have my experience tells me you get five people that are out for people like people want to make decisions you want to do things like that you put them in a room and you're never going to get them to agree\nRight never mind taking literally in some cases what would in order to pull off some of these things will take a hundred people or if not more\nTo pull off with some of these conspiracy theories or or or these these ... to conspire to create certain things and and nobody ever finds out about them\nI I mean it's I was always bring up the the Bill Clinton thing Bill Clinton was alone in the oval office with an intern and everybody found out\nYou know eventually how great there are some things that don't ever get found out there a big things like like what it would take in order to have\nSome kind of a conspiracy um they get found out now here's the question I have for you do\nYou not when it comes to anything involving politics or or a national news story like this is talk of his razor never in effect\nIs that what it is ... razor doesn't count\nMy phone numbers for three eight WNPR oh the toll free number one eight hundred three two one WPRI what's ...\nRazor the simplest explanation is usually the correct one right simplest explanation here is a guy as a as a political belief that Donald Trump is the er the savor the universe and anybody who is against him or is it was on the other side of him\nA is a bad person and he took it too far and sent either real or fake bombs in the ... in the in the uh in the in the mail to either really tried to hurt somebody or scare somebody and he's over the top guy an extreme guy that's white covered his van windows in\nAh in pro Trump stickers and that's about it if a ... that's what happened here we don't even know yet\nEvidently there's gonna be a briefing from the federal authorities on this in a couple of are probably about ten Fifteen minutes dish us we'll take that when we get a dead even coverage regaining WPRI Danny\n... are you doing good thank you\nBut uh yeah I Do\nAgree with you that the simplest explanation will be ... what it comes down to my mind a quandary is that the FBI couldn't figure out part when they add\nA evidence they couldn't figure out this and I it was when they were older bottom they can't figure out was Vegas and a couple of other things but they could figure this out ... twenty four hours\nWell they didn't figure it out right now in some way they tracked him right you're you're\nWhat you're saying is that those things that that would go what went on here we're again they didn't track them down before the thing happened\nRight so you're you're you're ... you're having your your not comparing apples to apples\nOkay I'm just saying that if you get really great on this one but then all the others were there were even the evidence they couldn't than\nI Am going to know you you know hold on a second Danny you're talking about two different things one is a crime is committed\nThere's evidence to look at and to analyze and they can go out and use their investigative skills to find the person who did it the other one you're talking about was not that they still given evidence they were given accusations of something that might have happened\nAnd they didn't put it together I mean granted they ... there was a failure on that end but you're talking about and chips on the phone line to prevent something from happening versus something happening and having all this forensic evidence to trace it back the two different things\nWith more than just jumps on the phone I thought they had a chat with all of this and I told him in\n... right in the ... but at that point nothing inherently right but nothing had happened\nOh let's chill nothing had happened yet\nAnd when they went by the way when they ... something did happen they traced it back to the Sinai abs within what a day or two\nI don't recall it was just so much going\nOn here it was about a day or two they got them so it there's there's there there are two different things I understand you are you trying to say I just don't think you got it on the air under gave the nail on the head on that one All right for three eight WNPR oh the toll free number one eight hundred three two one WPRI email me met at six three zero WNPR dot com\nOr the the the ... people want to believe there's always more than what they might be what\nThey are seen now maybe there is\nBut you got to wait to see and you know\nWhat ... they'll never let us know okay
