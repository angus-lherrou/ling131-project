that great but the difference between him and like Bill Cosby what Bill Cosby was convicted of and evidently what are what are your Harvey Weinstein has been accused of all those things he he's a big difference there\n\nBut the modern politics is is what we do we just take one little thing we conflated with a bunch of other things we make one thing stand for everything else and so therefore it's all one big pile of terror\n\nSo you know I got to step back and start to you know understand it's a small example of it but I saw this today and I said listen to the audio it over and over again and you know as far as Trump goes is it very presidential no\nIs it something that he should even be kind of flippant about or be litigating at a at a rally when we're in the midst of this and it's very delicate negotiations in a delicate process no when you have\nBut I mean he's he's sitting there and they're at a rally where was he yesterday's and Mississippi he's in Mississippi to uh you know obviously red meat crowd he's thrown red meat to the crowd in Republican circles right now they find doctor for it to be completely\nUm ludicrous in terms of her ... her viability in in in ... and I will tell you this on top of that you know this whole Supreme Court nomination has become something of a\nUm [noise] it's it's\nA symbolic victory rather than an actual discussion about whether or not a person would make a good justice you know the idea of being a good justice or not is you know it's it's like second or third on the list\nNow you've created so that's one team versus another and losing is a\nIs a shot and not in not like oh we lost this guy okay\nThat's not the worst thing in the world the worst thing in the world is that the other side would win\n\nAnd so\nIt's become like this political Rorschach test you can make the Kavanaugh appointment about whatever horrible thing you want it to be about whether or not it's actually about that doesn't matter\nIt's about whatever you want it to be about whatever your cause lab is whatever your cause does your is whatever it is you're you're the thing that you're most upset about more angry about it can be whatever you want it to be\nBecause\nYou know when somebody says words you can take\nThose words and as long as they're loosely kind of created an loosely connected you can make them out to be whatever it is you want them to be\nJust reading a story with\nCory Booker was it yesterday afternoon talking about you know even the ultimately I read the quotes is from the daily wire ultimately not whether he's innocent or guilty this is not a trial said Booker but ultimately have enough questions have been raised that we should not move on to another candidate the people on the Supreme Court\nAh should preserve the integrity of the court and be beyond the report to these difficult partisan times he wants to get rid of the guy now and get a new candidate because there's too much stuff around it\n\nSo you know to me I'm sitting here and I'm watching the ... it's it's it's really got into an absurd level everybody's got now I was reading the story was last night about the uh the FBI investigation that could wrap up at some point today supposedly um\nAnd\nYou know they have it usually with this kind of things background investigation that give it to a junior agents who are just trying to learn how to get to learn the ropes and do the the proper\nUm [noise] uh you know\nPaperwork and things like that and so it's happening now is they get these guys and they're going out there to get to agents going out there usually be probably be like one now they get to agents is a supervisor because you know God Forbid there going to be they're gonna be crucified no matter what comes out of this thing the question of whether or not they should be made public as being out there\nOr they'll say no it's going to go to the senator's only 'cause that's what they've always done but it'll be leaked in about three Thirteen seconds\nOr and everybody will be able to read it and of course it'll just be a bunch of this is what they said this is what was told to us this is the information we found will be no different than we were a week ago today or we could go friday\nAnd everybody's going to have to go ahead and decide what they think\nThe um symbolic nature\nPeople will make accusations about what a vote for does to this person does to the does it says about the individual senator\nThey'll they'll use it to deeply divide the people going into the mid term elections and ultimately\nOne of those two parties really to prevail or lose and you and me will be sitting here with the wreckage\nThe social political inter family inter societal wreckage where you know the idea that people walk and we have this some form of rape culture in the United states and\nThat you know we put a rapist on the on the Supreme Court without any sort of consideration for evidence or anything like this is going to be now commonly thrown about\nWhether or not this reality whether or not it's it's real doesn't\nMatter reality doesn't matter\nIt's whatever perception they can hammer into your forehead about an individual uh bought a party about a situation about a person\nWhat actually happened doesn't matter and in\nThis case the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh has now become a a block ... everybody knows what it means\nYou don't you think everybody knows what he rush act test this didn't blood tests you know what do you see that it's like when you're a little kitten you stand that later on the ground and look up at the sky you say oh that cloud looks like this that looks like that you can still do that by the way probably not 'cause not a computer screen 'em they probably have an app for that\nBut you laid out I took a dog it looks like a dinosaur oh really I think it looks like I Know\nOh okay so it's pretty much of this has become it's the patriarchy grape culture\nThat is what it is now so it's there's no evidence that as a matter of having it doesn't matter\nGuilt or innocence doesn't matter it's the it's it's whatever ... whatever for form of of of political manipulation we can achieve a mass basis that's reality doesn't matter which true or not\nSo you know\nThis is what I see today a you know Donald Trump making a great strategic move with that not really as he mocking a victim of sexual assault that is yet to be determined number one whether or not she actually was or not\nOr you know I tend to believe somebody says they are because those types of things are very serious and I think it only took a deprived human beings to lie about them but some people lie about them so it happens um and on top of that you know sitting there and and making fun of somebody would make it funny was poking holes in the argument haggling me here sorry\n\nSo that's the way I see it you want to look at the ... and tell me what you see my phone numbers for

the friction that's used between a union\nOr the union workers and a private company\nAnd how do you that's what the that's what going forward I think we need to start talking about and thinking about we gotta figure that out maybe we can do that together um the other thing\nThat I'd like to get to at some point today is also a big old besides that you mentioned you don't forget peanut butter club

stuff\nIt was a fascinating look at her time as attorney general as a prosecutor her whole philosophy on on life and and the idea of being part of the sisters of mercy uh I thought it was interesting so you check it out it's a long form conversation\nUncovered uninterrupted so I say it's unconscious uninterrupted we just have a big long conversation Arlene Violet\nThe pod cast you go to our

you count on for news traffic whether half point hand news talk Ninety nine seven AM six thirty feet are prominent cumulus station [noise]\nFrom the revolution song costs news or\nGood afternoon I'm steep climb in with the WPRI reviews at one o'clock Providence police arrested two men wanted in a string of ten robberies over the past couple of weeks\nAgo many of the stores and and a little lucky to be one of them that he did go in and Rob\nDetective commander major David look Peyton says that was the family dollar store on TALK stone avenue Monday Night the suspected getaway driver a cup Portman Johnson was picked up following the chase the suspected rubber acclaim Otay was arrested last night at his Hartford avenue apartment\nSaying that I'm doing well how are you\nI'm good that I did I make sense and link this whole thing out that it\n... definitely definitely did it uh it's it's a little bit confusing because they really don't know exactly who the person that's like that it is clear that that I got decided that it near\nHim or her or if it's just something that popped out there as you know like you said I thought that we've been trying to answer the questions that you are still asking\nFor a week after this out there right so I saw you on Twitter saying this stuff did you ever do final report on it because you've really I'm trying to remember if you did a ... only thing I Know about what you did was what you put on Twitter\nYes so we didn't including a what I put on Twitter in our on air story ... you know we we ended up talking with Senator Whitehouse about\nAll of the the result of of last week ... hearings and um we did ask you about this topic as well but uh when I put on Twitter was basically that we tried to track this guy down so\nWhat we're going off of it what was mentioned in these transcripts of this hearing that there were a couple of tweets that were quoted and something about it man being put the effort in that like with Twitter bio right and so they found that it for me yes the reporter founded Twitter account that match up\nAt pretty much exactly with what was that in in the transcripts\nFrom there you know we went to normal risk that a reporter take weight they tried to find this guy's eye contact information all the email address is made multiple phone calls that you mentioned just a couple of times the phone number is ...\nThat is associated with him on white pages this woman in Newport has this phone number now her phone's been ringing off the hook I spoke with her and\nShe has another six year old and she had it for six years right\nYeah yeah she said she has had that phone number for a long time and she couldn't figure out why her phone was ringing off the hook she was getting ... threatening messages\nAnd she said to me I I'm just trying to ... you know be well she has cancer and ... like this has been very traumatic for me so of course I felt bad when I called her as well not having the right number a that she was very cordial about it and then go from there when we couldn't get in touch with him via email or\nA as a phone we said All right well we've got to try and go knock on this man's door because we want to know\nWhy he told this story if he is connected to that Twitter account um we had a lot of questions so we tracked down in the draft\nWent to an apartment complex um or let in and talked to a supervisor there who tried\nCalling his apartment he didn't answer a she was gracious enough to let us go to his door which had his name on it um\nAnd the same name I should say that's connected to this Twitter account and ah we knocked on the door several times it seemed as though someone with home with your TV and some clips that than a shadow across the are the people but um after multiple attempts he did not come to the door and by the time we got back to the lobby the supervisor headset yet\nCalled down there and said he didn't want to talk to us so that's pretty much as as far as we got and I did ask US Senator Whitehouse about this when I talked with him over the phone on\nI Believe and I said you know what would happen here\nAnd and his his story is that you know he tried to keep it under wraps um tried to go through what he thought were the proper channels affording this complaint to the proper people and said that was leaked during that hearing and they identified him in ways that he thought where it was inappropriate\nBy you know quoting tweets that people could you know people like reporters [laughter] could could then go on the Internet search and find\nThe Twitter account and find his name which he says he was hoping to keep secrets this whole time so\nI did when I was seen since you about whether or not they they do is this like the by rote thing they do and should we ... did he was voted on we don't do any sort of work on our end to determine whether or not legit would just forwarded much it\nSo he if he expressed to me that he thought he had done the proper thing you know I got this complaint we wanted to make sure that was bought for the proper channels and he was frustrated and upset that it had been sort of both right before it was properly\nAnd that's why you want an apology because you should do to to put this stuff out there will be identifying or the ability to identify the Twitter account anyway right on right that was something that wasn't a problem because this guy was just a regular guy was just ...\nRight and and if you've seen the transcripts you know that his name as redacted from your transcript but those are those tweets and the Twitter bio are are identifiable\nUm and as we also know from that Twitter account this man has said publicly we're attracted a story that he supposedly told us that are White House so um it's been an interesting thought I got to try and follow I I Wish that ah someone ah preferably me could talk to this\nGuy [laughter] I have if he's listening\nI was the one outside of your door you know I think it's an interesting story to tell a regardless of what that story it\nSeems show\nAssuming that you know obviously there is that the Twitter feed Twitter name belongs to him and that he was the one who made the phone call um the the ... the name of the door and the Twitter name match yes yeah that's about all we know show somebody using that name has at the same name as a person who lives in an apartment\nIt's potentially you know we really need a human [laughter] yes that's\nForward and say hello this is me yes that's my Twitter account yes and the same person who called senator White House right now it's all sort of you know we're trying to connect the dots um but I I think it\nYou know we haven't really been able to pin that down yet and until we have a person of for 'em and and talk to us face to face a I don't think we can ever really know for sure I'm even though all signs point yes that as this person a this Rhode Island man is connected with his Twitter account and with that complaint that with me\nAnd a being a dog a reporter that we know you are you obviously tried oh the message is well I Would imagine right to try and get some kind of confirmation of connection to this guy to no avail though huh\nYeah yeah of course I mean like I said we we tried calling him an an emailing him we've looked on social media for relatives on some of whom have responded to last but uh some of them have been to and\nIt's been a it's been really tricky to even try and break through a I think the closest that we've gotten again is just going to the department knowing that he called down to his supervisor and said I don't want to talk of the media which to me is a good sign that were on the right track 'cause of someone who is not confused about why the news is outside of his door\n... right right okay yeah because ultimately if you're if you're confused you open the door but what's this all about right\nTo have ... who are you what are you doing here [laughter] ... facts\nMay may seem as though that this might be the person who did it and we just don't know why\n[noise] right right and that's really why we went and knock down his door because by the time friday morning rolled around he had already seemingly taken to the Twitter account and said\nThe story I told is not true um I've been getting them boarded with tweet a and so what we really wanted to do was not question the validity of his story anymore but the question have on why he felt it was necessary to make that kind of call in\nAnd right and if people can recant stories for all different reasons right does not for me 'cause I was made a mistake or it wasn't true it could be made a mistake by even bringing this up is now part of this morass that I Want nothing to be part of you know I was part of it so I wouldn't I mean over my head and I want to get out and um\nSo it's interesting All right so I as far as I knew you were the only one that actually tried to get a face to face with that person in terms of physically being there that you talked about it publicly anyway I'm sure other people maybe you've tried so I wanted to kinda see where you were in and um and so you're still available should the person who want to reach out and talk to leave you knocked on his door\nAbsolutely lady was at your\nDoor if you if you wanna get in touch with me I can do so on Twitter if that's convenient [laughter] so yeah ... I think I think he has an important an interesting story to tell we just got to see if he's willing to tell it\nCan thank you for everything I appreciate it things that\nAre ... and German gentle twelve\nSleep you know is this a situation where the simplest explanation is the correct one right don't use it as me earlier today so it's usually the simplest is simplistic solutions that is the right one guy called some of the White House in White Houses here if you want to go tell your story yeah what's your story of to the kid to the committee they investigated\nAnd just in case you want to go ahead and tell the media about this go right ahead here soon so and then you know whatever\nUm and then\nFor whatever reason this person and it could be a very viable explanations person doesn't um [noise] see I was when I was wondering issues if we can find anybody if nobody's come forward nobody you know if this is a person who's who's phone number was was on you know wrongly assigned\nOn the Internet\nAnd we don't even know there's no picture on the Twitter feed is nothing like this was this person even a real person who just somebody screwing around on the Internet now that Kim been toward door someplace in the room\nWith the guy's name that matches the Twitter account on the front door it leaves a little bit more credibility to the fact that there might be actually a human being behind this now what they were trying to achieve if anything is still the mystery is this is one of those things where somebody has a memory and they go oh\nThis must have been the same thing and then realizes later on oh no that was not it was somebody trying to pull a prank or somebody's trying to get involved in something you know people do there are so much is happening here but then some kids situations people actually tried to go ahead and get involved in things that are not involved\nMany thanks good afternoon we're less than an hour away now from the first nationwide test of the

[laughter]\n\nSo let's say I'll throw it out there you tell me what could what could possibly changed the landscape let's speculate\nRight my numbers for three eight WNPR oh the toll free number one eight hundred three two one WPRI can email me mad at six three zero WPRI\nDot com you can give me your your speculation somebody wrote me a funny one about Brett Kavanaugh that cannot read on the air I Wish I could though [laughter] it made me laugh out loud when I read it so it's going to leave it there\nBut what could possibly changed the landscape uh Patricia Morgan during the endorsement I think is interesting\nIs something that could have I guess some level of impact I never understand the endorsement thing anyway be honest with you your doors when things are great way to get some free media uh if if you have a machine behind you like if you're an endorsement of of a union or something like that then you get a whole bunch of volunteers\nYou get a whole bunch of you know a phone call or is that people are going to go to ... people out in the door on the street and get them\nOut for you that's interesting because it gives you a strategic advantage you know for somebody who is going to come out in the offer support ... without anything behind it and it gives you a couple of days of or maybe a day or two some or one day maybe depending on the person\nOr a free media and so yeah there's that\nBut if it's a landscape changing thing for me\nThat is like a a you know someone who's in is out or someone who's in can't be in any more or somebody who's coming in to offer an opinion is so powerful that the people that are already in are going to be a you know\nBlown out so you know don't mess with people's minds Brian's and Lincoln\nBrian your WPRI Brian Hi Matt how're you doing all they had been listening to show for a long time now that I'm I'm\nA nurse or more in the ... or my rap and I've done um I Know in my area a lot of you know a lot of clout\nUm but I think you know what the surprise or in the primary I think that ah that her in the worst of a ... ... ... a really what changed the landscape\nUm you know she she pulled that many votes and she goes in and do it and I think you know a lot of those well\n[noise]\nThat's assuming that the people that are in the ... you're talking about the republic I have to go look at the numbers of votes I don't have them in front of me well you're talking about I think for a forty but none of them but some of the actual number of people that voted for\n'em right versus how many voting in a in a primary versus a a ... versus the general election that's actually look at the numbers on how many actual votes you could mean to him I'm\nYou know what that does for him to take over and and specifically when you've got to remember something the ... thing is interesting an interesting interesting challenge for Allan Fung but\nForget about that I imagine if he wasn't even in the race imagine if it was just him and Gina measure of his ... Alan ...\nStill has to overcome the machine\nThat is Gina Raimondo right she has a machine she has the Democratic apparatus she's got more money than God and she gets so she's in she's got Providence pretty much locked up you'd have to overwhelmingly beat her everywhere else except for Providence even have a chance it's still\nA very much a a difficult thing just as an in a two person race\nJust because of the makeup of of the politics of Rhode Island and where the votes are now how ... how Patricia Morgan does that\nAn overall you know a gubernatorial a statewide level ... with with with independents and Democrats and everybody else I don't know how that how that works out I have to think about it and have to\nLook at the numbers but you'd think that that's a landscaping announcement landscape changing announcement\nOr I I think it\nCould be interpreted that way but you know you have to interpret it that way\nRight right I mean I I wouldn't say I wouldn't say landscaping in the sense that a lot of people are going to change their mind I think it's more taking away\nLong or where\nYou know on you know ... if we look at it now falling need as many votes as he can get right though even taking you know seven or eight percent of the vote away from that that's going to be it may that's landscaping and that you\nKnow the landscape chain and he always seems to me he's already doing that you know so I guess seven percent more I guess I Would say ... Brian thanks for the call I got an email here from Janice who says\nBig announcement Trump is coming to Rhode Island to endorse troll oh now that would be\nThat would be landscape changing that would be a huge thing that would be a huge announcement if he comes out tomorrow and actually announces that Donald Trump is coming to Rhode Island to rally for Joe ... it doesn't make any sense though it would be\nWell bringing the one guy who has ... who was a lower approval rating governor [laughter] reading the president\nWidely [laughter] he got more votes than her last time around now that was the last time around the presidential race right but\nWhat does that do on the Republican side does that take away all of Alan ... support among basically almost all of it in which case\nI mean if if Trump came in and did like a a two hour hazard job on our own phone or there will be pretty bad [laughter] I was ... that's what I read\nA\nThat would have to I mean that's the level that I'm Talking about it would have to be that that that it did they announce\nTomorrow it has to be Trump coming in for thriller in order to be like this big landscape changing thing don't you think or if there's going to live up to the hype of that press\nPartially for something nefarious he's got photos of somebody doing something\nRight right\nBut I mean anything below Trump coming in to stump for Joe troll oh I think that's an exaggeration\nI'm trying to think of any other permutations has that would work out what to find out tomorrow noontime makes you tune into the show tomorrow new\nSo if you can think of another thing besides I mean I don't think Patricia Morgan I guess you could if you have to argue\nThe landscape changing nature of it you can debate it then it's not a big announcement if everybody just looks at each other and goes Ollie crap then to me that's a big thing\nYeah producer Morgan coming out interesting yes wholly crap not really ... depending on the way you're standing however Donald Trump coming in to stump for two to come back I have a rally for Joe troll oh holy crap that's what that does instant I mean it's\nWhen we come back my numbers for three eight WNPR oh the toll free number as one eight hundred three two one WPRI as we all get our presidential alert tests right now you're getting yourself ...
