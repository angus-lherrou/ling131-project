seven AM six thirty W. B. R.\nProminent cumulus they show the\nRevolution sell plus new center this is the number of the news that new times got an update from the fucking fire department is building incidents in fucking as his old mill conversion there let's get right to the scene to believe hero Steve phlegm going again joins us live she\nIs is just exactly what they're what they just said what's the broad just sat there and it's that you know overall I mean you listen they're talking about public policy overall and the people in that Washington park and the people that I've talked to about this on the air and I guess all the rest of us are talking about an acute\nIssue this one specific issue the\nArching what's the best public policy in terms of what to do with sex offenders who are re entering society and what to do with uh\nAnd there's in general we're re entering society as a whole different thing you know\nGranted yes\nI'm In the grand scheme of things\nYour child is more likely overwhelmingly to be targeted by somebody that they know right that's the truth with most sexual crimes are they are usually even rape and the ... and women and whatnot it's usually somebody they know acquaintance of some kind um\nAnd those people are you know they are good at manipulation fear um they are good at control they're good at targeting susceptible children um\nThere's all sorts of statistics that of what they did the research will can sit there and turn your hair white if you want to go and figure out the kind of kids that are groomed the types of children that people go I mean it I mean people who are from\nSingle parent homes\nAre more likely to be the targets of this kind of thing because the because of of the what goes on and that kind of social circumstances that surround that kind of thing\nUm ... it's it's it's dire it's brutal and it's not the point it's dire but it's not the you know that's that's true but it's not the point the point is not that a neighborhood\nHas a better chance or your person living in your kid in that neighborhood any neighborhood in America has a better chance of being\nThe point is someone who has done it\nOver and over and over again\n\nHas moved in to your neighborhood in this specific case someone who is labeled by the state of Massachusetts if somebody is very likely to do it again\n\nAnd while I understand you know the organizations like the ACLU they look at overall policy and how it would impact everybody all the time in broad level of policy\nBut sometimes specific instances call for specific actions or specific um maybe not even actors or specific handling and this is one of those cases now uh you know what can you do about this legally\nYou know this is one of those situations very often it's it's tough to understand this a try I'm gonna try and and give you the ... the the\nThe easiest way to explain it we create laws in society to have broad based guidelines to deal with situations that are common place\nAnd we\nTry to do as least amount as possible in order to make it so that people can be as free as possible and only this is what I think our philosophy should be and I think we've relatively do this um where you have the latest touch possible\nTo be able to deal with things with the least amount of force necessary right you don't put somebody in jail for the rest of their lives for stealing bubblegum at at a at a convenience store um and you\nYou know you you take six situations through the legal situation the legal system get get taken into consideration as mitigating factors you want to try and be as fair as possible\nAnd so with with you know with a section of sex or sexual offender type laws sometimes you'll get somebody who was\nYou know in a consensual relationship with somebody who is two years younger than like a Nineteen year old and a Seventeen year old because the because of the uh the the laws of the state they are technically not allowed and so they ... they become a sexual predator and then they got to be marked without the rest of their lives like those things are are are are bizarre and so you know you try to create these laws that that will\nBe able to be ... be applied to the greatest amount of circumstances possible but every once in a while there's one that comes along and granted by the way the reports were the reports are that Massachusetts\nThey should have had this guy committed but because of human error they didn't\nAnd so while the ACLU wants to handle the situation like it's just a broad base public policy debate it's a very acute specific issue of somebody who was who most people in charge of him know and and said that they should have been committed someplace\nAnd this is not just some guy who spent a couple of years in jail because he robs somebody a bike gunpoint when he was twenty five years old\nAnd if you do a little coupe quick little Google Search and do some research as to whether or not there are therapies that are actually available to people like this that actually work you want to talk about dire\nCircumstances there's really not and so this isn't just about um you know whether one person is you get a second chance this is about whether or not we give this guy a fourth fifth ... was a fourth chance and hurting someone else\n\nAnd you know I I Would I Would suggest that the ACLU you know since there are fans of taking knees taking me on this one\nI'd say take any on this one\nBecause this is not a broad based thing this is a specific issue with a very specific set of circumstances\nAnd it's and and the reason why I think people are losing their minds I think pretty much in general people in our society of gotten\nUnfortunately why I have no idea but they all say this I've gotten used to having these types of you know sexual whatever's around you know you're going to notice they live a hundred yards from you I mean I've lived around them\nYou'd probably lived around you probably live around well now you know next neighborhood over and you know you're aware if your child is ever in a place with somebody like that usually that can't be in places like that but you know if you had a family member or something like that\nAnd in general should always talk to your children about this thing about this kind of stuff in the balance\nOf ah the boundaries are excuse me of what people should be able to say and do for them to them and what adults said I mean I'm doing the stranger danger type stuff and\nA personal empowerment stuff I mean nonstop with my kids a nonstop conversation\nAnd it's also a culture No Child in my family has to hug anybody No Child in my family has to kiss anybody there asked they say no it's no it's enforced by the adults\nGet them used to it a very ... at a very young age that they don't have to do this stuff that's the kind of thing they made that will\nGuard them and and they ... who knows if it's going to work you try and get to work you hope it takes\nYou have no idea because the deviant said do this kind of thing are very good at what they do their demented their twisted and they're evil and some people will just born that way man that's the way it goes\nSorry\nThere's a whole bunch of stuff like that in this world where people just born certain ways some of them you can work around some you can't\nThis is one of those things you can't\nAnd so we have to ah you know this isn't that\nLike you said some guy who was who was a serial assault or in terms of punching people or stabbing somebody was twenty five years old and can deal with his anger better now\nThis is someone's broken and unless there's some miracle cure out there someplace for this kind of thing I you know I don't want to tell you I'm Sorry\nYou know\nIt's like setting loose some rabid animal in the neighborhoods on everybody to watch out it makes no sense\nAnd so what should happen is these people should never get out of prison\nThis isn't like it like I said before this isn't something you can train your child to get around to be on the lookout for this guy went into people's homes or a ... at least one person's house and took the kid\nWhat do you do to guard against that oh that's why put yourself in jail you could do that\nAnd so while there's a lot of times I think the ACLU gets it right this one it's like guys you know there are circumstances in which that you know sometimes um it's not always the way you see it\nAnd and this one\nI'm Out with them\nI get what they're saying I get the point but the saying it man this is a specific acute issue\n\nYou know I see it as\nWell as far as I'm rubber ... there was as far as I'm concerned a child rape is the same things murder and you might as well you should never be left out of the person

Wakefield each day of this is the one o'clock WPRI News Good afternoon I'm falls and Gary in the revolution soft wash new center three people hurt today in a partial collapse inside a building being renovated and ... and that's where we find WNPR oh Steve lampkin\nFirefighters responded to the huge block long the four story brick mill building the former schoolhouse candy building on ask an avenue\nA there is no sided deal that it can't be done like that\nUm unless I'm wrong and maybe I'm wrong so when you know I have a a bubble gum machine law degree that's worthless so somebody who doesn't actually has a real one that does this stuff all the time has been regards to of been welcome to the show thanks for calling in today appreciate it\nCould actually I'm at now than you are you you have some ... somewhat of a conflict here right here you are you going to be being are involved in the arbitration in this situation\n[noise] well I'm not conflicted in any way I Am newly gates who helped the city or work in this particular case and I'll be\nServing as the city ... trader a these grievances go to remember the ... and ... or so called tripod tight panels and I am the partial a traitor for the city which means I advocate for the city's defensive agree\n'cause of the city picks one the union picks one and then there's a middle of the road that they both agree on type of reaction board that look at the situation\nYes pro arbitrator is selected her on the paddle labor out of the ... the American arbitration association or has put together\nOr something that's not so much conflict as you have an interest in this you're going to be arguing for the city award when it comes to a specific issue correct\nRight I'll be representing the city or as it's a trade it in ...\nSo ultimately you um you know you can't speak specifically to these issues correct but because there's this is a pending arbitrary\nBut you can tell us about the culture of side agreements in Rhode Island\nSure sure I'm reluctant to speak only because I'm In the infancy of my involvement in that case I don't have\nA whole handle on all the factual issues or what I Know pretty much derives from what I've read in the in the news and the hurt on the uh uh radio last week but I can tell you a ... in my experience the so called side agreements and they and their nominated a\nAnd a number of different ways a\nMemorandum of agreement a memorandum of understanding site agreements I'm also stipulated awards these are not uncommon\nA phenomenon and public sector labor relations and what\nI have come to learn is that many of these so called side agreement a are\nCovering subject matter is that a fairly significant and they are appendages to the collective bargaining agreement but so many instances ah they never been presented to the ratifying bodies of municipalities\nAnd so often they uh make their weight surfaced I've sort of coined the phrase subterranean agreements because uh in my experience over the past forty years I've had a number of surprises Kerr when unions\nFiled grievances and then on the day of arbitration or shortly before they produce a side agreement that purport to be a modification of the mainframe collective bargaining agreement and lo and behold\nWhen one inquires you realize that those documents were never presented to a city or town council or\nOther ratifying body within minutes the ...\nAnd ... with ... under the law which makes them completely invalid right invalid\nIt would make them yes there's a there's a fairly well a\nWell known Rhode Island Supreme Court decision a that was issued back in Nineteen Ninety four by\nJustice tray of the Supreme Court ah where the Providence city council um I was addressing agreements made by then mass fancy that had not been ratified by the council and of course on Larry ordinance\nOr in the city collective bargaining agreements had to be present to the legislative branch of in a simple government for ratification\nAnd the court made it very clear that agreement struck\nA in such a way that they have not been presented and vetted by the city council and ratified are invalid and not enforceable\nAnd so that's pretty much it's safe to say that site agreements or basically illegal in Rhode Island\n[noise] while side agreements per say I'm not unlawful unless they've been\nA prepared I mean anyone can foremost I cite agree that you could have a a fire chief\nUh forming a side agreement with a union to resolve a particular issue or to create a benefit pets that's essentially collective bargaining however\nMerely because reform the agreement doesn't necessarily make it a valid one if the side agreement it struck it then has to go through the process of uh of ratification\nMore famous to me that's not done that seems to me the ... the fact that it's a site agreement makes it aren't automatically invalid because if it wasn't a side agreement it would just be an addendum to the contract\n[noise] while they're British sided means that we have in agreement over here that nobody knows about that were kind of just working out between ourselves those can happen\nSite agreements can be negotiated but they have to come to the surface they have to be presented oftentimes ah issues arise during the life of say a three year collective bargaining agreement and the party need to collectively bargain a a side agreement or a memorandum of agreement\nOr a memorandum of understanding orange some cases they stipulate to an arbitration award which is a form of a of an agreement consent agreement if you will in arbitration the point is\nThose agreements still to be valid must be vetted by the city or town council or other ratifying body and if they are not than they are not valid collective bargaining agreements because remember even though they may be single subject matter\nBy agreement they still are in the nature of collective bargaining agreements they struck between a union and the ... and as such they have to be ratified\nIf not their invalid void and unenforceable\nAnd if they then take a step further if they are acted upon as if they are enforceable unreal\nWhat happens then [noise]\nWell that's an interesting question because unions often grieve violations of side agreement and then when uh the revelation is made that side agreement was never ratified\nThen diminish the power the has the ability to raise as an affirmative defense or the void ability or in validity in on enforce ability of the so called site agreement so\nI'm again merely because people go through the motions of preparing the side agreement in some cases signing it in some cases acting upon it doesn't make it necessarily a valid collective bargaining agreement if it's not ratified now\nYou have to look to agreements procedure too because in your main collective bargaining agreement your grievance procedure to find what a grievances and normally it's defined as a violation of the collective bargaining agreement already missed application or a misinterpretation of the collective bargaining agreement\nAnd when you have a side agreement\nThat it is the subject matter that is not in the collective bug and and that's not been ratified then one can argue that the grievance is not even substantively opera trouble in other words you cannot sue a grievance oversight agreement that's never been ratified in the first\nYou know it doesn't exist unless it's ... been hold on one second preview in regards to those leader attorney in Rhode Island is going to advocate for the city of work on this in this world reading agreements issue with this ideal\nA C I F outside deal with a euphemism was a good way just as just a comment about I guess it's a real thing\nBut you know side deals don't work unless the council sees him and according to the story in the journal of the council never saw the snowman and dimensions you didn't know anything about it we'll ask about that when and and and then what what will will ask been not about that specifically about what happens next\nIf you find yourself with a side agreement that's been acted on but never ratified what is the relief\nIs there any relief will come back we'll talk about back to my next\nThe markets have been volatile lately did you see put did you move your money out I'm Andy Smith
