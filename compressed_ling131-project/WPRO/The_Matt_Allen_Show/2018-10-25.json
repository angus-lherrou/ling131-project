Biden are similar and the parents to those sent to other prominent Democrats and the CNN\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio says the same holds true for a package intercepted that actor Robert De Niro his film company\nWho make money off creating a distorted view of reality\nEither to shock you to motivate you to evoke you to uh to anger you\nAnd we have these constant barrage of images and of and more and more importantly than even just images it's this um [noise]\nIt's this killed\nA it's an orientation of\nOf approach to the world's problems I find it I I I can tell you very impacted mentally or from the way that social media present things to people\nAnd cause I'm On it a lot and I hate it I really do wish I could just get off of it I I really I Can't I Wish I could\nUm Twitter's going to be the first one to go I think I'm I'm just I think I'm just going to take the take the plunge and just get out get off it would be done with it is just nothing positive on Twitter nothing ... or a cease marketed by killed I'd kill Twitter first hate it I think it's ... it's a sewer\nIts people over sharing getting involved the nonsense ... stupid things it just it is set up it's a it's like here's a hallway was trapped doors with various horrible things underneath them\nGo play when Dave Chappelle did that sketch\nIf you've heard I was a real place yeah what what would it would be that how are they would just be that I think it just be a whole hallway\nWhere there's traps doors that just have spikes and acid and crocodiles and horrible things underneath them there's really nothing Jim ... will let me ask you a question what's the last time you looked at Twitter and came away with a good feeling\nEver\nIf I use it for the good you have an opening here for work yeah it's a quick way of\nGetting news gathering thing right right right I get that I'm with you on that one that's that's the one positive part of a ... but even so with that have you ever walked away from your from a trolling through or a a a a tiptoe through Twitter and actually come away\nActually either at a fide or feeling good or you know with a better attitude about anything more information about something\nNope in a positive way nope never write I shall we one person who has\nA Twitter is a place where people go and pat themselves on the back for being on Twitter\nThe local Rhode Island media on Twitter is like is the most ... is it like a pack of fourteen year old little kids\nAnd some of them are pretty bad they're really bad I I don't ... every little thing they think I mean it it's just it's so ridiculous it makes me sick to my ... he's a professional people who are really smart and good people by the way but Twitter makes you crazy\nIncidents with about an hour or two\nIt's grim just pictures I think that's that's literally narcissistic horse manure that's your that's your narcissistic and you just like the look at yourself you dialed the vapid yeah I mean you're just not I mean there are some people and and you know I'm not going to do it 'cause I got to work in this poll making a pie in the pool kind of work here but there's some people that I mean deserved to be\n... by ... taken into their bosses offices in the local news media and and told you have got to grow up and knock off the look at me crap but unfortunately I think that the bosses won't do it because their bosses want them to do the stuff that's what creates the thing a social media crap that they can\nSpend money on we all have that pressure I hate it hate it with a passion and\nIt distorts reality folks think times you see your your favorite news channel of any kind of you have one\nI'm tweeting out stupid news stories about kids and kittens and doping nonsense and things that do nothing to promote any sort of newsworthy anything\nIt's just the way to get you to click on it that's it it's not news you know\nPolice officer finds kitty cats and a drain watch this shooting is is this news and then comes the comments why is this news wise this news was this news because you clicked on it that's why that's why it's it's not news if you cut down\nAnd the funny thing is when this happens on Facebook too and we have to manage the social media\nAnd so if you get a block from anything in our our social media platforms here it's because Doug blocked with\nPossibly may ... or some you know the ...\nIt's mostly but these are these people don't understand that when you when you respond who cares or or you do I is this news then all you're doing is you're you're\nYou're responding to it which is that all the all the loggers them wants you to do they don't care so you could you could you could fill out a a a two paragraphs dissertation or spelling out why\nIt's a terrible thing or why it's a great thing and make all the fantastic points in the ... in the in the world that you want but the more on roads who cares is is the same time you're you're doing the same exact thing is that is that thing is\nIt is really just turn it off it's really it really is a bad thing it's really bad and ah it has some uses I Can't say it's all bad it's like Ninety five percent bad or I should say it would be only be more generous eighty five percent bad\nFifteen Percent allows you to promote things like the mat Allen the uncut podcast we can go listen to my pod cast they have on our website six thirty WPRI dot com go check it out this week Jay halls from the ghost hunters shameless plug\nCheck that out oh back in the day was that created for you know you see your cousin on the other side of the country right through what your nephew was up to or whatever\nBut it's all degenerated to click bait nonsense into reactionary nonsense and to constantly so what is done in my opinion when it comes to especially when it comes to political sphere is that it has created a fun house mirror of reality that's the reality becomes distorted\nYou think that people who I think people speak in a distorted way they don't come across in nobody who's a trained writer anymore right nobody gets trained and being accurate in what they say they just have\nThere's no there's no inflection there's no voice tone there's no sarcasm that's able to be to hurt and if there's none of this stuff and so you take it and the worst possible way ... worst possible way that the other than what is intended\nAnd it's just about outrage porn the entire away outrage porn or or pulling your heartstrings so you get the view of the world that is\nDesperate that is surrounded by verging are enemies and horrible illness and so our political discourse\nThe only way you get to move to taste either be with somebody or against someone else is to ratcheted up all the time\nAnd that's you know I worked at a different radio station and I'm a news talk station and manage their social media and their Web assets as well and um [noise] you know we could have any kind of find the scores from any of the hosts or or or great content grid news content and anything that the uh\nThat was on there was outraged by rank of worried about a hundred and two one ... by hot chick of the week which was provided from the\nYou're right it's just it's just that's all I have a lot of friends so it's this one of those things now that distorted view of the world that comes along with that\nHas now it's like I said I think social media since yesterday is the is they hypothermia needle that the the venom of the world gets gets sent through to the veins of the public and this is a\nBad situation it gives you a distorted view of what everybody thinks about who your neighbors are um ... I I just I defy anybody to tell me why this is how this is done anything positive for us I think that this is what this is the our our political discourse in this country has plummeted\nBut in ... by I mean by by by leaps and bounds since the ... the inception of ... of social media and the adoption of social media by the ... politicians out there and so the solution is not them they aren't the solution I'm sitting here\nAnd I'm and I'm looking at I'm thinking the president's talking about President Trump is sitting there talking about how we have to stop demonizing each other and I'm laughing because\nHe demonized does everybody right so then who do you go to Hillary Clinton missed the ms deplorable or self they all do it there's nobody who's the moral leader on on let me let me ask you this question folks my numbers for three eight WNPR oh the toll free number one eight hundred three two one WPRI\nWho is the moral leader\nOn raising the political discourse in our country today in modern politics what elected official or politician right now can you point to that says oh that's the person we need to listen to that has the credibility to say that we should all get together and unite who has it\nOh wait for three eight WPRI the toll free number one eight hundred three to one that we ... who\nWho won a national level\nWe always and this is what's amazing to me we go to these people like we've point to them like they're supposed to do this for us they're supposed to they don't represent us any more I mean they do legally but they don't represent us\nWell we have to do is we have to stop the identity nonsense Democrat republics become like a new religion right\nBlack America white America gave our district America are men women write about about\nAll that stuff we have to start telling them this is the standard by which you will follow\nNot give us the standard to follow in other words we have to leave by we have to lead by ours by what we demand from them and the only way this country's survives is a renaissance of the individual where you're not some\nThe retired policeman reportedly called police after seeing pictures of the package bombs sent to CNN having recalled seeing a similar package address the De Niro\nThere was a manhunt on for whoever sent the packages so far which like ten of them up and found out there in the sprawling caravan of Latin American migrants hoping to make their way to the U.S has set up against forming a column more than a mile long trucking out of the town of pasta peck in southern Mexico\nDoubling the arrow sports the Celtics are playing tonight there in Oklahoma City to take on the thunder from the she's getting Christmas steak or whether center accuweather meteorologist ape Samuels says plenty of sunshine this afternoon but not that warm Ohio fifty here tonight the temperature approaching the record low of twenty seven that was in Nineteen Seventy six there was going to be a freeze\nLow twenty nine and tomorrow cool intervals of clouds and sun with a high of fifty one currently we have forty nine degrees here at the weather station and now we check in with the garden and\nFor the traffic [noise] from the w._b. our own center airs us a lot of insurance agency and regional traffic\nFlow on six eastbound just before the merger Ninety five north found\nSome work going on in the Newport bridge today so sluggish on both sides not too bad though the left lane taken at two Ninety five an adult borough so you're a slow on Ninety five north down and it crashed being cleared on twenty four south down in taunton by forty four watch out for that I'm David Gardner with yours a lotto insurance agency regional traffic\nSponsored by lows did you know the lows is now owned a craftsman you'll find an ever growing selection of mechanics and power tools tool storage and more in store and on line so whatever to your job demands Lowe's has just good tool for it lows the new home of craftsman\nLook smaller gatherings or large parties for him to one hundred and eighty again there were down in China in one respect\nFor the Senate didn't want to give one of\nVenus I can handle it off from wedding party in the area around munroe place in the dark with section and in fact the committee that can have an Internet gathering to weddings up to one of the gas and that's what being offered him has Peter Ing money a parking\nReally handicap edible seemed\nHere then called for six seven Seventy one years for six seven\nVisit our trainers dot com\nIf you've been putting off getting a hair restoration listen up this is what you've been waiting for diesel final hair restoration centers individual graph technique or I G G is a highly advanced scot free procedure that moves your own hair one follicle at a time without the use of ... or stages giving you a denser a more natural look\nNice to find O'Hare restoration center is the only practice in New England that performs this unique I.

just all platitudes it's almost like the it's almost like CNN and MSNBC and Fox News are going on or NBC and ABC it all these other news media outlets are going to are waiting for us to do the ... response so that they could say that we did it\nSo we better just do it even if we don't need it\nThat's where we get so that's where you get the president reading the teleprompter yesterday these are cowardly act they do not do well and then you gotta then you get Hillary Clinton she's sitting there all of this is a tough time in our society now I mean so they're not really being genuine they just going to check the box because the media says you should check the box\nAnd then the media will be like oh we didn't do any of that we don't do well not biased we're ah we're objective reporters looking for the truth okay sure you are please so who is it who's going to lead the who's going to lead to who's going to lead the revolution in the in the political discourse it make any ideas ...

I don't even know I mean they realize it but I don't know if they do it consciously or they just have found people that are willing to do that\nAnd get the desired result but the extremists are running the conversation on social media and in the in the uh in the news media I think a lot more than they should and\nYou know who has the credibility right now the political credibility you're going to have ... you'll have senators and congressmen will come out and they'll give you all kinds of the president all kinds of people do come out and give you a lip service about how we need to tone down the rhetoric and everybody needs to come together yet\nYou know as soon as it comes time to come together was coming together and being calm matters all the time not just after something horrible happened\nAnd so\nYou know this idea now to go to a Donald Trump started this up please please stop [laughter] it's just please stop you have I mean he's taken to a new ... new level I think that that's absolutely that's the that's the case um\nHe's ratcheted up but he hasn't started even start this this that we didn't start to fire that old song\nIt's always been burning and so\nIt's it feels worse because we have the fun house mirror of Facebook and ah and Twitter which is you know the fifth gateway to help a fifth level of hell\nI'm but this is if you have all these people doing this stuff I mean Hillary Clinton or Eric Holder said at the other day I'm Brock Obama had his versions of it the same way that I mean it\nJust nonsense nonsense that's gone on that's gone precipitously lower but the fact of the matter is it's always been there\nTo the point where I Can't think of one national\nSuppose it politician leader type person that could actually with credibility come up and say that we have to actually go ahead and raise the level of dialogue and our political dialogue to to avoid you know smashing each other in the face all the time in the end the ill will and the and the the resentment that goes along with it\nAnd I'm I'm that's what I'm asking you who is it who has the credibility right now who hasn't participated\nRight\nIt's kind of like a you know it's after a war who hasn't shot somebody\nWho hasn't committed an atrocity who hasn't done these things and\nYou know there's a war is hell with it you know they look to use the war metaphors in the war language in in politics all the time\nAnd\nYou know war is hell you weren't politics to be healthy if that's what I think is happening here ultimately is that we have to stop looking to these people to lead us in any way\nYou we hire them to do a job to make some decisions for us and stuff when it comes to being like the the uh the moral leader of the country or or people that show us an example of how to act and want to be like these people should be at the bottom of the blanket list\nIt's time for\nThe average every day you know what are they common that study we talked about last week the silent or the exhausted majority it's time for\nThe exhausted majority to take responsibility for leading everybody down the the proper moral path\n\nAnd for the people and the Democrats and Republican during dichotomy to to be relegated to to the public servant level that they're supposed to be go vote on things go whatever and you know we'll leave that leave us the discourse and figure out a treat each other you just go ahead and you know\nVote like you're supposed to vote or whatever I mean if we really have to expect more\nAnd call out the people on our side that overstep the bonds and we've been ... I think we have we've been bad about that because ultimately if if you call somebody out on your side\nYou're seen as being weak and or joining the other side like losing somehow\n... you know I don't know\nI I you tell me who is it who's gonna who you are going to try and find somebody to be the leader and this would it be to anybody I really do and I know and I don't think it's right I I see things go on and it just happens to me in a regular basis and come up at the bottom of the hour I mean when we come back from Nevada in the hour break\nI may get into this because it's I I almost don't want to get into it but I I think I have to they said some crazy news some stupid news nonsense\nThis story from yesterday I don't get to the but this this attorney general candidates and the compassion party saying the N word in front of students and the way it's been presented by the media and in the news\nAs ... it's just so bizarre to me it's bizarre like five different angles but it's it goes to show you how\nThe the the fun house mirror can mess with what actually the the truth of what actually happened\nMegan Kelly is kind of dealing with that right Megan Kelly is going to lose your show and\nShe's going to be like pay to go not work because [laughter] I ... in part because\nIn part of what happened\nWith her whole blackface comments which I don't think she meant black face in the traditional sense she met people blood dressing up in and\nAnd making themselves look to be like they might be somebody who was a black person rather than being there's a difference between dressing yourself up like somebody who might be black versus somebody dressing in blackface this is a difference there\nI don't think she was artful in creating the distinction between those two differences but now but everybody just assumes they think the worst possible scenario and they just go with it\nAnd it's like you you just ... it's there's this weird thing that's going on where it's because we have now beginning to think in click bait\n\nAnd that's part of the fun house mirror that we are going on due to social media and regular traditional media\nMostly cable news channels in my opinion based on what I've seen\n\nAnd national news media outlets because of their their their their inherent and an ever more so than uh than I think in the past or adoption of a left wing\nA
