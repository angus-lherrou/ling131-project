the rose I pulled the rental little and I gave her a kiss close my eyes gave her kids today that would be an aggression let's talk\nTo your romantic [laughter] yeah well\nIt's hard to believe that I was aggressive [noise] um you know that could be ... the term was an aggressive ...\nYou're right you're right that that that is precisely my point we are the kids are at such an impression when we look we want gentleman to be gentleman and we want young ladies to be young ladies and there's no room for for any sort of abuse or aggression but there is a hard wiring of of of the genders that does call for some level of\nBoy I'm moving to do the kiss deal like you buddy buddy and that and and we are completely completely destroying the poor and loving on Christmas there's already has a lot\nMore in the and the ironic thing is I've been kissing that girl every night for the last forty\nAnd that's I that's what I was gonna say I also had married a good idea I thought you know

I did want talk about judge Kavanaugh please do not think well I I agree with you a hundred percent you know he or she she doesn't have a life that\nShe is not supposed to be referring to herself as Dr that's number one okay I Do think that she's a very troubled the woman\nThat the second point I wanted to make I agree with you got a\n... one of you guys are a hundred percent but I don't think it had anything to do a judge Kavanaugh but she is not a doctor whites than Dr anywhere okay yes she's not she's not supposed to be using that as her title in our loan she perjured itself but\nThe other point okay who was who is the woman from a um oh the the one who had a a is a a judicial temperament I'm a I I I don't know I I've had\nThe ... illegal world ...\nFrom Alaska and by the way George George Kennedy I guess he's the one return or did not did not approve of his his his character and his demeanor so\nRight but um I have been in a courtroom I've been in high level or I'm not a lawyer\nThat but I've been in a like a play with already high level\nAnd they I Am telling you if a judge gets upset with like the outlook for example or if he's upset with the uh you know the the the anyone in the courtroom\nWhen they're on a leash on telling you they unleash\nOkay and I had the pleasure of actually walking a Supreme Court you know you don't argued before the Supreme Court it's basically the on and off um I got to go see them when I was in graduate school\nThey do washing the habit and you get go in and you get to go watch it and it actually read in a green light okay\nAnd the a boy who's going to quote argue he opens up it now and depending on how many ... like the show up that day they all start talking and they just like why into the guy\nLike ... and then then then the red lights on and he does that they've already made that once they decided to a a ... before the Supreme Court for president so anyone who said like ...\n... what he ... the way all the ... thing I mean\nNot a fan but I I mean I I Am telling you judges have done\nFor our high level and I thought for an ... okay\nI agree you know I Know yeah I don't date potato great great point and I can tell you I've been to a court hearing what I you know and and and I see exactly what he's talking about that at very well founded where I was I'm this many years ago when I was down in\nA specific caught and then and then the judge look to ride with the guy said it was within my power as I have you were arrested and then and a and a\nVery very abruptly said that to observe generally should posted a cool calm ...\nIs maybe a ... overstated in in in that this man again he would not be a good judge if you will not a human being first\nListen you go to the Supreme Court with going out to a break you go on the Supreme Court because you are a human being well\nAnyway as George ... this man's reputation he can never restore fully\nSo that was what they've done to know how one wrapping up will be back and open form island and then I'm going to have a little calling for die but was there with the open former you know don't let people get their first places we are here for you

what the money from ...\nIn the government gave you everything you have right now yeah oh yeah they're getting less and that was my point [laughter] 'cause you're very well spoken than I ... and I could tell you're a business guy and then so would be sent my question is\nYou seen a lot of them come and go right and I have seen a lot of change over here in Rhode Island so we've got a situation

uh I have an interesting conversation last night Chris if I may mhm so you may I got a little a little\nConfused so I I think what this is a good point so somebody called me last night and asked me about the Senate if if\nYou vote Senate by what you do congressional by the district well even though the Senate district wanted Senate district to Rhode Island him a bobsled does is running for Senate the whole state can vote for him because he represents the whole state\nIn from ... if I understand this correctly yeah there's no northern and there's no southern and really and then because\nUnlike the represented because think about jak reach terms it doesn't have the two more years till two more years so we hope for Jack Reed them so they're very rarely on the ... the the the ballot together yeah okay so it's not like we have a choice\nOr we've had the primary we we could pick by plane as the primary so therefore you can vote for him\nStay why don't they why they why is against White House yeah sure but yeah like well yeah because I was I I I was looking at the maps of the kept come up and said our maps are one or two which was representative district one represented to\nThat and and it says we each each state and you think about it each state so to clarify this each state only gets two senators right so California even the size they are only gets two senators\nSo there's only a hundred or so it is not district is like the rally shot district or so people ... people need to keep that high when it comes to the senatorial races that's why I just figured I Do a little public wasn't sure he could vote\nRight I'm In a in that rich or not you\nHave local news or you are right is laying the wood on brown right now in the fourth quarter forty one and nothing are you are really ramps of four and one soon to be ...\nForeign ... we have to take it on the indigenous people yeah [laughter] why are you know a portion of actual\nLet's rally around us to a university had a great run into the NCAA championships and now that they seem to be turned things around the new football on side of things and are looking to go for one so that was a program that they were even talk in a few years ago ... years ago about scrapping in a dish on some life so ah\nGo we had a little quagmire that's we you know in the front page of the journal down there in a a a representative Bob ... year ends up on the front page of the journal and it seems that he's been using\nA people that work in the state has to do is political\nCause a political work and uh which I think is a is a big job I guess a vote pilots that that's not supposed to happen like I was supposed to happen and uh it's funny because ah the gentleman's it's Ronnie ... is a is a Chris my way\nOr from um perhaps the ... and Chris has been out a beating the pavement in a given at a run against Lance it Chris is running as a Democrat okay uh and uh he's called ... or we're gonna have a little conversation with them so miss them away Chris good afternoon welcome to the show\nGood afternoon with the college how are you sir what good thank you can ask Chris good afternoon Chris how're you doing an welcome to the hot like Oh thank you very much thank you yeah I was taking my call thirty days to go how we doing about\nAll I think it's about thirty one already one okay 'cause you ... seconds who's who's\nCounting right I mean uh you know losing losing weight and and wearing the weather off the news every night but it's uh it's pretty good it's a lot a lot of work though it really is a lot of work in a lot of time\nTo me about anybody who runs and we you know we we you know we take some shots at some people and some people certainly running that don't don't have good intentions but most people do and it's a great it's it's in this climate it's it's a calling and we applaud you and others do it\nVery much banker bachelor stepping up knowing it affect you and why are you running buddy [noise]\nWell I just I feel as though it's it's a new time we need to change Cranston\nWe need to at least change district school you know I'm a ... as as you guys uh well no I'm a you know I'm a small business person and my husband and my father and ah you know we need we need to create a better get now if we don't our children are going to be what they're not gonna have anything like that but I Hope we get it going to do without my kids and everyone else get\nYeah and and ah\nSo your your vision here you're you're you're you're you're running against an incumbent\nOr not you know which way you you were him one time before this is your second time around to crush you ran against rep literally the last time what's what's different this time maybe a little more preparation a little more a hindsight in terms of what it may take this time versus last time [laughter]\nYeah I mean I'm I'm I've been out a little bit early I think I'd do walking and the very beginning of July [noise] um I I'm a more knowledge now I mean I understand what it's like to run a campaign I'm getting I'm a little more help from my friends and family people that want to volunteer I think people that have\nSeeing how uh well like the last time as as basically no uh NO NAME out there and people want to push me over the egg and I'm just I introduced myself to the people of district sixteen every night\nOr for a few hours every night and you know when it when it comes back out of what's really getting earlier and earlier I walked eight o'clock at night now I'm only walk until\nYou know about Fifteen twenty people don't wanna they don't want to let you get\nA knock on doors are certainly don't want to answer that does want the ... the mind is a yeah it's\nSo much energy you recently made a statement about the opera law whether you're proposing but this thing up the army you know well\nWell I mean I I think it's more a statement about it it's a statement that I Want to make about transparency within I met 'em over study and and checks and balances within the three branches I mean this isn't about anyone department Mike or for instance\nYou know what I'm proposing is if legislators that are looking for information on anything to deal with oversight he shouldn't be charged for these documents I don't care what the big ... what are they trying to get for instance\nA ... minute a little bit but you guys if someone was looking to get certain documents or any documents that might exist regarding the truck boat\nFault I hear that you guys would totally understand that the legislator or legislators that are looking for those documents certainly shouldn't be charged by our government by you\nSo that's what it's about it's not it it's just about transparency about ... you know with a check and balance on it and you know what the statement I made this just happened to be about the executive branch but it it really is\nYeah our our our our ... our experience was a it was it was if you were ... you know looking for documents that were contrary to the the agenda of the state house Chris in the past it was a he was a very ... again it but you get in a time into the choosing and you know you get\nYou get a lemon boxes of documents a you know for a couple of pages of\nVienna today but she picks through it in a middle finger two years so yeah I mean it's that's should not be part of the Senate should it should be equal time for or against or whether you're an insider uh your your your organization like gosh\nThat was very very much opposed to a to a ... a policy and we were going to church around a little bit so you're that's a that's a great great maneuver for everybody\nSo yeah I mean you know people\nDon't have the money and and the time and and the effort to fight all those all those obstacles and we need to eliminate that's all\nYou know should should be free to anybody I mean I see so I think it's a ... right to get access to documents if they require All right next thing so um ... you began to education\nYou know ... you're trying to focus you know is the thing on a ... which what what do you propose again if you go to and what what what type of change is going to make what are you looking forward to doing here ... what are you going to try to do\nWell I mean education as ... and a lot of people say but I've been I've been following this at the door and I've been I've been telling everybody I mean when they asked me the same question just asked my education investment a future you know we're just across the state that do a very difficult job and they're doing it very well\nBut we you know as a state we need to invest it in small class sizes and improve facilities I mean that's what it's about that flight I you know I personally I Am going to support the ah the school facilities bond that two hundred fifty million dollar bond that on the um that will be on the ballot\nDistrict ...\nDistrict Corker

L. I. D. emphasis on\nFinancial S. as in services dot com there are white pages there are videos on this and it it ... through original that's a and B it's they don't dive into supplemental jihad don't dive beyond I understand a and B once you understand the first part of the puzzle\nThe rest of the phones together very very simply because you've already been trained on it from your employers it's absolutely amazing when you're talking about moving in to be when you move into beat\nIf I'm going to have my employer's plan for life and there is a good chance I'm going to you don't have to have be because your employer will pick it up you'll have to pay that premium from your employer but not to the U.S government now if you don't have faith in your employer or you're never intend to take your be with you recommendation Ninety nine present time is Dubai be\nBy at sixty five so that you don't have to pay the penalties or premium increases once again just marketing term they call it a penalty to get you to buy it so if you don't need it don't buy it but if you needed by it because later in life is going to be more expensive\nYeah that's exactly it and and the expense is one of the is that big component because it's more an idea of how do I pick my coverage and make sure I'm fully covered\nAnd the other ideas how do I actually pay for it and this is a conversation I was having with Mike over the weekend Michael's referred to us from Eighteen tea and he's been with the company for the last Thirty years and he's he's ready to retire but his biggest concern is is he going to be able to cover his medical for himself and his wife dead\nAs we started talking I can see intends up as we got to the subject of medical so I asked them what are you looking to accomplish by talking with me today\nHe looked down at the table and he said I'm worried my wife's medical needs are going to get worse and I won't have enough to cover any increase in the medical expenses\nShe has some conditions on our life threatening but they can cause some issues down the road when Mike is going through was all too common with baby boomers the fear of unknown expenses that can cause you to focus\nOn only the issue and not be able to see the answer even if it's right in front of you might do the right thing by asking for help I turn to Mike and they said let's talk about what you have available for your retirement and what you actually want to accomplish in that time and over the next few conversations we were able to talk about what my could plan for himself as well as what accounts were available to\nFund his goals overall he'd done a great job saving for retirement so between us for when canes brokerage accounts he had enough to cover his day to day expenses and if you add in his pension that was available as well as the Social Security\nHe was going to be in good shape what was missing was how to distribute his money so we never felt that he didn't have enough\nSo we went through his financial stress test and it showed him that by using his pension and Social Security to cover his basic necessities he continues his brokerage accounts for predictable expenses such as a bucket list goals and then set is four one K. for flex will use this would allow is money to continue to grow to cover\nInflation in those unexpected medical expenses my couldn't have been more relief knowing he had a plan and a guide to help them make the right choices was exactly what he needed here you could financial services we believe you need to know how much you can and will be able to spend every\nSingle weekend retirement that you need to know without a shadow of a doubt that you have enough money to last no matter how long you live these are questions you must get the answers to before you retire while there's still time to prepare and make sure that your money last as long as your retirement does the team\nIs going to be pretty predictable threw out your retirement that's where the disconnect with the retirement planning comes in because well what about those unexpected medical expenses it's really just as you get older how much more services that you need and where does that money come from\nI think those are the anxieties yeah so when you're working when you're when you're sixty sixty two sixty three sixty four sixty five and still working you have this false but very secure idea that my health insurance my Blue Cross Blue Shield covers everything including nuclear war\nIt's all in their ... and ... it's just not quite true but we but we believe that and I and I I true Josh wealth your health insurance I have this false sense of understanding that everything\nIs covered under my my plant which I Know deep inside it's not yet but when we start to retire and we have such a a change of life and we have such a change of what's going to happen it's such an upheaval of well already thought through plans this one is we'll kind of a nightmare because\nWhat if I get sick what if I really get sick what if I get something pretty awful and then we go to dinner we start talking about everything that's pretty awful yeah is my health insurance got covered in the answer's yes you can change your plan halfway through yeah\nAnd I think the the other point is in order to be comfortable with your health insurance plan and being comfortable with your medical expenses you just have to make sure that your income for retirement is lined up and you know where you're guaranteed income is you know we are predictable and companies and you know where you're flexible\nIncome is because that's what's going to allow you to adjust for life as it changes view because when you first go into retirement you're going to be the healthiest you've ever been but as you get older things are going to cost more because you're older it's just it's the way life is its nature so we actually believe here you could financial services\nThe beginning point of any retirement plan is to create a stable foundation that maximize your retirement income in a predictable fashion so the starting point is to optimize your Social Security benefits because at\nFace value you can leave tens of thousands of dollars on the table but by employing a few little known strategies it's possible to generate as much as a hundred thousand dollars or more in additional lifetime

I Know I Know Bob before the break we were talking about what to do with your original Medicare senior party and your heartbeat so I Want to pick up what happens\nAfter you've turned sixty five you've blown up the cake you've gotten your red white and blue card in the mail and you've officially retired and gone into the sunset now we have to pick out\nThe next tier of Medicare right 'cause we've already talked about a and B now we gotta talk about just supplemental you see in the coverage and that's your regular health care companies like Blue Cross Blue Shield your United\nYeah when you're talking about supplemental let's actually to find that so if you are already retired\nThere aren't a lot of terms for this there's met a gap there supplemental there's parts see there's all this is all the same thing if that is super confusing to you and I'm Talking super confusing to give me a call\nFor one Seventy seven to seven to seven once again this for a one Seventy seven to seven twenty seven twenty seven\nWe will walk you through exactly what that means those are just marketing terms for the combined or supplemental or additional\nFrom a and B it's see it's just the additional coverage it is Blue Cross like man he was saying it is United it is the ... the Humanae the you name a company it's out there they're they're trying to sell more so when it comes down to what plan is right for you there's nine plans out there\nThey're all the same the names are different to protect the the innocent but they're literally the same so when you go buy them\nFind the one that works for you by the services you need not by the alphabetical letter that\nIt that it portrays you can have a bigger letter it doesn't mean it's better for you just find the services you need the one thing I think I Want to talk about the supplemental that comes in the office lot\nIs what if I picked the wrong supplemental ... I Want to address that for a little bit many\nAnd well actually this is a conversation that I was actually having at one of our dedication meetings I I was talking with Wayne and Kathy last week and as we were sitting down to go through our annual dedication\nIn this world is different they were both ready to retire this year God he was finally had enough of the hospital was ready to lead and so our goals to walk through all the time lines of when they switched from being employed to fully retired and so as we were talking they can from their retirement date but they didn't seem to be as excited about is I Would have expected\nIt so I turned to them and I said well is everything okay is it something else we need to cover and they looked at each other for a moment and Kathy spoke first she said I'm worried that our medical coverage won't cover is completely and we won't have the money to pay for now this is a valid fear\nWhat caffeine when we're feeling as well all baby boomers go through when they realize are actually retiring\nOutside of income medical expenses or the number one fear heading into retirement\nSo the easiest way to overcome it is to walk through what do you need for coverage and then lining up to what your income is going to be and so I looked at him and I said I understand what you're going through let's walk through what your coverage will actually be so once you both retire your primary coverage is going to be original Medicare part a and B this'll be paid directly from your Social Security benefit\nNext will be supplemental coverage and that'll be your Blue Cross a United\nAnd this will fill in what your original Medicare doesn't cover plus your prescriptions and this'll be big with the income we budgeted from your Social Security benefits\nAnd your eye on race because we can pick the plans based on your medical history and your needs we can predict the cost of premiums Kobe's inductive bulls last if there's any out of pocket expenses that we talked about that are planned for we have flexible money to be used so doesn't disrupt your entire income plan\nAs we went through the steps and reviewed the original plan I could see

... both of them are respectively a asked me if I Would do it if they kept the bits off\nThat role and of course it has to be an independent office so you have to put your money where your mouth is I Would be willing to do it as long as it had the independence that it needed I was happy that Mr ... said during the debate that he wants an inspector general\nGina Raimondo hasn't weighed in on it yet but I see this as an opportunity to really get an office that is desperately needed in government and independent office to chase down fraud and abuse and government\nSo you're saying if Joe ... you say yes\nI Would say yes because I Do I Believe him to be watching him for the years that he's been in political life that his word is as bond\nSo if he says he's going to keep his Mitt so off the office I and that you have the right to do it independently and let the chips fall where they may I Believe him I Believe that ... that is a a pet uh Morgan as well\nAll right what about Alan ... if he asked\nWell I Would want to have that conversation with him a relative to that office needless to say is you know because I was attorney general I care\nVery very much about word for Smith and the uh the Cranston police office uh offices report done by the violence they please is particularly troubling ... some of the comments that\nMake about is that the parents and the police department\nI'd be happy with the family and friends and I don't know whether that's ultimately true or not I would want to speak to him about it and say you know a kind of guarantee Siberia and tell me about that why did they come to this conclusion so that you can make a judgment whether somebody is truly going to\nAllow that off has to be independent and not the same same conversation were to occur with Gina Raimondo I Would have the you know the same conversation\nBecause she's taking some action is that I don't particularly like either a so\nMuch has Arlene such as ...\nWell ... you know I don't think she's forthcoming uh all the time there's a lack of transparency in in the office the media has to uh you know pull out the canine teeth out of her head before they get an answer\nSometimes a very legitimate questions\nSo all of that kind of stonewalling potentially a science that I Would find troublesome so when it comes to those two candidates that have to be a deep discussion but I Would be happy if they had an office of inspector general doesn't have to be me whatsoever I have plenty to do in my life has\nNot understood Eileen violent is on the line\nBut when I'm a little bit concerned about is your name did come up yesterday so are they using your name or are they speaking with you\nKnow they both both of them including Joe trailer didn't facts speak with me and uh and during the course of that conversation obviously\nI asked him the very same questions or that you've heard me allude to right now and that is that all of his be independent uh again ah you ... you know and he got Medicaid come running in and I'll be half of their friends or even on behalf of big government\nSay oh don't make my department of health and Human Services look bad you know if they have a misspent hundreds of thousands of dollars don't make D.C Wyeth look bad don't make\nYou know the fact is an inspector general has to be totally independent and have the right\nTo look into a house state money is used or abused it cannot have political interference\nWell that leads me to ah and and I didn't I understand what you're saying you're going to have the conversations if in fact that that that it's warranted a but yesterday Joe ... and represent of Morgan were saying that Alan song is flawed he's corrupt\nAnd he's saying that they are the insiders since we get into all this name calling you did mention that you would have a concern about the ... and the police report with is the police were called in do you think that Ellen fun is corrupt that's the word they're using\nI wouldn't need to examine that with him on my own I and I would most certainly cause I'm than really obviously with that report I read it when it first came out\nA as well as obviously as being a reference now\nBut I Would want to go over with the chapter and verse to say this is what the conclusions are and I still have excellent relationships with X\nDate policemen by the way and then and I would certainly get a their insights as well as to what did it didn't lead to that conclusion I as you know a former head of the state police uh\n... not miss a diary a O'Donnell sort of a downplayed that a little bit saying that might have been the writers conclusion\nHe wouldn't go that far you know is to say uh uh that uh it was run by the mafia that was the statement that he a mafia like in the way you know ... the office of chief and the department was being run so I I obviously would want that kind of input but it is a warning sign tower I mean\nYou know when when for example government is not transparent and\nThe media has to jump through hoops to get records that they're entitled to have all of that a warning signs and as opposed to with a Morgan ... from my perspective they've always been forthcoming and transparent and their dealings in politics\nIf you had to make a prediction and you were with me or my goodness during the whole Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump we were here on election night now all hours of the night with David layman as well and you called it you were going state by state saying if this turns for ... and you were going down the map and I thought oh my goodness\nIf I could only follows her around you know be five minutes on a five minute delay [laughter]\nWe could be calling the shots here how do you see this governor's race she was going to have an awful lot to be governor ...\nWell I as you know when you're a ... or an incumbent and you have tons of money you're really hot to tip over\nSo the starting point it becomes a herculean task for any of the opponents to unseat the present incumbent who has lots of money so that's the issue number one but anything can happen is you know there's a headline today about these the Y. F.\nAnd or a bad report that the feds gave it yeah of course the context of all of that is\nEvery state's D.C Wyeth had problems and it has been some progress at least made in the last couple of years it usually takes five to seven years according to most experts people don't see that you know the detail they just go by what the headlines that stuff and the race like this absolutely anything can happen but\nHaving said all of that it's hard to unseat a well financed incumbent\nEileen violet is on the line Arlene I Would love to pick your brain if I could if you can hold on to the break I have one question and I wonder if you wanted to weigh in on the Brett Kavanaugh the first test smoke coming up probably within an hour or so sure okay perfect Arlene violence on the line will continue coming up what her thoughts are on the Brett Kavanaugh case how that was handled when we come back\nTalk six or Ninety nine seven W.

B. R. O. B. one featuring an hour and a long way\nHe joins me on the line this morning Cranston mayor Allen fun good morning mayor Fung on this Friday morning how are you are more into how're you doing I'm doing quite\nWell you heard it I'm sure you heard of you had your own event yesterday was talking about that and just a moment 'cause I Want to get some details on that I'm Joe ... pulled you corrupt and has yet to come out and say ah how is he going to back that up what is your take on that\nChose a blowhard we heard him you know at the debate are making similar allegations that are on corroborated uh the one thing that we all know is that all of your listeners uh no but you can't win\nYou know the real question that people are fast forward yesterday's announcement which by the way was Bob from any game changer because\nYou know we've been through this all along and endorsements don't matter what really matters is making sure that we get our message out about the corruption that is really happening up at that state house and we don't need any more state house insiders uh like Joe trail oh like Patricia Morgan cutting deals\nWith our governor you know one really has to question\nYou know what is Joe what is Patricia really getting out of it you know what the old at the end she cope with Governor Mondo because we've seen historically because those to walk the state for over two decades now them even supporting the governor on her pass budgets with the millions in corporate welfare and expanding our sales tax\nAnd you you met a mere ... here's the thing\nOr if it's your turn will continue to say he's corrupt without backing it up then I think the theory is if I keep saying it over and over again maybe people will start to believe me if you keep saying there's a deal with Governor Romano you're kind of doing the same thing right off I keep saying it over and over but we really don't know if there was a deal people may start to believe me do you see why people are getting frustrated\nPeople are getting frustrated because of what's going on on this pill for years and that's what Joe trail and Patricia Morgan represents\nYou know and like I said endorsements don't matter what really matters is the people that have been hurt by governor Raimondo a them\nYou know kids that are still waiting for the benefits families still waiting for 'em you know their food stamps and the like uh what people you know seniors waiting for nursing home benefits or because of you hit disaster you know we've seen the um the corruption that was going on from our governor with D.C why I've\nI've got proof of what the governor has done mismanaged government hurt so many others that's why we need new leadership if Joe and Patricia of afraid of the real change real reform that I Will bring just like what I've done in crafts and turn it around then so be it\nA mayor fun is on the line I Know people have asked you this they've asked you ... it just seems to be such animosity between the two of you have you been in the same room and someone step on the other one's tone did you take his date at the problem I mean what is going on\nYou know I don't know what's going on with Joe why he hates me so much you know because you have a big word\nI won't give 'em anything what general Mondo did look Joe's at a history of deal cutting up at the state house for sixteen years I don't promise jobs with support I don't promise contracts at all I don't do any of that I own nobody but I Know that probably frustrate the garlic Joe\nSo be it you know I Am going to shake things up and that is from day one of a a former minister version\nI went to fix you I Would have put incompetent people that's my record a joke and just keep blowing his Hadiya but you know the listeners know that he has no shocked when the vote for Joe trail is going to be nothing more than a goal for general Mondo in this fame for years of a nap leadership that we've seen so far\nAll right mayor Allen song if I could put you on hold I Want to play for the listeners because I Know you want to have something to say about this representative Patricia Morgan was on this morning with gene Dallas anti and she I think she tapped danced around this whole situation of of a phone call on primary night or the hours following\nUm uh Ellen's on winning the primary beating Patricia Morgan who called whom who asked for who's endorsement there's some confusion here and there's accusations of lying so this is what she said this morning with gene\nString off this phone call that island fungus you had where he did he did he did he ask you for the endorsement outright\nHate was thinking might north meant\nAnd what did he say Hi pat listen it's all over let's get together what do we sided\nConversation private conversations not private you know that [laughter] just let it\nSo that he all he did ask you and obviously you turned him down\nI I Am not endorsing Alan ... for governor that's correct\nThat's to me ah having been an interviewer for twenty something years that's a very frustrating back and forth because uh we gotta we want a straight answer so can we get a straight answer from you Alan ...\nAbsolutely that was an imaginary conversation and you hear the hesitation of Patricia his voice over the last time I talked with Patricia Morgan was when she called to concede on primary night and it was a quick conversation that was it and I really that conversation that night so all that was in the ...\nI Know it's tough so I gave her a few days and then reached out to her once by text and I still have that text two days afterwards\nAnd then when she didn't respond I reached out again\nAnd nothing but by the way I'm smart enough because I anticipated this I Know how insiders were you know I had what I made that phone call to reach out again I had people that were by my side as I left that message\nNo time since primary and I have I've spoken to a Patricia Morgan so that's just pure fiction\nAnd this is this is getting a kind of it is getting a little bit ridiculous but I I think if people want to know so when you say you you send a text nothing then you called and you have people with you left a message in that message did you ask for her endorsement\nOh asked I asked for support absolutely because you know it's our I ask what's the difference mayor what's the difference\nEndorsements support however you want it freezes the same thing but the bottom line it is a I did reach out and there was never a conversation but who cares tower the bottom line is is\nI'm willing to make that change necessary at that state house you know and we all know you know I'd love to have everyone together even four years ago can block it took them a little time but he came by my side we had a press or at the state house talking about what we need to do\nI did and that's why I was reaching out because we have to be you know we can't have these factions going on a 'cause look we have to be United because the real problem in this state is governor Raimondo you know we can't continue on another four years I'm the only candidate that can be or Joe troll can't win\nAll your listeners do that so the bottom line is we've got to keep turning things around in on that agent for change\nAll right so just to wrap up the phone call and whenever you said he had its its semi Alan and I love you support that do\nNothing I never had a conversation with\nHer I mean ... what did you say you you say I Love your support or can I when I turned ...\nNo I just follow up on the tax all I all I left a message to our was yeah Hi Pat a hope you got my tax from a couple of days ago I Know it's not easy love to speak with you about your support give me a call when you're right that was it plain and simple\nI Know other top Republican leaders I had also reached out to her absolutely and I she didn't get back so\nAnd they write it's summer she did speak with others she did speak with others you know others had reached out as well\nAnd the bottom line is even to those others you know she didn't you know she wasn't making a commitment but I Move on because ultimately it's about saving our state from governor among those mismanagement and incompetence and the people that she's for\nI've got a real plans to reform D.C Wyeth reform you have put in the specter general make sure that we are turning government back around for us the little guys and one island\nOr even earlier in the conversation ... ... you said uh you know indoor since don't matter if you mean just Patricia mortgage endorsement because if somebody comes along and says hey I Want to support you you know we've got to get the Republicans back in the office of the governor you're not going to say hey that endorsement doesn't matter if it's somebody fabulous oh\nI'm asking for everyone support but here's a prime example Patricia Morgan also recruiting and supported showing a law against the fries and not run a couple of years ago how did that work out for her\nLook what's gonna really matter as me getting out there in the neighborhoods talking about my mission my vision for turning around without my plans to turn on and that's what I've been focused on day one everyone knows that Joe has none of that he just the blowhard\nA that really just wants to you know the things that are uncorroborated he cannot win\nOn the real candidate in this race or anything but a vote for me is going to help get Gina Raimondo back in in four more years of in confidence and hurting round there\nAre you doing some polling a mayor from\nI haven't done any polling we're going to you know right now we are having a people out in the neighborhoods you know a field director is a leading teams out there knocking on doors identifying voters we are going to do what we need to to get our message out and drive out the vote", "year": "2018",
