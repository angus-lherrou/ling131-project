{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WPRO", "content": "So I Am pleased to participate in this announcement that a suspect is in the custody of the FBI I Want to remind everyone to defend it in this case as in every case is innocent until proven guilty he has been charged today\nWith five federal crimes including interstate transportation I'm an explosive illegal mailing of explosives\nThreats against former presidents and certain other person's threatening interstate communications and assaulting current and former federal officers\nFor these charges a defendant faces up to fifty eight years in prison\nThese charges may a change or expand as the investigation for sees\nThis is a law and order administration we will not tolerate such lawlessness specially not political violence\nAnd so I Want to thank FBI Director ray and his team all of our law enforcement partners who are here ATF Secret Service postal inspectors Capitol police\nUh in New York City police department and the United states attorney environment on the southern district of New York and us attorney for the southern district of Alabama already on a Russian\nFederal state and local law enforcement officers from across this country responded immediately to the cause and contributed to this effort we are proud of each one of them I Want to read or write to defend it in this case is innocent until proven guilty\nBut let this be a lesson to anyone regardless of their political beliefs that we will bring the full force of law against anyone who attempts to use threats intimidation and outright violence to further and agenda\nWhere you will find you we will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law and now director right or who's done an incredible job leading this effort over the last few days he will give us the details of today's important arrest Chris [noise]\n\nFederal officials talking about the investigation the arrest of a suspect in the pipe bomb a mailing\nAs the attorney general as confirmed we have arrested sees are say ah\nIn connection with this investigation as our investigation is still ongoing I may not be able to answer questions about his background or or about his motive\nWhat I can say is that this was a nationwide investigation of enormous scope of the greatest importance our investigation ranged from New York\nTo Delaware to Maryland to the district of Columbia to Florida to California\nAnd as it always does the FBI responded with every resource we've got including our joint terrorism task forces are counterterrorism division and our world renowned experts at the FBI lab in Quantico\nBut but and I really can't underscores is enough we did not act alone as you can see from the agencies and departments represented up here today\nA threat of this scope of this magnitude requires all of us working shoulder to shoulder and today's arrest is a testament\nTo the strength of our partnerships and what we can do when we all work together\nI Want to acknowledge the many partners who helped in recovering and transporting these IDs to our lab\nMonica this is dangerous and highly skilled specialized work\nRequires great care and were incredibly grateful to all those who helped us in that effort and getting those devices to our lab from around the country\nWe can confirm that Thirteen IDs were sent to various individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe\nA small clock a battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives in material they give off sheet an energy through a reaction to heat shock or friction\nThough we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nI Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work a lot of folks at the FBI lab based on their initial analysis they uncovered they lightened fingerprints from one of the envelopes containing an ID that had been sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters\nWe have confirmed this fingerprint is that the seas are saying\nThere is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected from pieces of two different IDs mailed in separate envelopes and sample previously collected from say Iraq in connection with an earlier arrest down in Florida\nThis is phenomenal work with the greatest pressure\nUnder an incredibly tight timeframe\nWe see unbelievable work like this on TV and in Hollywood but to see it up close and reality is something to behold and we are so proud of our team at the lab for their work and keeping people safe and helping us to find the individual responsible\nLate last night we also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation of\nThis DNA connection and we want to thank them in particular for they're very quick work also want to thank the men and women of the FBI's counterterrorism division who remain on high alert every\nDay to try to keep the American people safe from harm and who move quickly and efficiently into action every single time today's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages in transit now an other packages on\nSo we need the help of everyone out there every citizen everyone in law enforcement everyone we've got\nTo help with this investigation in the days to come if you've got any information please call us on our tip line that one eight hundred call FBI or our email line tips dot FBI dot Gov\nNo piece of information is too small every tip could be the one that leads to something very important and of course if you see something suspicious suspicious activity please call your local authorities we need all hands on deck we need to stay vigilant\nFinally I Want to thank our partners too many to name from across the country because we cannot do this work alone everyone up here today understands that and\nWe take that to heart every single day as we do the hard work together a protecting three hundred and twenty five million Americans now I'd like to turn the podium over the commissioner O'Neill from then what\nDid that was Christopher raised the the head of the FBI Director talking about science arrest of a man that grabs actually within a year and every one of the men and women are the\nNYPD quite frankly all the people in New York City I Want to
