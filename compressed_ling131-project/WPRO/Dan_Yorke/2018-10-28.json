{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WPRO", "content": "I'm willing to say clearly they're going to be much higher than they are today because of where the federal deficit is has been building up\nNot just for one president but multiple presidents over the decades you know it's been building up it's not anybody you can point to currently it's been building up for many many many years so it's important to understand that and understand that if taxes go up\nYou're going to pay a lot more in taxes from your retirement accounts we have strategies to help you kind of\nIn the long run reduce your tax exposure so it's about wealth preservation and wealth transfer that we talk about a lot from our clients to their family\nSo having a well thought out retirement plan intrigues you I'm number of years for a one three three three eight thousand\nIf you save two hundred thousand or more for your retirement please give us a call we'd love to sit with you\nSee what your vision and goals are for the future and if we might be able to provide some assistance with that if we feel we have a chance then we'll gather your statements do a full report and come back in a couple of weeks and say look here's what we see here's what's good here's what we feel might be able to be improved\nAnd then you decide what you want to do it from there are number again for a one three three three eight thousand if you save two hundred thousand more of your retirement we look forward to your call\nJeff when you have that strategy and you you're looking at that road map I Would think having an actual strategy something that we can refer back to that is really going to keep people on on the right course her retirement\nAbsolutely you know becomes a lot easier to stray off course when the stock market is behaving rather unpredictably\nBy off course I mean people tend to make financial decisions in the moment that might not be in line with their long term goals\nSo having a formal strategy and plays helps you refer back to it and say oh yeah that's right you know we did talk about there can be some ups and downs um that portion so we're not going to jump out the window because things aren't that bad you know and so having that they're sick of it as as a\nProviding a certain level of comfort to you because you know it's part of the plan and you know it's been addressed\nYou know not having a financial strategy for retirement just helps you to know all the noise you know the day to day week to week movements of the market and of course the media attention that is paid to them and I keep in mind when it comes to the media\nAre they telling you like all good stuff no their job is to get your nervous so that you tune in whether that's on a TV show a radio show even or the newspaper their job is to try to get your back\nAnd get gets you connected so that you're constantly turning on the TV show listening to the radio show or reading the newspaper\nSo when you have a plan you can say yeah we have a plan we've got a professional taking care of us were in good a good place we can kind of relax a little bit let the professionals do their job and we're our job is to have fun retiring [laughter] that's your job when you retire\nA big picture financial strategy that is a great thing to have a leading up to during retirement and and pretty much at any stage of your life for that matter so get do you suggest that we sit down and we hammer out a strategy on our own is that ever had that idea\nWell you know if you listen to the media you know do a YouTube or Google you can do it yourself with pretty much everything you know there was there was a story of of a doctor who was up at the north pole and his appendix burst and he was yelling when there\nHe had to operate on himself oh dear I don't know if people remember that would literally\nI had to take out his own appendix 'cause he was the only one there otherwise he would have died now let's face that is the ultimate do it yourself kidding not that he had a choice but my God that's not what you want to do with your investments for your retirement lifespan 'cause we're looking at making key decisions that\nAre not just for this month this quarter or this year we're talking about potentially two or three decades that can be impacted by decisions you do or do not make appropriately now\nSo what's most important is to sit with the professional that specializes in retirement income planning\nBecause that's the most important thing that you can do so that you have a plan put together that will help keep you focused on the long run and less focus on the day to day ups and downs in the market because we know the market will do both oftentimes that does both in the same day\nRecently there was a big drop like five hundred points midday and then it corrected most of it but it was still down at the end of the day but those are big swings and those I think it's just my personal opinion I think it's more of the traders that are causing those bigger swings\nThat's just my opinion and computerized a programmed trading happens at certain levels so if the market drop a certain amount\nAutomatically computers are selling things and if it goes down to a certain level again they'll buy back in and it's all pre program so how can the the quote unquote little guy compete with that it's very difficult to do\nYeah great show today as always any final thoughts for us\nWell diversification is key in the different types of answers that you're using and the different tax a position whether it's pre tax money your after tax money non retirement plan money\nHaving all diversification all those areas makes your plan that much more solid in a workable as you go forward\nOur number here at Massey and associates say is for one three three three eight thousand we look forward to your call if you save two hundred thousand or more for your time\nAs always making you know the the our flies by I have such a blast with you [laughter] you know sharing all this information so please listeners tell your friends you know when you're listening and what station and you're

I think they're great and I'm I'm a big fan of photovoltaic and yeah I like it a lot\nOkay that you know the folks you learn something every day when you hang around with smart people I did not know about the shingles on the roof because that's that is something the solar panels ... you know speaking as a realtor that's an issue because\nThe federal government um if a lot of times these solar companies they put the panels on there is no money out of pocket to the homeowner [noise] but there's a long term lease it doesn't leave the house but there's a UC the filing\nUniversal commercial code filing which is a lean a debt owed by the homeowner [noise] and the uh F. ha they do not allow mortgages on houses that have those types of ah leans out on the easy ceiling so that's problematic for everybody out there who\nHas a a you know how to have solar system installed on their roof or free\nFree and right or is it exactly exactly now how does it ... your construction guy you'd have those solar panels on the roof what happens to this to the\nI guess structural integrity and then also functional integrity of a roof with those panels on there I mean that does in its ability to [noise] um [noise]\nUh resist water penetration to that effect compromised or [noise]\nIf done correctly know specifically the roof\nSolar roof shingles or the or the better right of the two from that perspective\nA little more money but as with anything of its installed correctly you'll find the weight of the silicon is not heavy okay generally speaking any any building built in the last you know forty years ... generally speaking be able to relatively easily accept the photovoltaic system without any trouble not very heavy\nOkay because I Would imagine if you had to you know if you put the solar panels on a roof ten years old at some point that roof is going to have to be replaced gonna have to remove the solar panels to replace the you know the original roof is that\nTrue that would be true that would be something to think about in general if you're going to put solar panels on or ... the shingles replace the solar shingles replacing traditional route single but some of the mindful as would be the age of your roof right for you put on Iraq system and tax that would be a very wise decision as yeah\nSo I think they'll they'll lesson for our listeners if you're thinking about putting on solar panels you should probably give someone like yourself a call just you know have a little ... before you make an potentially expensive for your call her realtor [laughter] you know you can call her without association of realtors I for one Seventy five Ninety eight hundred [noise]\nAnd they could always direct you um [noise] but there it you know there is definitely research that is\nUm I guess we should be required before engaging in something like that and having it installed on your roof if someone did have questions is there a number they could call the number ... number [noise]\nDepending on the nature of the question I generally people go to the Internet first okay an excellent source would be the databases state and federal incentives Desiree dot Gov\nYou could look at some of the Rhode Island officials the official Rhode Island builders association website would be a good one to check to ...\nAnd I'd be a good idea to do a little research on line first right before you so you know which questions to ask ... and there's a number of Rhode Island so we're professionals out there that have their own\nAssociation and national certifications called ...\nOkay knowledgeable about such things I Would that would be my first chunk of things\n[noise] now I've seen along you know I think it's a lot one forty six where they're like these and it almost looks like a farm of solar panels with ... a big piece of land that all these solar panels on it [noise] how are those owned by individuals or they they owned by companies do you know anything about that since\nWe're talking about I'm sure a lot of a lot of large look a large scale for a utility scale solar farms okay well that's the current uh a lot of production going on up there right now\nA lot of discussions about how that was incentivize and how they're using some of that land right now is I'm from a builders perspective that they're taking some of that land that could be best suited to develop housing right is is somewhat problematical rather we can put a lot of photovoltaics in ... in a lot of places will build anything ...\nSo that's an issue right now that's open for discussion and oh the realtors are involved in that we are mental community the building community so to think through some of this large scale photovoltaic\nDevelopment which we all like the idea of renewables have done in some manner of economic sanity\nAnd but you are capturing capturing a good deal of high dry land right now that could be in my opinion better suited for other things\nYeah I totally agree with that I'm On the actual I'm involved with the Cumberland conservation commission and that's an issue that we talked about this past year\nBecause as a plot of land in town that you know could be used for a residential development could be used for solar panels and ah you know it's something that we are paying attention to because again of everything with real estate there's only so much land available say you want to try and find its highest and best use and perhaps\nRunning a big tractor farmland to a solar panel field is not the best way to you know utilize that land\nI Would tend to agree with that exactly a lot of things we need to think about but in general we we do have a bit of a housing problems turning into a major housing bad one man we're short housing production by several thousand units a year and have been for a number of years so [noise] uh we we may need to have a discussion about that\nAnd and that's a perfect time to bring that up because we are going to talk more about that after the break folks who are listening to our I living radio right here in WPRI Ninety nine point seven FM six thirty AM we are sponsored by our high living dot com the source for the most accurate real estate information in Rhode Island\n[noise] I agreed you know so now we can take about two or three percent premium when you're building a house we talked about a couple of items um like roof shingles that have or have a so so liberal topic\nI'm not so it'll take a photo about the political attack a capacity how what is it different costs differential between that type of a a roof and let's say conventional asphalt shingle\nAnd architectural shingle Steele roof um would've you know what type of differences in costs are we talking about\nObviously your photovoltaic roof are going to be considerably more depending on many single you're going to put on somewhere between you know and out of twenty to forty thousand and that's why a lot of people don't put on the photovoltaic\nThey'll do everything in the house under the United States Department of energy's are already own program ... in that program as promulgated by the department of energy\nLike introduced on steroids to a little bit more than EnergyStar the idea being if you did put photovoltaics in the house or wind turbine or procured your power from renewable sources your house would be your building would be net zero and make more than a concern\nThat's the largest ticket item to be quote unquote green is for well tax after not inexpensive right depending on the number of programs available but that that is that's a ... ... and you have to really be thinking you're going to be there for ten or Twenty years they're really at this moment in time to see the recovery on that ... the payback period if you will that that's pretty long haul\nYeah yeah so now I'm you know we we I sell houses have been lots of housing with the different types of furnaces in boilers\nAnd you see those new energy efficient quote unquote a unit that hang on the wall they're very unobtrusive they you know seem like there's you know super efficient um is that a good option for existing construction\nYes it is it's a you know up in the brand names of those are called on demand system ... nor its ... those are excellent they'll generally run two hundred thousand BDUs on gas that'll do a large house it'll do actually hot water if you have ... unplug the old furnace and put them in there\nThat will also make a domestic hot water hot ... can do actually both the same time those are excellent\nAnother thing that they don't do is they don't use any internal air in the house or combustion so the houses you usually do four inch PVC pipes and sticking out of the house yeah one sucking the air and combustion occurs and the seal unit\nAnd an exhaust all the way back out so ... any there in the house to Columbus anything so these little things that are helping out towards indoor air quality new construction\nYou know the sewer greenhouses you definitely don't want that has ... put in any house that's a pretty good thing you know so that some excellent technology says water and you know we all have a\nMany times of the big thing in the basement keeping all the water hot so I'm not home right right it was in the winter so\nYeah okay so we've talked about heating or we talked to a little bit about cooling I Want to get more into that after the commercial break but then there's also the whole uh you know the other factor of of of lighting you know letting your home and are there\nThings that the consumer can do homeowners can do to reduce their energy consumption consumption when it comes to lighting\nSure switching to detect bulbs okay you have timers on fans we have um things of that nature as you're starting to go through your house when light bulb with burnout amused we'll go to the CFLs and now we're in the ... which I had only meal run Fifteen to

Caldwell from the island builders association\nAnd we are talking about green construction before the break we were talking about [noise] lighting and things that the homeowner can do um to retrofit\nA more efficient lighting and the home and David mentioned Eli deep hopes are there things to other things other than replacing fixtures and ... is there anything else the homeowner who has an existing home built in that you know forty fifty sixty seventies\nThat they can do I need to consider sure I Would number\nOn looking insulation that would be your insulation an air sealing is the most\nCost effective thing you can do what I can show you if you go down and look in your basement of your house is almost everyone around as a basement and you look at the top of the concrete you know about seven feet high between there in the first floor there is no usually know inflation the room Joyce and so when you're standing in your living room [noise]\nYou're losing a lot of heat and a lot of heat right out there you have little things like ... which I Know you've seen inspections all yeah I'm a lot of those people have nice pink fluffy stuff real deep and their medic and then a piece of quarter inch board\nThat's two foot by four feet with absolutely nothing over it and he's going right up to like a smoke stacks of you have the opportunity to see houses with thermal imaging cameras sometimes in the middle of winter\nYou'll see giant blues and and it's it's pretty interesting stuff to see some national grid is\nAre getting more aggressive with some of their programs for existing homeowners for\nA step beyond arise energy audit to really look at what you're doing incentivize things and how to how to make the money fast which has insulation air sealing\nAnd they'd be looking at your windows you know as you move up the value chain new thinking of All right I can do some instantly and that stuff a lot of homeowners can do on their own just to make sure insulation struggling stalled friday so the addicts shuttles\nWhich adventure to the roof or you know you have to vent the roof they'll put it in all those phone insulation but then they leave the big chunk ... the vial that's you know that's negated enormous amount of the value of what you've done so these are little detail things and enjoy surround the bottom and making sure you've got a can of phones to make sure you\nWe've all been in the middle of winter and see what is it cold rough coming from somewhere\nGo hunted down yet little smoke that's all that stuff most homeowners can do on their own if they want to move up the windows and heating systems those in the next type of systems that they would need to investigate versus some of the older eating systems that can reach into their lives right and you described earlier now be an on demand systems can easily plug and play from a diversion traditional boiler\nYep and you know folks I Want to point out 'cause uh David ... mentioned something about insulation that pink fluffy stuff you see in the attic and as a realtor I I've been in literally thousands of homes\nAnd I have seen 'em workman ship done by the homeowner and I always tell my buyers as we're walking through these homes to quote you want to\nRemember is just because you can doesn't mean you should and I have seen insulation that was installed backwards and homes um I've seen insulation that was installed you know compressed too much so that it doesn't function [noise]\nUm and and that's just talking about insulation never mind if you're looking at how light fixtures are ... you know are installed or other you know a contractor issues that people try to save money on just because they can buy stuff at a big box store [laughter]\nSometimes you need to really think about whether you should hire a professional and I always talk about about a year or so ago there was I don't if you remember this day in the I was an eye on TV [noise] there was a home in Somerset, Massachusetts that blew up\nAnd just ceased to exist it was it so efficiently blew up that there was nothing left of the house and it was\nA boiler that was installed by the home on it was they replaced the gas boiler and thank God no one was in the house\nBut it blew up in the house with shifted they showed it there was nothing left of the house other than the chimney\nAnd things like that he probably saved a couple of thousand bucks or so putting the boiling himself\nProperties okay because another reason why it makes sense to have denser construction more units more housing units in a given area is because the millennials a lot of the folks today they're not planning on having a car if they have a car they don't want to have to use it every day\nBecause they they can get out go walk to work come home walk stop at a restaurant go back to their condo their apartment their home whatever it is you need density in order to achieve that one of the reasons that they do not see the need to own a car a lot of these folks especially in more densely populated areas is because we have\nThese ... driven call you know demand a car services like ... like lift et cetera and these kids today they need to do something they just order ... takes him to where they want to go when they want to go home they call it again and they go back and they save a lot of money\nIn order to uh by doing that and despite the reputation that\nMillennials have most millennials are physically savvy and my personal experience and that also and the professional the data that's created by the national association of realtors amongst others indicates that they are physically savvy and that's one of the reasons why they're putting off new home creation purchasing a home starting their own household\nBecause they want to pay down some of the student debt that they've been honest with\nYou know I think the average student graduating student had over forty thousand dollars of student debt today and Twenty years ago I think that was a thousand dollars so [noise]\nYou know these are more reasons why make sense to build homes and a denser fashion that are energy efficient and then you have a larger open spaces [noise]\nRight that's exactly right and I believe you might know more about this than I Do Dave [laughter] they're all they are doing this and other parts of the country is that true they are yeah [noise]\nSo it I Know uh you know we travel around going to conferences here and there and you talk to people and in other areas where it gets really really hot and really cold like parts of Arizona they have a lot of a green construction out there and they're much bigger much more expensive housing so\nThe costs are much higher but I think they can also tend to generate a lot of savings on that air conditioning in the summer right they can do the right thing mhm [noise]\nSo we're talking about a lighting because the energy the way it can sue manages heating your home cooling your home and your and lighting um you know what the heating you can also a heat your your hot water um if you have an energy efficient boiler\nUm and just to get back to your point earlier joke at them very interesting subject if you do happen to live near a train station apple yeah\nYou're not getting in your car and you know you turn the key on right if you don't have to let her car and now we're building but I don't have to turn my truck on you know go to the shell station and fill up a gas right\nThat is a significant polluter right there are going to its carbon emissions so the the denser we'd get to can eliminate a few more cars Newt electrical like the train station they're building a ... very well for the market things I wanted to large number of people\nA lot of retirees believe it or not new um we my family just moved from the\nVery nice suburban neighborhood to the city last year we found that we liked it better than turns out that we do yeah\nThe you know we live in New Zealand square and and uh it's it's been quite a change but um one much for the better and enjoyed it quite a bit like seeing a little bit of the migration to be around those those those hubs like that and again we took an old house and it needed working in the process of doing all that work\nWe did all the appropriate energy upgrades and insulation that ah you know a significantly lower built in the last us\nRight [laughter] yeah that that's important to remember because you know you're building energy efficient houses green construction or you know remodeling it retrofitting for green a certifications but then also when you leave your home\nYou know how you're getting from point a your home to point B your ultimate destination of work or whatever if you can utilize public transportation mass transportation and not have to get in your car and drive from point a to point B by yourself like most of us do in Rhode Island [noise]\nYou're going to save a lot of money and do not consume as much energy personally but then in the aggregate when you expand that out\nYou know the extra ... like a whole neighborhood doing that you're talking about really reducing the carbon footprint and it's doing it in a way that is a more cost effective for builders to build homes to support that type of living [noise]\nIt's also better for municipalities cities and towns because it's easier for them to maintain the infrastructure when it's densely populated like that and um you know and then you have open spaces that everybody can use and you know one concentrated area [noise]\nYes and that's something my grandparents moved here from the Bronx New York in the in the early fifties or grandfather worked in ... and at that time they couldn't afford the good neighborhoods so which was you know the Washington park in the Central Falls to book at work so they had to\nMove out to a little more the poor people were any stretch of the plot of land out there but they were able to afford a car you know my grandfather to commute to work you know whereas my ... my grandmother never got her driver's license in the Bronx so you know we're starting to

for state representative in district Twenty one yes and and you only have one opponent just a chameleon [laughter]\nSo yes I made it through the primary and uh did pretty well with that and they're an independent or there is no independent his time uh there was no other opponent is just myself and\nIt can be nearly as a Democrat and the Democrats okay so I'm Mike you are a admittedly a pro Second Amendment pro gun guy and yeah right hand yes I Am right yes I Am card carrying member and so this is the for for those of you that are\nA pro Second Amendment you don't want to see any more of your gun rights stripped away this is the guy that we need to have up at the state house and tell us a little bit about your background and I'm now just go ... open Mike there\nOh okay so Mike on the Mike\nI'm originally from well look I graduated from high school or my father a navy veteran talk me out of going in the navy and said why don't you look at the coast guard and I said what does that and I saw the videos from the recruiter with the boats on fire and saving babies' and\nHelping people out it was great and I said yeah that looks great so I actually did twenty three years of service in the coast guard pile and uh and it was a great job I'd I'd love to stay or I just got you know twenty three years of\nSmall boats in and small ships getting beat up\nKind of takes a toll and the body so it was time to retire plus I'd recently gotten married and decided to settle down and and have a family and raise a family so you have children I Do have one daughter ... she just turned six yesterday oh how nice yeah we had a nice little unicorn birthday party so\nBut I'm back in Rhode Island after retiring my last job was actually out of Capitol Hill where I was a\nThe interim executive petty officer that's basically second in command and that was a great job in my previous job was a great job in New London and as we can exist as an executive petty officer\nA also second in command so I've got some experience with um government jobs and government work being responsible to the taxpayers and the and the citizens of the United states so um\nAnd you also have a lot of experience being a small business owner as well yes I Do and to tell us about what your businesses\nSo when I retired I um I had a couple of great friends one was a landscaper and a teacher and the other one was a um former corporate America guy that started his own construction company so before I actually retired I went to work for both of them kind of like moonlighting at night or whatever\nAnd they're just just learning the wrote tape\nKind of silly to see what I which one I kind of wanted to do and I couldn't decide so initially I opened a joint company construction in a landscaping and the construction was kind of difficult um there's a lot of competition in the state a lot of people you know looking to do that kind of stuff that they can pick up a bus or a hammer\nAnd then the landscape and seem to take off really well so I kinda backed off on the home improvement stuff for the construction and I basically just do the landscaping side of it now so it it does okay it keeps me working all year and I'm outside which I like him you know being in the coast guard was outside all the time too so\nThey didn't get sick of it huh no [laughter] no it's a it's not easy to labor force is a little\nTough sometimes but um I keep it working you know that's good yeah\nThat's really good and I think that one of the benefits of having a your own business or having a small business and being accountable is that you understand money you understand what it's all about and there's nobody coming to bail you out there is no taxpayers to fund at your business when you've mismanaged your money\nRight [laughter] that's correct so I've actually already a lot\nOf that in government we see tons of money being mismanaged and then it's like a taxpayer bailout um and and I think that there are a lot of people sitting up there that have never had the experience of actually owning their own business and having to a balance a checkbook\nOr business checkbook and ... and and make payroll and do expenses and understand\nHow economics ... how finance works right now it's like oh we'll just go to the well and get more so we can just keep spending\nMost people that they don't have um that that fall short put it that way or have trouble with their finances I find is that it's not an earning problem it's a spending problem which is what we have in the state right\nRight right so I figured it out rather quickly you know I started with about ten thousand dollars I had saved before I retired and you know I kinda\nI spent proportionally to my amount of customers or work that I could I could do 'em or handle and as the company has grown I've grown conservatively with the company I don't just run out and buy\nYou know or borrow yeah or bar\nAt Arlington slavery one way to go it is um it is 'cause you'll never get out of that either I\nI've spent the money that I've had and I don't spend any money until the end of the year in the accounting likes that of course it was like oh it's the end of the year you gotta buy something very so he loves that but\nAnd then if if there's no profit there's no paycheck right now so that you're you're the last one to get paid right if you get paid right so the employees always get paid to the business owner as the last one scraping Nicolas together if it if that's what it comes down to and the employees leave and they don't take the trash out [laughter]\nI've had many like I said oh near lock the doors on the rocks or whatever that's right\nSo you you have to know how to do all of that and I think bringing\nBringing a small business background to the state house is great I really do now um we have a just a couple of minutes here what are some of the other issues um that you are concerned about with the state right now and obviously your gun guy so I'm no matter what comes across in this is the issue that we had with the other candidate\nWas that she made a bunch of promises and then the right out of the box [laughter] she went against us so we you know we we'd like to see a toe the line on on Second Amendment or any gun stuff which will be watching you like a hawk absolutely but what what are some of the other other issues and you have about a minute and a half you can kind of outline so\nSo you kind of hit the biggest one of the out of control spending I mean we we need to we need to ... percent we're a very small state and we have a nine plus billion dollar\nBudget I don't know how yeah somebody's household bloated yeah I don't understand where it all goes and how that happens in such a small state um some of the other things we need to look at it as a ... it's infuriating when I turn on the TV and I see these wasteful programs that are still feeling and they need to be on the chopping\nBlock and just like a computer hit the mass to reset button and start over ... because we can't keep going down the same line with these wasted programs that are not working mhm we need to have an inspector general to\nLook into this wasteful useful spending um you know we need to fix a lot of things in the state we need you know I could get into a whole ... which kind of going on a few of the things I think what you want to talk about um\nIt just it just took the covered a minute and a half yeah now I Know and I kind of like a kind of\nYou know that didn't mean to to look for you before you even though like my one of the things I Want to do when I get up there is a look at\nSome of this wasteful stuff in and of course if I don't get on the Finance Committee is kind of harder but you know start looking at stuff and and and it costs with my vote because I can say no on my vote so if there's something I don't like a vote no on it if I think it's wasteful\nAnd make no mistake about it a Nick ... has been there he is a pragmatic speaker of the house he is a an a minus rating with the n._r._a.\nHe is a guy guarding the gates because in the most likely event Gina Raimondo is going to be reelected I hate to say but given the the field of candidates I don't know it does but you still have to get out and vote and bring them I have friends with you and you have to vote for Allan Fung these are only choice\nAnd I ... this is really directed at the voters and district Fifteen Cranston\nAnd all of a Second Amendment community if you can send a few bucks to Nick mad yellow or or help out of this campaign by by you know working with them somehow working the phones or whatever or to do whatever\nThis guy is going to be the one who decides what bills get to the floor for a vote\nAnd Gina Raimondo as is very clearly said that her goals are and it's in Providence Journal today's question number five they asked all the candidates what's your position on uh what would you do if anything to reduce gun violence across the state that's the question\nThe first thing is there is no gun violence problem across the state it's in Providence Central Falls Pataki maybe one socket not across the state but here's your answer in my second term\nI'll turn upside ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines impasse largest ... banning guns from schools\nVarious folks clearly stated that's her goal and she has hired a policy advisors from Bloomberg's every town organization\nUm she's got this working group she formed with forty three people none of whom from the second amendment community they've come out with this forty six or I guess it's really a Ninety nine page report I just downloaded it from the Internet\nAnd they have stated these are among the goals they [noise] the guy who sets the agenda and the house he's the most powerful elected official in the state\nIf he's not re elected as the second amendment community we have a serious problem on our hands going into this session of the legislature make no mistake about it\nBut in Rhode Island really the speaker is the most powerful person bam yeah yeah I mean more so than the governor of the constitution set it up that correct exactly so that people need to understand that they need to know how important it is that Mick Matty yellow gets back in office okay and retained his speakership and here's what I find very\nAlmost comical and funny is that and I'm already popping the popcorn because I Want to sit on the sidelines and watch this this stuff happened is if Nick Matty yellow does win and he does retain his speakership\nEating the moms are there the moms are out there campaigning for his opponent for fries [laughter] you'd think anything is going to get past his gate no absolutely not that's why it is absolutely critical\nThat Nick ... yellow wins his his race there's just there's no question so those people in district Fifteen get off you are but I don't care if it's raining out what the day's snowing\nOr you get your cars trouble find the Hoover there's no excuses nowadays you have to get out there and you have to vote this is extremely critical yes it we would like to\nSee Alan ... a fun song when we do not want to see a gene or a Monday or get a second term\nBut the most important position is that of Nick now yellow there's just no question and for all the reasons that Richard just talked about and a hundred more\nI mean they're really they're really coming and it's just not Second Amendment stuff it's a lot of other issues too\nI mean ... of course to take a lot of heat because of the the ... Red Sox thing but he was a very clear that his voters in his district were opposed to it and he tried to come up with a plan that would insulate the state\nOr ... or the state tax payers from any default on the bonds that were being issued\nI'm so there's a lot of controversy about that but Nick Mary Elle has done a lot of good things for the state first of all remember that he is the one that engineered the demise of the line item a lever for parties so\nPeople would go in and they just make one marked on the on the ballot and they would vote straight Democrat straight Republican he did away with that which makes people then go through a candidate by candidate\nOffice by office and make us election not like the old days master lover in the ... so called mass deliver God he he has a has been very careful about the way the ... states spends its money\nI'm not withstanding as Mike Underwood said in the first segment we have a nine point six billion dollar budget in a state with a bottle Evan one point one million people [noise]\nUm there are programs in there certainly that that need to be looked at and I think overall Matt Matty yellow sits in works with the Finance Committee chairman and they try to pare down the stuff that the governor puts in her budget a budget request that Governor does not pass the budget that Governor mix outta budget request\nSubmitted to the legislature merely as a guideline and they pretty much put it in a wastebasket and start their own process\nSo ... has a lot of of clout and and she deserves to go back again\nAnd and work for the uh the people of the state and particularly the second amendment community has an a minus raiding the n._r._a. for a very good reason [noise]\nAnd we can talk at all and likes about the two bills that did get through the red flag and the the um uh the other one that went through like the um [noise] yeah I Know I had I'm not a player\nBut I'm trying to pull it up to it's a red flag and the um\nThe early warning so that's a red flag bill or the other one's domestic violence that's another missile domestic violence misdemeanor I'm so there's some concessions that had to be made but relative in the midst of assault weapons so called the ... a bump stock ban\nYou know ... I think most of the second amendment community said oh well you know with a gun dealers don't even sell that many of 'em and it's not a big issue so we sometimes you have to give a little to get a little and so we're ... I'm\n... we've already given enough we're given a lot we you know we we we had a whole slate we had a whole pie [laughter] your head and every every year we we give away a sliver a sliver a sliver and pretty soon there's going to be no pie left\nI'm Charlie Hawkins always said that he goes you know if they they want they want the whole yardstick but they're very content just taking an inch at a time yeah and the ultimate objective is to take away firearms from the civilian market and I think that's the ultimate goal and that's how you know\nAnd they'll say well my father hunted because they think it has everything to do with hunting\nAnd it doesn't and ultimately I mean they keep chipping away chipping what's next because the next law that they make that of criminals not going to follow because generally they've already broken you know four or five six laws before they even get to the gun stuff\nUm so so what what is going to stop what is going to change nothing is going to change so when nothing\nIn just then they're like okay now we gotta do something different now we've got to come after hand guns now we've got to come after a shock guns now we got to come up to all of a semi automatic now we've got to come after what's next because when nothing works for them they just keep trying and they can't\nThe problem is they can't go back and admit that things are not working for that didn't work\nThere's other problems to the so called gun violence issue so the ... problem I have family problems there's a lot of things that go into it that they simply don't want to address because they don't know how to address them\nAnd uh you know they could be a good idea where although they go they go after the low hanging fruit which is well make a gesture here will get rid of guns and the progressive agenda\nCannot be fully implemented as long as there's an armed citizenry\nBecause as soon as people realize that their freedoms and liberties are being taken away by the tall Terry and state which is what progressive ism is there will be problems and they know that they can't put that agenda in as long as people\nAre armed mhm and that's the ultimate goal you heard it nuts it that's what it's all about I Want to talk about we have to take a break but I Want to talk about um [noise]\nIn that that task force that working group as they call themselves um aren't talking about the the the issue with a C. C. W. than what they want to do with concealed carry permits because uh that suit that's\nHuge and that there's so many things that I'm going to be affected by this and I have some questions about where all the money is going to come from so when I talk about that in a little bit\nUh feel free to give us a call if you want to weigh in on any of this stuff for me this is this is your your talk show too we invite you to call him leaves one eight hundred three two one WPRI oh you're a local for three eight WPRI oh\nBefore three eight nine seven seven sick last secondary a stick to your guns radio a new suck Ninety Ninety seven FM an am six thirty WPRI out\n\nFrom the sea skates Christmas Day cold weather center here's your exclusive your weather forecast clouds in some sunny breaks today with the highest fifty six mainly cloudy tonight a bit of rain later on low forty one tomorrow periods of rain end result in the morning and in the early afternoon type that fifty seven with WPRI was exclusive accuweather meteorologist Travis\nAccuweather on the voice of southern New England news talk seven of them and I am six thirty WPRI [noise] some point of southern New England W.

listen to the entire show I had to run off for some reason or this is a bad time of day for you you can listen anytime anywhere in the world\nSo I Want to talk a little bit about that that working a that working gun committing murder is not a committee it's worth working group it's a working group and why are they calling it a working\nWell if your committee you're subject to the open meetings active Rhode Island which means all of your um meetings have to be posted forty eight hours in advance to at least forty eight hours in advance the location the time\nAnd you know it's open to the public ... public comment is not guaranteed\nBut uh that's that's a working group on the other hand\nThere's not subject to open meetings act now this working group I was told by Jim many [noise] that when he was named as co chair\nHe said oh yeah we're going to make sure that our meetings are all publicized and I'm not sure that they work I didn't follow it that closely 'cause it was a foregone conclusion what was going to have a a forty forty three member committee not one member from the second amendment community so guess what yeah talking about ...\nPacking the court and he's not going to say anything I mean he's he's given your lip service telling you that they'll say oh I'm going to make sure that all of these um you know minutes get posted and stuff they're all from out of the group [laughter] he's the only one that's even remotely on the fringes of being close to being on our side and I stay remotely\nOn the fringes and and and that's that's a fact Fred from Warwick on the line right now\nBut after new fried welcome to lock stock and Daria\n... you know it's amazing you know here we go again with the same old same old but I think of them actually got to be the turning point if I got to get out and make they make the point well known that we're not going to mean not going to put up with nothing\nBut we've got to go down you know we're going to go for it yeah they do reporting to everybody and anybody who believes in the second amendment anybody believes in Goshen minor second my exactly it out on November ... and vote\nFor either you in district Twenty one in Warwick I Believe I Am well guess what you're we have the guy who you're going to vote for right here I'll let you talk to them got a question for Microsoft [laughter]\nActually no not at this time but you know I've got one guy he's going to have my vote for sure\nRight ... thank you for uh there's one and and yet [laughter] so I don't say we didn't do something for you [laughter] I'm so Fred make sure you you know you tell all your friends that live in Warwick grab your neighbors to they they they absolutely need to vote for Mike\nOh absolutely absolutely and it was nice meeting you the other day up at the bulls eye shooting supplies okay but when they get for sure\nYeah I'm sure we will All right thanks for the call have a great rest of your Sunday\nSo that you are You're welcome a couple a couple of minutes left I Want to talk about the the concealed carry permits and is working group\nAt what they want to do they came to the conclusion and I'm not surprised because I'm chief men DACA from a Central Falls is on this committee and he is a head of the police chief chief association that's it I thought it was going to the union but at the association\nAnd he's got he's got a checkered background to have been arrested a couple of times for a domestic violence and and I don't even know like how you can you can retain his position where he is but now he's on this this is a task force is chief of police beside yeah and it was a chief of police exactly so\nAnyway they had been a lot that organization has been talking a long time about not wanting to do concealed carry permits town by town that they're letting the municipalities handled and they want everything to go under\nThe attorney general's office and we know and Sheldon Whitehouse was there uh he he set out a letter saying ah you know don't issue anymore just send everybody here and then he just rejected everybody because he's an anti gun guy Sheldon Whitehouse is is an anti\nThe guy who doesn't like ... who doesn't want to see civilians with firearms and that's just the way that it goes so\nI'm now this forces recommending that this happened so they're taking it away from\nThe they want to take it away from the town's so that means eleven forty seven eleven will go away eleven forty seven Eighteen will stay keep in mind that if it goes all under the attorney general's office than eleven forty seven Eighteen\nIs may issue okay it's not shall issue and then we have what's his name neuro ... know Rona Rona neuro to who is is I'm running for a G undefeated so he's in I mean do you vote for any much like walked into this job\nAnd um he's another one who's an anti he's an anti gun guy and um he's already talking about high capacity magazine bans and they are Fifteen bands and if\nEverything goes through the attorney general's office guess what folks how how how much are we going to lose their it it's going to be a major issue means it's discretionary you don't you submit your\nPicture I don't like your hair I I don't like that that caller that's on your shirt or I don't like your handwriting\nI mean it can be anything that they decide they don't like\nBecause it's may issue and then they come up with some bogus reason why well your your applications in complete all wives and completed just incomplete or whatever they're going to come up with\nBecause we see this happening now with the ... office so it's only going to get worse and if you don't have any choices you can't go to your town to get a permit then you're you're flat out of luck\nThat's it not even Massachusetts does that Massachusetts is town by town and they they have the strictest some of the strictest gun laws in the country\nThat sort of Connecticut by the way in Connecticut Connecticut you have to go to your local local community and get a local permit first and you submit that to the state police not to say gee to the state police that runs a another background check to make sure you're clean the state of all comes up quickly you get it\nSo you could imagine how corrupt this is going to be now the other thing is is um they with a ... they want to put take the blue car to wave a Yemen put that\nUnder the age ... office him now they and they want some training so I'm assuming a training means you have to instead of just reading the blue card booklet and now you're going to have to take a test and and take a class so what does that mean now they have to hire instructors now they got to pay these people do you think you're going to get that class for free nope\nSo they're going to charge you for this class so there's more money I'm nuts disenfranchising the poor people who live in these neighborhoods next is gang bangers they need to arm themselves and they're not going to have the ability to do that because you're going to price them right out of it make\nIt without the blue card you're not going to get a gun and they do not only had gone they want to extend that's right or wrong long guns that so that basically the attorney general and the state of Rhode Island will be the czar the firearms czar who is going to decide if you get an anti gun person\nIn a row now I got an he's going to get in and he's going to sit there and as he could very easily say I don't think anybody in Rhode Island to carry a firearm I don't think\nAnybody in Rhode Island should be allowed to buy a firearm and you know the law says I'm the guy who decides that's right but that's where we're headed folks that you don't pay attention to this kind of stuff so intellect and they were ... you got to go out I Can't\nStress how imperative it is that you get out and you absolutely have to vote and bring a couple of your friends with you\nI mean if the if the four thousand people do yellow shirts that showed up at the state house\nAll went out and voted and you bring to friends with you and they vote the same way we we can beat Gina we can absolutely the numbers are there four thousand showed up at the state house all of you should be voting all of us should be voting glued myself in there and bring to friends\nAnd that would put us over the top the numbers are there it can work don't listen to these polls okay it's close and it could it ... Allen can pull this off if we get behind him and make this happen they were going to take every one of us to make it\nWill be back again next week I'm asked this time slot we'll talk more about\nThis we will be November fourth next Sunday will be back\nWith tunes Jackson from the Barnum armory have a great week everybody a jeep\nTruck solutions to the top of him than I Am six thirty WPRI accumulation [noise]\nPittsburgh massacre mid term elections I'm In case the gunman behind a deadly shooting rampage at a Pittsburgh synagogue heads to court tomorrow and the city's mayor takes issue with the president\nPresident Trump said things might have been different if there was an armed guard outside the tree of life synagogue were eleven people were killed Pittsburgh Mayor Bill to do those disagrees saying that's not the way to protect against irrational behavior\nThe approach that we need to be looking at is how we take the guns which is the common denominator of every mass shooting in America out of the hands of those that are looking to express hatred through murder\nBut do do called it the darkest day in the city's history but stress its resilience in the face of tragedy ... Pittsburgh\nCollective bargaining agreement and lo and behold when one inquires\nYou realize that those documents were never presented to a city or town council or\nOther ratifying body within minutes the ...\nAnd ... with ... under the law which makes them completely invalid right invalid\nIt would make them yes as a as a fairly well a\nWell known Rhode Island Supreme Court decision a that was issued back in Nineteen Ninety four but\nJustice Shay Supreme Court ah we're\nProvidence city council um uh was addressing agreements made by then this fancy that has not been ratified by the council and of course on the ordinance or in the city collective bargaining agreements have to be present the legislative branch of\nGovernment for ratification\nAnd the court made it very clear that agreement struck\nA in such a way that they have not been presented and vetted by the city council and ratified are invalid and not enforceable\nAnd so that's pretty much it's safe than to say that site agreements or basically illegal in Rhode Island\nOr outside agreements per say I'm not a lawful unless they are prepared\nI mean anyone can foremost I agree you could have a fight a forming a side agreement with a union to resolve a particularly or to create a benefit at that essentially collective bargaining however\nMerely because you're on the agreement doesn't necessarily make it a valid one sided agreement struck then has to go through\nThe process of a ratification\nMore famous to me that's not done it seems to me the ... did didn't noting the fact that it's a site agreement makes it are automatically invalid because if it wasn't a side agreement would just be an addendum to the contract\n[noise] while many different decided means that we have an agreement over here that nobody knows about that were kind of just working out between ourselves those can happen\nSite agreements can be negotiated but they have to come to this or they have to be presented oftentimes ah issues arise during the life of say a three year collective bargaining agreement\nThe party need to collectively bargain a a side agreement or a memorandum of agreement\nOr a memorandum of understanding orange some cases they stipulate to an arbitration award which is a form of the oven agreement mhm consent agreement if you will an arbitration\nThe point is those are great and then we'll be valid must be that it by the city or town council or the ratifying body and if they're not than they are not valid collective bargaining agreements because remember even though they may be single subject matter\nBy agreement they still are in the nature of collective bargaining agreements they struck between a union and administer palate and as such they have to be ratified if not their invalid void and unenforceable\nAnd if they then take a step further if they are acted upon as if they are enforceable unreal what happens then\n[noise]\nWell that's an interesting question because union often grieve violations of side agreement and then when a revelation is may ... side agreement was never ratified then diminish the power of the has the ability\nTo raise isn't affirmative defense a void ability\nOr in validity and on enforce ability of the ... side equipment so I'm again merely because people go through the motions of preparing the side agreement on cases\nSigning it in some cases acting upon it doesn't make it necessarily a valid collective bargaining agreement if it's not ratified now\nYou have to look to agreements procedure too because in Maine collective bargaining agreement you read this procedure lines where the grievances and normally it's defined as a violation\nOf the collective bargaining agreement already miss application or misinterpretation of the collective bargaining agreement\nAnd when you have a site of green than it is the subject matter not in the collect bug and and that's not been ratified\nThen one can argue that the grievance is not even substantively opera trickle in other words you cannot pursue a grievance oversight agreement that's never been ratified and of course\nYou know it doesn't exist unless it's ... hold on one second preview in regards to those leader attorney in Rhode Island is going to advocate for the city of work on this and this whole region agreements issue with this ideal or I see I thought this idea was a euphemism was it the way just as just a comment of I guess it's a real thing\nBut you know side deals don't work unless the council season with according to the story in the journal or the council never saw this and the mayor to demand says he didn't know anything about it\nWe'll ask about that when an ... and then what what will will ask been not about that specifically about about what happens next if you find yourself with a side agreement that's been acted on but never ratified what is the relief is there any relief will come back we'll talk about back to my\nNext southern

it into your accuracy is important my apologies for that so mayor full blown mayor board um [laughter] I heard that you that you've visited can block yesterday uh no I did notice more downtown was similar to ... you didn't [laughter] I visited him this morning It's MORNING I'm Sorry yes yeah that\nThat was only after I met with the uh the fire chief in my office first thing this morning\nSo you hear about this for me 'cause I Know we talk to you had not heard about it or not\nI didn't I didn't hear about it from you I'm I when I Walk this morning I have my cup of coffee pick up the paper or read the newspaper and I saw the article on the front page of today's Providence Journal\nAnd what was your reaction to it ah it sparked my curiosity that I Want to come in earlier than normal and try to\nGather as much facts are actual ah background to this as possible and address what I think is a very important issue that has to be addressed\nSo ... do you look at this and the same way can thought it was that this is some kind of a um an issue of intimidation or attempted intimidation\n[noise] ah no I don't take that point of view I I Know that's the point of view that Mr block talk but uh I Am gathering all the factual information that I'm able to gather at this time and I will continue to get that at a mission\nUh and how does that information was speaking to the chief of ... of of the city of walks fire department a relative to the information he may have\nAnd uh from there I went to directly to the property location as you know there are for businesses that that property so I I wanted to get a better understanding as to what actually did occur there the first business I went to that there was someone occupying was ah this the blocks business that ring the doorbell\nOr he invited me in a he showed me around his business and a proceeded to tell me the factual scenario you encountered\nA upon a a visit to establishment\nAnd I again I indicated them is to block that uh I Will be\nTaking the information he provided to me the information that will be forthcoming from my fire chief and if it requires further investigation by any outside authorities and the information that people will be provided by them and a\nCorrect or take the appropriate at that appropriate action necessary to address this issue not because it's can block if it was John Smith or anyone else or I Want to make sure that uh we are treating everyone equally ... equally\nAnd on and that there are no ulterior motives to any actions taken by any personnel at the city\nOr the phone calls they're recorded every adult falls at my office\nI Know no no no I'm Talking about that because I don't know where the call came in for the for the anonymous tip for the inspection\nI I I think if if fire does at the same way as police\nIf it comes in a as an emergency or a state it as a non emergency I don't know if you called the individual directly um if those calls are recorded or not recorded I Know within our um system\nAnd I haven't met ... the reason why am I mean I Am I asked department\nYet but there may be some sort of record I I I don't know I mean I've just been I've been performing to shop for six months in every day is an education injure a learning experience and an issue that arises that we uh attempt to address and do what's best for the taxpayers of the city\nSo you'd be looking into this doing some kind of an investigation to see if somebody inappropriately a call ... and ... in an effort to kinda send a message that can block and then the oil is well\nI I Am looking if there was a wrong committed I'm looking to address that wrong ... upon receiving all the facts and examination\nAnd I objectively sought those facts and I and we're both visiting the tax payer business and dealing with the department head Hawaii a intern who haven't\nGotten any information you know you're waiting on that from\nThe ... well uh yes I Am waiting for that information from the
