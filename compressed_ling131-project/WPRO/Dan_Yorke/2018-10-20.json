language calling in helping out with this Rob so listen this is\nBigger than what it seems that this goes back to and a half years alright I took this information when I found these discrepancies I brought these discrepancies to the city council I sat with everybody individually I showed them the discrepancies in showed them the math\nI question mayor ... in the fire chief\nAt the budget hearings they could not reconcile these what took place was this was done behind closed doors the finance director of the city war offered to pull this fiscal notes and skewed the numbers of how this line I can would impact the budget\nI have that in my possession I have sixty pounds of documents in my possession but furthermore\nThe key player in this is Peter Riggio the city solicitor he blocked me on every step of the way for over two years in my request to obtain records under the public records that he was not only conspirator\nBut he violated state law and he violated the seat on just by unilaterally going behind the scenes and having a backdoor deal\nOffering that and given it to the firefighters and not presenting it to the city council you cannot have any contract in the city of Walker and any other city in Rhode Island without being ratified by the city council prior to being ratify it must be heard an open forum\nIt must be discussed in the general public must have an opportunity to debate this and bring out that that was never done funeral Gerald committed a crime and I will be going all the way to try to have them disbarred I've contacting the Solomon\nAnd also the city council president I'm asked to fill in immediately that take place by Monday Peter Giuliano needs to be fired immediately because now on the back room deal that I'm gonna released this week and the second thing is for the council\nTo do the right to have a CPA ordered it in the finance the sheep is going to come out and say well that's the amount of money that was impacted by this really do not have the authority to see if this was legal illegal civil or criminal\nI've asked the city council unanimously bringing the skate Kobe's immediately ... recall on Monday the hot and then question all parties under oath particularly start avenues you originally I'm skinny heater material the CD ... allegations chief of staff\nThe fire department union ... only one that got councilwoman our Wilkinson who's the head of the Finance Committee during all this time when this was happening really need to be questions under oath and at that point law enforcement nice to determine whether this was civil or criminal however when\nYou have a number of people behind closed doors ... deal that is going to clean money under false pretenses for certain group of people that's called conspiracy yes and I feel that that falls under the Rico statute\nI I don't think you'd do far off I'm not a lawyer but I'll tell you right now I mean\nYou got fire extinguishers [laughter] yeah yeah I have\nA highly Lewis was that the house burns down ... works out good because I got the ... how old are they older than you are what guys yeah this crap has got so it does robbery rhythms

knew about\nIt I Know you don't want my go ahead you go to the ATM and you take out a hundred bucks and a thousand comes out you can't keep her isn't running them or what your kids do is go back the next day and do the same\nAbsolutely you know I remember um I think it was about two months ago Rob when you were talking about the cost of a chief retiring in the city of walk how much money you had to be put off aside and it was a couple of million dollars that it'd be putting an annuity right for chief\nI like that but when when this she's McLaughlin just retired who by the way you lied on five occasions to the city council will through time it just causes in your walk for a million dollars and that's without health care he retired at sixty one fifty ... chief shout every Eighteen months to two years and by the way\nShe slipped up resistance through its true attrition not to the fact they have a college education in this this fine in orange county or business management there would be at least skiing all the way every morning was the beneficiary of the skiing befall them and then they're out and now this goes out as this one\nFrom the time you must be wanting to sixty five that's fourteen years we're going to rotate seven more chiefs in and out the door it's twenty million dollars in debt service on a new high school on like nobody took them down on the box dodge\nTimes thirty

you know what this stuff needs to be exposed [laughter] okay\nLike by the way by the way Scott attribution was up to his neck in this\nThat's why he bolted out the door in April he knew and I predicted that night that he or she McLaughlin would face me in the budget hearings and they didn't well now gene or among money can be held accountable Gina Raimondo needs to immediately suspend or remove Scott attribution from rip the as\nBecause he was ... rock room deals that one of the people that he retired I'm he's won your conscious of their model I once was the first time I've been to Egypt was caught in two thousand five\nUnilaterally increasing the ... ... ... firefighters without going through the city council was home now and then the city council found out about it and they'll have to take them to court for ricin ... totally backroom deals on no stranger to Mr Scott I\nKnow what to tell you something he's Jews favorite favorite favorite Republican believe he's shown that I

Joe you were hitting on some of the the the cost and some of the controls that you attempt to to uh put in place um when you can or cannot continue on that show\nA thank you so what what I really want to focus on is it since my abs since I was put on a administrative leave back in August of two thousand Fifteen and kept on leave through August of two thousand Seventeen\nSo you were you she was elected took control we we know the toll came into place million Fifteen you shortly after were put on and been history of your life\nYou know there are a number of people in state government that good as we referred to that friday afternoon phone call him and we put on an admin leave in particular specific to me now I'm\nA there was no clear cut 'em rationale for that and I was subjected to a two year investigation that never happened so it really\nKind of goes to the governor's comments or after the uh may forms of Prescott press conference the other day where she basically stated that she was a confronted with a personnel rules and regulations\nThat resulted in me being out on two years of leave at the expense of the taxpayer\nAnd all I Would say to that knowing again um [noise] the rules and regulations that are of political is that what rules are she taught is she talking about there were no rules that ...\nDidn't follow any rules and I was in a classified services tenured employee and I'm not saying that ... beyond reproach each if those allegations they need to be investigated but there were no she didn't follow in Hebrew\n[noise] they did a similar situation with three very high ranking engineers at right now I'm just in a related mad as she put three a very well respected engineers from right on ministry of leave\nFor no apparent reason and they came back without a hitch sort of any sort of a a ... you know nothing sticking so that was the the new over here\nNow that's correct and if they were very well respected and they were they were they really\nWere but it but he has another piece when are you know where my taxpayer hat\nSo given all the problems that have occurred and I would be the first to say that what we do it through it on a training school and and child welfare in the DC Wyeth listen this is a problem business so it'd be somewhat naive not to expect problems\nTo the issue here for me is the extent of the problems are covering up of the problems and the human capital that was lost in the fiscal capital that was lost\nUnderstand that we were sitting in a new training school at the expense of proximity sixty eight million dollars for the stacked a state tax payer\nAnd when you look at the damage that was done or the ... the equipment that was broken\nCameras sound systems are so on and so forth are in the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ... because they couldn't even managed the facility\nMy my biggest concern is about ... cost the average cost right now I was a kid at the state training school\nIsn't is approximately two hundred and fifty thousand dollars per year per child per job last week operation that's the cost me God's surveys and based on average daily column of fifty five\nAnd when you tell me as a leader in the state of Rhode Island and her subsets of leaders within the department of D.C Wyeth\nFor two hundred and fifty thousand dollars you can't run a safe progress of viable facility where staff and residents don't fear on a day to day basis for their safety\nWhere kids are are ... while I shouldn't call kids they actually residents were residents are allowed to go to the program educational vocational\nMy ministry she was part of putting up a vocational structure Donny using federal grants and I can sit here today tell you in the public that does that facility is basically a store room\nThat's all it is now or that's what they've done and they've done decimated programming down their offer a number of years they couldn't even get the kids out in the rec yards under the guise of well the fences broke\nAll they kept kids stockpiled and moved to what we call chorus of lock up educational programs of compromise because they couldn't get all the residents from point a to point B as we I sit here today they can't even feed\nTo you and it's at a time in the cafeteria they eat down which is unsanitary it's frowned on by the federal court which yes the training school or they maybe don't eat meat eater you and it's not in the main OK okay but again it goes to leadership and it goes to control and a lot of other things\nIf one was to ask me my opinion of why so much violence occurred down there it's it's kind of simple\nRight kids needs were not being met programs were not being run appropriately voices were not being heard bullying was being allowed and staff are pretty much you know being allowed to do whatever they want [noise] and now on the administration or\nMove America for messaging ... ladies and gentlemen this

this and that's just one of the call and make a couple of statements because I followed the bill ... pretty much\nI've seen a lot of examples heard a lot of things and looked into him as I was hearing them\nEverything that he has been speaking of I I can say that I'm from following it none of it surprises me just to see how he's going to put it together for the benefit of the people that don't really know anything about this\nThat the I think it's a a roadmap to what goes on up there I can also tell you that uh this is a is a common sense type of guy old school where if you got hurt years ago you the thing that you wanted to do is go to work because that's\nWhat you know absolutely people would do they do run it out and try and get a retirement out of the thing or it's not an injury that goes out for years and years and years but over the years where it's evolved with the protection they get those particular employees he's too much of a gentleman the say anything\nAbout this bill through anybody under the bus but\nThe more you protect people like this and this is where the union step in and not to condemn everything that goes on with the ... because I Do believe in but when you make it an avenue for people\nAs a target the benefit themselves into early retirement or other things and it gets around to all of them talk at a coffee baked or whatever they're doing when they have a little bit of time off\nYour crazy if you Richard Painter you could you could get three months off of that you could get the get go see\nThis guy this thing goes on on and on all the time it

sounds kind of naive but that's the reality\nAnd frankly um [noise] I said this numerous times in public settings before why personalize\nListen I didn't always know what was right down there but I certainly knew what was wrong so if you take that a ball coming to work and understand where you're mandate is in moving forward you'll have success and I've worked around a few people were all put myself out there\nThat has had more success down there on match success to when I'm sitting up in two thousand Fifteen\nIn with a training school as I mentioned earlier that was meeting every meeting or shooting every metric including if you have to look at budget saving the state of Rhode Island taxpayers millions of dollars\nBecause I knew how to manage your facility at all levels from staffing

Germany and France are among the nation's criticizing Saudi Arabia which isn't knowledge the death of the Washington Post columnist and its consulate in Turkey is accidentally killed during a fistfight correspondent nic Robertson\nSays for democracy measures buddy is still underway ... one of the holes in the narrative arriving at a ... so far they say they are deeply saddened have regrets about what happened um for his family though of course knowing what happened to his body and all of this would be one of the most important and biggest thing\nSaudi Arabia and said it does not know where the remains of the journalists dark thousands of the Central American migrants are taking part in the caravan heading toward the U.S corresponded though where reports the group is captured the Guatemala Mexico border\nSome of the folks on that bridge actually have papers the sort of the most precious piece of paper that could possibly be carrying right now\nYeah for all kids just line up to other investments like a pension your Social Security and I know people don't think\nAbout Social Security as an investment but it's an income investment you're actually paying into it your entire life or at least your entire working life if you're on the private sector and it lines up to a four one K. because that's one of the distributions that they did when they got rid of tensions as a major us\nHolding that's it so that was pretty ugly oh we shouldn't come in with a song there should be a role over soon\nThe the ... ... what is there at ... you put your ...\nYour role in four one K. out or ... and you're all the money out [laughter]\n... yeah and you turn yourself around [laughter] I like what we're hearing process copyrighted by [laughter] if you're doing the four oh one K. roll over hokey pokey\nThat's copyrighted yeah and they don't do while you're driving yeah\nYou can put your four one K. and you can pull your for all and K out you know ... or ... billion euro you're following Kay out\nTheir focus we're going to pull back and yeah yeah I did a cup of coffee like oh well\nBecause you touched on a really important part that Social Security is one income to that you have a retirement impinging says another you're for one K. is also an income to everything that you're saving for retirement at some point is going to be used for income the key is where do they all say as you're moving forward and that's where\nHow do you move your former gay why the rover your four one K. where does the army ... that's where all those components fit it now I'm ... and it's my pleasure to be a part of a team from you could financial services we're all certified Social Security advisors with an associate as well as myself who's an I. A. R. with you could wealth management and\nAn hour I see the so we can help you maximize your Social Security and ... it's all under one roof you could financial services so today to help you figure out how to roll over here for Kate were given a wait ten free\nWritten income reports to help you figure out how to get to work through your entire retirement she'll be one of the next ten callers right now at four zero one\nSeventy seven to seven to seven to get your free ... income report again that's for one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven\nMany of those written income reports line up to four one K. amazingly because you can put in your actual four\nOne K. so if you bring in a four one K. statement from your employer it can go right into the income statement it is absolutely amazing how to figure out what a foreign when cable actually pay out it'll lay it all out it'll tell you how to treat your Social Security to trigger pensions that will trigger will just any financial document you have it's actually really need to see this in one place\nYeah and what it does too is is if there is a shortfall for your income it tells you how to continue saving and your ... okay and what you have to do to actually get to that\nThat missing component fell by just the way there's no stress\nThat let's dive into savings so if we're going to talk about four one K. first thing we have to do is\nTalk about employer so employers start by putting a four one K. into the business in which you are working and you have thirty one flavors you have Thirteen flavors you have a lot of investments inside of the four one K. I don't think those matter\nAs much as your contribution\nAnd if your employer matches there could be a profit sharing there could be a major match at the end they're gonna be a match during the week there's\nAll kinds of process sees that happening here I think we need to kind of walk through a little bit of that to kind of lower this well I picked the wrong investment I I'm In ... I'm In I'm In the market I mean this kind of stuff I don't think that's as\nImportant and I just think we need to kind of get some of that on the page\nJosh I think you're taking them some space in my head here you're you're written some space out in there so because when it comes down to it\nOh yeah no no no no when it comes to the fact that I felt really really at a\nShirt that so uh when uh when it comes to your four one K. it's one of the tools that easier to use to save for retirement because\nA lot of the things are done for you it's it can be an automatic savings that contribution comes out in time to pay comes to you so and it's in his don't automatically so it's systematic\nYou don't it's kind of set in forget so you decide how much you can afford to take out of your paycheck to contribute to your future retirement and it does that automatically so I think it's it's the one good stuff\nYeah it's when you're talking about saving and well getting your direction around about I'm going to my employer says they give me three percent that three percent of your total gross pay and then when they talk about well what you\nCan you contribute will you contribute over three percent Americans really need to start targeting ten percent of their total gross income into a long term savings process for one case are one piece of that so if your employers giving you a three and you do another three\nThat could be counted as six total percent so then you need only make up four percent somewhere else it can be that easy because when you talk about retirement savings it doesn't have to be a mountain or a molehill it can actually be a pretty good lay out of where it's going to be\nIf you're trying to figure out these calculations go to the Web site go to Euclid fs dot com that you see L. I. D. S. as in financial S's in services and look it up there's calculators out there there's white pages on this\nThere's actually a video of Josh was waving at ya it's amazing click on it and watch it you'll get a ton of information this show is all about the baby boomer for one case say\nYeah I like the fact that you you mentioned that there's a number or target you should be doing for\nThe temperature ... is a baseline that's the the idea that really should be your minimum yeah that's that's the minimum baseline of if I set aside this ten percent and I just let it go he will compound over time regardless of which invest when I pick inside the former okay now you want to be efficient about it\nSo if you're finding that your former K isn't working the way you want it to you definitely want to make sure that it's correctly so that it it'll work best for you going forward in the future\nYeah one of the things that are kind of coming up is when people are coming into the office there they're calling the radio show and they're saying things like\nI'm trying to figure out how to get more savings and and this is no different than what happened last week when I'm Jim came in gym came in and he was talking about how he was having problems getting over this ah six percent thing and it's really easy to kind of ...\nTo get in the weeds and say well I'm not saving he's actually putting away four\nPercent of his total gross income into a savings account just at the local bank\nHe's literally just putting it into the bank is automatically deposited he's just not spending it he doesn't look at that as a as a retirement savings so I asked him what are you going to use this money for and he didn't have a broken up he had all this money in one place he knew he had a four one K. he knew that he had a bank account\nBut in his mind he didn't break it up into three so you're you're good we'll walk you through the GPS system and when you do that what you will find is that you want to put your money in three different piles\nDaily usage emergency fund usage which could be a brokerage account or money market account\nIt's also then going to go into storage in storage does not mean that you're going to get rid of it it means that you're storing it and that's your four one K. that you're IRAs annuities this type stuff long term storage retirement money\nWith Jim was trying to get his mind around this it was mind blowing for him he was nervous his whole concerned he was hyper focused on it and you you know like when you get hyper focused on the up and you can't see anything else well I I was told I Need I Need and he was told twelve percent\n... percent save any twelve percent safe I Need to get to this or else I Will never be able to retire Jim was a young guy sixty two and so we walk through it in his calculation did say that he did need at least ten but he was saving six he was killing themselves trying to get to another six\nHe wasn't counting his checking and same guy that is a savings account too and you can redirect that money to being into your daily money into your emergency fund money and then into your storage money and it's amazing how much asked that you can actually accumulate\nIt's it's amazing to know exactly what you have and how you can actually spent you know the key takeaway with Jim was was to let them know how much you can actually spend every single weekend retirement to know that without a shadow of a doubt that you actually have enough money to laugh no matter how long you live in these are questions that you must get the answers to before you retire well there's still time to prepare\nAnd make sure that your money last as long as your retirement does\nThe teen here and you could financial services\nIs giving way uh customize ... income report just for you sort of take advantage of this offer this plan works best for those who were within five years of retiring and are at least fifty five years old who are ready to be ready for their retirement be one of the first nine callers right now it for one seven to seven\nTo seven to seven that's for their own one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven don't let your retirement become mediocre\nNow when we get back we're going to sing the four one K. hokey pokey songs were at talk about rollovers and how to properly\nOr roll it to a private IRA his individual retirement account\nMan I forgot all about Jerry I'm so glad you brought that back up that was a great meeting Ninety nine point nine nine nine nine nine percent of the time\nThis decision is moving to an IRA or individual retirement account while you're going to move your money that was trapped at an old employer four one K. to a new four one K. and box yourself in it doesn't make any sense if\nYou move to a new i._r._a. an individual retirement account now that money becomes in your control that man when you are hijacking my story by the way I always I I\nKnow that was that was a great meeting Jerry's just a great guy all the way around it when he was talking about moving to the other four one K. his ... he was if he moves it over to the CBS account it's going to put him in a box it was it just wasn't in his best interests\nTo just get a backup for a second because remember if he rolls from his old four one K. two new foreign K\nThere's no financial benefits that rover money doesn't get any of the contribution or mashed that you get from your poor so there's no bump up for doing it and when it comes to being restricted you're limited by what the plant guidelines are which means you can reach out to the GPA or your administrator for them to tell you what's going on so it's much easier just to go irate because you've already understand how those work and there's no restrictions\nYeah if you if you just got lost in that conversation or you're actually thinking about rolling over four one K. and you just want a little bit of guidance or well heck just somebody to sit and have a cup of coffee would give us a call at four O. one Seventy seven\nTo Seventy seven that again is for one seven to seven twenty seven twenty seven speaking of coffee I could probably use another cup right now one or two when the gray\nWould be great because well the reason why you want to move to the IRA is because you understand the guidelines and how it works but it also gives you more freedom to be able to plan for your arm these coming up\nWell it's a train right so you you you invest in to the employer plan\nWe call it a four one K. A. there's other those are the styles of this but today we're focused on four one K. so you save in the four one K.\nOnce you've left that employer or once that savings needs to do something else distribution\nYou have to roll it over just fundamentally it's designed to move from savings to roll over into an IRA I think that's all we talked about is that we've taken up from a savings account a giant savings account with multiple investment choices mutual funds yep and then moved it into\nAn IRA and that is just a vessel that's just a ... that's just the glass that's just the thing\nIt doesn't do anything it's ... it doesn't do any do you put water in it or coffee in it or tea in it or ... I guess I'm thirsty hours later there's ... ...\n... you have to it's only a vessel and or a vase is that I've had the ... vice oh that city oh bass bass I liked vases were fairly\nWell let's put it another way you're you're I raised just a rapper for your money and you can put whatever you want inside of that river so if you like chocolate if you like peanuts maybe like ... as long as you put the inside your rubber it's safe and it's\nProtected yeah I was going bore of how to distribute it I was talking about eating yeah I\nThink we're hungry and certainly here in the studio today so what we need to do is figure out so we have a four O. one K. we rolled it over to an IRA the IRA should distribution vehicle that's\nHow you take money out when it's with the employer the employer gives you loan options and you can take it out through alone if you I don't have an employer or you've left\nThat employer they're no longer going to give you a loan option you physically have to withdraw money and so instead of having to withdraw hundred percent of it you should be able to take it in bits and the only way to do that is through an IRA individual retirement account\nYeah the the IRA itself it's designed to be able to take it out with\nPieces in dribs and drabs so this where you could control now I'm a ... and it's my pleasure to be part of the teen hear from you could financial services we're all certified Social Security advisors with an essay as well as myself and Jason are both on a ours with you could well management\nSo we can help you maximize your Social Security and set up a retirement income tax strategy\nSo this way you know how to distribute from your IRAs it's all under one roof here you could financial services so be one of the next six calls at four zero one Seventy seven to seven to seven get a free\nCustomize written income report again the numbers for zero one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven\nNow when we come back we are going to talk about savings rollovers and requirement and distributions we're going to lay it out so you know how much to put away\nFor retirement you know exactly where it's going to go and you know exactly when you do believe that employer or that employer leaves you what are you going to do with that money rather than grab your chest in panic a little bit you roll it over\nWorking or walk through that and then you're ... when we come back we will lay it all out perfect English you'll love it it'll be great baby boomers just hold on we'll be right back [noise]\nMore of a retirement saturated with a team from Euclid financial services next [noise]\nIt's hard to go online these days without seeing another news story about a company fallen on hard times recently has borough has become the next company to restructure in an attempt to turn things around this means over two hundred employees are no longer employed and many of them have worked there for over\nThirty years now left to wonder if the retirement they were promised will even be there when the time comes\nIf you have concerns about your retirement or job security you should call your good financial services you could find services specializes in getting people to and through their entire tournament over the years we have held hundreds of clients who understand their options in we can do the same for you\nWe help political workers make better choices about their retirement options and benefits color you put funding services today at four O. one Seventy seven to seven to seven and schedule your complimentary financial stress test\nThat's four oh one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven go on line to you could fs dot com UC el id emphasis in financial S's in services dot com\nAttention ... usually selling something need your help you're invited to join in front chat and charities session as you please selling plan is starting a new project for twenty Eighteen charitable advancing we're donating to the highly around how men if\nAny women who bravely served our country in the in them and selling of his family rising to the challenge of making daddy for these soldiers in this hour time to give that to these courageous women\nAs they transition back into civilian\nLife my making blank and they can call their own\nLet's make a difference and you click community pulls together once again\nJoin us for a new selling at the home for one seven to seven Seventy seven for more information to donate again that four oh one Seventy seven to seven to seven you Glenn financial services stitching together retirement plans and\nFriendship since two thousand and three\n\nAnd this is the retirement factoring brought to you by your blood financial services [noise]\nWelcome back New England you our listeners time a factory brought to you by you could find services new England's go to retirement experts we're broadcasting from the ...

preserve and pass along your money than turn this ready what grab\nYour bed it's time to talk about retirement today we're talking about for one case where reminding baby boomers that for one case have the life cycle you don't take them into retirement as a ... you take them as an IRA were lay that out in very very Chris cleaned up all language\nSo that everybody understands it if you were getting ready to retire we have an awesome show today we have the entire team area you could read it help you get to and through your entire retirement that's four oh one\nSeventy seven to seven to seven or four oh one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven let's get talking about retirement Josh just\nDive into this topic on for one case you know being an advisor here or you could we come across several large companies that before when Kate is probably one of the best benefits companies like since ... and ever source\nAnd Eighteen tea and ... they have really good for with gay plants because well they want their employees to save for retirement besides being having a good\nWell for one case are definitely a benefit\nThey're there to help people say if they're there to help people get in front of retirements so not just the bosses are retiring but everybody's retiring fuss exactly that we have to get on the table the basic savings plan because that's what ... are so the basic savings plan is how much should we be saving twenty percent eighty percent four hundred percent of our gross\nNo maybe not that high but I I wouldn't mind saving four hundred percent you know bottom you're going to pay for a hundred percent of what this physics\nMajors that they're going that's impossible USA so the idea right so when you're talking about your four one K. exactly what should a baby boomer be targeting ten to Fifteen Percent savings does it ought to be in the ... no but it has to be total gross income\nYeah and I think we also have to address what happens when you actually hit your goal when you're four one K. what's that next step is it possible to hit your goal and you're four one K. is there actually is if you're now if you don't set one you'll never hit it if you're ever a forever laughing you know that the gods stopper but there is a finish line\nJosh I I I think we're kind of step and you're just kinda go back for a second are you saying that's confusing well really over the ... crystal clear I'm Talking like like a group of bell ringing off less clear is like my friend over as much\nA yes yes doing\nA rover is getting you control of your own money because once you leave your employer can't contribute to your ... you don't get any more employer matches and you're limited as far as being able to take money out of it because you can't do alone provision anymore\nSo you become restricted by whatever the guidelines are for a non employees now good luck getting straight answers out of that when you call the TPA or you're playing a ministry\nWhat yeah so let's talk through that because those are scary terms to so third party administrator or TPA a those are the people that that makes sure that if you do alone that's a website you go to\nIt it's not just fidelity there is another from behind fidelity\nOr if you're in a smaller from like a a smaller company not fortune five foot of fortune two thousand then when you call up you're going to talk to the gym or you're going to talk to\nBob you're going to talk to a broker in the employer has to send paperwork to them so they have to sign off on it those are what we call hurdles and they're designed to withdraw or slow down the process not to hurt you but\nTo say is is really necessary in sometimes to put walls up to say no it's not available\nIt's there as a protection peace for you to be able to stop and say okay is this really the right thing\nFor me is this in my best interests and so you do have to jump through some hoops to make sure that is the right thing for you and this is why you should always initiate roll over with the financial professional like us here you could financial services and make sure that we can get you through the paper work properly and make sure that the right choice for you\nYeah a hundred percent when you talk about a roll over though I don't want to make it sound scary\nRollovers are free so it doesn't matter what company use or how it works the roll over itself the active rolling over is free and that's that's a federal thing so the IRS put it all together so if you go from four one K. or any employer plan\nTo an IRA it's free the active rolling it over findings punish should not charge you for this financial advisors should not charge you just it's an act\nOf moving it to a individual retirement account\nAnd I think the key takeaway from this is the role from an old employer plan whether it's a four O. one K. or something else is natural it's part of the process of leaving a company whether you're going from one company to another or going from your final company to retirement ruler crosses self as natural as part of the distribution\nBecause without it you can't create a stable spending habits in retirement because you need to be able to know how much you can or will be able to spend every single week in retirement without a shadow of a doubt that you actually have enough money to last no matter how long you live and these are questions that you have\nTo get the answers to before you retire while there's still time to prepare and make sure\nThat your money last as long as your retirement does now with the near you could financial services is giving away customize written income report just for you we have three more of these reports left so take advantage of this offer now this plan works best with those are within five years of retiring or at least fifty five years old who are ready to be ready for retirement she'll be one of the next three callers right now at four O. one\nSeven to seven to seven to seven that's four zero one Seventy seven twenty seven twenty seven\nNow many this show is all about the life cycle of four one K. you start to save you put money in the four one K. you build up this war\nChest right you have this asset for retirement the idea is that you're saving for retirement everybody understands that there is no joke in that\nIt's every bit of literature I'm almost positive it's in every child book it's there yes mother goose wrote about her mother goose wrote about it and send the Grimm's fairy tale of retirement everybody gets a yacht and so now you have\nYour four one K. you roll it to an IRA why is it that way why do I have to rule it to an IRA individual retirement account the IRS isn't doing it as a trick\nIt's because it's the distribution model if you don't roll it over you still have to distribute it but now you have to take a hundred percent of it you have to take a large check if you roll it to an IRA you can take in small bits if you get to a certain age bracket say Seventy and a half\n... diets are now highlighting now you have to talk about taking a required minimum distribution if you've ever written that down grab you could no books write it down because this is a really important thing\nHuge penalty if you don't take it at seven and a half maximum to be real easy to understand if you do the life cycle four one K. roll over to an IRA irate to distribution if you do that rollovers cycle if you do that for one case cycle much much easier to understand requirement distributions\nBaby boomers get really really nervous about requirement distributions you have to take them at seven in ...\nWhy don't we start talking about taking them earlier than that\nI'm actually really glad you brought that up because when you say requirement or distribution in my mind I hear your income is just another way of saying income because when you were sitting in your four one K. and then moved to an irate it was because at some point in time in your life you were going to retire and then you were going to start taking money out of it\nBecause well you needed it because you're no longer working now if you're having trouble
