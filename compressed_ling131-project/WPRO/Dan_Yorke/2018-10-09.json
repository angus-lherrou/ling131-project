I. T. O. P.\nUm and number it's within the Republican Party in Rhode Island in general ... and\nAnd I was kind of a little shaken by it to be honest I had a another radio to the um\nRadio interview the following day I'm with the radio station in Newport again they had requested students from Roger Williams to count on the show and kind of talk about politics in Rhode Island as a whole truth so I told I told him I was like well I'm doing not tomorrow is there any way that I could support Joe trial without coming off as though I was\nAnti R. I. G. okay because I didn't want it to come off of that way for them and he told me that he would get back to me because he wasn't sure how to answer that question\nUm the following through that and I are us the German for coaches are those yes because I didn't want people thinking that I was against the Republican Party and I didn't think supporting Joe ... men thought but I guess the two correlated in that way so that night\nHe texted me and told me that there is a general consensus that I should cancel I interview in the morning and leave that top supporting Joe cello I'm basically distance myself from the campaign as much as possible\nAnd the following morning I was still going to be doing the interview on the Newport radio show he taxing me and told me that the former house minority leader confirmed that it would be detrimental to me if I supported Joe ... the former house minority leader\nYes meaning not Patricia marking the former former\nWhich is um [noise] um [noise] who's um\nWho's the former minority leader a brand new brand new burials minister okay yes I got that on my own toilet I go to them\n[laughter] you that as you get it on his own [laughter] um so I proceeded to the\nTo do their talk show anyways where I can voice that I supported Joe ... over Allen phone uh-huh and later on that day John Keith posted a poll in our ... board Facebook group trying to vote me out because I was going against the Republican Party and its values\nAnd its values yes and what particular values where you were posing allegedly [noise]\nI honestly am I'm sure I think it was just the fact that I wasn't supporting the nominee for governor Alan song that I was going against the party in that sense you don't you\nSo you went into this debate isn't isn't earners interested person\nYes I was on the Republican side\nSo you had Democrats or Republicans and independents students that you yes but you crossed over\nYes to because you were impressed with the

I'd learned about this Friday evening somebody a Patricia Patricia Morgan call me with about it but just your Morgan told me about your ears a smoking gun Patricia Morgan\nHired you on her staff did she not correct Europe paid staff or for Patricia Morgan yes I was right for that you should go to jail oh now I'm just suggesting that that's you know the ... campaign just texted my producer\nOr to let us know that your a paid staff or for the Morton campaign\nShe was a Republican correct correct now so I'm guessing you voted for Patricia Morgan in the primary correct high dead is this sour grapes on your part it is not sour grapes did on my side to support your trailer before Patricia Morgan offers are endorsement\nNow yes you did\nUse to vote yes yes yes follow the question sorry my fault yes I Do witness will follow the question [laughter] yeah I decided this on your own yes what Patricia Morgan have an influence on you\nKnow I'm so after ... primary I reevaluated who I can vote for obviously it wasn't going to be Gina [laughter] so it was fun or cello and I basically use the debate to kind of feedback deciding factor for me because it was an opportunity for the candidates to lay out their platform\nWhat was it about the debate the turn John for Joe true\nI think it was something as simple as he would answer the questions um and I when he didn't answer the questions I liked what he had to say in terms of his attitude for pro life on his press Second Amendment on his experience in the\nParty that that type of thing they did before you so so here's this is the the the funny part of this whole thing the\nUm theatrical officialdom that everybody in in this in this little tiny story and by the way this is a very tiny story I'm spending time 'cause I'm enjoying your company and I'm [laughter] and I and I enjoy young people than their thought process and it's important to to to pick the brains of of\nOf sub smart young people when it comes to the politics of the day and besides you had to sit there and listen to me and and Jonathan didn't fit [laughter] you were smart enough or shine off I Can't figure out which not to jump in\nDid you talk show show you just reacted on television on Facebook's coverage of the television debate correct um and then you followed that up on the radio side yes this was no conspiracy for Joe ... to ... the young Republican executive chef was it\nNow on I Believe Daniel north had asked all of us on that hang out on the panel who we thought it did back in the debate and my reaction after watching the debate was killed shallow did the best and the debate and I explained why\n[noise] um and you spoken with Joe ... yeah he met with them yes and how did that go it went really well are you going to work for him yes volunteer or paid paid\nGood are you just shopping for jobs no [laughter] no serious every ... scratch you know so [laughter] no I'm not shopping for a job [laughter] well what are you gonna end up doing for him\nI'm I'm just going to help in the last actually the campaign it's less than a month of this plant so\nAre you working on for are you working on a paid basis for any other candidate no but you're working on behalf above landers yes and bought Flanders suggested that you can't work for him\nBased on your decision to support the independent for governor Joe ... he has not yet expressed that to me have you had a conversation with them about it now\nYou plan on having a conversation with them about potentially you think you'd probably have a conversation with him about it now that you've been on the radio show you're explaining the whole situation yes more than likely you worry about the above Flanders taking you off his campaign\nYou think that will happen now because I think that Mr financial respect my independent thought ... that's my guess me too mhm mhm so um this notion\nThat\nHere here's I I Want to put this in perspective and please give me give me whatever the ... whatever answer used the truth okay okay do you think the young Republicans Rhode Island organization or the republic was Rhode Island young Republicans ...\nIs formidable I mean have you guys really had an imprint on on the local political landscape\nI think in the sense that we you help a lot of local candidates I'm with the campaigns I'm not only the executive board but also members as well\nIs the is the charter I failed asked Mr Keyes the chairman is um maybe you know as a member of the executive board\nIs is this is this Republican organization tied directly to the state GOP by any kind of legality charter or otherwise I Am an sure of that so you don't know whether you're just interested independent body or whether you actually have some kind of by law connection or legal liability connection to the state you\n... as far as I Know we're just we're supposed to be supporting the candidates that were not\nListen to this the foundational love you no matter within the Republican\nI mean I I get it but a Mr Keith doesn't report to Mr bell now every ... ever any conversation about the board\nReporting to the state chairman of it yeah no no there's no direct line that forces is not that I'm aware of you know a coal Brennan bell shaped will join us to see if he'll he'll talk to us about this\nDo you find this to be kind of ironic that um the Rhode Island young Republicans other than the people who've worked in the networking and the Facebook page and whatever and I don't how many people are in the group and you don't know whether that's your homework assignment\nThat as my homework assignment but for the most part it ... it in operation relative obscurity correct\nCorrect by putting words in your mouth or do you agree no I agree with that statement and now that he's done this correct he's make now he's making Rhode Island young Republicans statewide conversation yes by firing\nA twenty year old junior in college because she had an independent thought about a former Republican candidate running for governor what are the lessons that you're learning hear about this\nWell I think the biggest lesson [laughter]\nWould be that\nDon't matter what you should still stand up for what you believe in um I Know that sounds really corny um that the end of the day you're going to have to be the one to sleep at night so I Would rather be kicked off aboard than support a candidate who I Believe does not reflect my values\nOkay\nDid you have an expectation when you came here that they might reverse their thought process\nOr is that ms and Jonathan was the key is\nIn the eight people who voted against you\nI don't think I did now do you want to remain in the ... I\nWould like turned me on the board I think I'm valid asset to the board I think a little differently than most of them do in the sense of the candidate to support for governor which\nDid you agree with me and you don't have to do you agree with me as I was giving Mr Keith a hard time there but the process there would have been nice to have a personal conversation with members of the border before they popped you I Do agree with that statement yet have you ever had\nContentious debate mean healthy debate amongst the board on issues now what what the hell do people do\nWe [laughter] we how political candidates got elected\nYou don't have conversations about about issues uniform opinions or you don't have good healthy debate you don't you don't have that thing you don't do what we do with our politics in the planes every once in awhile have a beer and just get after you're not drinking age yet so\nHere right [laughter] I'm sure you've never had no absolutely not um [laughter] as social there's an opportunity for civil discourse them but for the most part everyone just kind of agree with each other\nIt's been quiet in the hallway and the work office building where the two sides in the Providence School bus driver strike been meeting\nOnce in a while someone comes up for a break but no comment on the federally mediated talks to strike\nNow and it's a day and Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh diving into his new job asking questions of both sides and arguments over increased prison sentences for repeat offenders chief justice John Roberts welcoming cabin on behalf of the entire court wishing him the traditional long and happy career in our common calling\nWB our sports it's game for the night in the a LDS at the red Sox win this evening it would take the division for Boston you can hear the game from Yankee Stadium it's going to be an sister station am seven Ninety from\nThe sea skate Christmas steak or whether center accuweather meteorologist Bob ... says apart we probably warm evening\nSome white Knight fog in a low of sixty seven partly sunny humid tomorrow Hi Avi tomorrow night well clouds warm and humid low sixty six and Thursday not so warm stone humid though some rain and the high up Seventy two currently Seventy five degrees here at the weather station of Robert Murphy has her latest book is\nTraffic from the WPRI road traffic center\nNinety five noise found the past thirty seven percent boulevard aided slow front of the deal out around the therapies avenue ... watch out for a a breakdown of the right shoulder there\nAt ...
