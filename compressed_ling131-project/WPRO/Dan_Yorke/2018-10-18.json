C. Y. F. and now he's on the new hip thing those are are are are three of the most important competency issues that Governor Mondo has to deal with and where she is\nUm challenge of all there's no doubt about that\nSo as we as we head toward you know the the final stretch of election day you know fun is finally figured out that he better start you know focusing completely on governor ... and the stuff that she's doing and that's what he's been doing the last three days and that makes sense to me\nHe's answers\nI wouldn't give them an a four but at least the choice of of of you know what a way you know when you put your pants on in the morning you know what do you feel like doing today at least that you know that part he's finally got figured out are so good for him he was on with Matty earlier today um\nAnd and and it's been you know he's ... he's he's a little sore over the last conversation he and I had he's been crying about these people cry about it and they've called the bosses and they say it was too hard\nAnd all that kinda stuff and so you know usually you know he's he's like you know baby with his Bob ... and then the social media stuff into the fake then your stuff and up and up up up up up there but it's all it's all part of their of their\nLike sucking on the baby bottle stuff that they go through\nThat ... that never affects me I'm telling you that is what's going on but number affects the way I look at stuff I think he's been smarter and the last few days\nAnd you know that might that might give him a little separation I'm from Joe ... and a little bit more a opportunity to dig into what I think he's the only avenue to to get after the governor and that is are competency issues\n'cause she's there not you're not going to win on the conceptual issues right now people are just kind of in their own places right now\nVery interesting uh a woman who says that she's very very left of center was at this forum and she asked me um you know what I thought the you hip crisis if you will what role would play in this election and I said very little\nAnd she kind of looked at me and plus a wasted 'cause no one's making a big deal about 'em and it seems like that you know that moment may have gone by lo and behold today Alan songs making a big deal about you have spent the first time he's mentioned it I'm just saying so it's it's kind of like his program uh that makes sense to me\nIt makes sense to me\nUm but I don't know what the hell Joe's doing I I don't know what he's doing here here's some audio from Joe trouble today um some audio from him in his press conference started from the top Alex and and and we'll we'll hear what he has to say\nWho work is that the a correctional institution in back of us right now he's at the by the way we can use a direct [noise]\nUpon this charge of an immigration detainees correctional officers have no legal authority to assess\nThe apprehension detention of individuals sword fighting immigration and Customs Enforcement or ice [noise] fearful all correctional officers\nIncluding those assigned to perimeter oh oh so I'm home since I hit by an struck [laughter] they are prohibited from was ice agents in any way I've reaction was intention of individuals\n... for example if that's\nThe thing he identifies the ice [laughter]\nAttempts to lose a reaction [noise] Rhode Island he oversees a cannot says the apprehension [noise]\n\nOn the line with us British [noise] we what this is this race Leah thanks very stay with the whole [laughter] thing way\nTo assess what no wind stages trying to get hold of criminal illegal immigrants [noise] All right so so there's\nThere's kind of the premise that look I think Joe is is it is found something that is that is interesting provocative compelling but there's a who should vying using him this is a preach to the choir speech\n\nIt makes no sense he'd be he'd be much better shape talking about animal rights which I Know he he he feels very strongly about\nAnd and\nSome new piece of legislation that he'll promote as governor on on how to navigate boats better in the water or or\n\nSomething where people go oh okay that's a new idea I've never thought about that and it's really not I'm not it doesn't hinge on my any allergy and maybe you ought to give this guy who was the independent candidate for governor luck\nYou are listening to this today about oh my God you're what the hell are you doing what are you doing solidifying the choir than is already pledged to you\nAll six percent of our seven percent or eleven percent or twelve percent okay I'll stretch it Thirteen or fourteen percent at the coast\n\nIt's like it's like it's like operating a campaign in quicksand that's not a growth conversation it's interesting it may bothers some people are but he's got to pick off\nDemocrats\nHe's got to find unaffiliated voters who get excited about some new leadership vision he's got no time [laughter]\nSo I'm analyzing both of those candidates and their own silos I think fun is actually doing I think fun just had a much better and constructive\nWeek when was the debate by the way\nOut was that everybody focused over

of that is only Fifteen in Providence let's\nSay sixty five other ones so it's those Fifteen stick together and they tried to get legislation passed that all these molesters cannot come into Providence they'd have sixty five people against him because those people don't want\nThem in their neighborhoods either well do you have a go now the next step is all these people that are the areas have to go to the state house in January\nThey can't forget about this one this man is going because believe me this man is going to lead we're not going to give up I'm not going to give up as long as
