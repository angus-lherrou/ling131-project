Ireland quite a bit um you know not having a lot of\nMoney I guess I guess as a kid I grew up right near Roger Williams Mark I'm ... I'm trying to say I didn't go there that much but I I think it was free when I was a kid I think it was yeah it was a um\nOptional donation we used to let the kids ... we didn't have a lot of money at the time but we used to let the kids to some change into the um donation thing but it was only on donation\nOptional um we'd spend rainy days walking all over yeah I'm I'm ... ... in and hope the old and an oil yeah well anyways boat\nYou mentioned your kids having to leave all leave the state to pursue a career right you know all our kids are in their mid to late thirties and that hit a home about ten years ago yeah and once your kids move away have a family of stabbed was alive\nHe'll come back every once in a while but they're not coming back to live and um it's sad because we've had to go without\nYou know being hands on grandparents for a lot of our grandchildren and it hurts it hurts so you know it does happen to every state if if you don't walk up the\nWill of course every state Joe has ... you know in and out migration right that just a natural phenomena but especially in the northeast you're in Massachusetts but especially in Rhode Island\nUh we we have a problem we make we make it hard for people to live um a prosperous and and free lives um\nUm you have to really you know I mean how many people I mean just think of the people not only who have less how often do we hear oh my gosh as soon as I retire I'm outta here right I mean ...\nWhy do we accept that why why do politicians and not get that one why do they only make the issue worse you know I mean I mean and the contrast is it's not it's not a gee it's not a geographical climate thing because you look at New Hampshire\nThey're they're they're even worse climate than us in math than you\nAnd yet they're they're number one and a lot of these national ranking people are ... they're they're working there they don't spend as much they don't control people's lives as much and people say it's all about the policies every once they all people leave Rhode Island 'cause the weather early Massachusetts baloney Joe well\nWe have that problem in Massachusetts to where we we say you know where we're ... we're done we're out of here ... you know you get ... you get\nCaptured to state you're almost forced to stay because of family and everything else but um you know New Hampshire you brought up in New Hampshire and that was going to was talking I was going to bring up you know they've\nUm some of the imported college vote hurts a lot of these small towns and communities and I know it's a factor in Rhode Island um\nYou know the answer is going to try to close the barn door before it gets um\nTaken down and that's what the college vote where you have to be a full time residents to vote\nYeah I think that a particular problem with that was in the news last election that they were a lot of\nCollege kids or were allowed to just even if they didn't register to vote were basically allowed to use their their New Hampshire address and ... and I think the story if I remember was it must have swung that senatorial election up there too long ago was yeah yeah ...\nWell Jo Jo thanks for calling in and we ... we agree with you I mean I mean I'm sure there's a lot of\nLot of listeners out there uh when we know there are who have family members have gone or thinking\nThemselves about leaving ... heck I think of the people just since I started this this my center and got involved in the ... when I called the center right movement in in our state I Would say half of the people that were here six seven years ago themselves have moved out of state seemed like South Carolina it's a very\nPopular place for what islanders Europe in fact it's a beautiful state my wife and I love it down their Charleston is an amazing city ah down in South Carolina so I'm gonna I'm gonna see after the break we'll listen a little more Steve you're a as we head out Mike sent us on changing gears\n\nFrom the New England truck solutions to this is talk of him and I am six thirty WPRI\nKnown as ... [noise]\nSpecial report deadly Pittsburgh shooting a deadly attack on a synagogue in Pittsburgh is being investigated as a hate crime correspondent Nick ... with the tally from Pittsburgh public safety director\nHe would not confirmed the number of those killed only saying that there were multiple casualties are adding that this was a horrific crime scene perhaps one of the worse that he's ever seen he did say there were six injuries and of those injuries included for police officers he says three officers had non life threatening injuries three others were in critical condition\nPresident Trump is monitoring the situation\nPresident Trump calling on the nation to toughen its punishments for killers\nI think one thing we should do is we should sit for not far laws in terms of the death penalty when people do this they should get the death penalty or they shouldn't have to wait years and years\nMr Trump dismissed the idea of tougher gun laws believing instead that an armed guard in the synagogue might have saved lives up costing teeny Washington\nWe we can't have a good jobs if we don't have good businesses but yet Rhode Island wants to strangle businesses constantly in the name of workplace justice you know the progressive regrets as what\nEverybody's outcomes to be the same you know does matter your experience or your prior pay or you know everybody should be treated the same that's not the way it works well that and then when we mandate that employers\nI'm here to these crazy regulations all we're doing is driving them out of state or or making them less profitable so they can pay you less and I made the analogy at the banquet yesterday\nThat it's kind of like what the Dodgers did and this has been my criticism ... now make\nThe former baseball player talking about my criticism of Dave Roberts as much as he's a Red Sox zero here are we really helped the red Sox out the first two games\n\nYou know so the red Sox still left these the first two games he took his for his best hitters who are left handed hitters out of the light up\nOver a hundred home home runs worth of hitters he put on the bench because statistically right handed hitters will do better against left handed pitcher\nBut yeah these these are his producers employers are your cleanup hitter is in your economy we need our workers to lead off and all that but your employers on the power players in our economy just like these lefty hitter is without power hitters in his line up and he put them on the bench\nAnd ... and they lost two games and they look very anemic and losing those two games even though there are good ball games they look last night now they had a right handed pitcher last night he puts those guys back in and they hit two out of the three home runs\nA that that the Dodgers hit last night and in fact including the game winner in the bottom of the case of tonight's going to be the test Red Sox are throwing a lefty tonight and I don't know if I've heard who yet but they're they're the only three candidates are left these\nUm and I I I I Will bet you\nThat he does not make the same as I bet you at least a couple of those left handed hitters who are so his better hitter is on the team he's not going to put them on the bench and again the analogy is when we put regulations\nOn our business we're almost it's almost like putting employers on the bench we're restricting their ability to produce just like David Roberts restricted his Dodgers teams capacity to produce runs by putting forward as best players\nOn the bench the first two games I don't ... this is not a time for minor statistical variances you've got to go with the guys who got you here you know regardless of what they just like you know the the regrets it was one it while it's a fair if we do this or it's not fair if we do that so therefore we're going to put all these mandates on employers baloney\nLet them do their job let them know do what they do best which is produced products engage in commerce pay employees and as we saw with the federal tax cuts\nWhen they make money because of lower taxes are booming profits they will give they will distribute the best former redistribution is a job\nIs the free market the free market is the best form of income distribution because the money that's made is distributed to employees and higher paying jobs in more jobs in bonuses in stock options and pension returns\nThis is what happens is wouldn't you rather have earned money and a good job and then be forced you know the ... because of a minimum wage\nMandate ... you know that you may or may not have earned so so that was the analogy I made um yesterday and then say is pretty good I'm gonna take a couple of the baseball stories and a little while\nBut by the growth is Steve Moore said yesterday at our centers freedom banquet growth is the key to everything a growth creates the jobs that creates the salaries and the prosperity we want and it also gives the government the money it needs\nSo-so lower taxes again it doesn't make sense on the one hand but if you understand economics it makes perfect sense\nIf you want more money for the government you lower tax rates\nSo that people and businesses are more productive and when they're more productive they just that they have they have ... more profits and income to pay taxes on more transactions taking place with sales taxes and whatnot so um\nWe need we need that change you you you this is an election coming up\nYou need to vote and you need to vote informed unique to study\nGubernatorial candidates senatorial candidates general assembly candidates even your local city or town council a mayoral candidates who is talking about pro growth low low tax policies who's\nTrying to ... some excuse to put more taxes more regulations and more fees on you and on employers in our state or in your community educate yourself we need pro growth policies in this state\nWe are we we are we rank forty or we have the we have one of the worst business climate some of the state\nAnd that means we have one of the lowest levels of prosperity and the state and and we we talk yesterday about the unemployment rate you hit you hear our political class crowing about the lower the unemployment state in Rhode Island you know what it has gone down\nAnd it's and it's closed the gap with a New England neighbors and with the ... the national average but yet when you look at broader indexes index is that that look at\nReal prosperity we still are bottom five and we have not close the gap why well think about this the unemployment rate doesn't care if you've worked five hours a week or fifty hours a week and as long as you can check the box and say I worked\nThe ... the unemployment rate so that's a good thing not necessarily the unemployment rate doesn't care whether you're earning your market value or not\nYou might be worth sixty Seventy eighty thousand dollars in a prior job and maybe now you're working at a thirty forty thousand dollar job or maybe you're only working part time when you when you want to work full time employment rate doesn't care about that\nOr some of these broader index is do the unemployment rate also doesn't care I mean taxes you pay doesn't care\n\nThe index we put together in the index we look at care about all those things those are true measures of prosperity\nWorking as much as you want are you working at the income level that you deserve to be at the market would normally pay you and ... and are you being overwhelmed with with paying taxes those those measures are true prosperity and wrote and when you look at those broader measures\nWe do not do well\nAnd this is this is why when you hear politicians talk about the low unemployment rate you've got to ask him how all that that's a very inadequate metric\nWe apparently we got a lot of people working part time are limited at limited income compared to what they're worth and obviously we're paying a heck high taxes um on a lot of different areas um\nAnd the legislation that that's out there you know would only make a issues worse we talked about regulation as well know Grover Norquist who who spoke last year at our banquet said he's famous for his no tax\nPledge that if I had a do over I I Do and no tax and no regulation pledge\nBecause regulations or justice strangling as taxes and we see nationally the Trump Administration cutting taxes and regulations that we see the economy booming I'm gay can be two examples of regulatory reforms going bad in Rhode Island when we come back\nMy extent house pinch hitting for Christian Mike on changing gears give us a call for three eight nine seven seven say

two callers Charles and south thank you both so the reason I say all that so I Want to circle back 'cause there was a method to my madness worst started\nWhat I just described last segment these dangerous to our freedoms as where the far left is right now and they're in the Democratic party nurse especially in the Democratic party in our state so I asked you from the beginning\nIs this a party are going to stay with or walk away from this election\nIt's up to you I mean you can do whatever you want I'm just trying to lay out lay it out for you clear and within the Democratic party obviously there are there are some people who are moderate and commonsense thinkers and there was an increasing number however who are not so again as a voter do you know who was who\n\nTo the gassy project dot com they have a website it shows you who's who but you should find out but you should make an informed vote this is very important\nKnow who you're voting for are you gonna are you going to walk away from the extreme left us or do you want to stay with the extreme left his that's your choice but be aware of what's going on that's why I bring up all these examples because this is where the far left is and I don't think many many road I I don't think as many as the media wants you to think\nSupport that let's let's go to the phones who's been on the longest ear crystal let's go to

people who give ... philanthropic Lee because\nWe agree with you that philanthropic charity I especially believing church based charities are far better than government getting involved in taking money from you and taking brother money for me and from our neighbors where I Believe that the charities can do a lot of the great work the government\nTries to do I agree with you on that

Rhode Island has been mired in\nI have a friend of mine hard to change around here they just they're they're so entrenched this mindset Sal that\nRight well I don't know that it's it's easy to say oh there's a problem let's have government fix it\nAnd it's such an easy thing to do but and but they don't think that playing checkers instead of paying chested don't understand the consequences ... and regulations bring it\nWorking on getting rid of that sales tax but ...\nWell we we think that's a great way to a boost our economy or yesterday Steven war so yesterday the even more so we should get

Dark Knight idea again race it because it's a new adventure if you're going into it with the idea of I have I'm going to re set a new purpose I'm going to do another thing for my life I'm going to embrace something new instead of being afraid of something different if you're going to embracing the new I'm telling you it's much\nEasier process and it's one of those things get excited from the next chapter in is usually catalyst that happens\nEither something monumental as happened in your life and now your perspective is change or you just walked into work one day and it's not the same place you can go to for the last three years something has changed and you're just ready to move on and so now you start going through this mental checklist of what do I need so I can walk away confidently\nYeah I'm In the thing that kind of happens is that people get into this with my boss doesn't understand me the company's\nMaking a different direction whatever the reason is I'm just I'm not feeling appreciated there's whatever's happening in your life that you want to go flip over your boss his desk or slash the tires of your co workers you go too far too long ago are no fly it please cut that [laughter]\nAnyway this is the idea of ... so the idea is you you're in this place and you're just I'm ready to retire I'm done going and it's not fun anymore first thing people do is an inventory they started opening up those statements that they haven't done they're starting to become active in trying to figure out how to log in because you're ... and passwords and stuff so now you've got to go get forget\nAfterwards and go through the regiment of what emails that I put on it you have to do all that and it's it's actually it's tedious but I'm telling you you'll feel better once you actually know where everything is you might not know how much you need but you know however they yes\nYeah and that that image towards step is that first place because it gives you a good starting point to start thinking through okay what do I actually have and then your mind automatically gravitate towards that next fall which is okay well what do I need to spend every month how much why actually need everything\nYeah well yeah that's that's a natural way to go is out well how much income and what can I generate ... I I think that's where I Want to stop people and say don't go there yet [laughter] go into what am I going to do when we're talking with my new purpose\nNow I have assets in and it could be four thousand it could be two million it could be whatever your number is\nDisregard the number that's easier said than done right yeah disregard the number and now what am I going to do with my life what's my life purpose and I know it's really big just say that because when you thought while I was going to be the I don't know the accountant for\nX Y Z company you didn't think that was my life purpose when you were going to become the accounting but that's what you did for fifty years\nYeah it's the the idea of what do I want to be when I grow up well what do I want to do when I'm retired it's the same question yeah\nAnd so this gives me it starts saying what are you going to do and you grow up and then when everybody ... your tires start young congratulations you're finally grown\nAdults exactly so now that you you understand okay I can pick and choose what I Want to be and how I Want to be it you can dive right into it but the one thing that you have to remember is the beginning point of any retirement plan is if you've got to create a stable foundation to maximize your retirement income especially in a predictable\nFashion so the starting point is understand how to optimize your Social Security benefits because at face value you can be tens of\nThousands of dollars on the table by employing a few little known strategies it's actually possible to generate as much as a hundred thousand dollars or more an additional lifetime income so let myself and the teen years you could financial services\nGive you a complementary customize your income report so this way you can see how much maximizing your retirement income can actually\nImpact your overall retirement now to get your customized plan the one of the first five callers right now it for one\nSeventy seven to seven to seven that's for one seven to seven twenty seven twenty seven don't\nLet your retirement become mediocre now many one of the things that are a great about this a written income report is that it really does straighten out your retirement it's it's awesome I actually we had a car call and Kathy oh jeez this had to be six months ago maybe five\nI'm afraid we can't retire in two years like we plan I looked at what we said what we spent every month and it just doesn't seem it's enough\nAnd it was a very open moment both hole and John they were scared and frustrated\nThey had set a goal while they were working and now is they got closest to the deadline they felt like they missed it now before we make any changes let's find out where you are today and at the end of this process will give you the confidence on hotter retired two years Keith the lifestyle you plan for and make sure you don't run out of money and sold in the next few meetings we talked about what they had saved\nFor retirement between their Social Security there for one k.'s in IRAs and savings accounts\nThey have plenty of money but what was missing was how to distribute it out over the three types of income guaranteed predictable inflexible this is well written income report really helped and actually allowed me to be able to explain how all three of the income types worked for them so as we were going through the report together I turned on them and said\nYou can retire in two years as long as we organize your four one K. and your IRAs for distribution with your Social Security is still create the guaranteed income you need to cover your day to day needs\nWhile still leaving plenty of money aside for you to cover the things you plan on doing in the future as well is make sure you can sleep at night even if like it's in the way it was at this point that Paul was actually able to relax\nShe was finally able to see the missing pieces of puzzle and she was now ready to be ready for retirement you you could financial services we believe being ready for retirement is more than just having saved enough money\nIt's about knowing how much you've said what's the lifestyle I'm going to have\nAnd how am I going to sustain it for my entire life but it also includes having someone like myself in the ... financial services to guide you through the pieces that are missing and now that beginning point of any retirement plan\nIs making sure that you have a stable foundation that maximize your retirement income and a predictable fashion so the starting point is to optimize\nYour Social Security benefits because at face value you can leave tens of thousands\nOf dollars on the table but by employing a few little known strategies it's actually possible to generate as much as a hundred thousand dollars or more an additional lifetime income so come in just like Paul and John and let us give you a complementary customize ... income report so this way you can see how maximizing the retirement income\nCan impact your overall retirement now to get your customize your income plan you must be at least fifty five years old and be ready to be ready for retirement we have only three\nLeft in these reports so called right now for all one seven to seven to seven to seven that's for one seven to seven twenty seven twenty seven and let's get ready to be ready to retire\nYeah you really do need a written income report it puts the image were together for us so that one of your biggest hurdles is just to teach yourself how to dream big again\nHow to teach yourself to I Want to be an astronaut or I Want to be I don't know I Want to run through two states ... wearing only Nike's just just two states just too well for me it would be Delaware and Rhode Island\nSo back to back yeah but but the short way okay yeah that's a long way\nGot it ... if anybody's ever even though that that's actually not [laughter]\nSo the idea is you have to start dreaming big you have to get your lifestyle in order and you have to really start giving yourself permission to really be you again and I think that is a very difficult thing to do when you've been in a regimen for fifty\nForty five fifty years when you're in you're working years 'cause you're told well this is your purpose this is your purpose then you build your entire life around that\nYes the idea of what's my new structure which that new plan which my new routine and that doesn't mean okay I've retired I'm going to get up I'm going to have two cups of coffee I'm gonna watch daytime TV and the more than one grow it all over it and\nI I think that's I think your nail it it because that right there when when the retirees say that it's that's them deflecting\nThe conversation of I'm not really sure what you're talking about it's okay to be lost in this conversation you have to say it's new to me it's okay to be lost take a second in just think through\nWhat did I give up by working yeah what did I give up what do I need to gain back to make myself hold again because of its gonna I'm gonna fix my house\nWell that that's good for about a year and then you're either going to go back to work or you're going to really have a lost retirement and you're gonna be wishing that you had something to do so have a great retirement become a precise planner and actually understand that when you are goal oriented\nWhen you have a purpose you can start to do that in that layers in income because now you know guaranteed money predictable money and flexible money all flows is one so that you go from your go go to your desk you go from your slow go to your death and then you go well\nAs as I've gotten a waste I think of as no different than go planning organizer\nAnd you're so for a project at work you're just trying to figure out what am I trying to accomplish over the next five years ten years Thirty years now you don't need to plan out every single year between the day you retire to the day you pass away but you can have miles to the checkpoints because then that\nHelps you actually defined what your retirement income and how am I going to break out the income in the different layers from guarantee predictable inflexible\nNow myself and Josh we are part of the you could financial team we are all certified\nSocial Security advisors with NSA as well as my cell being an IRA are with you because
