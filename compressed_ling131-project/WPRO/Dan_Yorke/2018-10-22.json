[noise]\nGood afternoon and the revolution soft wash new center Ron Paul's and Gary with the three o'clock WPRI news OSHA and protections building inspector determining why a ceiling in a building under renovation collapsed down to the seller three people working to turn a former mailing the residences were injured one critically and acting battalion chief Michael Fisher versus\nTheir effort needed to follow a sequence\nOur initial concerns absolutely with that more people could be trapped in the rubble also the remaining people in the building we needed to evacuate that's why we had to go to a large scale operation perform secondary circus so that we make sure that everybody was out of the building let alone they have a car\nAll of the secrets ideals that work has negotiated with their labor unions over the last decade without a request in a in the morning the afternoon I was visited by the fire inspector\nThat meeting go by the way\nWhich one with the fire inspector yeah I Know the ... showed up later but\nWell yeah so he was very cordial and we walked through he\nTold me that he had a an unspecified anonymous complaints about some sort of safety issue with lighting in my in my office he told the guy next door to me that they had an unspecified issue with a a an exit blockage ... he didn't find any problems in any of our bill so\nShowing the show when you left out

[laughter] oh my goodness and then the mayor came on a with Matty last week and and just threw up over themselves I mean there was embarrassed\nBy the way marathon and actually came by my office\nHe did you you talked about that yeah a movie you know you can't put two and two together here he is completely open minded as to whether or not this warrants further investigation has NOAA has no instinct about whether this was purposeful or not none of you know based on your\nWell I'm ... based on your well I'm a I'm certainly allowed for public information requests there's there's a lot of really says come on guys really just stop it please stop it already moving on moving moving on [noise] so ... so\nThere's this thing Mr ... to ... which I thought it was interesting which is that hey you know there may be others in fact I'm sure there are others or I'm not I'm just paraphrasing what he might have said that the point is a there seems to be some substantial discussion in the\nI think weirdly controversial town of ... east Greenwich mean ... those people in these Greenwich mean Paul he left is supposed to be smooth right I guess not it's just turbulent politics\nAs we've seen any community and now the town manager who's under fire a perpetually and you know fishing ethics commissions questions and and the like and and always a\nA you know the the brunt of ... you know\nTown council argument is now presenting some controversial stuffed tonight correct\nYeah so uh according to the agenda or that I was able to see on line one of the agenda item\nBy the way to hold on to hold on to the ... uh Alex did you get there stuff off mind you I'm Glad I'm Glad you were able to see it on line we we've been fishing all over the place we couldn't get an agenda passed October for the other special like passwords\nBut now I founded Allah he let us know after the commercial after we let you go okay this is a two hundred and eight page document being introduced tonight in east Greenwich which still yeah ... there's\nAn agenda item that basically says they're going to there's going to be a discussion of a\nSide agreements that that's my language they called us something a little bit that can you read it to\nShore All right I'm not too hungry pages no well okay thanks fine uh [laughter] uh\nUnder new business there is going to there's an agenda item that they're going to update and report on the legal status of memoranda of agreement and memorandum of understanding executed administratively without prior council approval authorization or deliberation\nWhich are administrator did this\nThis would be the previous administrate or in the town of these scratch\nAnd these are disagreement or this book what ... what is it about do you know\nWell as I did look at a couple of the ... did not read all two hundred pages because ... I Am I'm just not that statistic\nAnd or or is it masochistic I always forget which one it is anyway legs masochistic masochistic and so\nThey are but the bottom line is that the the one that I looked at a had to deal with a incoming firefighters in what step that they would be a brought in that would they be brought in at the the lowest step which is what the contract calls for what might they be placed into higher stuff which is what the site agreement did\nSo uh just like in Warwick where\nThe union negotiated with a a friendly administration or for benefits that were outside what was agreed contractually\nAre the same thing happened in east Greenwich and a final\nUh agreement wasn't ratified by the legislative body in this case the east Greenwich town council so as as attorney ... said it therefore carries no force of law is invalid so you know we're seeing now a pattern at least of to where\nWe have these these conch quote unquote contract negotiations that carry big dollars attached to them that aren't being done the right way back to being done in a totally non legal way so the question that I have and uh I'll find out\nHow bad it was a war because of my open records request that netted me my surprise inspection um\nWe're getting ready to ask every Rhode Island municipality for all of their site agreements that they've negotiated that alter the terms of the contract that were never ratified by their counsel so you know I suspect that as as attorney ... said he thinks that it's fairly widespread practice\nHopefully we'll be able to determine just how widespread it is and ultimately I think we're going to need although we it's already not legal\nMaybe we're going to need some legislation and maybe even some penalties put in place to ensure that this kind of garbage stops because well\nHow how would you know Vince August is pretty short guy he must have a basis to to assert that it's a pretty widespread widespread practice and if it's a widespread practice how could it be\nWell that's just it and you know ... why is it a widespread practice what it said violation of the law um why are we ... and look I think the ultimate problem is if you strip all of the noise away the real challenge here is that all of these negotiations are conducted in secret\nThe contracts if they are ratified are ratified out of the public eye the public doesn't know what everyone's agreeing to until after the NCAA is dry and it's too late\nSo this idea that all this stuff happens in secret all too often with both sides basically play for the same team\nAnd the ones who take it on the chin or the taxpayers we see it over and over and over again and I think that the whole process is bunk and it has to be changed the tax payers if ah we see over and over again that whether it's the administration or the county or whatever that they're not\nWatching out for taxpayer interest through their actions are there in actions\nYou got to get the taxpayers a chance to defend themselves and we don't have it in the process that we have right now and I think that has to change\nSo you've you've you're ... if I heard you correctly you're doing a request for our own communities right now\nThat we're not out there yet but it will be soon yeah\nWell I appreciate your your your work\nI'm ... but this is something that needs to be done by the attorney general\nYeah this is already general maybe the next one might do something you know Putin ruin a I think would be very interested\nIn is yeah uh Peter kill Martin doesn't have a bit of interest in something like this no\nUm but I I don't I I think\nYou know once you able to gather\nTwo or three or four more towns if God Forbid they exist suicide agreements were public employees\nA you know outside contractor I mean I think you just stop there and then you just you just petitioning the attorney general's office to pick it up and by that time will have an election time we'll have a lame duck and by that time they'll keep the file on the just the first week of January when Putin Rona gets in there\nAh because I think we go down the wrong track if we start asking for some kind of legislative\nUm at least certainly on legislative response to this this is without a doubt in my mind\nIllegal activity yeah I mean there's just it's illegal criminal activity and the perpetrators of such have got to be investigated\nPursued prosecuted and tried it's not it just it what what's amazing to me is that the the billboards firefighters\nKind of out in what was suspected by you and and then rub Cody and anybody else was paying attention to it by grieving it\nBy saying what is a mayor\nOh I'm In in the summertime unbeknownst a lot of us maybe you but not to me I'm Still came out with a grievance made a solemn and stop paying this vacation pay based on his worry that this thing was not legit I guess based on your pressure and rub goodies pressure and then they\nGrieve it and so so there as if they are completely in the dark right over [laughter] that is side agreement has to be ratified by contract council and mayor is so\nThis attorney general's office should have made a public statement that they're doing an inquiry old ready\nNothing but crickets from that lazy corrupt place\nOh my God all the career people the attorney general's office I'm sure aside I mean that leadership and there is just they'll stink go and the clocks running and it's almost over thank God a revolution stuff wash new center polish headlines and got you on my line of four three dirty

B. R. prominence cumulus station [noise]\nWell I I'm In fact I even called ah you know can't block and I you know I've spoken with him in the past as well but I was\nActually quite shocked at its thought of a side agreement and so I did my homework and I did find out that they are rather common but I'm not sure because what they're what they're set up to do is to try to set up unintended consequences but\nAnytime you've got when we're having we remember the [noise]\nUm so so for example I I spoke with a friend of mine um she's in another municipality and\n[noise] she gave me the example of where you've you've got an agreement with a union and for example that the in the ... and the agreement they will say all of the members of this union will get\nTo have their professional training you\nKnow reimbursed and then they have one\nIndividual who is like the assistant or something like that that that belongs to the union but it but was it named specifically like if they said like for example let's use firefighters here in terms of the agreement if it says firefighters will all get there a professional training\nReimbursed and then the\nAssistant who is covered under that same bargaining agreement want it to go and get professional training and did not than what they would do is they would just demand it bought\nThat case [laughter] the you know the the mayor or the manager is supposed to be aware of that situation\nThen it's up to the mayor our manager then too you know prize the ratifying body which in most cities and towns as the city council and you know I\nI sat on the council here and while like so it it\nIt is disturbing to me that there would be an agreement and people not think that\nAny kind of fiscal consequence had to be a reviewed and re ratified to move forward\nRight right so you know your suggestion was somebody\nBut do you turn somebody in another ... looms she even more credibility to become a jury but Mr gusto and much to do the things that this is more common place perhaps um people know about this is a big government cultures and you can have your kids have\nA complete contracts and then reached an agreement and the ... with the refined body you know having public open hearings and the whole thing and then and doing what they're supposed to do I mean there are there are thousands of dollars should time\nPayments or value that have been accumulated in ... but by these for over five years there's ... there are hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars that have been ...\nHundreds of thousands if not seven figures\nWell and that's what I Do not know that information I Know they're waiting I'm I Know that there's in Europe I Know you're aware of this but there are two um audits ... being taken you know under way right now but I'm\nJust a fact and I'm totally in agreement and I'm telling you right now in a stent Health Administration there would absolutely be no sight deals or amendments and\nI'm with out you know going through the proper channels and and making sure I mean I I just I find just saving the thought of that\nPerplexing because why would anyone think you could do that I I I mean we have to go through so many different checks and balances in government as it is that\nSeems it just unfathomable that somebody would think that they could even Institute that type of an agreement but more importantly an agreement that has a fiscal note attached to it and so that's one of the thing I\nSaw the other thing I did there were ... with him in coming from air war did you ever come up when you were on the council or did you ever did you vote for or against ...\nNo ... and I mean and if and if anything ever came up it was never you know put in that those terms but I'm going to tell you when I was on the city council we had a position that\nI'm was I used it constantly and it was um the internal auditor position we had a remarkable remarkable employee who fill that role and I would always go to her to ask for fiscal notes because I you know there's all types of things that come before\nYou know uh the city council\nAnd I wanted all the best information and ... you know what are the consequences if we vote for this financially or not and that type of thing and so I did reach out to her and I just I asked her you know I said do you think in in your purview which you have because\nShe's not there any longer and I don't think that they have filled that position I think that\nPosition has now gone on failed to at least for months and I don't know how since I I left the council and two thousand and seven so you know I I don't know if that position you know how consistently that position has been failed but I've got to tell you that\nThat was a resource that was invaluable to me when I was on the city council and so\nI I did reach out to her and I just said is this something in your daily duties that you might have caught\nAnd she told me she thought she would have and the reason being is because that position unlike an outside auditor like an outside agency or from which isn't involved in the day to day operations she was you know she was\nA great goal between the between the administration and she actually\nI Would say was a watchdog so she would constantly review personnel records and she thought that she might not have\nUm discovered it like the first day or anything like that she said but over time and after she had time she thought she might have been able to pinpoint that something was a wry\nShe knew me or are you making a ... tone on on the campaign through\nI Am I I'm In fact even we had a debate last Thursday and I brought it up and because I was also concerned because my opponent the acting mayor when um the incident came up about um can block I was I was very concerned about that so that's I call\nYou mean the floods ... he goes in and ask for a bunch of reports and also need to go to ...\nCorrect and I was\nI was I I I mean again um I Know that they're\nTrying to figure out exactly what happened there but\nWas very dismayed by that and I so I called up can block to get his side of the story and I'm I asked him at that point I said well did they act has the acting mayor reached out to you and he said no and I just mine when I'm\n... ... ... did end up going over there\nYeah that's right I called him out on it ... after I called him out on it and during the debate I asked him because he said oh no during the debate he said I wouldn't\nI wouldn't call just a regular citizen [laughter] well\nI I've found that a little disturbing to because I'm just dismayed because Warwick is an awesome city I've I've lived here for over twenty five years I\nI raised my two boys here I'm obviously very invested in the community and you know having served as an elected official before but\nThe constant since may the constant upheaval that has been going on and the constant um downplaying of Warwick in the ... community and

disagree that they didn't want to participate in the debate I've no idea why they call anyway it was a joined the parents were they they each talked who's each mayor was indeed Whitman the candidate a who's reportedly two and a half a million dollars into her race for elite sprinting here\nHitler so I Want you to listen to this out someone was just run we we listen to this couple three minutes yeah three three minutes twice I can get I Want you to listen to this whole\nConversation this is weird\nYou know Dina some good questions and then these answers are just middle or just trying to dances way you know look a little bit more refined in this whole thing and then the the Whitman comes up with this\nWhat she would have done thing\nI'd like to hear from you afford three dirty peiro how you do what she said she wants to do\nI don't know if I call it a crisis on your hands but you've got a problem going on in Washington party of a pedophile convicted child rapist and kidnapper who's living in a neighborhood six o'clock every night or a people that were there protesting you're paying overtime bill to keep\nOn him what's the next step what are you going to do\nYou know it's just an example of a you know anything that can go wrong will go wrong when in a city that big\nOf a community meeting the other day and you know families are scared families are really concerned this guy in a kitten ethic kid you know rape them happened three times something has to be done and so what I've said is no you know we're forgiving city but this is enough is enough the crime is so Hannah see doesn't deserve to be in our city\nAnd what we have a short all of the residents is we're going to keep it around the clock twenty four seven guard to make sure that he doesn't escape our site and do the same thing to another child\nDo the is that the right thing to do authorized police overtime twenty four seven to keep a watch on this man\nNo I don't think so at all I think uh\nThat's not the way you approach it is a our mayor I really would go and meet with him and I would encourage him in the best way possible to move out [noise] uh I'm a mother I'm a grandmother and believe me I feel\nFeel for all the mothers grandmothers fathers who have children in the neighborhood it's a terrible thing uh again\nWith all the things sadly are a nation of laws and this guy is here legally throw a little old ladies here legally\nAnd ah I'm afraid someone's gonna get hurt\nSo you don't object though to keeping watch over him on to you might be able to persuade him otherwise to leave and go somewhere else well\nI think it's going to be quite ahead on the police fire Jen I don't think it's a good thing uh I think\nThe group can't be and who is protesting\nTo be encouraged to just take it easy\nJust go away there are other people living in the neighborhood and the mayor I should be taking sleep\nSomeone she'd be meaningless having to have him leave\nWhat mayor that's not out of the question you could go over bring on his door but once I said I'm the mayor I understand your predicament I really think it's best if you do what\nYeah I mean isn't that and I have to just knock on the door and say would you mind please leaving\nYou know what we need to do is make sure that every kid in the neighborhood is safe you know there was some really raw emotions at the meeting the other night and day you know as a parent myself the last thing that I Would want this guy is living next door\nSo what we've done is two things you know first of all make sure that he doesn't leave our site so that he doesn't do the same thing once again in this against the peace of mind to all the parents but then the second thing is\nThere a lot of angry neighbors you know it's also for his safety as well to make sure that there's a police on guard\nAnd she said you'd be a little naive you know I don't think\nI don't I don't think it kept ringing a bell I think you arrange a meeting and again this is what leaderships about it's unsustainable have\nPolice covering him twenty four hours a day and again\nWhen there are I mean you saw what happened when tempers flared let the bus strike nine buses or damage and knew God Forbid something happens if something happens to hen or something happens to the person who wants to harm him you you know two lives can be rolling\nSo it's not a good thing like you've got to sort of on it and get there and meet with them okay that's\nA de de ... been candidate for mayor in ... with gene onto a news conference this weekend\nI'm\n... ... ... could you explain to me it for three eight dirty bureau toll free one eight hundred three to one of the bureau for three nine seven seven six one eight hundred three two one nine seven seven six how was that

[laughter] in as much as a ...\nKind of lost his mind put his foot in it and now has a budget that you're gonna have to stick with God Knows for a long\nA twenty four seven surveillance of this guy by the way I'm generally not a pessimist honestly\nThe reason why over the course of the gears maybe you know there should be if you can listen for a long time if you don't let me just explain that to you maybe you operate it this way to the reason why I get so upset when wrong things happen when things when when when public officials and and and those were supposed to be serving the public good do bad things just because I don't expect it\n\nYou know I I don't I don't expect that those kinds of things are going to happen so I'm I'm generally not a pessimist\nSo I ... I generally do I I react to things that are happening now where things have happened yesterday I generally don't predict\nDoom or predict stupid decisions are really bad at predicting outcomes no matter what it will actually that's not true Oreo Trump is just still going to be screwed up um\nBut the pessimist than me if I'm going to let that squeak out a little bit tells me that after election day all of a sudden there's gonna be an adjustment\nOf the twenty four seven monitoring of this guy because you know we found you know sometime around November ninth tenth maybe they'll slow it down maybe the twenty fifth maybe by Thanksgiving it's going to be hey listen you know we've been monitoring this guy and we've got kind of his movements figure it out and\n\nWe're not necessarily going to be doing twenty four seven anymore we're going to be kinda sniffing around and we're going to keep the patrols in the neighborhood but ah yeah we're just we're ... right right right cause that twenty four seven thing was a direct emotional\nPolitical survival reaction on the part of a lower ...\nAbsolutely positively unequivocally nobody can debate\n\nBut you know post election then but then again
