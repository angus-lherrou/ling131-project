ask\nWhat you're thinking I Am sure that you've been listening on the radio all day long you've had more than your chance to just say what you're thinking oh you but many people you know open up at three o'clock when appointments listen to the show and or you just tuned in for the first time if it's something you want to get off your chest regarding it uh\nYou're you're more than welcome to do so without my necessary guidance\nAh [noise]\nThe idea that the president you know continued\nTo have his rally and you know talked about his hair and tweeted out about the baseball game and criticize the manager as if he's just you know ...\nTweeter is\nWhat it is it's been a lot of a\nHand wringing over that over the last\nWeekend but I said something to you last week that I Am really beginning to to own and that is we have to stop we have to stop having any expectation for him\nAnd if we can if we can stop having an expectation for him\nA then we won't get our pennies in a bundle about what\nHe says or doesn't say can we do that I I think we just have to do that\nWe have been in Dr needed into this idea that the president of the United states\nIs the ... in chief we've been indoctrinated into the idea that he'll say something or she'll say something some day that\nNot only heels but make sense I'm\nEven admitting that there's no sense to be made there's always something that we have there's there's a a mourners need built into our culture to hear something nurturing smart\n\nAnd we're not going to get it\nWe're just not going to get it we have to stop we have to stop I think to a certain extent the press has got to stop I understand what the hand wringing is all about I understand what the expectations have been for the presidency\nBut we have this we have this time now where you know this incident in of itself needed examination aside from the president's see the president didn't do this heinous crime\nThe president's tone may add to and and the city that creates you know percentiles worth of extra\nFertilizer for something like this to happen I'm open to that I understand that I understand the divisiveness that has has now kind of\nRule the day here in the multi multi faceted complication of that\nAnd what he has purposely or ... or or or or just by his nature inadvertently done I understand that the pushback is some times as vitriolic a or worse I understand all of that I think you understand all of that\nBut I think one of the ways that\nSomebody needs to lead this country I don't know who is going to be or how it's going to be said or whether there's a consensus finally amongst the media in this country to articulate this point of view or to get people onto articulate this point of view\nA heard Bill Kristol say something similar to what I was thinking when I woke up this morning about this he was on MSNBC as I was dialing around and he said something like yeah well certainly Sarah Huckabee Sanders it was the one of the ANC or something I think it was Andrea Mitchell said\nWell Sarah Huckabee Sanders going to have a press conference coming up at a at one thirty today and a really interesting to see what she has to say about the president's reaction to this and that is a I don't know I don't care\nI'm not watching her\n\nAnd she's with incredulous ... I I have no interest in when you have to say\nI mean ... you know how many times do we have to have an expectancy that something or is she going to shape for him something that you know is this concept that we're looking for in him were disappointed so I'm not\nWe have and we have to stop worrying about it we have to we have to kinda run the place ourselves he was echoing exactly what my thought process and presentation to you would have been today in is right now we have to stop\nThe the idea that\nBanging your head against the wall feels better\nWhen you stop [laughter] he's got to be is got to be talked about here we just have to stop now it's easier said than done it as a habit\nOr not unlike you know are putting forth to mouth\nI mean this is that's how we eat you know we pick up a fork in we we put something in our mouths that's how we eat to it is it's not even ... ... ... we tie your shoes\nWe don't leave the laces untied we tie your shoes\nThat's what we do we put

and I think it's irresponsible\nHad last year we had to say you have any free question though\nI she can't be there's no way that you get to a place well no ... there's just no way you get to a place of that kind of position without being brilliant\nI don't think anyway\nAgain media organizations there was a Jeff Zucker comment you know he's the president of CNN you know after the pipe bombs he talked about the environment that he thinks the president has created there's no doubt about that\nBut there's no there's no new once they're from her it's you know do you blame the president for the pipe bombs\nNo\nThe pipe bombs are the responsibility of the person who sent them\nThe conversation is about the environment that's created the people who might want to do that seem to want to thrive in that's what the assertions are by people on these platforms including CNN\n[noise] uh but I ask you the question do you do you want that specificity 'cause I Know I Do as a consumer of news not only somebody who works in the broadcast business but as a consumer of news I Would I Would like I'd like in the lay it out\nBecause it's pretty hard to figure out I mean you know he's black the New York times and then does exclusive interviews with them\nA\nHe's done the same with NBC and then he does exclusive interviews with\nA a we know his affinity for Fox the cable network we know that\nUm and nothing that they do I guess is included in the fake news world I I don't know if he's ever charged than we're doing something that in his mind was fake I don't keep score on him because they don't take him literally\nBut the specificity I think would be would be a service to the country don't you think for three eight zero toll free one eight hundred three two one dirty appear emailing a damn it takes three O W appear to calm now that's a separate but related conversation to what's happened in Pittsburgh\nOf it is related only in the sense that that again another series of of a verbal lashing out came\nYou know on Twitter from the president and in his rally for the news media as a reaction to the Pittsburgh things and again I'm not gonna sit here and and ask for the president to nurses and to be the right thing for us and almost kind of he can't do it it's not going to happen we have to stop asking for it\nWe have to ... and we have to stop beating them up for it\nI mean he's ... it's it's as if he has a disability we just keep ... we we can't keep beating them up for his disability he can't do it he won't do it we should stop asking for it I don't like bang my head against the wall I don't think it feels better just want to stop all will but we vote but we should stop\n\nYet on on the practical end of this we should be asking for his support staff Sarah Huckabee Sanders as press secretary to specify an end to end to end to give us\nThe I don't know the\nWarning\n[laughter] from the White House as to you know what media platforms are determined to be fake and whether or not\nRight\nYou want to take a stab at that you want to explain that do you agree with me that the time has come\nFor some specificity from the White House and pressure ought to be brought to bear on this White House to demand that specificity I absolutely do I think that question should be asked every time they get together and not just by Jim a cost of of of CNN\nEvery news organization should be asking the same question over and over and over and over again until it gets through the White House's mind that that is their responsibility they cannot sue the president search a climate exists warned against the climate\n\nTurn you know a a broad base\nOf\nTens and tens and tens of millions of people in this country toward a dish trust\nAnger\nGod Forbid even hatred of news organizations without a level of specificity it's just it's time it's time for a couple of different things to happen here but we can from the mid term election it's time for us to stop expecting him to be who he is not\n\nIt's exhausting to watch the media in this country the national press I'm Talking about it's exhausting to watch them pound away and pound away with an expectation via analysts so come on\nAnchors who opine reporters in the field any combination of those who speak\nTalking heads whatever who continue to a grinding grinding grinding grind it something that is never going to happen\nWe've got to get to a point where it's kind of like an understood I'd given that it won't and we can we you know it might it might be purposeful to suddenly remind ourselves that that's not what we get from him but then move on past it\nI think the currency would be that the White House specify\nIdentify speak\nDirectly to and about label brand\n\nInstead of broad stroking\n\nIdentifiable news organizations that he and the White House believe exist in this thing\nThis part of the broadcast sponsored by province auto body the first and only facility in Rhode

but the independent voters and he also has to try to take the votes were in trouble I Believe\nAre because we asked a question in the survey you know how\nHow much they catch it might change your vote and thirty six beside of Joe ... voters that there's a good chance it could change their mind\nAnd I think that's a possibility of out one taking those boats that doesn't mean the guy went you it means is a chance for only nine percent of our\nOil okay so what that means is I guess based on his polling data I I think Alan ... made a terrible mistake for most of this campaign getting\nCaught in the tough so I don't know if you've heard of her by talking about my visual\nOf of this remember the old the roller derby yeah remember remember how they would ... the first time I the first GM or would go out\nBut then the the gym was two and three were like the fighting each other to get out of the pack yup that's what that's what it feels like doing like reminder was the gym around for the other two are like the gym or trying to get free in order to be able to chase her down in ... and score a point and\nI you know so they've gotten tangled up with each other right in front of me at a terrible mistake but now though\nAt the end it seems to me that ... gene is locked in around this forty five percent thing and the only thing that fund can do at this point is to go backwards and beat the crap out of trouble and try to transfer some of those votes\nTo get those ... votes and they also have to win most of the undecided vote no it very difficult in the last ... days are in the thing is your\nGina's numbers I moved up we ever forty five co before the hottest forty eight so now she's getting up to forty five and six days a forty five it's going to be very difficult to a theater and fix what race\nYou know I ... you know I've been talking with some of the uh the media types that are interested in this I wouldn't doubt a ... bill anyway there's still eight days left but I I wouldn't doubt that she gets fifty\nYou know if you have said that to make three or four months ago I Would say no there's no way but now there is a possibility\nYou know I'm ... spending the money over the last week she has outside money coming coming in our front losses outside money um she could really push of what it was a turtle comes out on the November ... if if they really push a big get out the vote in Providence but socket when socket that can really help the Democrats\nNo we had a caller Pryor in the ... there's been a chronic conversation on this radio station for months and that is true and needs to get ... get out first he's not coming off the ballot so that's not but\nIf he if by some small chance and I doubt it would happen because he's just been so committed to staying in this race and his enemies round song has been way too clear but\nIf he ever said you know made a big media to do about bowing out and transferring his his efforts is loyalty and his endorsement Allen fun is that is that something that could stick [noise]\nI'm not sure at this point and I can't really think so either you know I I think it'd be very difficult plus as you said in his name was still around about sort of a number of voters that will still be voting for him but I don't no matter what he\nDoes have the most transferable you know but again it's a group of it's a group of nine percent right so a third of the nine percent thinks that they might jumped somewhere else and not nearly statistically\nI was also another friend who weren't sure on that question open to get married like forty nine forty eight forty nine percent yeah whatsoever would only be like Pakistan against vote among a lot you know found\nVermont and I love the U.S this question is not just you know who would you vote for the election was held today it's the it's ... it's a great question in the poll ...\nGet credit for that one All right well good that's just one four years ago and I've got a question\nIt's a really smart question because it it it talks about the stability abroad constituency Seventy percent definitely Regina locked in unlikely to change Fifteen Percent in eleven percent chance to change so right so she's she's ruined the boat and the Russian yeah this is her supporters\nWalking than what Alan from supporters are the ones that are the soft this is Joe ... supporters will they couldn't move I mean if it comes down next week some people might have a second thought but they may stay with them\nYeah so what's\nThe thing is as I said Allen on those unfavorable numbers have gone up by ... percent of his poll so I mean that's not what you want to see if you don't want is your clothes the election however it has been really good about it on the media with a lot of um having negatives and the governor's campaign\nYeah I'm not sure that it's just the money you know it's just it's not a ... definitely use the advertising right of ways but it's not just the money\nNo no it's not just that I mean keep in mind Allen one got about thirty six percent of the vote for years ago and basically and all the time he hasn't really won't watch it all the polls no\nAnd one of the way she was going to be able to do that was to ensure that form Republicans don't run its independence against him and he ... he was not able to do that and most\nOf them and say well how's he was supposed to do that or you know all you got to do is pay attention to the inside baseball and you would have ... you would have learned that I could have happened so at this at this stage of the game um it is even though it's always exciting to generate new data yup there's not much new you\nKnow and I ... the governor is up by seven points now should the eleventh points over there won't be there's been hurt direction at this time\nNow do you tell me about the the the competing polls like the goal of ... ... ... people hedge chill up like Seventeen percent yeah how how do these are comparability between the\n... that I if I'm correct and I'm not sure I think that was an online poll I'm at odds with with you one phone call so I mean colds get different results um these results very similar to the poll those problems journal or about a week and a half ago two weeks ago and and and they were alive calls also\nRight and this is Saturday after over twenty through in ... so its last week's snapshots of the Senate race\nTomorrow center a ten o'clock tonight or ten o'clock tonight tonight on WPRI on the hill that just tell me what would you get\nThe ah no they won't like that [laughter] that is also going to be a question about uh how would I Want to feel about putting judge Kavanaugh in the U.S Supreme Court uh-huh and tomorrow morning a question about legalizing recreational marijuana route marijuana for over Twenty one and Rhode Island\nBy the way that the president is poll in this and then this inside the governor Poland right thirty six percent favorability unfavorable sixty two percent\nCorrect those numbers are very similar to what we found we asked the same question Deborah first it was it thirty five sixty four so as odd as it was one other one is negatives went down one no real change in the ... and I'm the president\nAnd All right so what is your so give me your final thought on\nWhat am I a poll up whole week in advance of election day is it is it's smart is it fair is it what is it well oppose an choice before the election day okay but the air really but I don't sing the numbers of people are people are have you ever studied how people are affected by a poll a week in front of an election\nOh I haven't studied it but I mean the polls that come this pose a will come up this coming weekend all around the country I'm On race is going on and again then is it many times oppose just a snapshot\nOf that time people's opinions change you about the undecided voter ah who's going to make up their mind over the next eight

Chris Gasper [noise]\nIn the patriots preview presented by your New England Honda dealer smart first trend is split still patriot plays a box for oh Chris Gaspar is in Buffalo\nChris good evening how are you doing Well Mark how are you good I just want to make sure we had you there and we do oh yeah no yeah I'm here I just wanted to make sure the connections were good and everything and yeah I hear you loud and clear\nWe're rocking and rolling man those gone welcome owns\nYes welcome into patriots review and as I mentioned brought you buy a New England Honda dealer step up your tailgating game this season when the always dependable twenty Eighteen onto the R B motor trend twenty Eighteen SUV year visited Honda dealers of New England dot com it's the patriots and the bills tonight\nIn Buffalo but we have a lot to get to about this game and maybe about the patriots season and let's start with this there is news today from Rapaport\nOf NFL Network about a patriots player and that will be Josh scored the patriots are dealing with a disciplinary situation as it relates to Josh Gordon he will face discipline tonight or he will be missing time first quarter or so after a showing up late what's your reaction to this Chris\n[noise] yeah I mean my reaction mark is this sort of goes back to what was the final straw for him in in Cleveland you know they thought he was going to be going to be able to play for them and they had a trip to go play the saints and he came up with a hamstring injury issue late in the week and you know wasn't able to go and it was a surprise to them and it became sort of an issue for them where\nIs this a guy you can count on where's the sort of be accountability and dependability so I think\nFor any player this would normally be minor but everything is magnified with Josh quarter and because of the issues he's had in the past and and take the substance abuse issues out of it just\nThe idea that this guy's had this type of issue in the past and it also gets magnified because he's coming off his best game as a patriot so I don't know what the story is there who knows my Greece had a great story on ESPN today about the environment they built for him and in that story Gordon said that he's living in Fox broke\nWith his girlfriend so it wouldn't seem like it would be that difficult to get from wherever he's living and Fox broke to the stadium to be on time for the bus to go to the airport to to fly here to buffalo I don't know what happened will be interesting you know if more comes out\nYeah let's hear the actual report itself from today again Rapaport event fell network first to break the news on this\nI'm told that Josh Gordon new patrons your Sievers expect you to be disciplined during tonight's game against the bills because of tardiness I'm told he was laid to either in meetings for a series of meetings not just not clear which I'm told this was something small that the patriots are managing is going to get plenty of playing time after this\nBut because of his infraction is going to be kept off the field for several series described to me as\nAbout a quarter so if you do not see Josh Gordon on the job for the patriots to start the game this is why and and obviously a for the patriots this is the situation there trying to manage someone they knew they'd have to work with and this is a step in that direction\nOkay that's ... earlier this afternoon Jeff how has this tweet saying more context to this story Josh Gordon showed up late yesterday before the team to party fringe elect stadium for buffalo I'm told Chris that you don't miss the boss you do not hold up the buses but he arrived\nA minutes before the bus departed from the stadium so he was cutting it very close yesterday when most players are they're much earlier than that\nAnd so the team is not happy with this they continue to manage the situation you discuss that Mike ... story where they are you know trying to build them and firemen\nFor this player I think what this comes down to Chris is that there is an unreliability factor that we've all known about with this player the talent is a man's we nobody can do we know what he's capable of he's an excellent player\nBut his skill and his talent will be worthless if he can't be relied upon and if he's to miss time or miss games or anything like that and I think that is something that the patriots sort of have to keep a check on as long as he's a patriot\nYeah and I can't say you know I I Know it's been out there on Twitter people to read it at that you know judge Gordon arrived here to a new airfield on the first boss so I think that they have\nMade their point to him about tardiness I think he sort of understand that you know and ... and it's a tremendously talented player and I think part of what the patriots were trying to do here\nFor him is not only enabled him to be the best he can be on the field but off the field to uh this is a guy that you know had sort of a rough upbringing and maybe doesn't have some of the life skills that you would like someone that happens in his position here\nAnd this is something that obviously they're dealing with so when you look at Josh corn and it's not just about making sure he knows the play book or that he earns Tom Brady is trust it's about trying to put him in a place in his personal life where he can be enough of a professional that the patriots can rely on them\nAll right so there is that going into tonight's game and then there was also the status of Rob Gronkowski Chris what's the latest theory on that\n[noise] yeah I mean he's he's at the stadium he's here so I Would be surprised you know if he didn't play as monster numbers against buffalo in seven career trips here and obviously you know he's a buffalo homeboy he is absolutely crushed the bills forty four catches seven hundred and thirty yards\nSeven touchdown ten receptions of twenty five yards or more so if there were any game that ground wanted to\nGet back into and sort of get right and you would think it would be this one and then I'll always rehab looming in the background here mark\nThe incentives you know at this point in going into this game he's at Seventy eight point seven eight percent of the stamps this year that would put him under the eighty percent he needs for one of those one point one million dollar incentives so I Would expect to see him tonight All right\nAnd he will be in Buffalo where as you said that he is from so I think this one means something to him I think we'll see him tonight or you know technically a game time decision but I I Would probably lean on the side he's going to be out there is going to play into tribute tonight the patriots will be without Josh Gordon for the first quarter this might help explain some trade rumors\nAs it relates to the patriots and we will get to those reports coming up to echo your gas and electricity costs like eighty percent of the fortune
