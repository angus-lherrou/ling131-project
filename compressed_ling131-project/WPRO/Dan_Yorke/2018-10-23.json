I didn't have any ... twelve thirty deadline was issued here in our building for the team by [laughter] and I'm like oh\nCrap I was because you have all you had to wait and I'm Out you're all going to quit [laughter] so I'll be doing well shows showing that Riyadh the job you're going out is thing works but I'm the only want to hear ... through in\nFor me 'cause I didn't have any cash on me I was going to be the only one ... but then Alex says oh yeah been been you know are are online you will rule over there\nHe put in four dollars for me I don't you why did he put four dollars in for me too but you might as well you should do you want it for ... for it on you and me dummy is ... so I Can't have a four dollar share because now I'm going to have to have one point one seven five six shares of the one point six billion dollar take\nSo happy to give you two bucks I just said I just put your two dollar lottery ticket I'll be happy to have an even share with everybody even though I had to spend four dollars I'm over a TV yeah and when two lovely person who is running that pool tells me that people are coming in from vacation\nTo nobody wants to be left behind [laughter] fuss over there I got this idea that everyone leaving the big boss last week he put in like ... I've been in that thing right now it's like a utility bill monthly for me now\nBecause I'm In this thing [laughter] I mean this thing now with tonight for two different places of employee for eight dollars net [laughter] well dollars Thirteen dollars gross it's like a fifty sixty dollar monthly bill imperfect ... to try to become part of a team\nAnd I always said I don't want to win the lottery All right then your show starts after the news [laughter] seeing them are new and by\n[noise] away from the New England solution studio pointing away from the general election this news talk Ninety nine seven AM six thirty someone who you are oh\nMuch in central headquarters [noise]\nUh\nHe says I was the first candidate in this race it cleared this governor would eliminate Rhode Island sanctuary state status\n\nAnd then he talks about Ellen fun you know jumping on it is is I was I was first on the record to say that they put a garbage can and garbage cans back on state beaches and lo and behold Ellen's long after you heard me say it in the media started telling the same idea standing\nUp for animal rights is also something there was always near and dear to my heart so much that I did the kids the television commercial toward the second Ellen phone campaign I heard about it\nAnd learn to polled well we saw the advent of paused for fun PAWS\nGive me give me a break ... stated when announces\nGovernor that I Would create the office of government accountability on the phone came out saying that he would create the office of inspector general another page on the phone cook from I ... and now Allen Fung has literally copy my plans to revamp the Rhode Island DMV\nIt's practically a copy and paste of what I highlighted publicly quite frankly Allen funneled date will say or do anything to get himself elected here's here's the code I said to to Alex yesterday when we were reading this together [laughter] good that is one thing to say that it's another thing to write it\nQuote I don't believe Allan Fung has ever had a creative thought in his empty head [laughter]\n\nSorry if he wants a good idea for his campaign he simply steals it for my campaign\nIf everyone loves might well thought out policies and plans regarding what I'll do is governor I respect me as first port in this year's general election\nVery interesting very interesting uh\nBut you know I think Joe has the right to say these things and probably should explain it the idea that you got you know Alan's copying me\nIs um well it's just too funny it's just too funny\nSo um\nLet me ask you this question is the DMV near and dear you're voting heart or do you just kind of roll your eyes and say whatever because now all three candidates are kind of struggling over the\nDMV thing in the meantime\nPhone is running\nThe secret is out\nJoe ... admitted his campaign will help reelect Gina Raimondo what would that mean for us in four more years of Raimondo when\nYou have the state's troubled online benefits system like like the governor I made it wasn't right for the backlog keeps growing all those things are a lot of very wrong how badly [laughter] the project they cost almost six hundred and fifty million dollars I made that decision I made it that they have and then they\nShow if he if he wants to do an ad on new hip alone I think that's fine dining Joe ... of this whole thing\nIs such a big mistake it's such a big mistake\nThere's only one way in my mind to actually handle the job trailers situation if you're Alan ... and that is\nYou know a head and shoulders commercial where you'll look straight in the camera and say hey listen I don't have any problems with ... everybody has a you know everybody has a reason to run for office\nAnd he has his and you know conspiracy theories inside\nA vote for for ... is probably a vote for a month ago um and so if you'd like to remind do go you you can't you can't vote for him because\nIt's just going to guarantee that doesn't happen I mean at this point two weeks out in front of the election I think that's what he has to do rather than\nThe including sure low and and like these conspiracy\nAdds\nIt it just it it it just is it it's a B minus player doing D plus work the creative is cool and you know the agency people to put it together you know they get off on the idea that they put a good\nAttack ad together but that's that's not going to help it's not going to help you you can split that message you can't slip that message you just can't people don't they don't they don't and and [noise] so look if you want to see Gina Raimondo unelected\nYou you need to to talk to on one song about taking a different tact here I mean Joe trouble was not getting out of this race he's on the ballot even if he made that announcement saying\nScrew it up if you take it anymore I should be copied me one too many times do I get my boat and I'm going home the heat still\nBe on the ballot in the idiot\nSo you know\nYou gotta you gotta you gotta be careful with with the way you go about this whole thing\nSo that's my question I usually I usually you\nCan set up an entire radio talk program simply by complaining about the DMV\n\nBut I'm asking you a different question and that is the is it a player in your in your in your gubernatorial\nVote because I'd like to help all three candidates ... you know sit their priorities I haven't heard a lot to be honest with you from any one of them lately about how this place is going to feel when they get elected re elected I really haven't\nI really have an ... I ... just as a consumer never mind as a broadcaster I Can't I Can't get my ... I Can't get my mind around it the whole thing is just kind of ended up being a\n[noise] a mess right\nAnd I think the message is probably going to a turn out that you know if this thing's days in the same course of the next two weeks and I see nothing that's going to change it I think she she she has a walk in this election\nI think I think her victory is even bigger than that because I just don't think that these two guys have done each other any favors and Alan ... I'm sure of throws his hands up there and says well that's what I'm saying\nThat's what I'm saying you know this was a\nYou know down to the wire one on one if I had a one on one and ... have been\nDrafted on me so that's what I'm saying so what what you know what\nAm I supposed to do what you're supposed to be better you're supposed to be better than all the candidates you're supposed to be able to reach across you're supposed to be able to\nYou're supposed to be able to to pull votes from the other parties that that's how you win elections you don't win elections as a Republican just relying on whatever it is called the Republican base around here and I'm Talking about the Trump base sometime at the Republican base in Rhode Island\nYou you needed to be an eight plus player to win against an incumbent you have to do that by Flanders who's going to find that out Flanders this is an a plus guy who's running a C. plus it best campaign\nAs some of which is is not remedy evil because he doesn't\nHe does not want to go after Sheldon Whitehouse personally I mean you know whacking out I'm over ... over you know gas bag and do this is about the toughest he's comfortable with and that's just not the way you go after him comments\n\nI mean I mean he you know he'll keep his reputation attack with this election is a great guy of find manage make tremendous contributions to the states is going to get beat by Fifteen points at least\nBecause there's nothing because there's nothing there there's no there there there's nothing going on you know I Want to be a better senator the show the White House he's too partisan people go on and\nWe liked the fact that he ... he puts Rhode Island on the map we like being on the map we have a we have a you know small person complex so\nYou know a ...

of law enforcement and fire personnel in that in that region to\nUh you know respond to it but at this point he doesn't know that anybody get hurt\nSpecifically although he does he as you just heard him say he's pointing to the idea that residents twister coming down the road which is something that I've experienced in it is it is is something you never forget a nuclear program directors hanging out here he is mid western dude you've seen you've\nSeen before and he asked at the time in Kansas and or in a in Ohio and uh you do have your number of storms that are like this you know what's interesting about\nUh this is and we were talking a little bit off the air is how the cell which is now just west of Norton mass has such a defined hook echo and that is really where the cold air and the warm air\nKind of mingled together they twist together like a union yang\nA counter clockwise and that's where you find a a all of this rotation that car so it's just one of those things where uh you know it's it's rare for a New England to receive these disciple weather but when it does happen is just as dangerous as those the tornados that you see in the mid west and again\nFor those and we have plenty of listeners of course on the on the personal county side of things whoever's expressing a little bit of relief that Rhode Island is out of the thumb dumpster morning region\nWe have um this this format of of whether the new was referring to a hanging around more acutely now in the Arab world Norton north ... random eastern area so\nYou know just picture for Ninety five being a place you probably don't want to be driving right now between\nUm you know Brockton and without ... north of that but just coming up I'm from taunting so to speak all the way through a were Ninety five would merger four Ninety five that that places a mess right now\nAre and who would be the place where something whip up whips up out of nowhere I'm doubting that if you're if you're driving there that you're not seeing this weather and if you\nAre I mean this this weather at least when it's in front of you\nAre in hiding from you or I mean the the tornado wind\nApplication can happen rather quickly but the idea that it's black\nIsn't a mystery to anybody so if you want to give us a ring from there for three ... and tell us what you're experiencing that'd be fine but safety first both hands on the wheel and you can get to a safe place with your vehicle and of course if you're in that region and you're seeing a really really heavy weather mask coming over your neighborhood\nOr lowest point in the house if you can if you don't have a basement them all central point so that you're you're in a place where walls are more protected for you know other than that was a post our fingers and hope this sucker gets the hell outta here I'm Still seeing a a an advisory for personal county from the national weather services for forty four pm\nSo looks like we've got to ride this thing out for a little while longer\nWell and remember when the when you put the warnings out it means that there has been rotation associated with is a system already are with this cell so that's what that tracking they're saying OK we've seen something rotate obviously ... got hit by well right twister on them but it doesn't mean anything coming down in ... and it just means that you know I I there's a possibility to get to safety\nRight All right so that's that's where we are right now but he but he wants to relate to this it's so weird I Know that if you say in east Providence right now where the sun is shining brightly over this all the run broadcast Senate you're saying what are you talking about\nUh that's the weird nature of this whole thing and I'm looking at the spawning this this is incredible\nI Love to talk ... hopefully we have one of our money around just joining us soon and love to talk about how\nThis thing becomes is spotty as it is it's not like we have a you know Ninety mile\nA weather mass that is you know green and raining across the region we have we have complete sunshine and nothing on the radar sprinkled in with some bright red and orange and yellow areas inside the green showing\nLots of ... and I can see right across central masked by the way you know the signal of debris payroll extends all the way up through and we have listeners in in in Worcester county and the like you're\nYou're you're about to experience some pretty tough stuff there I've seen this weather pattern moving across western mass right into central across Springfield across from ... big big cell from amorous heading into ... a a a lemon stir\nA asphalt has a big one so if you know anybody up there you ... you know warn them if they're not aware of the situation in an office and not paying attention\nYou remember the Springfield, Massachusetts only a handful of years ago got destroyed by tornado set of tornadoes that literally ... this is now a half a dozen years ago or so but I mean that those tornadoes came across um ah the ... and developed in in the west village area came across and I go home and the west Springfield and literally blue half of south\nThe south part of the city to bits a it was a terrible tragedy is actually right where the casino was just been built\nUm so there you go that's what happens tornado comes through the building casinos to replace it\nAh but they're they've experienced that and you know more than they'd like to and they're looking at some pretty tough cells over there I don't know where those shows will go and it would we how they'll dissipate\nI'm guessing that they're pretty quick are activating let's go to the news ... accuweather ... Larson is where this five day in your face for joining me on short notice ... ... what is the nature of all of this body is so much sunshine yet so much to worry about with the cells in looking at on the map\nA lot of cells other that for sure but oddly enough only one\nHas proven to be severe potentially severe this point in time and that's the one they're proud that the tornado warning actually second tornado warning that we issued\nOff for the taught in an area in Massachusetts the storm a question that wind cell in particular is just north northwest they're taught right down south west or Brockton and it's on its way north east toward it appears that the threat here in the immediate Providence area is over they are in the clear at this point\nUh you should know for your own of no taking that north Providence or experienced a tornado we just we just um got off the phone with the police chief uh residents\nAre eyewitnesses to a tornado that happened in a in the ... park section of north Providence and they've had some live wires and power outages and debris and trees down and polls down and that whole thing so they they saw one you\nKnow right and that's that's where this first appeared basically it's where this first started again rotation which prompted that initial warning initially which\nIs rotation is seen on radar but as that story was pulling away and and moving through a north Providence\nWas an indication of what we call ... ... ... sometimes you'll see why there is that an actual tornados touched added expense up some debris that actually shows up in a fuzzy detail if you will on a A N had stopped a radar and we did start to see that signature\nAnd not all that long ago and that would be an indication of data touched down so that has been confirmed\nWhat is the what's the nature of these these kinds of tornadoes versus the traditional the twisters you see from miles and miles away in the mid west\nBut we think it tornadoes typically occurring ... often times during the spring and perhaps early summer months any associate them with a lot of heat and humidity in advance of the strong cold front fifty nine degrees here today that's two degrees cooler than average or late October a soda certainly not they're not\nOr that the same kind of thing we saw in ... in the meantime polls get lot going on in the revolution selflessness and

over payments in work uh regardless this said to to Matty that it's it doesn't to him and I'm paraphrasing it doesn't seem to hinder\nUsual that there are many communities that that operate in this ad hoc fashion again my words\nAnd I mean that's a it's unbelievable how in heaven's name could that be the case right\nWell you know lingering has been this conversation that can block had with me about the town of east Greenwich\nAnd\nLo and behold last night at the east Greenwich town council the embattled town manager right now she's fending off an ethics complaint that I Hope she'll ... she'll talk about here\nAre clearly she has had a tumultuous time down there but it may very well be in part due to some of the diligence that she is doing including a giving me a pile of paperwork that includes nine ten eleven issue memorandums of agreements\nThat on format reflect the same kind of problem that the city board seems to have which is a agreements that may or may not include financial transactions\nAre on the part of the town that have not been ratified by the council\nAnd anybody that reads these things and I've only had a chance to ... you know during breaks here today 'cause we get these documents during the show and of course we had the storm and everything else going on um but I've been zipping through this stuff and I'm thinking why\nIn the you know there's been going on in the town of scrimmage with\nIts firefighter union president initially in all of these agreements with the prior ... town manager Tom ... who by the way I'd never met but who was reportedly very well a reputed in in the town and was there for a long period of time but maybe\nIt was running his own operation I'm not exactly sure of because I'm looking at these memorandums of understanding and I'm thinking that anything good ratified by the council guilt Oregon is is is arrived traffic and all sorts of all the challenges of having seniors welcome nice to have you and thank you thanks for coming\nSo I've been trying to explain to people to basis by which I was interested in this conversation linking that which is happening in the war to at least\nA flavor of the same kind of problem and he's going to would you agree with me that these side agreements or of the same kind of at least category of why factor absolutely okay I'm a ... we have not had any pre conversation I've got the stuff on my desk um\nGive me the executive summary on on what it is that you're concerned with what you present it to the town council last night's\nAre so obviously a aside agreement a week it can be lawful you can have any sort of side agreement you want it could be a good idea\nBut the problem is when the side agreement is not brought to the light when its so called subterranean and happens or without anyone knowing about it\nYou're depriving the council or even the public for that matter to know what the content is and potentially the financial ramifications or other ramifications\nSo it's not to say in this list of um memorandum agreements undecided agreements it's not to say they're all bad per se but all of them none of them or has the public had time or the ability and even the council many instances\nTo weigh in to decide for themselves is this a good policy or bad policy\nSeems to me that I think there's eleven sided agreements that you put in my pocket as it is that when I'm looking at yes how many of them some of them seem to be anybody in the sense that they seem to be procedural or or maybe I'm wrong about that sometimes I you know I'm not trained to to know the nuances of east Greenwich government\nUh by the way for all of you listening thinking what is this whole big thing about east Greenwich dishes on the dishes on the momentum that Mr regards to was talking about yesterday about many towns may have this dynamic in this dilemma\nUm and we made we may I Hope we don't but we may find down the line that we have a slew of this kind of\nOperation going on uh in in communities where the people that you'll elect to supervise the investment of taxpayer money maybe on a wedding or\nWorse kept in the dark about what's been trends active\nBut go you're the it seems to me that there are some things that are somewhat interesting and then there's some stuff that ... pay involved in a whole bunch of other things that seemed to be demonstrative changes of course\nWe're we're ... is that true yes were they were they ... were they ratified by the council it anytime now\nIs that part of what was alarming to you absolutely how long have you known all about this is kind of a shocking to me about this in June so\nUh when I first came to the the town where I haven't uh I started as a consultant I Believe uh it was in the spring of two thousand Seventeen may I made him a presentation\nAnd during my may presentation or June presentation I did\nI did a point out that even in the firefighter contract itself there were some things in there that when I pointed them out to the town council they themselves did not know what they had ratified and the biggest one or was that they had eliminated what's called a floater position\nAnd when they did this the overtime spiked so ah east Greenwich has done are suffering from a firefighter overtime problem\nIt was unknown I was not it was not explained to the council or they aren't aware of it they didn't budget properly for it and so to tell you at the end we did budget properly for it this year in fiscal year Nineteen and it's one point two million dollars\nIn right now for the first quarter were running over twenty thousand dollars a week on fire fighter overtime\nAnd if you think that this is a community I might be a wealthy community but it's still very small community of only Thirteen thousand people\nSo this is not a big city like province where um there's a lot of things happening in Providence you might want to he might have those kind of a overtime\nNumbers but this is a community that typically what happened over over time that I Would expect to be about maybe four hundred four hundred and fifty now we have three times that amount in fact in the last school year we had eight hundred about eight hundred and twenty five thousand a firefighter overtime\nAnd the questions like how did this come to be and when you look through what happened here it is a the definition of subterranean to use a dinner Augustus term which I think is is very good it's it's stuff that happened\nOutside of the purview of elected officials and the public and it had drastic financial consequences and the question is what to do about it\nCumulatively other than that specific floater a thing a cumulatively what is the ... damage to the taxpayers of all of these shot agreements that you put in my pocket so that you presented last night to the town counts\nCorrect so that's one of the thing that town council um\nHas asked me to to uh do a financial impact statement on on these things and so one of the things though is that just to know that these all are now avoid uh so\nUh all the site agreements with all this all decide agreement by what action or just by presenting that they they avoiding themselves\nBy a that they haven't than ah than the council was not aware of\nThat well yeah I got some legal advice on on this and general earlier today and that is um if you don't have counsel ratification of these agreements they don't exist anyway\nThat's correct that's what I'm saying that void so\nThey're void the void and the sense\nThere was no action necessary for them to be boy did they are by their very nature voided ... or or non existent\nSo the action that needed to happen is that you need to know of their existence so for instance so about a year ago [laughter] I I uh I I knew we knew of two of them I'm In the beginning we we found them\nAnd in Lincoln people losing electricity no reports of injury so far that we will have more sick stay
