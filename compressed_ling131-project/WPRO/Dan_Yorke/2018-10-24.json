hours\nI I didn't but he also talking about or you just I'm going to be offering your own little clear on this whole thing a little bit of both you know I missed one is is interactive guessing\nWell my my whole point of view to listen to it was talking about I'm using it as an opportunity to talk about the political divide in the country and what you know commonality of values and and what to do about it and all that stuff but I mean I totally know what the actual motive was at the person did it it's hard to determine to say something\nAbout the specific acute issue yeah right ... I I just think that the president United States\nUm\nYou know makes it to him in a statement which in in its in its pure context\nMakes perfect sense is pure pure context and he looks completely out of character and is anybody going to actually going to be able to make a point to him that you just can't turn it on and off and that's where we can\nTalk about that in your show starts the minute

news\nExclusive attention it doesn't always mean it's a conversation here you had to find just in a in a difficult place because we don't want to avoid it um and you know have kind of check myself in these situations to make sure that we don't you know kind of manufacturer\nConversation where the conversation does not exist\nSo it's it's always fair to just say to open up to the program today with the nation's most important news story and say whatever you think about it you're more than welcome to give us a ring and offer your thoughts that for three eight nine seven seven six five four three eight dirty PR real\nToll free one eight hundred three two one nine seven seven six one eight hundred three two one WPRI emailed me Dan at six three oh WPRI become Facebook Twitter Daniel show that ... e\nUm you know I'm happy I'm happy to hear what you have to have to think about this\nUm there are a couple of things that are glaring to me that I think are just things that I I find interesting to say I don't know if you'll find it interesting to hear but I Do think\nI Do think that we ought to be somewhat relieved and the temperature on the story is somewhat tempered because nobody was hurt it seems like we do have some security protocols that are are in place and do intercept the one thing that's always\nA a parent when tragedy uh results from this kind of act\nWhen loss of life results\nOr a high profile person God Forbid is taken out or hurt oh we we go back and we you know we visit the timelines school shootings\nUm\nYou know major actions trained around much or crashes uh that kind of thing and we say oh my gosh we can't believe this\nWas missed and this was missed and this was managed and this was mentioned in what is going on with the process and boy do we have to have hearings and investigations on the process never mind the acute thing that happened here we don't have that\nAnd so the nature of this is is that when when when protocols and process is break down then the phones explode on the talk radio program every it was about the airways thing right and that's just kind of the human nature of it when everything kind of work well\nSo far you know so far\nWe we tend to just say\nIt is not the nature of this forum for people to dial in and applaud good work\nWe kind of in a way expect good work and we only react when we're let down that good work didn't occur\nSo let's just remember\nAll this this may not be the dominant part of the conversation at least from your end today at four three WPRI let's remember that process has worked\nAnd we're lucky that we're not dealing with\nA deceased ex presidents at all\nThat's that's that's number one a\nNumber two there's a lot of conversation going on about the nation's rhetoric this feels like a violent act and it feels like it's easy logically\nForm added and presented it feels like the objective is somebody that doesn't like Democrats or\nYou know we'll have to find out who this is over time in my confidence is is that the FBI and other authorities will find out who this isn't it's not going to be home grown or not\nThe um who knows who this is whether this is\nOrganic frustration and anger and hatred and terror here in our homeland by a U.S citizen or whether it's somebody that has infiltrated the country and is doing this or whether this is somebody who's\nPretending to be where are we going to station that's pretending to be somebody we we have no idea I got an email from somebody today is a pretty sharp cookie\nOr who believes that this could be this could be democratically stained\nThat this is this is this is the kind of thing that could energize the Democratic base because now it has been um\nA victimized\nThat some ... political strategist would employ this kind of thing\nTo turn empathy sympathy and then\nA rally cry around Democrats who have been victimized by this kind of attack\nI mean the the um\n[noise] I don't even know what for what phrase to use regarding this the pessimism\nOf of of human nature that\nIs required to offer that theory is something that just it's just something and then as I said the mat there in our cross over time at the top of the hour there's the president the United states\nWho I think we would all agree um stayed on script and said the right things here this afternoon\nA here's what he said [noise] actually begin\nToday's remarks by providing an update on the [noise] suspicious packages and devices mail to current and former high ranking government officials [noise] the safety of the American people is my highest sand absolute priority\nI have just concluded a briefing with the FBI department of Justice Department of homeland security and the U.S Secret Service as we speak the packages are being inspected by top explosive experts and they made your federal investigation is now underway for\nThe full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice we will spare no resources are expense in this effort [noise]\nAnd I just wanted to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together\nAnd send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United states of America [noise]\n\nIt's a very bipartisan statement I can tell you from both sides we both agree on that [noise]\nThis egregious conduct is abhorrent to everything we hold dear and sacred as Americans my administration will provide an additional updates as they become available and I just want to thank everybody for their understanding [noise]\nWe're extremely angry upset unhappy about what we would this this morning and we will get to the bottom of it [noise]\nOkay you know good enough but but\nYeah as I said to Matt in you know I'll say to you and this may cause you to reacted may cause you to just go home I it's it's it's\nReally the ebb and flow of you but what is really disturbing to me\nIs to see that wholly appropriate commentary from the president of the United states looks so unlike him that he clearly needs to a stay on script\nAnd be\nNeeds to temper his tone you would say look everybody has has a tone and temperament that it has to be fluid and changeable fungible for the environment that you're in I mean we all do that\nThere are certain things you'll say in one place that you won't see another the certain behavior that you can exercise in one place or this behavior you can't ... you know you can put yourself that way and another we get\nThat we get that all presidents and all people change their patients their tone based on the salinity of the situation or whatever but you know his discussion of unity\nA and his uh appropriate discussed with the violence that this\nScheme I'm\nClearly is is actually a clear break from his regular disposition\n[noise]\nI don't know that anybody can can legitimately argue\nThat\nPoint\nI just don't know how you do it now they might be some people who try here today and I'm ... years because I always learn something from somebody on the ... on this program every single day but I think it's inarguable and I just I just ask the question\nIs if if if what I say is true\nAnd\nIf even if you're a Republican Trump voter you know part of the base so to speak and you recognize that that is true how do we tolerate that\nAre also new ... ... ... what's new\nIt's at his home is also as new to us as the symptoms\nYeah well for me is new an unwelcome I mean ... is a welcome for you\nIs it welcome yeah is ... ... let's call it the new only oh yeah well it's appropriate it's appropriate sure\nSo this is so so so my kind of guy the body slim guy the
