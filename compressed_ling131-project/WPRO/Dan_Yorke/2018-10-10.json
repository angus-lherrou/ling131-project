twenty ten in the Republican legislative office or you know they don't have I don't think they have air conditioning so maybe it was hot that night\nBut here's ... version and then it will play Earhart version cause what the hell right\nBecause this was about ten years ago and what happened was a I was serving in the general assembly and we were in the minority office and we were in a back room of the minority office which is attached [laughter] we're the we're the staff is it's just outside the door with the door was open\nAnd I'm In an argument or face to face with Larry yeah hot who's also state representative well he was he's not at the time he was and we're in a very heated argument and uh we read each other's face there's no question about it\nIn all of a sudden out of nowhere Larry goes to pull the ice with his two fingers when when he did that I slapped them back\nSo it became well known within the minority office we had this to name a new police report was of a fly on a when I came out of the room I ... I mean they they heard the the rug is the Stratford it's you know I said I didn't hear them first he he pulled me in the eyes\n[laughter] okay so that version one\nNow here's version to here's Earhart later saying well I poke him in the I actually tried to I I actually tried to pinch your nose listen to this\nI I can be a little light hearted at times\nAh and if you've ever watched uh Joe you know on the ... out for the house you know how how excited the it gift jury I liked the description before about about a ... uh and uh\nI I was just looking at it and and I\nJust couldn't reach resist the temptation and I remember very specifically because it was two fingers but it was like some for finger and what I did was I reached out and I tweaked his nose or I attempted to tweak his nose just because I thought the situation was so ridiculous\nNow I don't know I I don't know\nJust to ... or ...
