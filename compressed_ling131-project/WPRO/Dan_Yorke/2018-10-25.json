they get flagged out a cop call nine one one or ... toll free counterterrorism number which is one eight eight eight New York city safe\nAnd that's where anything new or someone as information about any of the incidents this week in New York\nWe don't underestimate the difference even one person can make towards our collective safety and neither should the people of New York city I Want to reiterate as I did yesterday as I Do any time we talk about far reaching investigations of this nature of any other kind that nothing we do and law enforcement we'd do alone\nFor a joint terrorists taskforce comprised of professionals and the agencies you see here today and others were investigating all of this with great precision\nAnd I can say with certainty\nThat we will identifying the rest of the person or people responsible for these acts make no mistake\nNew York city's intelligence and counterterrorism counterterrorism capabilities are second it on every day they are not just this week or detectives and analysts are constantly poring over the threat stream as we proactively deploy or resources around the city as needed\nAnd you're seeing that today to add up in abundance of caution will tell you that when we look at the events of yesterday and today I have a match pride in incredible work the men and women are the NYPD reaching everyday especially when it involves partnering with the organizations represented here today\nAll concluded by reminding everyone that law enforcement professionals do not care about the politics behind these acts but we do care about is keeping the public reserves safe\nThat's it that's the job fighting crime and keeping people safe and through the fall and willing partnership of everyone who lives and works in and visit New York city will make the safest large city in the United states even safer Mr Mayor that you're\nVery much commissioner I Want to express my appreciation to all the men and women the NYPD who have done an outstanding job yesterday and today addressing this situation and to all of our partners federal and state partners everyone has been working together\nTo address this forthrightly now look one of the things that we emphasize the moment like this is that you're going to see a lot of police presence it's important that we proactively take steps to protect those who have come under attack\nClearly what we've seen in the last few days is an attack on media outlets an attack on the prominence of public figures\nOr going to make sure there's expanded presence as long as we needed to show very vividly that New York city takes these issues seriously that we are defending people who are coming under attack that part of how we protect the Democratic process\nIs to show the threats like this not taken lightly so that expect that presence and I know that for those who have gone through this uh in the last few days that the president said they appreciate greatly\nWant to say that uh everyday New Yorkers have responded to this situation with the kind of strength and the kind of resiliency that this city is famous for it makes me very very proud of\nAll eight point six million New Yorkers as they have handled the situation a with a real sense of resolve a they're not going to let an act of terror intimidate them and that's a really important in this moment to say whatever the motives of the individuals involved\nAh the people in this city or are not being thrown off the game or not having their values undermined or the way of life undermined New Yorkers are standing strong right now\nIn the last thing I Want to say is you know it in a moment like this there's a lot of concern there's a lot of fear\nA clearly it's upsetting time it's a time when there's been too much hatred in too much division in the air\nAnd in that context people can feel powerless I Want to remind people that everyone has an opportunity to play a positive and constructive role here\nUh first of all helping law enforcement this is something that everyone can do if you have any information at all that you think could help law enforcement to address the situation share it with law enforcement immediately\nOr let them be the judges of the value of the information don't hold it back\nAre so many times and I agree with the commissioner of law enforcement that ultimately has proven that they will find the perpetrators but so many times it's because\nUh an individual citizens step forward with information that really led to the key breakthrough you have information\nSharing if you're concerned about uh packages that could arrive at your home or your workplace you see something that worries you reach out to the police get their involvement to address the situation\nPeople can be part of solving this immediate challenge but finally we all can be a part of solving the bigger situation that we're facing as a society as a nation a tone of civility a tone of mutual respect is something we all can create\nWe shouldn't just ask what are the most prominent voice is doing we also have to ask question are all of us\nTreating each other with respect treating men and women the law enforcement respect people in the media report the news treating them with respect this is something that we all have to do as a way of addressing a crisis like this and we can and I have great confidence that we will thank you\n\nUh what we're listening to a alive a briefing in New York regarding this a pipe bomb scheme will continue to see if there's any news fully\nEngaged on this investigation we're working quickly to process and analyze relevant information from the suspicious packages recovered over the last few days we will continue to do so for as long as it takes an until there is a resolution\nThink\nHope to fight off\nHow can you just hold\nIt really is something\nThat should be taken seriously the NYPD and the FBI we're we're taking this seriously we are treating them as a as as lived devices as you see the way our bomb squad\nOr detectives went into CNN yesterday uh this this has to be taking with the utmost seriousness of uh as far as a hoax device we're not treating it that way stomach\nFor terrorism\nRelated to what you said [noise]\nIt's absolutely terrorism because an effort to use violence or to make a political impact asked the definition of terrorism or the people in New York City or are as tough as it gets a this city has been through a terror attacks before\nOr the people are city understand the the whole game plan of terrorists is to intimidate us a New Yorkers refuse to be intimidated that's where we see time and time again go back to Nineteen Ninety three the first bombing of the world Trade Center and everything that's happened ever since\nUh people in this city are full of resolve and don't let these things ah throw us off or a game\nAnd uh I think that's important to inhibiting a terrorism going forward to consistently show or those who would attack us that their efforts are invading\nA so New Yorkers had been exemplary or they do a heed the warning if you see something say something but I Want to remind people because we see this a lot a people should not hesitate some time someone's you know looking at something that are concerned they think oh maybe I should call maybe I shouldn't\nIf it's on the cusp make the call you think maybe you should call you should definitely call let the experts\nAre resolve something let they've there's anything that's suspicious let law enforcement me the wants to make sense at\nAll [noise]\nClarification New York\nCity regarding the um the the pipe bombs that have been found over the last couple of days ten in multiple locations will continue with some of the questions and answers you should rent them short the packaging\nYesterday so it's not biological it's still being a subjected to further testing up by ...\nThe officer retired officer found\nThat just\nA I'll say that uh would like to thank him for for doing his job correctly you know he saw on the news and thank you for putting it out there that this package that you saw yesterday was almost exactly like the pack and show that they were showing on TV and he took affirmative steps to call us to make sure we can take it away safely yes\nThose lies [noise] they\nWere simply by [noise]\nI I Would say it's suspected explosive device that [noise]\n\nAre they now I'm not\nI'm not going to I'm not going to talk about intent but uh you know if you were the bomb squad detective how would you trade it right kind of background\nI Want to say whether these seizures flows you've got free\nSo we're treating\nThem as suspected of explosive devices that so\n[noise] I'm not going to\nGet into that in the back row is going to try that thank you\nFor all the places where it will get forensic evidence off the bill would it take that\nI'm not going to describe whether devices are the same or not what I Will tell you is the folks at the lab Quantico are extraordinarily thorough and everyone will be examined in great detail and we'll go from there were\nGuys that\nLike they're constructed by somebody who actually knows if you're just asked me\nThe same question that he asked me I'm not going to go into that affects them right here in front of all\nIs there a time when you go maybe ... ... it's\nAn ongoing thing uh we are discovering things by the hour\n... on the second they\nOne of ... ... talk about that\n\nSo in terms of tracking be have a over six hundred thousand plus employees up there right now so we have their eyes and ears looking for these packages I Will say in the also network we've found nothing in the last eight hours so um what we have so far as what we have ...\nTurns out\nNot really significant although again it's working we we've got our eyes and ears the folks employees highly trained post inspectors out there a search in a post office or what he's looking for these devices and again we haven't found anything in the last eight hours\n\nNot this time Notre Dame last one I\nWant to have people falling\n[laughter]\nYeah so uh as John said our what eight eight eight New York city safe hotline we have a hundred and thirty nine percent more calls or as of yesterday so people are calling\nAnd am I going to speak about specifically what the weeds are uh I'm not going to do that 'cause we're still in the middle of the investigation thank you everybody thank you for being here thanks already so that\nIs better twenty five minute exercise there from the officials from the FBI and New York city\nAnd um the summary of of that explanation is very simply that they are treating them as suspected explosive devices and won't give a clue as to what did they think\nOf they were there to detonate a and failed or whether they were just\nFor show or a message and we probably should talk about that a little bit when we have some time after four
