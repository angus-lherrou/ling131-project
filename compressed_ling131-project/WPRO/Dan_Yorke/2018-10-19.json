to do today by the way but this one I Can't ignore this this is this is too good let's go\nOkay today we hear a lot to tell you appreciate the press has come out yet um we had a person\nOh France yesterday like twenty people show up just people say that if you do too many press conferences they're not important to they probably use the most important press conference of my campaign for a variety of different reasons\nThat got the ball the rabbit out of his that was it was funny back in two thousand and one of the\nUh the treasurer Gina Raimondo had\nMade a presentation to the general assembly that the pension system in this thing was in such severe trouble that if we didn't make these major changes to her that she has outlined with her commission\nBasically the sky was for winning and the state would probably of ends up in bankruptcy\nOr not being an expert in pensions I rely on her credibility I treasure [noise] uh she even more than I knew what the situation and at that time I voted in favor of the pension reform\nI was also certainly with my colleagues to my left here in uh Spencer tickets and who was a state representative back then is fences voted against the pension reform um what we're doing today\nIs we're talking about all the people who have been ... blindness pension reform because the biggest thing it did was it a limited as the Cold War for a long extended period of time [noise]\nAh throughout this campaign season which I consider one's been campaigning for two years I've had an opportunity to talk to a lot of different people who have been harmed by the pension reform harmed in a way that if you retired and you had a pension or twenty thousand dollars\nYou know Social Security as many people didn't have back then you weren't getting any coal so the cost of living increases were not put in there have been truly\nYour pension would never be worth the same twenty thousand dollars if you go Twenty years old they will be cut in half maybe less\nSo people have always been outraged about what happened even more I learned about it the more I realize that you know I'm outraged by what happened\nOf the things I learned early on as a business here we stop the\nTape for just a second I Need to remind you something about my friend Joe ... who I admire anyway like\nA and have for a long time he's\nSupposed to be the conservative

had two state wide debates\nTo state wide debates\nAnd you have an herb knew about this and now out of nowhere he's going to re investigate the major pension reform to defend treasure now governor

ready to go on a business it if we didn't act on this right away that would have happened\n[noise] so what did she do she took the pension funds and she invested in high risk hedge funds by her investment in these high returns gr risk catch ones she lost five hundred million dollar\n... now that that that's a whole nother conversation\nJust because the word pensions stern through this does not mean the same thing investment decisions are absolutely open and fair game and worthwhile for for discussion if if you want to if it by the way\nKnow Joe's hitting on something that I thought the candidates may have hit her on a long time ago which was that you know as a as a candidate I'm Sorry as a as a treasure oh she's done some things that the the new treasure ... magazine or has unwound including this hedge fund investment strategy\nNow I don't know whether the voters think that applies to her gubernatorial a resume\nBut\nI think that's fair game but that's a whole different

investments\n[noise] she benefited because the people there in men is that these funds executives of these companies for managed to raise millions of dollars for her that's the money that she's using

Washington park it is a it's a neighborhood dilemma [noise]\n[laughter] that that that that one does it make any sense to me the news ... we go\nA professor Andrew horror which assistant dean for experiential education Roger Williams university and really smart guy and a law professor good to speak with you thanks for joining me\nGood to speak to you as well so you're you're cited in the journals report on this rather than reading your stuff tell me what your gut check using this dilemma\nWell I I continue to really be mystified how absolutely wrong we get this stuff as a society in every possible way um we\nTake a person who's been released at the conclusion of their sentence we treat them like a pariah we make it almost impossible for them to find stable housing we make it\nAlmost impossible for them to find stable employment those are the things that the data quite clearly show us a assist people and re entering society becoming productive members of society and significantly reduce recidivism\nBut with sex offenders we decide to do everything exactly backwards and increase the danger to society at the same time we treat it human being as though she is not a human being\nYou know [laughter] I expected you to say that and I think it has a lot of merit I did say yesterday that I'm not sure exactly what the this this consensus\nIs all about what the endgame isn't or we\nAt least a Scorpio when the community activists to me she said we're just gonna keep shoving till he leaves a you know he he can go to another neighborhood were sick and tired of the stuff in Providence okay\nUm I get that how do you think that there's ever been a study or is there any documentation that shows that when a sex offender by the way I got too much allusions though the key way this is a sentencing issue as far as I'm concerned but you know now that the same things the\n... and by the way this guy's problem\nOr was this kind of situation is so screwed up are you originally had two hundred years I mean there was just so much there was leading these deal and then there was there was some human error when it came to both of Rhode Island Massachusetts handling of his case and so he's been out for a couple of years because of some slip ups and\nAnd some some some bad formed due process stuff so I read anyway\nIs there ... ... ... ... is there any\nData out there that shows that when someone has been charged with this has a stable and employers will life post incarceration that they actually straighten out\nThat the risk of recidivism is lower yeah they're absolutely categorically is data out there that shows\nExplain a little bit\n[noise] it's it's not actually that complicated I mean what what we do with sex offenders here in Rhode Island is we passed laws that to draw circles around every institution you can imagine and say ... a person with a sex offense on the record can't live in that circle\nA and the consequences those circles is that is virtually no place that a sex offender who has to register and live legally and the state of Rhode Island ah and certainly no place where there might be affordable housing so an overwhelming percentage of our registered sex offenders are homeless\nAre not surprisingly that drove a number of registered sex offenders to Harrington hall our state's largest homeless shelter right and then in its wisdom the legislature passed a bill that said no more than ten percent of the residents of Harrington hall may be registered sex offenders\nAre thereby are taking somebody who was already homeless but living in a shelter system\nAnd throwing them out onto the streets which common sense should tell you is not where you want a sex offender to be hanging out right ah and then uh it's very difficult for somebody without a stable address the access successfully services and to remain a receiving social services in treatment\nOf because the more transient you are or the ... you know you don't own a car you're lucky if you can access public transportation\nGood luck accessing social services so we're we're reckoning barriers to all of the logical things that we ought to be doing a in order to try and reduce recidivism things that are proof that\nWere due to you know I I got I got Sable employment of course is the last piece the puzzle sure right if you have something to do that's productive every day I you're much less likely to wander\nA professor anymore which is with me I got to tell you man I have this vision of you saying this and I'm sure you have in many many forms and many many places saying this in front of that group in Washington Washington park Wednesday night and being booted out of the place\nOh I'm sure it would be because nobody there is interested in listening to rational reasonable talk\nBut here's the thing we got we got a mayor\nWho you know for a municipal judge who looking at an election day two and a half weeks from now walked in there and I'm told spur of the moment lead on his police department of promise of twenty four seven surveillance that didn't help\nWhat what really didn't help was the statement that Mr gardener doesn't belong in Providence and has no business living in the city a new I I I have never been more disappointed in a public official in my life I don't think than reading those comments\nOr I consider mayoral or as a a friend he's the former colleague of mine at the law school at the very smart and capable person I Can't imagine for the life of me what he was thinking or why he would say that\nElection day and well\nOr whatever uh I I Can't you know a fueling the fires of vigilantism and mob is\nA is not an appropriate thing for a mayor or any public officials to do that twenty four seven watch at this stage I actually think is required for one purpose which is to protect master gardener\nI there's an angry mob outside of his house and they continue to say that there will be there every day I I don't think the police department at this point as any choice but to do its duty and protect Mr gardeners safety\n[noise] what do we do with this thing I don't know we do with this thing I\nLike I I honestly I don't know what kind of stamina the neighborhood will have for this and I don't know at what point it becomes blatantly obvious to anybody looking at this thing in a common sense way that this guy is being unduly harassed and the constitution\nAnd I don't know what kind of resources the police department have to continue to spend the money to fulfill the promise that was made knee jerks for the moment\nI don't know any of those things I don't know what the endgame is here for anybody\nI I Wish I had something intelligent [laughter] in response to that other than that I agree with you I don't\nI don't CNN game either I suppose perhaps with the passage of time people's emotions calm down to the point where they can actually think and use reason and listen but I'm not optimistic about that\nYou haven't thought about what I said at the beginning which is that for these particular convictions are the only thing I've ever thought is that it's gotta be through a key way type of crime I mean we we are so incapable of of\nProcessing this this Megan's love thing as well intended as it is levels one two and three all it does for the most part is create psychiatric services in less than ... and listened I'm a real estate values I\nAte does it give you a better feeling as a parent to know that the sex offender move ... around the block and\nNow you're going to be vigilant about your kid I used to be vigilant about your kid anyway I I agree\nMore that are all that the notification statute does is create a false sense of security which I consider more dangerous uh and I encourage it until it vigilante isn't on the kind of behavior that we're seeing now ...\nWhat is the big picture when smart guys like you get into these big think tanks do you agree with me that the sentences need to be longer and that that that that the actual solution here is is that the root of the sentencing issue\nI Do not ah because the evidence does not suggest that sex offenders are more likely to be a recidivist than other folks in fact in general the evidence suggests the opposite sex offenders are less likely to be recidivist than\nPeople committing robberies burglaries the assault with a dangerous weapon on and other such things [noise]\nUm no I I think the solution if I could wave a magic wand would be to make the public uh respond more intelligently and understand
