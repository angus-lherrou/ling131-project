I think we have in the computer but that's always a sore thing for me um\nYou know this is a this is you know let me you know help me help you this is this is Jerry Maguire help me help you I mean I just feel\nLike for all the work that met a yellow is done and he'd do some good work I mean I'm show so disappointed\nIn how we handle that post sex stadium thing that is not an incidental thing and

and the people in protective\nRight come on at least the stop stop pulling my leg stop\nAnyway I'm deeply deeply disappointed with his leadership on that and a couple of other things but by in large by in large the speaker has not been the worst thing that ... that ran by in large\nSpeaker's actually held the Ford down on on on some tax cuts by in large he's tried to be a different voice when it comes to a you know the economics of this state he's not a bit of big reformer I'll tell you to his credit I disagree with him vehemently but to his credit he is all about the power\nAnd the credit if he's been transparent about it we need line item veto ... you know I don't think so what do you mean well I got to think about it you know we got a ... will will you'll take it under consideration we'll look at it that's his that's his favorite thing well look at it\n[laughter] you know you\nKnow doctor could say the Nick Nick we had to do this procedure right away it's life and death he'd say young you know what why don't we take a look at that [laughter] everything everything is we got to go look at it [laughter] ah\nBut he has not been a disaster legislatively for the state he has let us down he is what politics get in a way and the guys around him or there's some good guys around him and there's some really dopey guys around which is the case around here because the talent pool is just not very fit I not very thick\nUm but somehow he's convinced themselves and the people around them I convinced him but he's got to play 'em sneaky rope a dope and rope a dope and kind of you know in the ... way through this whole thing he's not the one who's the sexual harasser\nHe's not the alleged sexual harasser he kept a guy who has been giving a state rep a problem and who has a ... by the way now somebody pointed out to me than it was something very interesting so we're pretty close to the story\nWould you identify them but it's not to rain\nOr how many people in the legislature haven't rushing to the news to tell everybody about how great a guy Mr cable is and how they could never imagined doing anything that's reported that he might have done in the category of sexual harassment they answer is zero point zero do you normally right zero point zero don't habits not out there\nAs you point we don't try\nPeople here even in the court of public opinion and un un rumor but nice she would never reported this story if he hadn't have corroborated way deep\nAnd the story is this a state revenues Providence is that she's had a long time problem with him that he has been bothersome to her\nAnd the term sexual harassment finally comes up an email this past march where she says I don't want him in front of the hearing that I have to testify to uh the bill that I Want to see past\nAnd in in in in ... yellow knowing he has himself a big problem does the cute thing and says a key but once you take a walk while she's a well she's testifying I think she's got the whole thing solved rather than saying you know we have a serious problem here we have a serious problem here\nThe idea that the speaker Alex I forgot to ask you about this one is we were preparing for the show\nAs a couple of cuts you know I Want a but is there is that you have the thing that this is a this is out of the building yeah you go ah they've got their content we broke up ten and there will you please as as the speaker tries to paint this as something that's outside the building\nAnd the friendship that occurred\nOutside of the legislative process outside of the building you know you can't manage friendship\nYet the only one\nThere at the bar you know they're at dinner or or outside of the buildings are private art or I Would say that their friendship with ... we out of the building I've never seen anything inappropriate in the building I don't know of anyone but at the end of that or hurt and then it appropriate to build that\nYeah here's the problem you acted in the building you acted\nIn the building you moved them out of a chair position for hearing a Porsche hearing\nYou act in in the building speaker you act in the building\n\nAnd then you just popped him from his leadership position in the building so what are you talking about\n\nIt but this is every everyone studying this thing like that this is really really complicated and there's a lot of finesse involved in this whole sex sexual harassment thing and you know these things are hard to digest and you know nobody wins and on the ... and you can take that attack then there's ... there are stories that kind of have that\nKind of a guy's ... rock and a hard place irresistible force in movable object ... that's not this\nHe acted in a hearing to remove him in front of the rap who doesn't who is not comfortable with them and then when the story went public he popped him\nSo if this thing is all about a relationship that exists primarily an exclusively or exclusively out of the building he never would have done those things you don't make those kind of considerations\nAnd by the way this notion I'm sure this friendship began in the building\nAlmost needs to know each other from burble east Providence we all know in Rhode Island nobody goes more than two towns over so people leave promised don't even know where ...\nIn Brownsville holy cow they know the power plant that's it nothing else going on ... east Providence\nWas the last ... let's see if you call me from bravo you told me last WMDs Providence I'll tell you you are there are\nSo they so they used they used to\nYou don't have a legislative doesn't work based friendship that went bust\nBy the way I feel like running a whole new on thinking about the whole\nConversation with with with the with Gina Matty oldest one\nBecause he's doing this year play by play is like well they were\nFriends and they were in friends and there was all before me and he knows\nThe length of the relationship he knows how long they haven't spoken if this is out of the building how in God's name would she be able to recite this as if he was the ... the author of the drama\nIt's like ... which of course\n\nI asked this question
