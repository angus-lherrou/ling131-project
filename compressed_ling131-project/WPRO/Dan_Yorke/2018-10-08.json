B. R. O. prominent cumulus station [noise]\nAfternoon in the revolution soft wash new center I'm pause and Gary what's at three o'clock WPRI news the Florida Panhandle bracing for hurricane Michael expected to hit Wednesday after likely strengthening to a category three strong job or Cuba right now and later in the week accuweather meteorologist Bob ... says we might feel some effects but they shouldn't be severe\nUp it before she was part of that to see will get by with just a very rough surf and strong rip currents or what not but if it comes a little closer to the coast they would also have the potential gale force winds and wind driven rain and the Thursday Thursday night perhaps early friday morning timeframe\nBut for the most part more block in the meantime bobsled forecast in just a few minutes of Providence man killed in a three vehicle crash on ... avenue at valley street early today Providence police say twenty eight year old ... hurry junior was in a car struck by a landscaping dumped truck\nA passenger and Perry's car hospitalized in critical condition the driver of the truck in stable condition and under police guard at the hospital with charges pending now wouldn't hurt in the third vehicle another car\nFor three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one W here so I wanted to share with you a a column that was in the New York post and I'm not going to you know read the whole column but I'll give you some highlights from it\nUm and the title of the column is is America's sleepwalking toward another civil war\nA and it's written by a guy named Michael good when over the the New York post or in some of the highlights a they start off talking about how a on a debate held October Nineteen twenty sixteen\nUm New York times slanted coverage basically sat in a remarkable statement that seemed to cast doubt on American democracy Donald Trump said Wednesday he might not accept the results of next month's election if he felt it was rigged against him a stand that Hillary Clinton blasted as horrified\nClinton uh basically said quote he's denigrating he's talking down our democracy I'm appalled at someone who is the nominee of one of the two major parties would take that position well that's not the way our democracy works fast forward to now the height of irony and hypocrisy the Clinton in his reporters including the New York times still refuse to accept the election results\nAre willing to destroy any part of government they cannot corrupt with partisanship members of the self declared resistance are tearing America bar apart because the election didn't go their way\nIt's a straight line from the unprecedented plot Brock Obama's administration to infiltrate and wiretap the Trump campaign of twenty sixteen to this Carlos accusations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh\nThe pro by special counsel Robert Mueller has turned up nothing of significance against the president yet applauds on word searching for anything that would justify its existence\nIn that context it's beyond mildly interesting\nThat a former FBI agent reportedly tied to try to pressure a friend of clear steamed lousy forward into changing or sworn statement to the Senate\nSo support Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh one for his lawyers happens to be the lawyer of the fire and former deputy director of the FBI Andrew McCabe or and so he goes on to to point out a lot of these things that it basically is this it's this resistance movement that has refused to accept the outcome of the elections\nAnd you know that's part of what you're seeing and all of these protests as you know people just feel compelled to protest a virtually anything that they don't agree with uh with that in mind Alex and I are going to get a rent a bus and we're going to go up to Fenway Park and protests the outcome of the last playoff game\nA and if this playoff game doesn't go our way we are going to protest this game to already have our shirts men excellent [laughter] actually we are going to be part of the resist the Yankees movement for three eight nine seven seven sixty eight hundred three two one WPRI do you think we're headed for a civil war and how would that look\nA because you know obviously you've got people that are that are kind of intermingled together in the north south and it was kinda geographically based or but it's not certainly not totally geographically basis time and how would something like that work and I think these midterms are going to go a long way to do you miss the answer on that\nUh because the midterm elections you know are going to tell us if in fact this is going to be 'cause you can you imagine if the Democrats take the house of representatives\nOr in the Senate or they will impeach Donald Trump that he will be impeached whether or not he did anything whatever the that's the first order of business is to undo the results of the twenty sixteen election or then the second order business will be to impeach justice cabinet\nOr because they don't agree with that that pick as well or in the hopes that whoever took over I guess would be Mike Pence constitutionally or would appoint someone else a but that's the first order business if they went in after when the house in the Senate a and they've got they've got to win it pretty significantly\nUh because in order for impeachment you need sixty percent in the house to be able to impeach a that's a pretty high bar and I don't think anyone thinks that they're going to take sixty percent\nUh but those votes will come up they you know the ... once you've got the majority now you have the ability to put forward the articles of impeachment uh and to have people vote on it so that's going to be what this country is going to be about and and you know we've got some very real serious challenges out there\nUm it's amazing to me that we had a former can you imagine if this if this had been the other way around if you had a Republican former secretary of state\nBasically go to a foreign government and say don't don't worry about dealing with this guy just wait as soon as he is gone we'll get rid of him and we'll have everything will be back to normal but don't don't talk them don't even talk to them\nAnd and that's exactly what happened when John Kerry went to Iran\nJohn Kerry made the trip to Iran to basically talk to the government of Iran and say don't don't worry about who you just give it some time give it for years\nUh this guy will be gone and will you'll have a better place to deal with it if that had been reverse the the news media will be unbelievably that'll be wall to wall that would lead all of the coverage or you don't even hear whisper of it are now because of the media has become\nA I mean let's face it the media has become basically an arm of the Democratic party that's that's who they support\nA and that's exactly what they do so are we headed for civil war do you think that we are and what would that look like for three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WPRI that uses the toll free number a You're welcome to dial a broadcast that any time to ah to engage\nA it's it's a fascinating fascinating world we live in a in this resist movement you know it it basically they've decided to resist because they didn't like the outcome of the election\nAnd and that's fine you know you can you can be against the policies but you know argued policies on the merits of the policies\nAre but the way they handled a cabin a nomination I think it was disgraceful and and if that's the way they're going to operate you know waiting till the eleventh hour leaking Dr Ford the testimony and then having former FBI agents try and do witness tampering that's scary stuff\nUh Joe is in Providence Joe you are on the drama of the day on your show just minutes left there Joe I get in trouble for that you betcha\nYes sir yeah just only a quarter of\nIt just said was do you mean the Columbus didn't come to the Plymouth Rock no serious [laughter]\n... well ... ... vote\nThat's correct to convict that is correct yep you're right I could get a article it out you know brought\n\nIn and they fell short right\nYou're right you are correct or you need that you don't need to sixty vote majority to get the articles of impeachment out\nOh why oh\nWhy specify what I Would just say that they show ... wife is ... ... square foot\n[laughter] right mhm it was first it was on\nTrial for like ... ... Whoopi Goldberg says it's a great great well if it if it's not right and\nA state\nYeah what what can we get some oil it was a coach\n[noise] no I agree I agree ah but ah thanks for that that clarification that Joe appreciate it for three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WB here so that would be the first order of business in a a Democrat U.S Congress and may maybe you want that maybe you would like to see the impeachment but you know if you couple\nThe or the fact that the news media is going to be all over a and they're going to cover every detail or wall to wall constantly nonstop um then that's what that's what America's gonna look like you know after January when the new Congress this morning if the Democrats get the majority they are going\nTo impeach the president now once you're impeached doesn't mean you get kicked out\nThat has to go to the Senate in the Senate you that's where the the trial if you will takes place\nOr the articles of impeachment are proposed in the house and then they go over to the Senate and that's where the conviction\nOr if in fact you removed from office happens in it's unlikely that that would happen a but it's still you know ... it's the the news media that it's going to take up in the focus of this country is just going to be ... unbelievable it really is going to be fascinating and disgusting to watch\nUh and that's that's what's at stake at the midterms for three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WPRI do you think we're headed for a civil war do you think that these divisions that we have between Americans are unbelievable I mean a perfect example is the er the protests that took place in the state house in a while I was on the air basically last Saturday\nUm you had one group there was a against Marxism\nRight and then the other group was ocean state against hate will\nIt occurs to me that if they sat down at a table with maybe some Chinese takeout\nProbably have more in common than they have not uncommon\nBecause Marxism is totalitarian form of government or in which one side it speaks the other side is is persecuted for speaking out against it and you would think the hate people against hate people would be very much in favor of not wanting a Marxist government\nUm so you would think that you know in a real world where they sat in the in a conference room with the like some pizzas and preserve\nOr the pizza by the way the best pizza in the state or nay the world\nUm that they would find a a tremendous amount of common common ground

I'll be watching the headlines for that um I have to admit that's not a scenario that I took into account uh when I ran the numbers for Joe ...\nOr was that all of the top Democrats in state will get arrested um I missed that one and that's on me I I miss that I have to go back and re look the numbers um but you know you think about the fact that you know Hillary Clinton overwhelmingly won Rhode Island are overwhelmingly won\nJoe I'm Donald Trump did better than many people expected in Rhode Island but still Hillary overall overwhelming we want which Hillary voter\nThat that cast their vote for Hillary Clinton is going to vote for the co chair of Donald Trump's presidential campaign that's the person I Want to be\nA because without those votes and and I even gave him in this rosy scenario I even split the difference I gave my gave Gina Raimondo eighty percent of the Hillary boats and that leaves obviously twenty percent I split that ten percent fifty fifty I gave half from Detroit low and half from the phone\nAnd he still comes out thirty one to forty six Gina gets reelected\nAnd that's with with bending the reality that ... the person who cast ... Hillary Clinton is going to go in and vote for the co chair of the Donald Trump for president campaign that that ... mind boggling to me especially with the approval ratings Donald Trump in the state of Rhode Island right now\nBut that's that is the most rosy optimistic scenario that one can do with the numbers that we have available that's the best\nThe best the Donald that I'm really can do is thirty one percent and I love it when people throw up to me they said well what about ...\n... ... when Katie one he was an independent so I mean if you're looking when a okay let's take a look at that first of all linked ... he was the United states senator he ran to the left of Frank Caprio rent far left any for weight not a freeway a four way race\nAnd in this four way race or running to the left have Caprio he's still got\nA lot of votes from Republicans because they remembered his dad he wouldn't little confidence\nOr he did very well in Barrington he won places that are a left leaning Democrats shouldn't wind when because of the legacy of his father and the fact that he had the name recognition of being United States senator I Would be you know I'd be willing to bet if I could stop random people in little Compton in separate and right now\nAnd ask them if they would vote for Joe ... on the strength of his father's reputation\nThat's never going to happen they don't know who you're talking about\nSo don't don't use the ... the argument because that is uh my cousin Vinny would say that argument does not hold water\nCarlos in east Greenwich Karl welcome to the day in York show\nHello Charlie\nI Am that far away at your trailer supporter they only a four or five candidates running for governor don't forget your nose or whatever yeah the only\nPerson who has six words from a little narrative wrote\n... years ago ... has Sprite will some courage\nAllah and\nAshton more so than following that puts his finger up in the air it's going to be very weak and were among the oh we don't have to mention anything about you at that and\nI think it's the Y.

get on my uniform wearing clothes but then I got out the the new district map because they redistricted district right after the ... election uh and changed dramatically ... was taken out um some other parts of the the first district removed to the second district more conservative areas\nAnd areas from the second we moved into the first south Providence more than most notably and some other\nUh incredibly I'm left leaning district parts of the district and so I ran those numbers and then I rent them on a presidential a year which Iran in twenty times in non presidential you're

Bob ... says we might feel some effects mobile they shouldn't be severe\nAnd he said that he made the statement he was going to drop equally from Allen flown in from Gina Raimondo yeah well you know I knew that if you take him in his word and he draws equally from Chino ... loses it's\nIt's not going to happen on his wife and I could have like two ways and independent when the governor's race in the ... well three what you want to get it right but\nThey do is we can shape the example nobody says oh what shape your one chasing one\nBecause he blew up the Democratic base he ran for the lifted Frank Caprio ... it's like it though it was a good man but he was perceived as not a Democrat so he wasn't a very strong democratic candidate it'd be better operator so we can show you got the unions you had all this will support it or the logistical support you had people come to my house during that campaign campaign shaped my house and nor Smith you're right\nYeah I've been around on the middle of nowhere\nExactly he had a ground game do you have you back on one that would say this I was out campaigning that you feel I had a very tough race that year and I was working hard powerful and I live in the district is almost always voted they over the last democratic governor so if you're going to win you got to win my district in which the wife\nAnd I I Try to tell you how many people and the Malian orderly people who've never governor John sheet of course remember US Senator John cheap ... I've never been a great dislike stretching either split on it and these folks they told me I remember being their living rooms they were saying there were votes can shape the because you know they they were doing ... sit\nAnd he was a little counted for crying out loud I Know that's like the way it's weird ... it's still was barely enough to the way it yeah\nJoe Shapiro and now it is twin there which I find highly ironic for other reasons Patricia Morgan the two of them or do not appeal to Democrats it's pretty wise you know\nThe last ... you're going to do if you're serious about winning the race the first thing you're going to do is you're going to go ahead in um in in ... could find a prominent Democrat do indoors you if you're an independent you shed some of that Republican label\nAt today trying say this to I'd never be dredge people that that because they don't want to vote for some reason\nWhen I'd ever ... wherever you want yep\nBoth friend who wants to understand that I Know one of my very good friends and they weren't very good size nurse let's deal just doesn't like ... not going to happen it's fine with that but I just ask people please don't vote for Joe thinking that Joe is actually going to win that's what bothers me because it's one thing to say I don't want to vote for this candidate I'm gonna go for that Kennedy that's fine\nPlease don't say this is like I took one of these two guys that I don't want this third person to win some or to do with the better it it's it's boggles the mind when you look at the ... elections just a math problem yeah here's really is that people need to understand\nThere are always a significant number of voters will vote for the Republican even if the person's in prison at the same with the Democrats in fact yeah well I'm not sure what I'm saying there are people that vote straight party they both part\nYou take those voters off the table any independent it's got to get the huge percentage of what's left and joke so we're just not appeal to enough of that percentage to get what's left to be both Raimondo with all her money and Alan and his structure and in Florida ... let me\nLet me ask you Brian ... if you if you had a neighbor who had a Hillary Clinton or I'm with her sign on their lawn lately I might still likely to vote for the co chair of the Trump campaign\nOr very unlikely and also you know I hate to say is it by talking about this rather see giving name recognition I Know they made sure has got a big audience but still not the majority of voters state it may be the majority ...\nHere's the reality most people don't know who's ... they don't as long as what we can shape us because his name was chief even a U.S senator he been the mayor Warwick forget that he was a very good and popular mayor what\nTo do a lot of votes for that reason yeah Joe has not had a real challenge to himself in many years in the legislature so I'm not sure how many people out of his district even know who he is\nReally not believe that yeah you know he plays the drawdown of you know\nI don't know I just don't show to well I Know he's in the race to prevent Iran from the frustrating because I I just wish people would see it for what it is like whatever decision they want to make but she has for what it is\nPre she ate that Brian Newberry the former house minority leader in the Rhode Island

your head writer editor living or you know this story about my nose or you know that's a that's why you are I Know exactly what's going on\nWell you know the story behind that is that the Joe ... was

court\nAnd wrong and every day to stop that because he basically very confident and didn't meet the criteria and so that a ... one of the main reasons why it was really really angry\nAt flung and the other thing is on top of add to that an insult to injury the a ... pointed out that McIlroy whose father is a huge Democrat ... to that position when you read that you would right out of his mind\nAnd on top of that you have a mind though has offered is that going to a very quiet judge said\nWell we don't we don't know that we can speculate that that's the case well I don't know that um I I you know what I'd like to see I'd like to see friend to debate moment\nWhere Allan Fung says to Gina Raimondo on stage in front of everybody oh by the way do you know do you have a deal with Joe blow to put a huge step daughter on the court if a if you get reelected in of course from answers going to be of course not\nThat's an independent process judicial nominees became governor has no control over

brilliant and honest and I'm supporting her now if we can get out there talking about Joe true oh please\nOkay he has no Bob Healy\nEven if he was a ... that's twenty two percent of the vote the only way you win was twenty two percent of the motors and a five way race math math again but damn mapping\nRight I crunched some numbers or two weeks ago that come up with about ten percent go for a while but then since he's been making so much noise of late\nI ... that are twelve percent is never run a statewide race you know he has no clue you know of how to harvest their votes all over the state where Allan Fung has Gina has\nOh gee just going to have a ground game see that's the thing had I'm Glad you mentioned that because you know when when everybody says oh she's got two million bucks that's a lot of ads\nThat's only part of the story what two million bucks buys you is a get out the vote operation and it's an operation it's people in every polling place it's identified voters it's phone calls his tabulation it's vans to get people to the polls\nThat huge that huge and she's got some money to do that the trailer doesn't even come close them right\nUm I agree but\nUh I think Alan ... Fong wants to rule it Bernie crashed it could be the next governor\nHow would you do that without ... vice principal well\nI Am from college in free cars will give you a free car free college\nNow I'm Talking about maybe preserving ... OK mhm\nUh because like the power plant thing up and borrow Gina has no problem courting deciduous reservoir or ...\nI think he's white and I think Allen I think both shrill oh in Allen have come out
