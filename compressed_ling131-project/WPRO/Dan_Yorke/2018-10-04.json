I mean the pregame broadcast\nHey things are very very technical and intricate and hike timed\nAround here but I was I was\nThinking and I said the Matty at the top of the uh the show in our little crossover thing that we do that I noticed that the the the uh um Flanders Campaign is really sticking it to a shelter and I had the audio yesterday played it\nBut played again just play it again and then I had this I don't know you might think it's unique or strange but different thought how view\nI don't know if it's ... or ... how do you pronounce that refers to flash was we were sixteen [noise]\nOh and talk about flatulence on a sixteen year but\nWatching Senator Whitehouse asks her vows [noise] flatulence [noise]\nWas an embarrassment for Rhode Island [noise] my selective problem solver\nAghast brag about ... and I approve this message\nHigh so I think I got it you know they've called the ... and the gas bag and\nI'm not sure that this is the kind of level that I wanted to she bought Flanders yet but they're trying to trying to poke fun at Sheldon not hit them so hard but hit them hard enough right and I get that they think that there was embarrassing I thought Sheldon Sheldon was tasked with checking out\nHe's your book you know little commentaries under his picture and I guess there were two things that were\nA kind of hard to follow one was the devil's triangle thing which Kavanaugh said was a drinking game\nLike quarters you know how to play quarters back this question yes you have like ... quarters is you know you have to balance the quarter and if it bounces into the glass somebody's got to drink forget who I mean if you're not get in I guess you drink it yourself\nOr no no I guess the person got the last I don't know I forget usually I didn't play a lot of course I played Thumper we'd like summer but that's different\nAnd then this thing ... was in I guess I can say that without losing my job 'cause everyone's saying boosting but ... is flatulence\nAccording according to Kevin uh but last night\nOn CNN interview or Chris Cuomo had this guy no no uh Anderson Cooper had had had this dude from Gail who was his roommates\nAnd he was saying they finally had to speak up because the devil's triangle thing or not about quarter as it was about something very different and the bull thing was also about something that we had any of that audio play that\nOne Brett started saying things about his drinking or an is uh [noise] I use of a certain words are sexually oriented words you know I knew he was he was lying because he was my roommate and we we\nWe were in a room together our beds were ten feet apart a for a couple of months um and what struck me in and made me more interested in and speaking out about it as it is not only did I Know that he wasn't telling the truth I knew that he knew that he wasn't telling the truth\nYou say that he was a ... and I'm quoting you and notably heavy drinker even\nBy so whatever that so that's that's not the part I mean it's a little bit of the part but that's not the part they they go into it later you could ever do would catch because like I gave that to Alex relating the game like about two minutes ago um\n[noise]\nOh I just wonder\nDoes it does it bother interview if it turns out that the question about bullying turns out not to be flatulence that Flanders is is trying to pin\nFlatulence on White House when it wasn't flatulence to begin with I mean it's not like White House was talking about flatulence he was asked me what this meant [laughter] hey listen if this is the level of our politics nor campaigning we this is the level that we have to play in\nThis this sandbox that they've chosen\nOn the fight over Sean hardware\nUniversity centers of America ACP

five minutes alone so I Would say if you see a great Jersey walked by in terms of who's on the Jersey he'll freezer shouted out in the middle of the show yeah why not I I knew it I'm a okay we're

you see something out there among the people I Want to get a feel free to just shouted out I'm gonna let all the guests know before they come on they can do to save\nA six one seven seven seven nine

always dependable twenty Eighteen hundred see are the motor trend twenty Eighteen SUV of the year\nVisit Honda dealers of New England\nDot com quick turnaround for the patriots Chris coming up there when on Sunday against the dolphins and uh all indications are today that Rob Gronkowski\nAll week looked like he probably wouldn't play tonight is going to suit up and play tonight for the patriots so I think it's grown pushing to get into this game because there's money to be made there's incentives to hit game day roster bonus plus playing time plus performance he wants to play and I think that if you go back a couple of years\nThe patriots won at the structure his contract so that they could rely on him that way yeah there are some of the bumps in the may go through though right maybe something that they felt he wasn't doing\nAt the advice of his agent or as family or his father or any of these people that are involved you know they they got him to sort of play through the bumps and bruises by\nBeing on an incentive Laden deal and now that he's got that I think he's pushing to play the night\nYeah that would make a lot of sense to me I mean you look at you know we get the the one million dollars if he plays in all sixteen games with these active for all sixteen games and then he's the playtime incentives as well right now is it eighty eight point seven percent of the fence of snap so when you look at that\nAnd you look at what he needs he needs eighty percent of the snaps to get one point one million\nOn top of what we just talked about before\nHe's really incentivize to play any games and\nI guess that's good in a way but I look at this game and I look at the seven guys being out for the cold I look at this coats team and I feel like\nFrom a big picture standpoint this is one I'd like to see ground set out especially with Edelman coming back I think you could get away with it if you're the Patriot than ankles been nagging him for a little while they pull them from the game on Sunday against the dolphins I have a hard time believing it's one hundred percent healed in four days\nAnd so I just sort of wonder if it somehow counterproductive or detrimental to the big picture goals of this team to have him pushing that playing this game for financial reasons\nWell it all comes down to what kind of risk is there what kind of risk is there and him playing is there to you know potential damage where he hurts themselves to the point where he's missing a stretch a games if and if not then I don't really see the harm if you manage and right but you know\nYou know Rob Gronkowski and you've seen him for years what starts out as one injury somewhere else if he protects or favors it sometimes becomes another bigger injury elsewhere on his body and that's what I'm concerned about you know sort of favoring that angle maybe not as quick up this theme whenever the situation is and he put himself\nIn peril and ended up with a bigger injury or a bigger problem like I go back a couple of years ago the last time that Gronkowski Brady and Edelman\nFinish the game together it was against Seattle the last time they play the game together it was that jets game well how long did it last night jets game the deep off from Brady and he tries to bring it down\nHe went out in the first quarter hurt his back and needed back surgery and that was after he'd gotten sort of jacked up into stardom by Thomas before so I I just sort of look at that I think sometimes he can have one injury and it can become something that has a different injury that's actually a bigger injury\nThis press release just put out in the last\nMinute by the New England patriots it reads\nThe New England patriots announced today they have activated wide receiver Julian Edelman says the fifty three man roster they have also released running back Kenyan born or from the fifty three man roster so Bonner is the guy out he has the corresponding move Edelman officially back and go tonight would expect to see from him\nThere'll be interesting to see there's a number of factors earmark one is the poor game suspension so we set out those board games for performance enhancing drug you know the other one is this is a guy coming up an ACL I mean we have not seen Julian Edelman in a real game a game was something on the line and non preseason game since Superbowl fifty one\nIt's been a long time so how much Ross is there for Julian Edelman and how is he physically because when we saw him in training camp he was admitting that he didn't have his legs underneath them and I would think four weeks away from the facility for weeks without playing and competitive football games would not be really conducive to getting your legs underneath you\nSix one seven seven seven nine
