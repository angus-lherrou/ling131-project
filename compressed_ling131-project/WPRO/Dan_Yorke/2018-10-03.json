his impression of crush Christine Blasey Ford at a Mississippi rally last night as we hear with correspondent Bob Constantine in the white\nAs soon as it's two hundred and twelve school bus or there was I talked to number was closer to a hundred so it was two hundred and twelve school bus drivers that are in the middle of\nThis this dilemma today correct okay thanks for the numbers show so the negotiations began when if you will\nOrder contract expires June thirtieth night we started negotiations months before that\nI'm so right around night\nAnd you came to the table with expectations that there was going to be a rift or no expectations that there would be one\nWell you're always going into negotiations you know a lot of problems that my top opera water knows the\nI tend to know and kind of solve the problem so we always kind of expected to be um you know a little bit contentious but we did not expect this guy that\nYou did not expect what specifically\nWe did not expect first can take the stand that they're taking\nOn the retirement plan on the retirement plan yet\nSo before we get to that the the negotiations on wages in work conditions and anything else that may have been put into the mix went reasonably well\n... for the most part yes absolutely\nSo when first student says you know the the hourly rate and the compensation that the problem school bus drivers are provided is is competitive or better than anywhere in the region you have no argument about that correct\nI have no argument at all except for the fact that we're looking for them to pick a dollar from that hourly rate they're offering off and put it into the pension literally that is our ask\nRight you're so you're asking nuts for an additional dollar from the offer you're asking them to a redirect the dollar\nCorrect okay\nWhy do you want to have your employees transitioned into this this particular pension program described the pension program it's within breath and your mind\nOkay so um first of all they're not my employees are my members jobs\nAnd we were where democratic you didn't hear the members tell me what they want the members got together when we were preparing for this contract their number one asked was a pension and I can tell you why we have a forum on cable company currently\nThere's supposed to match the first I Believe it's three hundred and fifty dollars of by members um contributions into that into the company's four one K. um here we are in October they haven't matched it yet and we have a few of them just about every year or go to agreements procedure or get a lawyer involved\nI could get three hundred and fifty dollars out of this multibillion dollar corporation and my members are tired of it they don't trust the company to put money\nDo they have a response as to why they've been tardy\nWell they say that if the glitch um they they come up with excuses all the time it's a you know that accounting error every single year multi billion dollar company three hundred and fifty dollars really I'm not buying it neither am I. members\nSo let me ask you is that these are part time jobs with an unusual benefit right\nKnow actually there are not Providence is it different animals so we have the contract with the school department which is one piece of the work here or do you get about a hundred and fifty charter which is outside charters private charters are that come in every day so it would be the school department is is in a small piece of the work\nThat tears so my drivers will go out during school department Ron comeback get as much work is I Can't for the day as they can fit and go back to the ... and then come back and get even more\nI if I'm drivers working over sixty hours a week\nOkay so if if I'm a school bus driver in Providence shuttling kids from one school to the next and him and my working that morning shift chicken you know taken a long break in the ... going back in the afternoons and not getting much additionally be the forty hour work week\nOnly if you want to if you want to do that you can but most of them come back to hustle some charter work and and make some money\nUm I Would say a very small number of people work left to forty hours a week in that location\nBut their relationship with for student is is is a defined as a part time job\nIf they call it a part time job yeah but if you did the numbers I mean I have people that average a forty\nFive hours a week I think it's more of a part time in that they get the summers off if they aren't them I'm at in the school breaks that would be the only thing that would make it part time but David ...\nOkay so um I just got to know if my producer did you mentioned in the morning show that the glitch uh oh it was frankly man that said so okay So Frank McMahon reportedly\nA firm ... per student to your uh your adversary in this particular environment or said that there was ... there has been no glitches in I'm In the shared four O. one K. matching that it happened in New Hampshire once or whatever and that there's been no problems here so is is that not true\nWell here's the thing I'm sure a great guy I don't know him I've ever met him I'm not go skating but then um so I don't know where he's getting information from but whoever is giving them that information really needs to be fired\nBecause up here we are on October Dan we still don't have our match on the four one K. and twenty Eighteen right now it's a problem now\nThat I'm that would be that would be crazy and would that that's the kind of thing that you'd want a weekly or monthly or whenever the deduction bases is right\nWell we would want them to follow the contract language which is the first three hundred and fifty dollars that are members put it in the company match that dollar for dollar up three hundred and fifty\nYeah no that's okay um it is what it is you'd be crazy to lie about that that's for sure so and that would that would drive me nuts is an employer is it is it just the ... or is there a greater strategy that you're trying to employee here to do about these employees in in the in the greater big pension plan\nWell it's part of it it's like rich and the frustration that comes along with it and members constantly having to file agreements about it and another part is that some of them can't afford to put their own money into the ... case though the pension by taking a dollar for low wages and automatically furniture or retirement\nUm without that maybe CNN would benefit ... all the all member everyone in that yard so it would all have a secure retirement going forward and that's really what the goal\nFor students to suggesting that the thing is upside down you know under funded and and and they don't want to be involved in that I'm trying to figure out in the last man on the question what what risk is there to this to the company\n... have you provided in any any risk free arguments here in terms of their ... the dollar\nThe last time we met which was Wednesday before we went on strike you know we got to have a wife as to why they don't want to get into the pension one of them was the money we settled by and they get a dollar from here and put it\nThe next thing they said was that there was an unfunded liability which is not true it is not true there is zero withdrawal liability my politics a that is not true we took it away completely\nUm they said they didn't believe us they feel that there was some sort of some sort of risk that they'd be getting involved then we gave them a blank piece of paper told them to have their lawyer right up the deal as long as a dollar an hour goes into the pension protect whatever you need to protect in the language will sign and they were not interested in it\n... I don't know what else I can do what do you see the ... just say the the pension deal goes upside down busts yeah what then well\nThen I think I'd be more worried about that one hundred million dollars per year that you'll be extra ah just agreed to put into this quote failing fund um it's not feeling that it that is a red herring if I've ever heard of\nIt is fair excuse and it doesn't even in in in in the next day we literally just signed a deal with UPS hundred million dollars a year they're going to put into that Patrick that's about the type of company that Throws Away a hundred million dollars a year and for you know it's got to be there during his pretending it's\nFor you more participation secures the fun correct for\nThe more members we get involved into it absolutely and we want are fun to be healthy so we try to negotiate every contract\nUm usually what we get from an oil is that I Can't afford it\nWe will get the numbers and yeah you know what ... we're going to take it off the table a that's not the case you were just getting a stonewall low with no reason behind you\nKnow to this is this is the real puzzle it certainly is when it comes to just the remedy for the city of Providence I'm the dissolved as a conversation about can we get a he would give fifty drivers to come in and\nAnd you help with some of the kids in the ... in in special ed and all that kind of stuff because they're you know their disabilities students there by law required to get the transportation you say you won't use the equipment from for student because they're kind of what the boat\nAnd they would they would be a profitable involved in that and you know that's really what we're trying to end up in the pocketbook right now I'm with the strikes that wouldn't make sense they would weaken opposition um I I got to tell you that we're affected by this just as much as it can be in the community here\nElectronic devices sounded off across the country uh to Eighteen this afternoon as the federal emergency management agency conducted an emergency alert tests the tone sounded the subject red presidents alert and the text read this is a test of the national wireless emergency alert system no action is needed\nThe message broadcast on cell towers for thirty minutes some people got the alert multiple times others didn't get it at all\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders denies President Trump was mocking Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford at a rally in Mississippi last night\nSanders also denies the New York times report that President Trump and his siblings profited from tax avoidance schemes by their father dating back decades from the sea skate lawn care whether center are exclusive active with a forecast\nPart of the comedy tonight little fifty five ... sunshine to borrow the high Seventy seven\nNow cloud sixty six degrees are WPRI news time is for thirty one\n[noise] from the WPRI road traffic center\nTo get an accident being cleared Ninety five north than before the therapists avenue curve traffic is tricky jammed up from just after thirty seven all the way up south than curiosity has things slow from before one Ninety five\nAround the service curves south on Ninety five also fairly sluggish moving out of attack it into downtown prominence north down pretty slow through downtown is well when a five ... found\nUnder the speed limit and between Broadway and Ninety five six ten connector in that and you got a bumper to bumper ride pretty much start to finish out found\nA heavy ride from just after Ninety five heading to the split when you see a traffic problem called they got to leave the arrow prominence on a body traffic tip line four to one W.
