Jason Korea defended his snow all smartphone app rejecting federal prosecutors claims that was a scheme to the fraud investors he then asked for a vote of confidence from the people that Fall River\nI so he was right in the middle of it and that was two years ago right two years ago in the winter or that I had him on a pretty impressive young guy elected mayor twenty three twenty six now and I was indicted by the time he's thirty you'll have the whole thing figured out\nI don't know what to expect the problem is a\nPlace for you this five or six minutes worth of audio simply because it was it was really really strange but interesting at the same time so this indictment comes down from the feds\nA and that was you as attorney Andrew ... that you heard there at the top of the hour the indictment more or less says that uh the mayor in his effort to privately developed this ... el ...\n\nUh turned his attention to politics and left\nPastors in the lurch and then use some of this money that the investors provided for his own personal lifestyle and kind of left itch to ah to to fledge\nAnd the interesting part as us attorney suggested that the app itself and I remember apps can be\nYou know very insignificant or an apple can be the end result of a multibillion dollar business operation\nSo remember what you have on your smartphone is his varied the technology is incredible and what's behind it you know can be something very small something huge\nObviously they were trying to build something huge that was that transferable to somebody huge or who would buy it and they would all live happily after after you know good luck at the American way\nThe a prosecutor suggested that the ... never left prototype status which the mayor vehemently disagrees with and some of that conversation is in the winter run this is about five or six minutes I just found it fascinating and I've never seen a this kind of play by play\nA run down to refute the facts and suddenly assertions uh that are contained in the indictment listen this is edited by the way\nThe progress of smell is this that in one day just appear on the app store\nIt took time it took money took research and development it took vision it's a passion for countless hours to make it to the app store so many times you hear stories about people with an app idea people is wrong probably up ideas\nMany times never make the app store many times they fail along the way\nThis is what so all looked like in two thousand Thirteen year what this is all logo now why it out all these owls are specially snowy owls messenger birds so the idea that time with Harry Potter an ad which was you could get these messages\nThese these posts of content around you do your cell phone\nBack in two thousand Thirteen it's pretty exciting you can see we had a photo type in two thousand Thirteen year one I didn't sit there and not do anything that's me that's a real screen with a real working Web

and you can see that we had a sign of page where you can pre sign up for the day the app came out on the app store you get an email and you can go download the app\nTo conceive just from two thousand Thirteen to Fifteen made a lot of progress the color schemes changing the purple you're seeing the lines in the in the in the product takes shape you're seeing a fight allies nearly complete version of a prototype at this stage a working prototype and then finally\nThe app status changes\nThe F status changes from prototype\nTo available in the app store and you don't have to take my word for it you can take the people's war that raise their hand and so they have the ... on their fault but take apples we're the biggest company in the world there are two emails\nMay nineteenth through thousand

zero for\nDated June first two thousand fifty [noise] I Want to show you what you have to I Want to I Want you to actually be able to see what it did so this is right from our slide that\nThis is the

you put a hundred thousand dollars in his campaign doesn't mean he's using it\nYou know you can write a hundred thousand dollars on the line if you'd like to ... and get Ninety thousand five hundred back ... man that was that was it\n[laughter] that question too\nI I don't know what his finance is I'm just telling you I'm I'm not move by that might move by headquarters and the movement has things I'm not here to pick on him I just think it's a bad decision the Providence Journal in ... in in public radio made a bad decision uh channel ten does that I think it's a bad decision\nOr having said that it was it was a it was it was not a really engaging debate in the sense that the candidates are pretty much stuck in a performance place\nAnd if I had to objectively look at the for people that were on the stage last night my take is that Governor Amman do want to debate handily I mean handily in the sense that you determine about winning a debate based on what what what's neat you know what needs\nTo happen and what didn't happen\nMean Gina Raimondo to to fall down on the debate had to make a mistake a huge mistake or a sort of promise or or create the big lie and she didn't none of those things she looked very comfortable in her skin she defended her her program which I vehemently disagree with in terms of economic\nProposals but she defended them particularly a and nobody laid a glove honor\nIn it you know and that's in the minds of the beholder I Know that I Know if you go in looking at certain Kennedy's thinking you know you're looking for something from them and and and you know if you have a predisposition than it's natural that\nYou'd see it differently from me and if you do that's fine you can tell me that for three eight zero toll free one eight hundred three two

she\nShe did herself absolutely no harm which means she wins\n\nAllen fun or you know ... was doing the best he could to scrape up they you know she's a she's ... she's a bone the budget up she's got a bad plan and you know he made he made some shelling in points but again the gravity caused this necessary to come up against an incumbent was missing\nHe said something them and played a little bit later on which are the give you a little bit of a window into the way he thinks\nAnd I I I found it incredibly disturbing and indicative of of why I call him a B minus now see mine is maybe D plus player after this one because it was really really suddenly\nSuch a clear indicator of how how he operates and how he thinks\nAnd I played a little bit later on Joe ... is just struggling right now ... and a tough spot he put himself in a tough spot he took the bait on these police reports he's he's angry um he he he had a wonderful debate I thought channel twelve a terrible debate last night\nUh including you know doing the uh the old\nThing we've got this until I was someone who uses but he's got a whole list of me to this is where this is where Joe at like a [noise]\nA a a cut eleven um there was a time and space where Joe is not engaged in the debate at all obviously it was getting to him\nAs Mr trailer where those tax cuts were only a dollar [laughter]\nActually getting man is going to turn mind my asking you what what were they were worth what I didn't have the ten trillion dollar estimated cost I Can't hear you again because of the plays plays audience when the whole thing and I guess\nThere were some black lives matter a legit you know people use that moniker for all sorts of reasons on on on him told and and and that's what some of the reporting as the black lives matter activists\nI'm\nJust pure stupidity they should have run those people out in ten seconds security ... out you're out out thankfully didn't dominates ... too badly as as the debate went on but that set a tone of intimidation which is not what you want and these things\nThe the the one one of the most ridiculous conversations though both from the question that was asked the original question and the follow ups and and the answers the\nPressure of a debate works on people and you and you lose your you'll lose your focus and your ability to be able to say what\nTeam win in done has asked the question I don't even remember who was first it was first Alex the fungus versed in who I respect tremendously is a very good journalist an excellent reporter um his is debate hosting skills\nHe could work on that and I don't know what he was thinking asking this question\nNext question we will start with marathon marathon most if you have campaigned very negatively at ... at times during this race for governor do you believe the people of for it on our helped by this kind of campaigning and if not what concrete steps would you support to scale back back in the future\nWell the report back on you there and because they only negative ads that I've been seeing and directed at my way I've been taken out of body as well as well supporters on it I think supporters of both you and God what am I Do have ads were negative I'm not here to the base here in but if he can no longer responsibly way so what I can tell you is you take a look at my commercials\nWhile I'm Talking about the most recent one is about change\nIt talks about my record and Cranston talks about the businesses the small business owners that are how open their doors all funding for the right to say without the corporate welfare called for the governor loves to subscribe to Garden City and chapel viewer floor if that's what I've been talking about\nBecause we need new leadership that different from the approach that had and I thought I'd say so that was funds\nAnswer which I thought was formidable it was pretty good answer um there was probably the best answer of of the four of the question itself it starts to deteriorate I hate to break it to an end to everybody else does a First Amendment thing out there and it it's protected by this thing called the constitution\nAnd there's very little that anybody can and will do about negative advertising ever\n... it just starts to dig in what was the so the next follow up because everybody gets a similar type of question fired away this is ...\nLet me start with our ... our work down there as well served by negative campaigning and if not what would you do it do about it if elected governor\nWell I haven't done any negative commercials so I don't believe in negative commercials I Believe in pointing out the negatives about your opponent so I think you need to do that\nAs long as it's fair game and in this particular case you've got a guy like Allen foreign bragging about how great the city or Cranston is easy one minute he's telling you that he's got a thirty million dollar surplus put his he's got potholes big enough so for a bus to fall in what he keeps his twenty million dollar surplus or so\nAnd so they're so he turns the conversation so the question is a pivot not there's no answer for it\n... it\nIt just it just gives an opportunity to confirm that you've got things that you criticize your opponents for and then build Gilbert was next they believe\nIn good health Europe not offered any negative advertising but you're a real political outsider here what can people like you do to decrease negative advertising when I wrote on politics\nI Want to be the only adult in a row\n[noise]\nRight now [laughter] as a practical matter going forward Marco bat or I look forward to that because I I think the negative advertising\nIs one of the reasons why half\nOf the people don't want to participate in in politics it's why people don't even want to get in politics you started running they started bringing up here but let's talk about the other half the people that don't

the union was under the rule of city hall and they will run yeah you you like a mafia in the union president was protected and got that and not any trouble is because he took the audience before the

problem was in the city of Cranston and obviously to do a certain degree because the leadership doesn't change still is now I'm guessing the police department\nIs is is running in a much more freer in in in in in fine fashion because you know colonel when Quist is pretty much describes as\nYou are an honest terrific cop from the state police and I'm like oh I ... and he's been I I don't know him at all other than to interview him from time to time and bumping and say hello\nBut you know I think he said because he's he's doing well and Allen fun was forced to make a good decision\nBut then there's a little window on the you know hey if I get a chance to give someone a screw job\nThat's exactly what I'm going to do because that's how it operates and that's why\nIn part that's a component
