indictment today\nEarlier this morning Fall River mayor Jay's little Korea was arrested and charged with nine counts wire fraud and four counts of tax fraud all arising from an alleged multi year investments scam\nBeginning in January to thousands Thirteen and continuing over the course of four years correll allegedly convinced seven people to invest over three hundred and sixty three thousand dollars in snow al company designing an apt to connect local businesses and individuals with a target consumer market\nKorea whoever diverted more than two hundred and thirty one thousand dollars of that money about sixty four percent\nTo fund his political career and extravagant lifestyle and the needs of his other business ventures\nThis was not about poor accounting or honest mistakes according to the indictment Korea used invest your money to fund personal travel and entertainment spending thousands of dollars on air fare luxury hotels restaurants casinos dating services and adult entertainment\nKorea also allegedly bought tens of thousands of dollars of luxury items including a two thousand eleven Mercedes sedan\nJewelry and designer clothing\nIf here's the also use ten thousand dollars of investor funds to fund or his political campaigns to pay down student loans mostly by using a company debit card and a personal credit card\nMeanwhile according to the indictment Korea deceived he's investors and snow while on an ongoing basis he reassured them with fake updates as the snow owls progress in finances but refused to show any one financial records like bank statements that would have revealed she's expenditures [noise]\nAt the same time Korea did little to keep snow while a viable business and the snow al floundered\nKorea announced his candidacy as mayor of Fall River during the election he even touted his stewardship of snow well as one of his primary qualifications to be the mayor of that town\nAccording to the indictment spring two thousand Seventeen while Korea was mayor of Fall River he learned that snow well was the subject of a federal criminal investigation and took steps to hide the scheme\nInstructed as accountant to file an amended personal tax returns in an effort to account for the diverted investor funds that he'd previously failed to report as income\nIn short based on the indictment despite the trappings of a company\nAnd whatever technical progress was made on the app product that snow al intended to sell the company was first and foremost a clever way to the fraud well intentioned investors and fund Korea's lifestyle to date no investor has received any return from their investment in snow well\nBased on the indictment this fraud was committed by an elected official who is supposed to be a trustworthy advocate for the interests of his constituents\nObviously every one of us is expected to follow the law but this is especially so for those who ask for the support of a particular community so he can lead and represented\nTaxpayers expect and deserve more from their elected officials would that I'd like to thank the FBI the IRS the inspector general's office at a hot and the Massachusetts inspector general all of whom did work on this case brought it to a successful conclusion\nA compelling fascinating and whenever the federal government is the U.S attorney or you know lays out a case\nIt always feels very convincing by the way the the the feds when they get you on something criminal their their conversion rate is this is off the top of my head but it's somewhere in the eighty Ninety percent ratio\nThat's usually pretty uh pretty rock solid and then the or the FBI is your age and the special agent uh Harold Hank Shaw a really kind of lay the lumber down there was ... it was much more accusatory might as well play the sport is she will get a little background and\nJust to highlight a few of the additional points that you already brought up and approximately six thirty this morning special agents with the FBI IRS department of housing and urban development office of inspector general arrested Fall River mare Jason ...\nHe was safe taken into custody without incident in Bridgewater, Massachusetts today's arrest as a shock to many in the city which is pride itself on a tradition of honest government hard work in public service\nUnits mayor was fired from honest selling out of his friends and associates for his own personal gain\nHis actions were underhanded shameless and greedy\nWe believe you devise a scheme to the front and invested in this company snow all out of hundreds of thousands of dollars neglecting their development in growth of this company in order to focus on his own political career and his personal financial benefit\nMr Korea blurred the lines between his private business in public duties using invest their fines as his own personal ATM systematically looting almost a quarter of a million dollars\nSo what do you spend all the money all throughout the course of our investigation we found you spent tens of thousands of dollars on airfare luxury hotels restaurants casinos in adult entertainment\nYou spent roughly Nineteen grand on luxury items including a ten thousand dollar payment for a Mercedes Benz jewelry for an ex girlfriend and designer clothing\nCareer also use approximately forty six thousand dollars to pay down in student loans significant credit card debt and defined his own political campaigns even went as far as using invest that money to make charitable donations in his own name\nOn top of cheating as investors we allege she also cheated taxpayers by filing tax returns as soon as you find out as a finding false tax returns as soon as he found out he was under federal investigation\n... Korea has brought a undeserved shame and embarrassment upon the city of Fall River\nYou betray that trust to investors in the end of betrayed the trust of his constituents most of our elected officials are hardworking honest people who truly have the best interest of their communities at heart\nAnd yes those who do not should be and will be held accountable for their actions\nAs we move forward let me be clear the FBI you know law enforcement partners will continue to investigate allegations are criminal conduct in Fall River and beyond will pursue anyone who steals from hardworking citizens as a means defined lavish lifestyles or even a burgeoning political career\nI'd like to win acknowledged a great team of investigators analysts and prosecutors who worked so hard to bring this case where it stands today\nMy serious appreciation for the tremendous work done by us attorney glowing in his team as well as the exceptional efforts of our colleagues at the rest\nOf that is the FBI or ... or the special agent in charge or a Harold Shaw\nA on this usual Korea an indictment now Korea was scheduled to um you know stand up for the charges a little while ago and I had a show unconfirmed reports that he was going to publicly speak about\nI don't know when and if that's going to happen in our own Steve ... is on the scene I'm\nYou know following the story so we'll we'll let you know a lot of people in Fall River are concerned about Fall River if you have a thought on this for three eight dirty P R O toll free one eight hundred three two one zero email me and Dan and she's thrilled dirty appear to ... what happens now in terms of his Merrill tea and\nAh who steps up where and you know who runs the place I'm going to catch up on that kind of stuff\nSay they don't want evacuated coming back to check on their property stressed yet and Allen Fung says he'd make changes at the state training school if he's elected governor\nGOP candidate says he bring in leadership that would meet with the monthly set of mentoring slash vocational programs and speed up opioid interdiction effort WPRI sports sailing price they are the starting pitchers for the first two games of E.

I asked a question poorly was there the the effort um\nYou know two weeks ago was interim this seems like it's interim or more in this more fertile opportunity\nFor other companies to bid jobs you're thinking\nYeah yeah and you know and I think I think that we're looking at every\nPossible solution I mean before this thing happened you know we talked to ride we talked to rip do we talk to every bus company we could find up and down the east coast [noise] you know there were a city that buses a significant percentage of our students them ah you know we were looking when when when\nThey started coming down the pike we looked at every other place that had that had this issue in Seattle how to bus strike of similar nature uh earlier and in the year and I think it was February [noise]\nAnd um you know they have a probably over twice as many students as we do\nAnd uh we bought ... nine thousand uh Ninety five hundred and they bus eleven thousand so it it it goes to show you're like well we are ... you know some people have asked us oh this could have a regional impact quite frankly this could have a\nA a national impact but what I Want to do is what we're doing like like you said controlling what we can control and the school department you know we don't control the strike we control our response to it and we're just trying to do is made our\nFamilies wherever we can you know last night I announced and we've been doing this already we are going to put work on line for students were going to and if the students can don't have Internet access for going to send home our pockets and if they can't and no one can get to school to pick 'em up we're going to hand deliver them we're going to do whatever we can to minimize the impact on our students because they're the ones to students and families of the ones that are suffering\nAnd um I mean there have been around forty students then that have missed every day of the strike um ah\nThat that have only been absent during the strike so\nBut one student is too many and so\nI Know it was mostly ... and students with disabilities and\nNow I mean I think people have this idea about the students with disabilities that all these students have physical disability most an overwhelming majority of our students with disabilities\nTheir transportation accommodation is you get a drop on the corner instead of at the bus stop you get a drop of your at your door in some cases\nIt's not indicating physical I'm a disability it's more anyone with an ... with a learning disability is where most of the the overwhelming majority of those kids are but\nAs I said you know one student has too many one day is too many and the fact that we have almost forty kids that have only miss school during the strike is you know it's twenty four thousand kids but we are going to do everything we can to make those families wherever they are\nSo let me ask you this was was\nThe hesitancy to do this and this seems like a pretty smart comprehensive R. P. threefold let's see what comes in based on three different solutions I'm a insure them or or or full time was it was it wasn't a feeling you know a couple of weeks up until the strike\nIn the early started to strike that this thing had to resolve that like this is like ... just had to resolve it so I mean let's say in these three options seem to be very smart but they seem to be in some people's eyes party\n[noise] um I mean I think\nThat's possible I think that does have to ... ... we we did want it to resolve and everyone thought it would have thought it was resolved but we were looking at all these options beforehand as well you know we have a process where you have to follow in terms of putting them in front of the school board and you know that being said we will look at emergency preterm it if that's what's necessary to get this done I mean what does that mean\nWell and I don't want to get into the ... I don't want to get over my skis on ... what I Will say is as I understand that we have a significant\nThe lengthy preterm and process that involves multiple layers of government but in times of crisis in times of emergency we can a speed that up and if we have\nQualified providers that are available we will be using this those emergency for camera procedures and I know that there's a line meant I'm across the government agencies to that\nWell you guys would be nuts to put out this kind of a or if he or a series of three if you didn't feel like it would be some response you\nMust have you must have found a way to match competitive or alternatives um\nEntity stepping in here with the R D process I I I'm guessing you guys did that ... there will be a response to these on west\nYes yes but I Do think that what we did find out beforehand is that the way that the uh the the whole solution oh there were limited limited options that was one qualified\nBetter right and so the idea is to try to break it up and see what we can we talk to other people we know that there's that there's interest um income into Providence to city where people will come the question is you know right now it's not you know how do we make it more attractive for more better is to be able to enter into the conversation so that our kids\nCan get to school I mean we're we're missing\nYou know we have kids that are it's not just kids aren't going to school by the way we're not we don't have field trips we don't have\nA middle school athletics or are happening right now I Want to you know publicly fact many of the other districts in the state superintendents are called to say hey can we switch the schedules around so that we can how our kids can hosts so that they're not missing\nYou know out on games we varsity athletes you know we don't have buses we don't have Affleck said uh other school districts throughout the state of really really stuffed\nUp and then there's this huge administrative mess I'm absolutely uh uh I I Am I'm certain that everything you're saying in more is is part of your your current best by the way what's the cash flow in this well for students not performing what is that money being returned indoor held or it never will be paid you know what the logistics are there\nUm it's as I understand it then it will never will be paid so whatever their whatever they would be paid for those runs they won't be paid\nAnd if somebody responds to the larger or if he which is you know you're in you're out uh do you does the city feel more comfortable that you're only ... just you know the kiss them to buy I'm Sorry I didn't hear that you do you think you can just simply replace for students in one fell swoop you're on legal ground that people do that\n[noise] yeah no I mean we don't have the absolutely um you know and what our hope is still here uh that they're going to come together and resolve this with the Teamsters I mean this is the daytime and I know that their ongoing ... conversations and uh you know with the number of different\nPressure points have been applied by number of different entities and that still going to be the best solution for us in the immediate term but but I guess the\nQuestion however we can get our ... our students to school safely and securely\nAs soon as possible will be our best solution\nAnd so I guess just one one business question then when a student question in ... the\nThe the idea that\nThere was more Smith your language in this agreement seems to protect for students from its obligation whether jumped strike how than you'd replace them with these are these have you thought that out\nWell Daraa fees are being you know last night the school board actually voted on them happening and then what we're going to do is work with the administration to ensure that whatever language needs to be included in those to ensure the best situation for the city of moving forward is included\nI just don't understand how for student gets moved aside if in fact they thought they were protected by job action is just kind of a a nonstarter\nFor them that they did that that they were there seems to me if I understand what happened here is that the ... that that\nThat waves non performance ... liabilities or the job action specifically so I'm not sure\nI signed the protests I I'm not a lawyer so I don't want to give you an official opinion on this but my understanding of it is that it just probably protects them from suit [laughter] it doesn't it doesn't protect them from not getting paid or from us moving on\nGotcha and finally the the us federal\nUm issues of mandates that are being violated with some of these uh these these kids and I ...

running for mayor and she took umbrage with my position that do all the mayor's kind of fall is on this and he's got you know but it's got some work to do\nUm did he mentioned the language in the contract and she's got a point in York and I wanted to follow up with you on the radio even though it would be weird we have a kind of an obsolete conversation tonight on this matter but you made a really interesting point welcomed by the way to have you\nThank you for having me back so Charlotte\nWell I told you I'd follow up on and say I'm going to follow up on the follow up so we have the superintendent school schedules and I asked him about that but prior to that we asked him a gallon\nAbout this the only thing that you mistakenly said on the TV you you inverted of the scenario and that is that the force majority language was inserted not replaced force majority takes that the liability away for for students for\nYou know whether this that indoor specifically job action which is actually in the contract strangely in weirdly enough\nUm but so you understand the difference correct\nTry and get me yet okay so you're saying you know having said that\nIt's interesting the superintendent came in after the contract was signed so uh you know he's not um I don't think personally professionally responsible for that\nOr he does have the school department is well aware of that language and that's got to be addressed going forward so repeat what you think about the about the mayor's a responsibility in this because it has been more or less characterized by by many that you know golly shuts it truly not his issue\nIn his shoe he is he is the mayor problem and then he signed the contract I I don't understand\nI don't understand why\nHe wouldn't get it passed some that anyone would get a pat on the ... sign the contract and hence the teacher the forgive me the drivers are on strike\nWell I'm not sure it's that simple right I'm not sure it's that simple the the new ones that the superintendent offered there you may have heard the sound bite is\nSaying well here's the thing 'cause it's kind of confusing for everybody I so they've got this three or if the thing is a solution right so if the if if first student and and the Teamsters don't get together there's at least an effort being taken now to replace for student either in whole or in part\nI usually have my my my thumb on this stuff and really understand what's happening I honest to God don't know whether we have a viable mayoral race or not I really don't uh you know anybody's gonna dump a half a million dollars in short order into into into a race\nOr at least late I mean she was she was on the ballot in time in June but she's an independent didn't have to you know go through the primary has been relatively quiet hasn't said much\nWill reportedly thinks he's going to come on barn storm and hero with mayor lawyers and ... and certainly he's got you know he's got the worst thing you could be dealing with which is this really acrimonious bus strike right now\nBut for her to say kind of like it's it's his fault\nBecause his is his contract is certainly a political play that makes sense for an opponent right I don't know whether that sticks I don't know whether that's resonating I'm not sure how many people are aware of the nuances this some of this some of this responsibility get by me even so um gosh knows you're working for a living\nUm and I don't know how much you're paying attention to that so maybe you've got a thought on you know the political blame game in this election

I think has has a place where\nIs he um you know if he can make a move it may catch fire\nIs it there's a series that go local ... there's a series of questions in the polls that go local prop published and I'm I'm reading them here and I think the really interesting\nUh and again did determine for yourself based on you know past experience as a consumer of news whether you you believe or this and to these work or not\nBut given that they've invested in a poll they've got you know at least a modicum respect for me because you know and it's expensive to DePaul and it's\nIt's something that we kind of rely on here so I Want to be fair about it it's a really interesting\nQuestion uh what should have fallen comes closest to your view regarding each of the following candidates for governor of Rhode Island\nAnd there's like one two three four five categories\nAre and the categories are I'm sure to vote for the person\nSecond is there's a good chance of vote for the person the third is it possible that I vote for the person the fourth is is it it it it's unlikely that a vote for the person and then the fifth is I'm never vote for the person here's how it comes out real quick\nGina Raimondo I'm sure to vote for her Eighteen percent good chance to vote for twenty percent possible but I vote for her Seventeen percent\nUnlikely that I'll vote for her Thirteen percent and never vote for her thirty two percent\nAlan ... I'm sure to vote for him Fifteen Percent good chance Thirteen percent possible twenty three percent unlikely twenty percent never twenty nine percent so they combine negative for fungus forty nine and a and a combine negative for um a reminder was forty five\nTrue low sure to vote for him three percent good chance six percent not high numbers at all but it's a ... it's possible that vote for Mr thirty one percent\nAnd unlikely that I voted for him is thirty percent combined with never vote former thirty percent so true those negative numbers are the highest amongst the three which at first glance you would think as you know what put a fork and to be done\nBut unlikely and this is true for all three candidates does not mean I won't because it's a different answer\nBut the idea that there's a that there is a possible vote for him at thirty one percent for Joe true though means that he has an argument that he can make that people are still open to\nThere is a it could be for true low number that is exceptionally high at thirty one percent\nOf which I think is is his to ah to try to capture you know how he does it have no idea or from the revolution suffer US News and I'm going
