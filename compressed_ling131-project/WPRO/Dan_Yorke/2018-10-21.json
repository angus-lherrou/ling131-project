and that was the most carbon the\nThat was the one that that started with a bit of a questionable penalty to that's on ... on the kickoff return looked like it today and it looked like it should have been a whole against the bears but they call it again seven or so they get the free Fifteen yard just great deal position to start so I'm sure that added to some comfort level for the defense\nYou know they they were awful that was part of the worst rabbit they had all game or I Would say the worst news of this game is what happened at a Sony Michel not only was it a turnover but Sony Michel was injured in this game that team says\nIt's a knee he was questionable to return I don't think anybody bought that if you saw it how hard it off too I mean he was carted off from the patriots sideline to the locker room he went down while spinning and appears to be that left leg same left knee that he came into the NFL with an issue with uh this could be bad news for him\nYeah and it's unfortunate because obviously he started to pick things up here in the last couple of weeks and I'm just concerned now in terms of the workload\nFor James White or you know you look he's Mr reliable here but the more he is going to be on the field the more apt to use the getting up so it it sucks all around it doesn't feel like he's going to be back in the times\nWe will hear from the head coach of the patriots bill ballot jak I'm pretty sure he's going to give us nothing on that injury so we will find out in the coming days\nPatriots quarterback Tom Brady is I'm also curious to hear from some of these defensive players in this game because I I still I Know there were a couple of short fields there but the bears I mean have no business having thirty one points against anybody does have a team in the lead the bears shouldn't be scoring thirty one points [noise] [noise] oh\nYeah I feel good about this one and there's there's talent there and we got one the one guy I was a little bit afraid of a tailor Gabriel and they kept him bottled up in this\nBomb that was on the eagles last year who ... who has a breakout game I mean he's just another guy I don't care what they paid him he's still a scrub yeah so that shouldn't happen you know he ended up with one like a buck twenty and a touchdown or whatever it was for the day like that's that's far too much they're not a good all kinds of team in their defense was clearly bank got polio Mack was on one leg all day\nI thought because I don't respect the patriots events all that much that it might be a bit of a tough spot and of maybe a shootout at times but it was just a lot of bad play stupid stupid Turner was bad penalties of times they really shouldn't they give them fourteen points build his games that have been something more like thirty eight Seventy\nFive thirty one this week against the patriots last week they had thirty one against Miami and before there by we the bears had forty eight points against Tampa Bay who quit and the second one that say about the Tampa Bay bucks that this team at Ford points again that one's\nThat one's waited much like a randomly and that's like Adrian clear borne so six seconds Dallas last year that that game against Tampa they in a fire in like Smith it offensive coordinator they do it in the second half like ... there's only so much you can oh here's a great call let's get to this right out of the gate then in ...\nI'm a good some guys how you doing the show is a this one's the gym I'm broke would you put an asterisk asterisk next to this went\nA no and I'm ... and I love to dish out those asterisks believe me I Do you know an issue on I don't want to issue it's always look at the risk of sounding like a typical a home or in a cliche I walking cliche it is tough to win on the road this was ugly it should have been it shouldn't have been this close but no there's no\nAsked was what I don't feel a sense of le they rarely go today I feel like there's very few games in the NFL that have an asterisk next to them yeah there's not as many games it's much easier to add the asterisk in baseball Green Bay is a hundred and sixty two of them Green Bay joins not worth my\nGreen Bay win over San Francisco last Monday Night fake when that gets an asterisk faced with this today real way because you know they start to Usama ... was at times the first driving the game it's like okay this is going to be a blow up here today it's their own stupidity they've kept costs and then they kept the bears in this game\nYeah that's true to turnovers were killer quarter to quarter hour Patterson bumbling on the kickoff return inexcusable\nGod right uh and it was really from bumping into his own guy dabbling weird turn over here at the end of the time catching the ball but not catching the ball wasn't an ill advised ... throw from\nBrady maybe maybe but he's still was there to make the grab and they talked it up\n[laughter] patriots had their fair share of turnovers cell block to hunt for a return a touchdown for the patriots first time that it happens it's Nineteen Ninety six style van noise or was the guy who here's the shore him to do this then why get if they touch down because ... is our did all the work\nNo cause someone else and not right to ask him no I mean that play was Dante odds our he may ball in a way out in their made the block at the pods\nThey knew I was in the right spot at the right time to be able to pick it up and but you you know you're watching a football usually the the disruptor on the play like that yeah isn't typically the guy that's groups and scores no one else has to do the you know has to get the glory\nSo the patriots luckily as you said made up for it they had a kickoff return\nBy Patterson after you've gone built on a kickoff\nSo how can you be I still think you can say\nWell you got to limit the mistakes yeah oh and I hated the high five at the end there too and all that was and I feel that way I Can't imagine how do about what you're up there and what do you do and do just get in and then do you stupid dancers like the football whatever you wanted to do there you want to showboat and high five when you've been down you were down ten points at that point like stop it\n[laughter] yeah I don't think that's going to go over well no no I think he's probably going to get talked to you about that I mean it was ... I watch it again and it was sort of like the ten where you sort of stopped and it's looking to do the high five at the five\nAnd I want to get on the oh it's critical of them ... ... very critical kind Bob yes very critical of Patterson on the broadcast saying that that is not the Patriot way\nYes oh kind bugs [laughter] that was Patterson that's harsh criticism yeah oh yeah I mean they're both ripping Patterson no it doesn't take much but for Bob he was not appreciative of that whatsoever six one seven seven seven nine zero Ninety eight five or ... or in fair haven today what's up Avon\nHow you doing guys good\nI just uh I just thought the defense aside I understand it was a tough game to watch very frustrating that standpoint I think the biggest story to take away from today is a Josh Gordon\nWe are I think we really got something good yeah I think we made out like bandits a Tom Brady it looks like he's becoming\nHis favorite receive it real quickly I mean just from my eyes he he had that great it was it five catches a hundred yards it was like a complete bowl he was given the authentic good Bush you know Brady was going to him on the fourth down\nI understand Sonia show got hurt and that's the reason that we need to keep an eye on but I'm really excited about Josh Groban going forward or I'm going to hang up and listening\nAll right I've appreciate the call that catches they made on Fort than to was a great\n... masters his head on the on the field and it's held held it comes on I thought he was he was going to be can cousin who's going to be done you shouldn't be excited he was awesome today\nThan just hold on on the part I Want to stop you right there that catch that he made a fortune to it's better than the touchdown that he had here a couple of weeks ago agree you while you're away from me know that was you I Want everyone to recognize that that that catch was a better more difficult catch to make that was a great grand\nInstilled they were down at that point in the game that was a balls cats that's been has been playing a major uniform are still for whatever reason\nWest side of the field left shoulder placed him in Britain can't connect\nThat one that they missed on though I'm going to put on Brady as much of a hawk as I Am protected rating that was a bad throw their so I'm not gonna blame Gordon on that he was awesome today now we will notice though late in this game you may have noticed when he was running an ad that big catch to the one you might have five yard or yeah he wasn't moving so great no I don't think he's a full speed\nNow so I don't know if that's the hamstring that's been that he's been dealing with maybe he got when did but that\nYou know obviously this place and we're up to hear it splits ... when he made that cats but it feels like he's just not he's not on a ... percent or he was maybe hopefully he was just winded on that point\nJim is in Boston He's up next on the shots at star market patriots post game show Jim\nI thought James ... is the most valuable player in office when he was like\nOh I think James White whenever he's out there and he's contributing to the theme is going to come up and pretty important and significant ways and now with that will be shell however long you may be out with this injury James White is going to once again be a guy that is extremely important out as often goes yeah\nAnd uh and that's the concern because I just don't want him on the field every single player I mean selfishly I Do because he's the most reliable player I think outside the Brady on his office right now\nBut the mores on the field the more he's ... uh after getting up and it was a good thing about Michele while he's obviously look better in the last three weeks as he can take some of that burden off him so now it's him and Kenyan burner and how much can you really rely\nOn that guy 'cause yeah you know like a little ... well this is sort of my thing on this it's not so much that you're going to see James White carrying the football between the tackles because you don't have Sony Michel but not having Sony Michel and having to back up the Kenyan barter who is just jak yeah I got off the street\nThat can influence your play called ... that can influence your packages were James why does on the feel more because you want to be throwing more but you don't have the same type of fate\nAnd whoever it is that is running the Balkans after he got her today Sony Michel you didn't see James White rushing the ball at times but I think he's usage can change because of whatever's available to the office of judgment Daniels than I did your concern is legitimate\nYou might see I'm Out there playing a lot more snaps and he would have been otherwise do well let's go to Carl who's in Westfield Carl\nHey good afternoon guys are real good\nGuys this is I I agree or you're right on the weird possibility the oddball special internal was a it was nice see white was able to slowly

wrong left again his face and uh you know he's obviously got the ability to throw it you'd made some great plays out of pocket running [noise] um I thought he probably really well so I'm Glad we just came up [noise]\nEssentially you know with enough stops were made some great plays on the ball to get smashed options [noise]\nBut uh it was a great one oh no\n\n[laughter] yeah he\nDid yeah I think everyone's out there's you just don't know when your number's going to get called and everyone seems to make be making place um [noise]\nYou know we just got to do more consistently and I think we're able to move on to score points that I think the turnover sharks are uh you know frustrating because we talk about all the time we just haven't tracked him yet and if we do for going to be great 'cause we're all on to the wall or make a lot tougher for them to score and hopefully we'll go more points\n[laughter]\nYou got a good throw on it and uh he made a ... a really good place so I mean I think those are just ... ah\nDo you hold your breath smashed on jump up and catch it and I couldn't find our shouldn't have dangling the goal line but are you getting close to the end zone and they were pushing and we're pushing [laughter] sure it was what probably half yard or yard\n[noise] pretty close to first of all of\nUs have much of it there from the place or tried to tell you the ability to guard outside or even though they came up and kept going back to getting prepared for that but yeah that\nWas just part of their plan and I think you know they're pretty good at it they have a lot of flexibility within their ... but um [noise] you know they've been trying to think the other good lines linebackers and make some place you know secretary so that's a good team [noise]\n[noise] [noise] yeah but\nI mean [noise] I mean if you Russian there's other issues that you try and there's issues I mean I think for us to recognize what their scheme is what they're doing and uh you know trying to play off like I said I think they made their fair share plays doing that and we made our pressure to [laughter]\n\nYeah a\nCouple of British course or any time you score when you're not on
