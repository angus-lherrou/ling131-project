detail\nOr in the way that they should uh and also a lot sometimes the commercial brokers\nOr they don't like to mix with the residential members as well so that's been a bone of contention and so for these reasons\nUh we we look at creating a will be called a commercial exchange a witch east coast commercial property network is one ... and so this allows us to create a database that really focuses on the aspects of the commercial market the data fields\nOr the how the data flows brokerage is work together et cetera\nAnd in because the commercial property network is separate from the MLS a you know you you can attract those commercial brokers in that typically don't want to or shall we say a socialize with the residential\nExactly and the other thing another thing too is with commercial properties and a lot of folks don't realize this [noise] a lot of the requirements that you have on the residential side of\nThe business aren't there on the commercial side of the business it's all basically you know copy on MTR it's all part of the due diligence of the buyer so if I Am going to be buying a commercial property\nIf it's a ten unit residential property or if it's a strip center or just a standalone gas station I Need to as buyer or as an agent or a for the buyer I Need to do all of that homework and determine because there are no cell disclosures the sellers not required to disclose anything\nSo you don't have it you don't have the lead paint law that doesn't apply to commercial properties okay and if I'm buying a property that I think may have been a gas station and may have underground storage tanks it's incumbent upon me to do that research and find out as by or as the buyers Asian because\nThe seller one may not know and and they can many times say they don't know because the property is older than a period of time and for which they've been an owner\nYou so that's a great point again so that speaks to a you know while a license real estate brokers in Rhode Island can sell commercial properties if they don't understand the nuances and the commercial market it can make it a make a difficult and that's again been one of the reasons why commercial brokers\nUh uh have been reluctant to participate in MLS because they want that that expertise I don't want a residential an agent bringing a buyer and and not being fully prepared for what they what they should be doing their due diligence and say\nRight because it's one of the reasons too is if you don't if you're not working with an agent who is experienced and knowledgeable about commercial real estate they might sell tremendous number of houses every year but commercial real estate again it's it's a very it's a different\nUm you know a very different business model and you are responsible for a lot more there are many more things that could potentially go wrong and liability could be ... could be exposed when necessary liability if the agent doesn't know what they were doing\nSo they should just make it easy and call you Joe [laughter] yeah well we can't do that but there are plenty of commercial practitioners\nIn Rhode Island and you're you know I'm I have experience but I think the you know what you want to do is you want to ask if you're talking with the ... or an agent you want to ask them what is their experience in this type of real estate so if you're selling\nGas station a restaurant a convenience store or you leasing space or leasing industrial space ask them how long they have been in that area of the business because\nYeah so I'm Sorry I didn't mean to interrupt but I just want to touch on this point uh because they can actually do as a search for the members of at east coast so that free place to start to find somebody who uh is qualified as to go to the east coast website and do you remember search\nSo how would they get to what is the uh your own for that we have a handy or can we\nYou guys are asking that question [laughter] sure I've got it right here [laughter] it's uh WWW dot east coast C. P. N. dot com\nAnd they have it so if you want to and they again this is actually applies residential real estate as well you can interview your realtor ask them questions okay just like you should interview your mortgage lender you should interview your clue ask questions you need to be comfortable with them with their level and they're under their level of knowledge their experience and\nUm you need to have a good report with them if it's not something that makes you comfortable you're not comfortable with the level of experience they have maybe you should keep looking\nBecause again you as the consumer buy or sell their needs someone to represent you\nWho has experience and the knowledge or you know in this um and if you're trying to sell the retail building or an industrial building because\nThey're not only is it just the actual selling of the property many times the difference between having a successful transaction and something that language is is financing and a realtor that's experienced in commercial real estate will be aware of all the different financing options they may most likely will have relationships with the lenders\nThat are out there who can finance this type of a transaction you know most residential realtor aren't aware of the lenders who can loan on a gas station or on a church I have a client right now and they're looking to finance a church I Know people who do that type of financing so that's only because I've\nBeen in the business of well my colleagues who have been in the business a while also have these relationships but someone who only does residential will not know they'll just kind of see the big question mark when you ask them that question\n[noise] and so in a another aspect and and what we have on the east coast a website not just properties for sale in lease but also business is business opportunities and I'm sure you know as you can speak to this or the businesses will bring it up a whole nother level or\nAnother area of ... and especially when challenged do not all businesses believe it or not not all businesses have impeccable accounting records I don't believe that and that can be a little bit challenging when you're trying to value a business or when it comes time to negotiate with a prospective buyer\nSo you need a realtor who's experienced in these types of negotiations and perhaps as the seller you will listen to the realtor and how to prepare for\nThe sale you know start to get the paper work together and um you know codify memorialize or database of consume ... of our clients and customers\nA track where the money's coming from where the money's go things like that so that you can really establish a value for the business because many times especially in cash businesses\nNot everything is accurately accounted for and that can make it challenging when you're trying to value a business for a fire and then to if if um\nYou don't if you cannot account for all the money is our banks they're not going to be willing to lend money to that fire so it becomes a big challenge and then\nUh when you may have to do as a seller is financed the deal yourself essentially the bank for the buyer the folks you are listening to our I living radio we're here weight on a W.

P. R. O. six thirty AM in Ninety nine point seven F. M. we're talking about commercial properties commercial real estate this weekend in particular the east coast commercial property network John ... vice president of M. L. S.\nAt the Rhode Island association of realtors is here and he's going to tell us a little bit about the history of east coast property network in how we got to where we are today\nSure so uh we spoke a little bit about why the hour how the commercial market is different\nAnd uh so really uh back in two thousand and twelve or the folks that Rhode Island or in statewide looked at their own a lesson and saw that there was\nA ... a slice of the market that really wasn't a being met properly under the MLS a umbrella\nSo they decided to create the what's it called the commercial exchange ah Rhode Island commercial exchange and uh and that's as we've talked about really focused on the commercial market\nAnd uh and it was really Rhode Island centered but you know as you know the commercial market is really broad and so a due to some fantastic gross and and the needs of the brokerage community\nAh we've we've branched out and re branded a and and we know ourselves the east coast commercial property network and so\nUh you know we've grown too close to twelve hundred real estate professionals who are using our service\nUh currently approximately Thirteen hundred a property for sale or at least one business opportunities in our database and so you know we're\nThe proud of that growth a leader of course want to continue to grow in a ... really where one of the the the only a local sources of commercial real estate or in the area a and so uh we found that you know when the snitch I think we're really we're really uh\nUh providing a great service to the a commercial brokers\nAre not only do they get to a list their properties in in the commercial exchange but we feed that information as we said earlier to our I living ... so that's a real big benefit of the commercial exchange is not only that the databases or the data excuse me is in that database but that we're really we're sending it out to other\nSites are I living a commerce are I in a in a multiple of multiple municipal sites\nAnd that I just jump in that's significant because what this means is if someone goes to conduct commerce are either talking about them talking to them about moving their business to do what island are investing in real estate in Rhode Island\nAnd maybe the state is trying to put together some kind of a proposal to entice them and they go and they looked at this database to see what opportunities are in Rhode Island they're using data from the east coast commercial property network\nSo if you are thinking about selling a piece of commercial property and you are interviewing a real estate agent or real tore to lift your property you need to ask them do they participate in the east coast property or information network commercial property information network because\nIf they don't and they list it only on the conventional national websites the average consumer is not going to be able to find that property because those sites need to pay just to search\nWith east coast commercial property network anybody can go get on line and look so you just have to go to our living dot com and look for commercial properties\nAnd you'll be able to see everything you don't have to pay a membership fee or pay one time search fear or anything like that it's free okay um and every thing on there you're going to have all this information that you would not otherwise have before just a conventional MLS so that's something that makes it a two things that make it very different than other opportune options out there\nAnd a great point a to follow up on that as well as a if you don't see or what you're looking for a there's a great a feature on the east coast site where uh there's needs or wants function so you can go and you can actually as a consumer enter or what it is you're looking for and uh someone will reach out to you\nYeah that that is significant because you know let's say I'm looking for a place and I want to have um some kind of a sports complex and so I Need something that's really big has high ceilings clear span those are all factors that you can put into your you know needs and wants and if an agent\nOr realtor who participates in the east coast commercial property network\nHas a property like that or maybe getting a property like that they will find out that that's what you were looking for so maybe a quick way to a ... a sale but again the best thing is to lift the property what someone who participates in the east coast commercial property network because\nIt's pushed out to all of these municipalities to their databases to the state commerce I'll ride database\nAnd consumers from literally all over the world because when you are the um when you participate in east coast commercial property network it's also a a ... a source of a resource for the um the victim which is the largest real estate conference in the world\nSchool information in a supple information tax rates you can find a real tour of course using to find a realtor link\nOr it's you can even register for your account or if you choose to us so that you can save your searches and you can get email notification so you want to find out\nA property is price has been reduced a sign up get the email notifications what's great is because it's the portal for the MLS\nAnd we have the source for that data that gets fed to all these other sites nationally but it takes time to get their uh you're you're you're dealing with the site of the MLS so you're getting that information that I'm real timely manner you're getting the the most up to date pricing and property status\nOr and you know that's one of the biggest benefits really\nYeah and I can't emphasize that enough because especially right now it's very competitive out there you know it's it's a competition when buyers go look at a house\nAnd you need to get in your offer as quick as possible you need to get in to see the house as quickly as possible but you also want to be aware if a property either comes back on the market or if the price drops maybe there was a house you've been tracking but it's you know just twenty or thirty thousand dollars too expensive\nNow there's a price drop now it's in your wheelhouse you can afford this house okay with our living dot com if you are working with a realtor that can send you properties if you set up your own searches\nYou're going to be notified as soon as that property change actually the price change or status change happens\nWith because every hour everything is updated every hour so if something changes you're going to know about it right away\nThe national Web sites they don't offer you that opportunity okay because this is the resource for all of the information everything comes from our

say it was the biggest surprise when you came to Rhode Island\nWants to go to work at ... ... statewide MLS\nWhat was your biggest surprise about our I living or about our MLS because I think one of the one of the biggest things a surprise is that I had when I learned about this because of course being involved and leadership I go to national conferences and I talked to people around from around the country\nRhode Island is in a great position because we're a small state answer my question because we're ... that's what I was going to say to writing us because we're a small state we have one MLS for the whole state\nSo I you know I mean it's a touching the small aspect I mean it was really impressive is that it it's small in comparison but I mean you you guys do what you guys now I Want to be and actually I was born in ... so I'm from from Rhode Island originally but\nUh I mean we get a lot done I mean they'll let the don't let the small size fool you you know are\nWe really are are are doing a lot and we're pretty proud of the things that we've accomplished and it's pretty impressive\nUh what what's what's happening down here\nYeah and and the biggest why that's significant in other parts of the country even in Massachusetts and Connecticut where they have multiple MLS is\nIf you're working with a realtor in one part of the state and you want to look at a property in another part of the state he or she may not have access to that property and let's see if they don't participate in that MLS which may be in another part of the state in Rhode Island it doesn't matter if you're looking in when socket westerly Central Falls ... wherever it is Newport\nIt's one MLS for all of those property so it's really efficient you know it's very easy to keep track everything is

really got my\nUh the bulk of my start with him very very good so I Know that she was trained absolutely properly and now that she's coming to ... getting even trained more\nWhich is fantastic she's great on the line she really is we have a lot of great instructors on the line that will you be joining us my home solve the night okay where are met misses that ... range on route three ... twelve hundred ... avenue in country\nIt's at six o'clock and we provide pizza by twisted pizza in Coventry uh provide some beverages\nYou know and all of the\nAgain the safety lessen the safety briefing that we do we're in the safety like in the in the classroom area if you will for about forty five minutes\nThat we do a little work with a ... gun which is a training gun and then go into the range and we should all the live stuff which is really fun and typically we have about twelve different firearms on the line they vary\nA but typically those twelve their approximately nine hand guns and then we have a couple of rifles as well\nWe have generally a A R Fifteen and a twenty ... twenty two which is always really fun and that\nIt's it's interesting because that particular fire on this one that everybody seems like really afraid of because the media has done quite as scary as the media is on a job on it and just tortured his reputation so and you know that\nOverwhelming majority at the end of the night that is most of the ladies favorite on because it's so easy to shoot it really is twenty two\nAnd then Sean brand again who works at mid state he's generally there as well helping us out and he brings his MP five\nWhich is nine millimeter and are by you know it's a ... and that's really fun to shoot because it's a pistol round in in the short barrel rifle than and then he's got that thing dialed and so that when you're if you're in he's got a red dot on it so you just put that red dot right on the target and it's going exactly where you're telling it to go you're not plunging so\nWomen can make a really super tight group with that and it gives them that positive reinforcement and then typically will put on a a river ten twenty two without the traditional loophole to cope with the cross hair\nAnd that things dialed into and the hand guns we there's lots of twenty two so if you've never shot before\nA it's perfect they we have a great instructors will be one on one with an instructor the entire time you will never be alone with a firearm were pretty thorough when we go through the safety briefing and it's all buttoned up you can ask any question of the instructors while you're with them\nAnd it's a very smooth night women come away with a lot of great targets and a great feeling and typically\nCome back come back and neither do another ladies' night or take a private after that or they might have a great interest in even getting a firearm\nYou can ask us any questions while we're there anything about a blue card about concealed carry we have a lot of interest in that as well so\nIt's a it's a great fact finding mission and it definitely does take the myth out of learning to shoot so our next ladies' night\nIs this coming Tuesday October sixteenth that mid state six o'clock you do have to call mid state gone ranging Coventry and register pre register by all means because of how much pizza or we have to know how much food to bring that's the most important thing\nAnd then the next one if you can't make this Tuesday\nIs the next one is October twenty fifth\nThe day after my birthday [noise] yeah you'll be there\n[laughter] I bring a cupcake [laughter] thank you with that it could never afford all the candles it up to go in that cake where you get out to get like I Want to get a job to do a jumbo cake you know a little Campbell when ... when the candles costs more than the cake\nYou know you know you got problems type to stop counting sure if the only way that will just sticking out eighty in the middle of the gate and out there that was a high rich [laughter] find ridge Exeter October twenty fifth same thing tweet\nTwisted pizza in eggs that are providing the pizza will have beverages for you and and the same format we have the basic safety training for about forty five minutes and you'll be with like minded ladies are typically who have never shot before or\nMaybe did it when they were young and and um you know it ... summer camp or something or or maybe did at one time with their husband or brother or something and they're like well you know I really want to get some professional instruction this is a great time for you to do it\nAnd then we go into the range and we should a bunch of guns and hand guns and and a couple a couple of rifles in there as well and it's one on one once again so this isn't I don't want you to think of ladies night like as a league\nWhere you bring your own stuff and you call them and and um there's nothing like that you don't have anything you could be as green as clover just come on in and\nGet the experience and take the ... out of learning to shoot once again that is a pre registration to at MIT at a Pine Ridge indoor shooting range which has five sixty south county trial in eggs that are and you can give Pine Ridge called register for that one on October twenty fifth\nTough comet trail otherwise known as route to do\nAnd south yesterday on the tone on route three [laughter] and we could get into all of the Rhode Island as ... as to a ... it's next to where something used to be [laughter] it's the old pool shop right over there or I don't I'm not used to be on that road\nOkay here's another segue you know where bits state is right next to ... minutes toward the\nUh in order to have it so good you are so nobody sponsors and men and towards ... is sponsoring the show their attorneys that law\nAnd they welcome a new attorney their attorney Charles ... Linda how you've heard him on the show he's actually done a couple of legal lectures for lock stock and diet and how some of your definitely familiar with him\nAnd he was at the age ... office for twelve years he actually prosecuted gun\nRelated crimes and so this she knows I mean the guys got\nThe whole plan he has seen it from the other side now he can approach it from a totally different angle and he's going to work hard for you he brings that twelve plus years of experience as a criminal defense attorney to\nInvent and towards ... he's a strong advocate for the second amendment community he's he knows his guns he knows his laws his knowledge of the federal gun laws is definitely vital to helping any Rhode Island and protect their right to keep and bear arms\nTo call Charles at the law firm of in mentor gee Fifteen hundred new ... the number is four zero one eight two three Ninety two hundred and he'll even give you a free consultation he\nDid work and family court too so\nI mean he's he's a good criminal defense guy but he's also got experience or the other aspect family court appropriate I Believe we have some experience and [noise] so yeah chess is a good guy to get to know and everybody who has a\nConcealed carry permit or who has a firearm at home for self defense have is number on your speed dial\nBecause if you ever have to use it God Forbid you got called Charlie quick\nDon't talk ... talk the cops are going to try to get to the say everything under the sun just as if it is if he don't say a word called jazz and he'll tell you what to do call Charles can lend it and they'll tell you exactly what to do and most importantly you can tell you what not to do\nLet's say there's bowling pin chew going on and that's at Pine Ridge indoor shooting range Saturday October twenty seventh at one o'clock until it finishes\nIt's only Fifteen dollars per competitor so have you ever want to try a bowling pin shoot the very popular um you can even be a beginner you don't have to have any experience for this\nAnd you're going to go head to head with somebody at twenty five feet two sets of five pins are set up sixteen inches apart or on an eight foot wide by four foot deep table and the first shooter to get all five pins on the ground wins the round\nAnd then it's kind of like a tournament thing where you progress from there but don't let the tournament and the head to head things scary you can be\nI'm new to this you can be new to shooting bowling pins and you'll get very good at it quickly is a great experience too and it's only Fifteen dollars that's it but you have to sign up okay you've got to register you you you ... you do have to provide your own pistol\nOr that's not going to be provided for you have to have your own eye and ear protection and a ammunition to and when you're shooting bowling pins people if you if you're going to a gun shop and asking them what type of information that you need to knock down a bowling pin you really need a high velocity and a heavy grain in order to get\nThose hands down and real bowling pins I mean if you've ever pick one up\nIt's been in a lot of those shoots loaded with lead [laughter] it is so it'll just like got stuck in the lead and just stay still [laughter] and just stay right there you really have to have some in your ammunition to knock them down so how many rounds people usually have to bring you know that a\nBoy if they ... it depends depends on how far they go\nSo why not let's let's do this test okay so he uses a glock\nNine millimeter in a car being conversion with a sixteen inch barrel for the nine millimeter portion of the test the blazer bras a hundred and twenty four grain full metal jacket about Thirteen hundred feet per second penetrated twenty two layers of three eighths inch sheet rock\nAnd a dented number twenty three right so if you're keeping score at home that's nine millimeter went through twenty two layers and dented the twenty third layer out of a sixteen inch barrel without nine well off and it would be higher yep\nOkay for two to three uses an AR with perfect at fifty five grain full metal jacket ammo travels around twenty eight hundred feet per second it penetrated the same number of drywall layers but shredded them more dramatically ... that's that's the power of the\nThe that round it just it's it's devastating around okay so back to nine millimeter he tries out or how low point one twenty four green Remington golden saber black belt plus T round about fourteen hundred feet per second that bullet went through Seventeen layers of sheet rock shredding their backs surfaces\nJust about the same as a two to three bullet expansion of the ... point was minimal which has to be expected\nI'm In that type of medium they use you know drywall instead of meat\n[noise] two to three grain appointed to the max fifty five green bullet designed for environments the Wii max is\nMeant to provide rapid explosive expansion that's almost three thousand feet per second twenty nine thirty\nThis one made it through Thirteen layers of drywall\nBefore was left of the bullet came to arrest so that was only Thirteen\nTo top it off he grabs a lever action ... and some CIA mini Mac twenty two long rifle with\nA forty grain round knows bullets and so that's a twelve hundred twenty feet per second this one makes it through a loving layers the same round fired from a semi automatic Pistole with a four inch barrel I was nine hundred and twenty nine feet per second made it through ten layers and that's the equivalent\nOf five household walls\nThe moral of today's story if you think your dime millimeter go through significantly fewer walls than a two to three you'd probably be wrong and a twenty two can be a lot more effective than some folks would have you believe\nIn my little problem with the words effective because the ah screen shot the companies is this thing that we're looking at if you look at the way he's got the drywall positions they're looked like maybe ...\nNo more than six inches apart in a typical home you've got to buy for\nA ... yeah ... if you have insulation in between the walls which is hot and can be I mean and I go to is going to cause some of that now there's absolutely no question that if it's going to go through that many layers if you fire and miss it's a good chance is going to leave your house\nOr your apartment or your condo and that's one thing you don't want because you're still going to be responsible for that bullet where ops so as we've said some uh several times I think in the past on this program\nAh probably your best bet is a shock going for home defense\nBut you still need to understand what ammunition you're putting ashtrays out because I've seen I've seen people I've seen on a YouTube people doing um ballistics testing with\nWith bird shot so even you know seven and a half eight nine shot and most people aren't taking a long shot in their house I mean they the FBI statistics tell us that the average gunfight is three to five feet and last about three to five seconds that's about it so it's up close and personal it's very quick\nSo most people don't live in a new port mansion\nAnd say you don't have big long corridors and rooms you've got a compacted space\nSo at close range I've seen some of the ballistic testings on on YouTube and even seven and a half each shot [laughter] it can go right through all of its close sure yeah but for under duress under stress\nAnd being able I mean you still have to aim you can't just point like they say a stop to aim at church target\nUm you know the way those pellets will break up and especially if you do hit your intended target is going to be less chance of those little pellets by themselves\nOver penetrating fell into the neighbor's apartment or condo or the neighbor's house through a glass I mean we've done you've seen it too we've done to the last testing in their vehicles if if you shoot into a pain and glass it's like the glasses and even there it's just 'cause there's virtually no deflection whatsoever other than a ...\nA when children back when children are our safety it's totally different exactly so\nUm you don't count on your don't count on your walls or your windows to\nSave anything it's not going to and even even loading up your firearm in your home if you're going to keep on in your house for home protection it'd be very mindful about where you're pointing that fire on because if you do get an accidental discharge there is going to be a hole somewhere and just pray that you're going to minimize collateral damage and\nAnd not to hurt anybody on on the other side of a wall or um you know\nTry explaining that to your plumber or I got a forty five hole in my uh\nHot water heater gi Joe how that happened and don't think that you know unless you know the guy that he might not alert that\nCop at the local pd and say you might want to go into this house and see what's going on over there I just pulled out of hot water heater that it was plugged with a forty five so you never know you know this is Rhode Island you sneezing in one socket and catch cold in Newport yeah\nI Know and I um I think us talk about the twenty two long rifle for a minute I like it I Know you do um\nI actually I'm a I'm a big huge in some of the comments on my Facebook page if you look at 'em on a I'm a huge twenty two ... fan I learned that from bill Lou when I a lot of you know bill ooh he used to own police do so\nIn a situation and he God rest his soul he was a a Cranston police officer for many years to and an incredible shot he built that range over in western\nCranston that Hogan valley range it's even a plaque there dedicated to him so that police will have a place to la to practice and you can do car scenarios and pop up targets and they turn on the lights and it was very very awesome you brought me there and showed it to me I used to work for him ... years ago\nAnd um he ... his two favorite around twenty two magnum and thirty eight special\nYeah well the the ... yes the key is you have to hit the target [laughter] so I don't care if you use a forty four magnum or you're using a a nine millimeter was Seventeen round magazine if you're just going to spray bullets or our life\nIs not going to stop anybody and you're going to run the risk as you say of collateral damage of twenty two caliber rounds correctly and effectively place that's a difference between effective\nThan with at least it's going to it's going to stop somebody and it's going to cause a internal injuries but see the the the the the\nArgument you're going to get which was ... first in this article was that most people in a gunfight are missing their intended target because of the stressful situation that you're on everybody all most people\nIf they're practicing and they're putting their time in sitting in front of the front of a well behaved target it's not going to move around it's not shooting back\nThat's about Twenty one feet away and they're not cause trouble making and they didn't bring their bad friends with them most if they're very well behaved and you're sitting there and you're shooting at him going to make a good shot you're gonna make a decent shot well the the stress of and I\nGod I Hope I never find out what that's like um I Can't even imagine what that would be like and trying to hit your intended target at that point and I think that's the whole argument here that most people are going to mess we see it all the time with the police\nAnd and they're going to hit whatever collateral they might be some collateral damage there you know\nI think I'm In the days when police officers carried six shot revolve or is that the fact of the matter was they they tended to be better shocks more today when they're carrying Fifteen rounds and one in the chamber [noise]\nUm and they they just have a situation I'm In Chicago that a police officer there was convicted of second degree homicide\nUh pulled up to the scene jumped out of his car and here's a young black man with a knife with a three inch blade\nAnd he gets out and and the guy keeps walking doesn't respond to command he's one of those later officers on the scene he jumps out of his car\nAnd fire sixteen rounds ... into this kid and says he felt threatened because the kid has three inch blade while the he had had an empty his hand guns into\nA perpetrator or would be perpetrator\nHe helps them get sixteen hits but in most situations that could happen because as you say somebody shooting back at slow light situation um it's ... you you you're not going to be assured of firing once and somebody falling over that's in the vets and Hollywood that's in the movies you see that\nRight but the odds are of you getting into a gunfight in your life is pretty slim to none but the odds are very highly yet and the odds of you having a CPA issue fault that that increases the little bit\nYou know once you have a firearm at that point and you really have to be very mindful of safety and when I go through my classes I talk a lot about safety I'm all into the safety aspects of it\nOn because it's all fun and games until somebody gets hurt you know you want to have a good time\nIt's a fast paced shooting class we're going to teach a multiple shooting drills while building your confidence and marksman ship that's very important like we talked about earlier hitting your intended target you're going to learn the techniques that you need for perfect practice and that's what we say all the time practice doesn't make perfect perfect practice makes perfect\nAnd you've got it and you All right so now let's put it to work you can register by giving me a call at\nFour O. one for for one zero one one one four oh one for for one zero one one one or you can even\nTax to that number two the cost of the class is two hundred and twenty five dollars per person you will need your eye and ear protection a serviceable hand gone up three to four hundred rounds of ammunition strung sided belt pollster um you can even do like\nYou're in the waistband or if you're if you take Harry and briefcase or something bring it let's let's work it and see if it's if if it's effective is that if it's a fish and\nBring that stuff work your gear bring your gear uh bring whatever you think that you would be carrying out on the street if you have a concealed carry permit and you're able to carry out on the street or bring that stuff because that's going to help you you'll need three to four magazines or speed loaders if you're if you're bringing a revolver I changed guns and when they take these classes I might work with\nA semi automatic for a little while but then I'll always work with my revolver because I like a revolver or evolved as a great gun and\nI'm Steve loading that is can be a little bit difficult so you've got to put the time and work on that muscle memory to can bring a ... a couple of guys that that backup gun comfortable clothing you want to bring some snacks we do give you I'm about forty five minutes for lunch and it is rain or shine so\nIf it looks like it's going to rain brings some rain gear because of you don't put the foot around very we get into it and you're not going to stand under

Gregory crews and all the information is there and see a lot of other stuff\nToo as well and the weather let's look and see what the weather's doing now never mind that Sunday is brought to us by competition shooting supply\n[laughter] looking for my here it is that the dishes shooting supplies for thirty five benefits street and Pataki at home the twenty five dollar transfer see John Francis nice guy knowledgeable connected can hook you up with just about anything that you're looking for a competition shooting supply\nOf today's ... fifty degrees right now and as you can see clouds are starting to come in a tomorrow we're going to get up to about sixty four a but it's going to be another one of those cloudy days with a few showers\nOn Tuesday gets partly sunny up to fifty eight degrees Wednesday fifty nine degrees down to forty eight up to fifty six and maybe some rain on Saturday at fifty degrees so\nIn the transition season between summer and all of them and you know that's what it is and guess what the autumn hunting season that a good thing yes it is you know we've been hunting mushrooms and between two so he's on hunting for something I think for you call it foraging for aging in the woods we'd like\nThat uh okay so\nI Want to talk a little bit about what we're we're going to run out of time here how much time do we have ma ma five we have five minutes okay let me just quickly mentioned are six taken to carry class I Know well this is I Know I have time to time\nIs money my friend and I know sixty conceal carry class it is going to be Saturday November seventeenth at Pine Ridge indoor shooting range five sixty south county trail in eggs that are\nHave this massive we'll give you the credentials that you need to apply to Massachusetts main Florida Utah Virginia and Connecticut\nSo the question I always got his how come not Rhode Island because Rhode Island is is a complete animal unto itself it requires a shooting qualification test which I find a lot of people cannot pass even experience shooters they come to shoot it they can't pet food that requires some training\nAnd and every uh just thirty nine municipalities in the state the roles digging in jogging\nThey all have their own their own applications so do you have to write a letter of need references blah blah blah this law entailed with red\nSo we don't include Rhode Island in this because I I couldn't do it justice for twenty five people sitting in a classroom but the other one's a lot easier so\nIf you wanna get certified to apply to Massachusetts main Florida Utah Virginia and Connecticut and you don't necessarily have to apply but you will have the certification for those it's November seventeenth\nPine Ridge indoor shooting range all six certifications or two Ninety five mass only as a hundred Utah only is one hundred to sign up you\nCan give me a call for one for for one zero one one one or\nJust go to my Web site and there's a link there to bring you right to pay pal it's the ... the under the classes tab should be the first one sixth date concealed carry class just girl down there's a link right there and you can pick whatever option that you want it's very very easy or just contact me send me an email or ...\nOr send me a text message and all of a sudden you the link directly we have three minutes to talk about this gun safety things help make\nQuaint there so I think we last week we're talking about the governor's a so called working group on gun safety the issue the forty six page report that we've talked a little bit of a a lot about last week well this us yes today this Sunday's Providence Sunday journal\nReports that the Providence Journal along with public radio and ABC six channel six\nI'm commissioned a a poll one of the questions is would you support or oppose the general assembly passing a bill outlawing the sale of new underlying new semi automatic rifles\nAnd the state and ... the words are new semi automatic rifles not assault weapons or whatever\nAnd I mean let that sink in okay semi automatic rifles that's not your your ones dressed in black that's everything got up\nAnd so the response was fifty five percent of the respondents supported such a band that's forty or forty eight percent strongly supported at seven percent\nHad some support for it\nAnd on the flip side on our side forty percent ... a supporter I'm Sorry opposed the idea so it was fifty five to forty\nSo the fifteenth point spread their other people didn't know or didn't care or whatever so I'm\n... who's who the paper describes as the chief lobbyist for the leading gun rights coalition after Rhode Island state house declined to comment when he was shown the results of the survey however our old friend Linda ... who heads up the road island coalition against gun violence\nSaid this quote this poll confirms that the majority of Rhode islanders support a ban on any new semi automatic rifles\nTheir own polling the coalition's own poli don't ask me who pays for it because they don't have supposedly have any dues paying members nevertheless our own polling suggest even stronger support\nWith fifty nine percent favoring a ban on a A R fifteens or assault rifles or military style weapons whatever you call him\nSo folks this this election that were coming up is very very important critical it's critical mc nabb yellow or takes us has some comments about this and he's ... he said one\nOf his quotes is we will continue in the next session to review and have discussions on new proposals taking Rhode Island's Second Amendment community taking\nYeah so when you're at the voting and you got to vote ... when you're there choose wisely okay really do your homework do your research\nLook at who's on your side look at it is clearly not on your side and choose wisely\nWe'll be back on the twenty eighth CNN [noise] have a great we\nGoing to be from New England trucks illusions Tucson whenever I'm a I'm six thirty

consulate there wasn't medieval on him and he was killed and it was chopped up and they said that that the crew down there to kill them and do all this that'd be an outrage and\nJust because they're

you represented the roof and it was just one of many men that want to hold us down\nI mean this is this is gone far beyond ridiculous now so I just wanted to make him you know to make a statement that if she doesn't have the guts to come on the air and and defend whoever wrote you know would not defend who I've read it but defend herself against whoever wrote it on her behalf\nI mean this this letter is talking about getting her support and donating to her and getting behind her so if she doesn't want it she should come forward and say\nWell because she's on the radio towers by you know everything I ever hear about where is all scripted little like that ... that intro that you were doing that was a scripted thing on her Facebook that it's all scripted but maybe she just is not good on her feet I don't know that you know\nYou can't run legislation by press releases new releases and scripted things you sometimes you do have to stand up and just speak without a script and maybe she's not comfortable doing that or maybe she thinks the high I have no idea\nWhat are your constituents neighbor saying representative team so I mean I don't see how this could ever ever work in her favor so someone is out there thinking they're doing or a fever and I think it's going to backfire but what are your you know the people surrounding him saying\nWell believe it or not the most upset among among my constituents are women yeah I'm a because you know they I mean first of all that letter attack every man and then every woman ... values are are mad whether it's er\nThat's been respond her father brother and and then by the way\nHappy Columbus Day also insults everybody who happens to be Italian American because they you know one little adjective changed everything if they had said Italian child would have been it would have been really nice but you throw into that but like we see and it changes everything\nSo they throw that in there by the way we also have some some people that live in these brothers that their names do end of all we'll just like mind though\nHow yeah I don't know where that comes from someone inside and it's almost demented this letter to be honest with you uh you know\nTalking about who your friends are and ah trying to link you to something that happened up at the state house I mean the bottom line is um\nThis whole idea of the ... movement needs women like you consider volunteering I mean there's someone out there that I don't I Hope this isn't a group of people I Hope it's maybe one person that thinks they're doing testing Caldwell a fever and I and I certainly don't think they are I Would be with him and who are highly offended don't let me in with you ...\nYou don't mind my mother always said that you are who you hang out with but if you if you rented out with somebody who limped eventually you're going to limp fields there's the dollar and a and that's a that was her metaphor for what you choose your friends wisely\nUm and she is still out there so by some people that like yesterday I actually wasn't I didn't reply emails yes but I didn't even looked at them because they said you know what\nThis campaign mode we've got a month ago and I was out there campaigning speakers of the people of all of my district and I cover a good part of West private Chinese brothers\nAnd and um and but then some people were taking screen shots of some tweets that were going out with some of her friends one of them was actually one that ran unsuccessfully for the state Senate a nearby Dale Johnson or Lincoln wherever that district there's\nAnd the files stuff that came out of her mouth like I said aren't they supposed to screen these things from Twitter I mean brought a bomb like they were going out of style but\nThen there's pictures of just being cold well and this woman\nThough you know eventually eventually the truth will come out as I said it may not be her like those are her words and she started that whole attack back in January when um when when one of those state rep ... me too and then all of a sudden\nThey have to react in a you know to make it look like it was the right thing to do politically to have a a sex or harassment training at the state house\nThat was three by any means so when she said well when he was offering you know if you give me sexual favors I'll get you bills passed since she didn't named the person who said it allegedly on and then yeah then you then you were all told to\nAh well let's have some sexual harassment classes is that what you're talking about yeah\nExactly so that so what happened there is I I did that night because I said you know I'm a I'm a professional I have I have my own business have lots of employees and most of them are women and I I'm very sensitive to that we've had training in my business and we have things posted all over the place that we've never had not even one\nIota of a problem with with management to stop stop this baffled vice versa and and I took offense at some point in leadership is is saying you pass your bills are new to this that the other and yet you don't mention who it is\nFirst of all I have a problem with that because there were a Fifteen year old girl was running around in that building and I want to know we have a good lawyer in that room I Want to know who it is and she never even mentioned whether it's a former all of\nA former rap or covering up so I had a major problem with that and then for them support on this and I say it proudly and I know you can people can criticize me but it was a dog and pony show all for the optics Robert and I said I'm going to value women I'm going home and having dinner with my wife that's all I'm going to value or women in my life\nAnd and then because she took that and by the way for the record\nI did say that I I skipped it I didn't need it I've had it in my in my personal and my business life right but she didn't take it that way so from that moment on that's what they'd hang that has a I Am a disgrace to women I didn't go to that by the way there were eight teams rather than go to that right but I'm the bad guy\nAnd and so that's where a rhetoric and everything that that she said it was all about that reproductive rights by the way we've never had a bill come to the full house\nAbout anything to do with reproductive rights so you know I I don't even know where that is coming from I don't serve on that committee on the climate and on the corporations in\nThe middle east when I'm getting at today I feel that\nThere are so many people that feel that our I'm\nJust going about their day to day life right I gotta go to work I'm going to take care of the kids can sometimes take care of the parents uh and and then there are those that are looking for something to protest and hear you say we'd never even dealt with\nA challenging reproductive rights I'm you know we've got to stop these men we've got to stop all this ... it's not happening so I don't know where that this anxiety or and or\nCall to arms you know call to action just sat and what are we trying to stop what are we trying to you know don't bring hate to my community\nRight and you know area you know you know who has the biggest problem with the progressive wing of the Democratic party it's the Democrats\n... ... how they are so concerned they don't want them in there and and look what they did to their own like you know they did there\nThere was a there was a flyer that went out and every representative receive a it was it was so well done it was beautiful card stock and it was a there was a going away party for these two or three four five reps whatever it was and they were all Democrats\nAnd they are going away party because they've signed onto a pro life bill and we're going to get them out we're going to primary them and we're going to get them out but this is what they're doing to their own they're very concerned that and and they are bringing like they they have these signs on the loans hate has the home and it it it's ridiculous I mean he doesn't have any home in my house either\nBut there's so much heat that comes out of those homes because if you disagree with one of their point hey you\nRight now I I hear you All right we're going to ah I'll read her seat and interesting calls well as your opponent and I do you plan to get together and have some kind of a debate for this legislative seat\nWe're right we actually already did a last week we had a\nReaction on that some of the video\nOn out I think it was a blog than it would\nBe it would be nice to be cordial I mean we all read the same air locked children depend the same schools in the community and we worship in the same church that we play in the playground but yet there's all this this course and it just drives me bananas\nAnd it's not right I mean I ran against the Democrat in two thousand twelve and ... it was very respectful like no I'm I'm a Republican I have my conservative views he's a Democrat he has his liberal views but at the end of the day we understand each other we respect each other we shake hands over to this day every time with each other we do\nBut in this case here she sees me and it's like she sees the devil Mm ironic that wrote a coffee shop I say good morning and she just walked by going oh my God I just saw it goes\nLike it doesn't have to be that way where reporters were are not enemy ... at the end of the day I'm representing her as she\n... she has an issue she should feel free to come to me like everybody else does\nUnderstand aren't representative Anthony junior was so from east Greenwich he's a Republican challenger this I guess you could call it a hate letter but it depends on how you know which side you're on so listen we'll talk again in the future about five weeks left ear for weeks left to the\nBanks our November stick their compact enough\n[laughter] I think everybody was thinking

prevented by your New England Honda dealer smart first ran alongside Chris Jasper ad splits feel patriot places Fox furrow denied the free into patriots host the undefeated five in Kansas City chiefs we've got a lot to get to before\nAn eight twenty kick off that I can as I mentioned patriots preview brought you buy your New England Honda dealer step up your tailgating game this season with the always dependable twenty Eighteen hundred a C R B motor trend twenty Eighteen SUB of the year visit Honda dealer some New England\nDot com Brits we have a guest with us right out of the gig tonight before this game at a gym known C O of joy stadium Jim thanks for being here with us appreciate it yeah thanks so much for having me today so off the air you were just telling us about a new program\nHere at the stadium and on game day where you don't have to pay to park your car\nThat that is true totally every you know catch no cats free parking\nIt was one small catch which I'll talk about All right down to it but no ah we were the ... we believe it was the first team in the NFL the offer free parking to our fans um and I think as everyone knows or the one of the toughest things about Gillette Stadium is where landlocked by route one um and we were constantly looking for ways to improve that process\nSo new pilot program we tried at the last two games and it was successful was free parking um but it's free parking and the delayed exit lot\nSo any any fan whether they're a season ticket member or any ticket holder can park for free if they agree to stay Seventy five minutes after the game before they leave\n'em and it's part of that um you know as we know at one o'clock in the four o'clock game there's a lot of things to do whether it's tailgating whether it's patriot played cross pavilion is open inside the stadium for our post game but for the for night games as part of this program we're opening the cross pavilion post games or for anyone who takes part in the program\nI'm so give someone something to do for Seventy five minutes after the game before they go to the car\nI'm In the benefit we look at for every one is we know it's hard to get out of here but if people can take advantage of free parking which is a benefit to many um it delayed their eggs allows people who want to leave right after the game less friction on route one I'm so we've had success for two games and we're excited to roll it out for the rest of the year\nCan you tell the people exactly where this lot is Jim and in how they can get there they had to participate in it\nAre absolutely so where it's located or it is one of the stadium general lots across the street from the stadium and anyone who comes down here in up it's a you'd under the ... south or the pizza and north entrance\nOr in a way to get it get access to it or you need to download a parking pass the good news is if you're in your car right now I just did it two minutes ago and it took me two minutes so if you go to the Gillette Stadium dot com\nI'm right on the front page Gillette Stadium to see a big parking tablet that's free parking if you go to that is very intuitive you can download it right now I take advantage of that tonight and then for the remainder of the season you can continue to find it on Gillette Stadium dot com\nSo again if you're just hearing that's if you're on your way to the game right now you're planning on leaving at least Seventy five minutes correct yeah Seventy five minutes after the game you can go to Gillette Stadium dot com you can sign up for it on your way here and then there's an extra benefit to it tonight as you mentioned the cross ... billion tonight there's actually an added benefit to that\nYeah so for a for a night games\nWe're providing food and re beverage free non alcoholic beverage in across the million or so it's a place for for all these people to go um watch the post game show relax and then when they get to their car they're going to have an easier time getting home\nSo has dropped the gotten worse on route one no words no I'm going to try no\nSo um we've been working for forever on him to everybody in\nIn about Nineteen Seventy one night\nAnd you know and all of our ... all of our improvements have been incremental so we tracked it and it is better but it's still talk with one road so a couple of things that we've done recently as one as we move all of our employee parking and would that did is that took Eighteen hundred cars off of route one er and we actually saw a tangible benefit of doing that\nOr this year in addition a we acquired the Fox bro terminals lock up the street and were piling this year a prepaid parking and castles parking and the benefit of that as casual since ... for us to process than cash\nUs or experimenting with that now we might roll it out on a more global basis or but those are a couple of things we've done in recent vintage\nAdditionally or is it gives you guys know we have a uh the MBTA and open a commuter rail stop on a pilot program at twenty Nineteen\nUh so we're always encourage more people to take the train 'em but we're looking for ways to increase ridership I'm so one of our hopes are long term it would be to have multiple trains have a train coming down earlier in the day for people who want to go to patriot place\nUm and then have one come later so we're working on that but with the train every two and a half people that ride the train is one less current one\nBecause that's our average with just over two people were car well or so people car pool more that people take advantage of the train\n'em and also\nOver lifted so big these days are that we're working to continue to enhance our Ruben ... program because one of the big things were missing right now we don't have a north bound over a lot so anyone who's used right away I dedicated\nTo the area that we have a dedicated one in the south yeah uh but they have to exit to the south and it takes longer to loop around so we're working to to\nWork in a source of a north ... and that will continue to help the process because we can keep the over lip cars from in front of Gillette Stadium you know that whole stretch it you know from got it from North St up the Dunkin' Donuts you keep the ... out of there it helps everyone else as well\nSo all of this is in an effort to make the game day experience better I I Know that's a big part of not only what the patriots have done for teams across the NFL continuing to try and make it you know more attractive entertainment option you know it's just so that people never get tired of dealing with some of the congestion and things that go along with spending the day going to a game\nExactly I mean I I think our season ticket members of seeing all the changes that we've done inside the building you know we've had we had a draft Kings' we had a union pointe cross ... billion unlike a lot of people don't know cross civilian is open to all of our season ticket members for\nThe whole game it opens thirty minutes before kickoff ... there is a private hospitality until thirty minutes before kickoff but at ten minutes of eight tonight through the end of the game is open to the public and then post game it's just all but for those who take advantage of the free\nA free a free parking doesn't it a lot\nUm but one other thing we we've added this year I'm for folks have been to our fans on you know when we got rocked the plaza pre game we've got you know we've got photo ops we have a lot of activation McGinnis down there last week you know we get the Sunday Night Football truck down there but this year we added a we've had a Bud Light a veteran above like bar\nUm it's only open pre game but it's another way with first for the MBTA riders cutting outcome enjoyable light at the bar\nFor you head into the city but for people who don't want to tailgate you know that activation zone is a fun place to go get down park your car gives you something to do before you get in the building so this this last year when I ask you about you how many spaces are in that larger so people have an idea how big it is a well the the good news is the program can be scalable based on volume\nUm you know so ... so tonight our goal is to have a thousand cars parked there are so that's the goal um\nAnd uh but if the program successful um you know with our pizza and a lot of cross the street we can just expand it because it's the heat that has a bunch of individual lot that we can customize so um we really put no ceiling on it and um you know but we can watch the enrollment and react accordingly\nA gym and one more for you I Know that uh tonight there's going to be fans were coming here than it wanting to keep an eye on the red Sox game I saw that you know it's been kind of put out by the team here in recent days with the wife by in the stadium free right ... if you want to stream the game keep an eye on the game whatever it is you want to\nDo it yeah and you can stream it right to the Gillette Stadium dot com app as well as if you go to ap you'll be able to get that downloaded um there were all sports fans here so we know we know people are coming to watch this play the cheese but we don't want anyone not to be in touch with everything else going on\nSo again Gillette Stadium dot com if you want to take part in this new program to park for free and you can take advantage of free food and beverage after the game as well on a a delayed release lot after the game check that out your wet stadium dot com and the Gillette Stadium out correct\nYeah that yeah so if you go let stadium dot com you can download or you can download a your path and very like I said it took me two minutes or the other thing is we are
