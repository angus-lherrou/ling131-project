{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WPRO", "content": "Everybody in government everywhere had to put on including the speaker of the house with the sexual harassment seminar I I have a visual him sitting in that audience\nA up their state house for this multi hour seminar did they did\nAnd and and knowing full well that underneath them you've got this this thing and it it it's it's clear that they knew exactly what they represent people had been accused\nOf doing because one of the things he's accused of doing reportedly\nHappen in a very public space and uh and so it's not it's remember the sexual harassment not sexual assault\nRight there's a difference between the two um\nAnd it was pretty well known reportedly a throughout the delegation that there was a problem here\nAnd that the complaining state representative ... you know concern so to to\nTo strip the representative keep all of his House Judiciary chairmanship\nWhich to most of you you know in addition to a quarter would buy you a cup of coffee you you are probably so less concerned about this than you are your everyday life that I I get that\nUm I Wish you weren't like that but I Know that you are for the most part and I understand that you are and accept that you are you all these kinds of things generally don't rise to the level of your dramatic concern which is why\nWhich is why I don't know what the hell they're doing\nIf this was not in the speaker's mind worthy of formal rebuke\nDemotion like he just did\nBack three years ago two years ago a year ago six months ago six weeks ago right if it wasn't worthy or be then why is it why is it were the review today\n\nLast the same question with Matty there the cross over and he said well because there's an election on Tuesday well what does that mean I mean I understand the answer and I understand what he's saying he's I I get it\nBut you have to be able to stand up and say nothing that ever came to me warranted\n\nA specific a demotion disciplinary action I just was trying to be helpful and try to shuffle the deck around but the problem with that of course is that\nYou know shuffling the deck around is one thing if you're going out to dinner with a bunch of reps and you're going to keep represent a cable over here and say listen man she's got a problem with you\n... ... ... leave her alone\nWere all out together as a delegation spending are a huge campaign war chest in ways that are disgraceful to Daniel show but\nWe're gonna have steak and lots of drinks let's just make sure you stay over there and she stays over there that's the kind of thing that you can arrange\nYou can't arranged taking the chairman of the committee and having him leave the hearing\n\nWhat they're complaining state representative coming to testify on her bill assuring the state representative that the chairman of the committee who should be on his own to make his own decisions about how to execute that committee\nThat he has to leave the committee and be replaced by state representative either the yellow\nSimply to execute the humidity's so that the state representative who feels like she's been harassed by the chairman can articulate free of whatever pain or pressure she feels her arguments about the bill\nThat's the people's business that's the people's business that has to\nBe reviewed upon in real time as the people's business the the light should have gone off and they had of everybody on the matter yellow speaker leadership team that we are working too hard to keep this guy in place\nThat if we if we're doing something officially\n\nThen we have to do something really officially you don't ask the chairman to leave the hearing because the person coming to testify for her bill feels like she's been harassed by him you remove\nHim from the Judiciary Committee and you more or less you just to him that he's now in the hands\nOf his voters when you say\nThat there's legitimacy to the prom because there's no legitimacy to the problem\nIf the representative is saying he lives in this guy did this everybody knows it and uh I don't feel comfortable and I think that you are I I think that you are creating an unsafe or a harass\nType environment\nYou you have to say to her I think you're overreacting for reasons that I think are clear unless you're going to tell me something that I don't\nKnow that he's got to go I mean they you know I mean you've got to you've got to deal with him\nThere's no there's no middle ground in these things\nNot anymore maybe in the old days but not anymore\nSo I I I I get I'd love to hear what you think about this at four three eight zero toll free one eight hundred three two one dirty appeared roads too bad that this conversation is happening you know a week before the election\nAnd clearly you know ... see who by the way is on television with me tonight I'm Daniel state of mind weeknight seven thirty in my right TV and Fox Providence had midnight he was originally scheduled anyway with Joe Fleming to go over the poll numbers and the governor's race\nIn the Senate race\nOr and we do do that but we could not not speak about this particular story since it was Ted story um what is somewhat unique about this story is that nobody knows what we're talking about in terms of the allegations\nRight the email doesn't specify it's it's the it's the\nReporter generated information that Ted has gathered where she had to make a decision as a journalist whether to go forward with this story week in front of the election\nAnd uh\nYou know and and and and know based on the reporting out\nWhat has specifically been alleged\nAnd I will tell you what I Know about it I mean there's all background information from people who have\nUm you know I'm disgusted but it's it's in the neighborhood of a very public um perhaps\nAlcohol um induced or high ... public scrutiny ... of of um\nBeing turned down for whatever\nReport in advance is\nI mean that's that's that's all I can tell you is the here say through the pipeline on this thing\n\nBut I guess there was a there was a night when and again this is this is this is not unsubstantiated it's not I cannot attribute this to anybody specifically um it's here say conversation that's offered to me on kind of background of but it's it's one of these things where he embarrassed her he embarrassed\nOr in most people think unnecessarily and there's the there's deep or stuff that I I Can't I I won't talk about because\nUm I I don't have it substantiate it even at that level\nBut it's just one of those things
