R. oh good afternoon but afternoon how are you okay\nI was just it again it's just my own perception but it it seems to me that um when you said that the narrative\nUh become stuff but then the um the accusation um I recall you know listening to you commenting on the whole Brett Kavanaugh ... uh you know and I'm In my impression that you had absolutely no uh\nUh the or no faith in anything and uh you seem very supportive of Mr fellow um and I you know I think that the story out the one is far more serious than the other but it's the same idea rather an accurate\nThey maybe you didn't hear everything I maybe you didn't hear anything I had to say but the cabin okay so I never came down one way or the other and Kevin ...\nI I Know I I I'll ... I'll finish I'll finish\nMy statement and you can respond I never came down one way or the other and the Kevin\nOkay is what I said was that the evidence was presented credibly enough where the story was present incredibly though by the witness I'm professor Ford that I thought it warranted a thoroughly\n... I didn't think that the I don't think the investigation that was offered to us through enough but I never I never suggested that ah that Kevin uh-huh did these things I left that isn't open issue for me so I ... you know ... you know feel it here at the way you want to but that's the way I was in the hallway\nAnd ... and ... and what's interesting if you want to compare the two cases the idea now that this this police report is out um is part of the you know it's it's it's diligence on the part of the media unfortunately the media is not been able to do the kind of diligence that the FBI would be able to do seems to me\nUm because the police report is equivalent to an FBI report\nSo thanks for the comparison Murray thank you for three eight zero toll free one eight hundred three to one of the bureau Andrew in Providence you on the Daniel show below\nThat thank you for letting me on\nUm my point today is pretty simple but I feel very passionate about it\nAnd that I think for a decade now a local and national level and picking our\nElected officials from the wrong stock of men and women and\nAnd the governor's race now\nMy you in a long time committed critic\nOf though so I'm looking at what are the are the options that up and on the fence as you said when this incident is a ... that's a recording of against the den\nOf shrill oh a hating Nick Matty yellow as a kid had been like dropping an Advil on the scale and arm all in court Carlo and I want to talk about why quickly please so\nThis idea of picking lead us from the raw stock of people for me it has been up out somewhere along the lines there was a shift you know started during her former state performer and this is what our politicians are\nAnd we're calling these people eaters but it's it's become like common knowledge that you are the most everyone that they don't really mean what they say and the other thing or are there are\nOther agenda\nInstead of the people that are really committed to sacrifice their own personal a private sector alive and aiding in a government and process system\nThen leaving it and not what I see in trouble in this incident is\nIf my Thirteen year old daughter was home alone in some neighborhoods teenage boys were banging on the front door\nI Would eat great oh I Would you get it to my neighbor who comes running all over the coming there had to tell them to get away from the house\nNow well that's the that's version one of the story version to the story doesn't refer to that\nSo what origin to excuse me version to is the police report how did you just tune in I mean the the version to the police report that we've been reading all day long that that is where it has to know that in the matter yellow was an addict all ratty out all that stuff\nThat was that the that was a part of the reference yes yes\nBut this ... this story after story Andrew Andrew please go ahead yeah this part of the story\nThe story drillers doesn't differentiate between the stories so his memory doesn't tell I asked him was there a story about the young lady and the kids and then there's another story about you know you know running out while they were playing football\nDo you remember he's like I Can't he can't differentiate between the story so somehow\nOh could somehow in the police reports there's absolutely no reference to his gallant reported gallon effort to relieve that Thirteen year old girl of the stress of the kids trying to bank down her door\nSo that so okay so just a minute just pointing it out that although that is Joe Joe was version\nIt doesn't appear in the report said the same time you're ... version that he pled no low isn't actually even true either it's even better for him he's not guilty or as so this is a forty year old neighborhood thing going on\nIt is clear that there was contact between ... and met a yellow of some kind\nThe police reports delineate\nClocking gun hitting three times according to witness statements ... like yeah I don't know the police reports indicate it you've got to talking to him or when they respond to whatever the sentiment is this is forty year old can versions of memory of troll oh we don't have met a yellow on the record about it at all\nWe don't have the young girl we don't have a I don't I don't know if Mr medical seniors is still alive the rest of the movies not I mean he's forty years ago\nI don't know I'm I assume those next parents are alive you've got you've got all\nOf this so give me your summary in ... 'cause I I I just want everybody they know the truth about what what the facts are out there\nWell I appreciate that also because I was clearly totally charmed by the narrative that I recited for that\nAnd that may have occurred it may have a daughter\nThat's ... I Would feel indebted to mind they now even if it's something as more simple and I would call common place perhaps for that or maybe not doubt about it takes a village\nIf some of the neighborhood kids misbehave I don't think you need to either hiring to reprimand them\nAnd I don't think that a Thirteen year old or young adolescent a child but also an able bodied young man\nI don't think that that person can't take a slacker costs the head about learning manners if they were acting out of line disturbing the neighbor but I'm weighing this yeah this really truly tragic story about following\nA meeting of vehicular manslaughter\nAnd they're not even on the theme praying\nWhile again he didn't he didn't commit a vehicular manslaughter because ... because he's not convicted of such there was no indictment he admits to driving a vehicle that hit a man who died because of it but that's not a commitment of vehicular manslaughter\nOkay it's important that we used definitions\nI absolutely agree I when I that that I feel pretty confident that\nIt happened and all of them will be all accident\nAnd it resulted in the debt considering that man's or not it's not murder\nWell one of the matter is that somehow that case ended up going through the system without any any formal um we're no conviction ... well no indictment either a there was an initial charge and no indictment uh well I mean\nSomeone resulting in desperate sounds like you don't want to receive the big favor or to get lost someone uh\nWell uh but that's that's that's for people to determine on their own and that's what you know you'll ... you'll have to figure out as you know it was fun as a candidate for governor whether he should go the extra mile an asked for that documentation to be on shield\nIf he doesn't he doesn't end you'll determine whether that's good enough Andrew thank you as a lengthy conversation or thought Rhode Island is formally west bay orthopedic south county orthopedics in foundry orthopedics\nNow I'm telling you that because there were so many happy patients or west base ... counting the foundry you'll be even happier knowing that all those places have now combined to form or so or rye\nOr the ... or so Rhode Island provide patients for the full range of for the treatments it's a it's a really really fancy fancy operation right so they got the doctors they've got the surgeons they've got the therapist they've got uh the whole team they take care of the U.
