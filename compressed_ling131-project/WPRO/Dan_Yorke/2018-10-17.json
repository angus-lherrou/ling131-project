F yesterday I mentioned that you know not all bad and the Gina Raimondo camp showed how based they are a because the Gina Raimondo camp\nIs is is is\nJust this inclined to to swim in the pond scum as anybody else so\nThat let me get a chance but uh\nI I was just wondering it's really funny depending on the show and depending on the ebb and flow in the news cycle and all of this ... you started talking about a sanctuary city in the phones go nuts for three dirty PR real but what's really interesting about you meaning this audience is that I\nI I I get a sense that that and I'm not trying to distinguish you from any other show listening 'cause a lot of you listen to all the shows here in this great for us like I always found a general sense of applying you're you're you're thinking process to this a little bit more than just screaming about it\nIt becomes a very emotional issue\nSo I Would love to see if I can get anybody to react to how difficult it is to try to evaluate this issue when you've got to police departments both operating in the same way\nOne may have signed the document but the other is no different they're both operating in the same manner\nOne mayor is saying we are sanctuary\nAnd another mayor saying we are not sanctuary\nNow I don't know if that's a code that can be attributed during the the debate the other night the bro Joe debate the public radio to bet you are right but often times Allen fungus talked about this because he\nHe you certainly within primary politics within the Republican Party politics he has you know he has felt the need to stand up and say that Cranston is you know kind of like a zero tolerance on illegal immigration thing\nUm\nThat role was he said at the debate will get a ... he was reacting ... arguing about this community policing thing which troll doesn't think is good and which feeds into you know being more sanctuary like I don't know what\nThe hell and Mr funk you said that you want to prevent Rhode Island from being a sanctuary state practically in policy turned how would you as a governor do that\nFirst and foremost I'm the only one on this day is a sign that order\nWith okay so is that the tapes that probably would park or the the reporter asking about as governor the disposition of the state on this and you don't see ... arguing it\nRight so the question is you don't want this place to become a century state right and he's he's digging into that moment of yes so he's not arguing that point just want to make that clear to everybody could roll it\nFirst and foremost I'm the only one on is this a sign that order with a form of justice for the credit squeeze will cooperate when they have a criminal criminal isn't there a detention that's illegal\nNow that she engineered policy let me just finish that's a good question as to change things in between what the governor say\nAnd even with the ... because they certainly doesn't understand what community policing by his below his standing in the back where it really is the is the bottom line is the bottom and when we did that yesterday and all ... or ...\nWith the fall so he knows what I mean if we think the bottom line is that the governor's Raul about uh let's see what was the prime example is what happened with Mrs vaudeville than a convicted wrote viola who is in the yard for a couple of years serving a sentence who was in a week\nFor the letter and ended up meeting more crimes contributing back into that over your prices that we have in our state\nI Would order the state police and signed that agreement with the department of justice because it also support for federal funds that comes down to what's going to stay with the old I'm innocent powers and police departments as well\nSo that's how we're going to do what we're I'm also going to do incentivize cities and towns to move away from the states where cities and towns because that's not right if they're not going to cooperate and throw in the middle finger at federal funds well then they're probably operating with no money there on the state level we're not going to be able to give them any additional okay\nOr should I think you're getting a ... it's very hard to follow\nHow this fits in two definitions\nAnd you know funding has been is is become pretty adept at kind of mixing concepts and trying to say no I Am\nThat way well ... well the way that you're wondering if I Am okay will you running a sanctuary city in ... no of course not you want a century or state or they don't know\nYet and so you're doing what the difference in the city of Providence he ... he he would just keep talking circles 'cause he's not doing anything differently in Princeton\nAnd the joint problems at the same time we have the governor's reaction to that as well or off that list just so we're talking statewide you know sanctuary is this a you know she makes an interesting point about that specific case\nAnd whether or not ice was at the ready now did the state police call ice with the state police what role the state police have on the guys get at getting out of jail\nThat's the guy\nMost of the time we are looking at seizing the moment in deporting
