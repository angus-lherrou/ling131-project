jump off that point a little bit\nWhen you call up the Social Security administration office they really are great people they really are a ton of knowledge that they help yeah but they have to answer and yes or no that's tie and your hands or handcuff and you have your thinking so when when a consumer or a baby boomer or somebody calls that says\nHey can I take it yes should I take it I Can't I Can't answer that yeah yeah so you got a call someone that actually does know what's going on you needed income planner not just the financial planner but you need a financial income planner you need that that's a really important distinction I'm Glad you\nBrought that up you know it in the financial income planner\nThat planners going to be putting together a tax plan for you oh ... that's that's Ninety percent of an income planned in my opinion or just because it's the simple fact that you have to have the if you don't have the plan for the taxes that you're going to be paying whether they're high or low you you're never going to be able to get 'em any lower than they are\nYeah and the income plant in the tax plan is a component of it when you're sitting with your income planner and they should be able to talk to you about Social Security in terms that you understand like\nYour full retirement age do they actually know what your real flipped for retirement ages because depending on what year you're born it can be somewhere between age sixty six in age sixty seven and that can make a difference depending on when you actually want to trigger Europe for one hundred percent benefit so you've got to make sure they have that information as well\nYeah when we're thinking about this I think we've got taken one step further\nIn income plant or is not just thinking about taxes\nAnd income they're also thinking about legacy where's this money going to go after I die what's going to happen after this right how's it what is the chain of command does it go from husband or wife to children does it go from wife to charity to children where does it go how\nHow many miles do we have to feed off of this one income that is an important process to think through that's that is in the Social Security conversation\nYou're right absolutely amazing now we have to get this on the table if you want a written income plan you need a retirement income report\nCalls for old one Seventy seven to seven to seven\nNow we're giving away the enemy's yeah let's give away the head of these ten of these are going out the door today we are giving away retirement income reports today you need one if you're going to retire there are American Made their handmade right here in east Providence give us a\nCall four oh one Seventy seven to seven to seven\nNow remember so security is not designed to carry a full load it's only supposed to carry thirty five percent of your total income your rights Ashley crazy to me\nIf I Know well it's it's designed to line up with pensions IRAs other assets that you have for retirement you know your personal stuff your collection whatever it may be so how do you figure out your tax bracket off that that's where everybody is shaking their fists right all\nRight I'll tell you about well although all those are\nConsidered income writer if it's an IRA and and anything that's taxable in in a retirement plan is considered for your income that fit in that yeah it gets into the tax bragging exactly that was also in your hand at oh no that's right that's right if you cross over a threshold\nOf thirty four thousand for a married couple\nFifty percent of your Social Security that you've received now becomes taxable doesn't mean it's taxed at fifty percent so and then if you cross over another threshold at forty four thousand actually eighty five percent of your whole Social Security received in that year now becomes\nTaxable yeah so there's two tax right when you don't have a Social Security let's unpack this little bit right so there's two tax brackets and if your income and that Social Security that's that's ten Ninety nine cents a W. twos that is actual working income of any kind that's right and then that adds to it and it could be two tiered system\nYes it is a two tier system you know if you go over the first one it does and as soon as we mean you're going to a certain ones but if you're not careful you definitely don't do any planning you're going to have the right never going to throw you over\nThe ... one of the fact that we're all talking about taxes and tax planning but when I hear someone talking about long their taxes or how do they pay for their taxes or you know where does it fit when I hear as income or at least that's how it was with you know villain donor when they sat down with me last week\nAnd they kept saying things like what do I do about our taxes am I going to be able to pay them is this going to hurt my Social Security is my Social Security and going to be taxable\nAnd at that point it

available to accomplish them doing Don I could see the path of their retirement they couldn't wait for the next meeting to see how everything fit together so they could enjoy their lives and not worry

retirement factored rocky Euclid funny services New England go to retirement experts we're broadcasting really you could vote stayed east Providence we have the entire team here we have Jason the Republican votes manning uh money man ... high regarding and I'm Josh Wells getting you to and\nThrough your entire retirement to show is amazing we're talking about Social Security we're talking about how your Social Security affects your retirement plan and how do you actually affect your Social Security it's an amazing concept I'm going to blow your mind grab your you know pets Turner's radio up\nLet's talk about Social Security let's get everybody under control when I take it how to take it how sick it again and again and again no you only get one so you can only take it when it's your turn but remember your spouse or benefits your benefits and all their retirement benefits are only a portion of your income\nYou have two different times in your life to choose if you can either take a pre retirement before sixty six or after you take for retirement\nIt's so if you know when we took a commercial break we were talking about how taking early retirement affected you and we have to really go back into that I think\nYeah Josh you actually just kind of late where my mind was go and just before you said you only get to pick Social Security once you only get one time to turn it on and the one thing that I see is a big pitfall is that people say I'm going to turn it on sixty two because well I Want to get every single dollar out of Social Security that I can get\nBut as soon as I hear that I literally creates because once you turn it on this no going back and it can create a lot more issues down the road if you're not sure why it fits aware fits like for example we were talking during the break them up Bob\nHe was talking to me after one of our Social Security events and he looked at me he goes hey man I Want to turn on my Social Security sixty two\nBut I don't know if it's a good idea and as we were talking about well why is that do you need the income well no I've got a pension from oil company but I'm eligible to take it now and I feel like I should just turn it on now\nAnd I was like robots if you don't need the income now let's take a look at all the recounts let's just make sure that your Social Security doesn't do more harm than good\nAnd as we went through a discovery meeting not only did he have a pension that he was collecting all of his retirement accounts were in IRAs so turning Social Security on at sixty two would have been the worst decision for his Social Security would have been eighty five percent taxable pushing his entire family to a higher tax bracket that he could have never gotten out\nAfter we went through his retirement income report it became crystal clear the best age for him was the turn Social Security on at sixty eight\nIt was amazing to see Bob understand our Social Security ... into his entire retirement strategy but the only way he was able to see it was my sitting down with me here at the office and going over his retirement income report this report lays out the most optimal time to take your Social Security benefit\nSo if you want a written income plan you've got to call you could financial services here for one\nSeven to seven to seven to seven\nRemember you only get to retire wants some calls now for one\nSeventy seven to seven to seven\nI Love that you have Bob\nI didn't know about that story it's absolutely amazing 'cause Bob if he would have triggered all those IRAs and his income from his employer and everything [noise] holy cow buddy you talk and that's a that's a tax burden that's a bomb you can't turn back off her hair done deal it's oh it's a done deal and it was absolutely definitely this whole right now and he had\nHis he had a permanent income stream coming in and to a higher now hard at you know turning out that sets the minimum income level now are out there should be listening to this and the thing was is his goal his mind was I'm going to never take the IRA money until I have\nTo thinking he's never gonna have to touch it but even realize his armies at age Seventy one if he had that anti Social Security on and had spent any money yet he would've jumped up easily to tax ... oh yeah\nAnd never been able to get out of it and it would have severely impacted his life he would have had more money coming in but I had left to actually spend because\nOut of and in fact that his entire family tire family income\nThat's right he ... his neck would have been yeah the law so income that have been would have been crushed to oh yeah you know as talking with Bob here you know I think we're talking about pitfalls they don't think about the actual income itself they're talking about missing the pitfall of actually maximizing and when people say that they believe that it's\nOh we'll just wait to turn Social Security on age Seventy so it's really not it's it's really how can you minimize the taxes on your own you know we're sweet spot on your tax ... and that\nAnd yeah the taxes change but they don't change but every ten years so we know what it's gonna be next year the year after year after year after so it'll be very close [laughter] that's what I'm saying even if Trump the changes that right if a President Trump changes the taxes it's not going to change the calculation in which we are talking about the threat as well that's absolutely\nWe have the entire team here Jason the Republican I Would do it folks man in modern matter as senators I everybody and I'm Josh well is getting you to and through your entire retirement today's show is amazing\nWe're talking about Social Security we're talking about how Social Security affects your retirement and how you affect Social Security we are making sure that everybody's\nMaking good wise and proper decisions when it comes down to choosing their retirement and who to deal with it now grab your you know bad turn this radio up let's talk about Social Security let's talk about how to make sure we are doing the right thing at the right time and what works for you and your family\nNow before we took a break we were talking about\nA advisors and credentials and certifications matter Oh absolutely yeah and I was saying that Jason\nYou're a an essay certified in so many on how to sew security and that it's a um it's a designation for Social Security um acknowledgement and makes you said that you were there and that you were at the top of your field\nNow during the break why we're actually our commercial break Jason you were telling me a story about correct can you can you share that with us to just just tell us about that one 'cause that was at her\nI mean I I Know what's going to be a fly here but it's a it's actually really a good story\nSo well you know you're my friend ... came in about a year ago you know and he had an a financial advisor he liked you reached out to me because she was nervous his financial advisor didn't understand how Social Security worked\nAnd he felt he was getting some bad advice so I asked credit to come in sit down let's talk about it over some coffee and just to check you know and before Crick had come in to see us his financial advisor who told him he should trigger Social Security when he turned sixty two and collected while he's still worked\nYou know so I asked him what his plans were for work we talked about how we really enjoyed his job and what he thought working till sixty six is what he really wanted to do\nAs we talked about the consequences of taking your Social Security early the different penalties the caps and all the problems that could cause a down the road for him\nAfter hearing all this correct stop dead in his tracks that he looked at me with confusion and said why would I take it early and not wait until I was ready to retire you know he went on to say his financial advisor never told them anything about his Social Security in actually how it worked\nSo you know ... you can financial services and we have a Social Security plan for him he's now going to take it at sixty six you know and I just saw a correct the other day and he couldn't be happier so you know if you need Social Security retirement planning help\nI Want you to give us a call here today you quit financial services you know Craig I'm sure glad he did and it's for all one Seventy seven to seven to seven again that's for one Seventy seven to seven to seven\nYeah Jay I Love that for about ... I remember when he was down with him you went through the the retirement income report with him at\nPoint blank showed him exactly how much he was going to save my taking your Social Security at sixty six verse taking it sixty two\nMore importantly it also showed them how the rest of his accounts lined up to it how the three rules of money we're actually the biggest component of making his decision with his Social Security he knew exactly where is his bank accounts were supposed to be where he was after offers day to day income\nHe knew where his income was going to come in from Social Security and his four one K. and the small mentioned that he had\nIt it was amazing I I that's one of my favorite stories there\nYeah let's get away to more of these uh retirement income reports not just a Social Security but all of his income it's an amazing report you have to have a\nRetirement income report is what you're going to ask for it focuses on Social Security it focuses on whatever your income process needs to be so give us a call for a one\nSeven to seven to seven to seven once again that's four oh one seven to seven to seven to ...\nYou know what I Love about that report is the fact that it actually shows you how to maximize your income so that actually winds up to the goals you have in retirement because remember this is all about you it doesn't matter what we think it matters what are you trying to accomplish\nAnd does the components and tools that counts you already own line up to that and if it doesn't\nHow do you make it work so that you can have enough income and not over paying taxes and you have that weird bird\nYou know we we all know the guy down the street who's always complaining about kids get off my lawn or why if some if a car's right up government's taking my paycheck no it's because you\nNot lined up and it's it's just understanding where's your money coming from and how does it work and it's an absolutely amazing thing\nYou know in in ... well Manny with that report what it also does it points out where the pitfalls food and will happen if you're not careful you don't have the proper plan put together\nYou know is it gonna you know where you're going to fall into it a tax bomb that we talk about we've talked about that I don't know the shows you know or is it going to be that you're just going to run out of money it shows you hold those types of scenarios\nAnd with that you can actually put together and have a plan that you confident about in understand how Social Security and your other incomes work and how it's going to last year entire retirement yeah some of the ah some of the things I Want to jump off here is a pitfalls\nI Want to go back to pitfalls so when we're talking about pitfalls about Social Security\nSome people don't realize that Social Security is calculating the last thirty five years not your entire lifetime thirty five years so it they and they wait differently that's right so when it's weighed a the the latter years the the older years\nYour last year's in your career or wait heavier\nThan say your original paper route and and I love when people say well I have a financial

really terrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we're gonna have to say we're going to get to the bottom of it and then we'll be severe punishment\nAmerican pastor Andrew Brunson is back in the U.S after being released by turkey correspondent then we'd have been reports the Trump Administration wrapped up the pressure\nThey froze the aspects of the interior and justice ministers because the United states felt that they were connected to the trial of pastor Brunson and then they also imposed tariffs on exports Turkish steel and aluminum\nAnd the to me this is a total turn off I Would I Would want to hear from this woman who's running\nAnd the whole idea of men are a threat to our reproductive rights\nAnd it they name you represented you Russo is just one of many men that want to hold us down\nI mean this is this is going too far and beyond ridiculous now so I just wanted to make him you know to make a statement that if she doesn't have the guts to come on the air and and defend whoever wrote you know would not defend who I've read it but defend herself against whoever wrote it on her behalf\nI mean this this letter is talking about getting her support and donating to her and getting behind her so if she doesn't want it she should come forward and say\nWell because it she's on the radio Tyra by you know everything I have an ear about her is all scripted so like that ... that intro that you were doing that was a scripted thing on her Facebook that it's all scripted but maybe she just is not good on her feet I don't know that you know\nYou can't run legislation by press releases new releases and scripted things sometimes you do have to stand up and just speak without a script and maybe she's not comfortable doing that well maybe she has things to hide I have no idea\nWhat are your constituents neighbor saying represented gee Russo I mean I don't see how this could ever ever work in her favor so someone is out there thinking they're doing or a fever and I think it's gonna backfire but what are your you know the people surrounding you saying\nWell believe it or not the most upset among among my constituents are women yeah I'm a because you know they I mean first of all that letter attack every man and that every woman ... values or permit whether it's her husband was on her father\nAnd and then by the way happy Columbus Day also insults everybody who happens to be Italian American because they you know one little adjective changed everything if they had said Italian child I Would have been it would have been really nice but you're throwing a notch like sleazy and it changes everything so\nThey throw that in there by the way we also have some some people that live in these ... names do end of our just like mine though\nHow yeah I don't know where that comes from someone inside and it's almost demented this letter to be honest with you or you know\nTalking about who your friends are and ah trying to link you to something that happened up at the state house I mean the bottom line is um\nThis whole idea of the ... movement needs women like you consider volunteering I mean there's someone out there that I don't I Hope this isn't a group of people I Hope it's maybe one person that thinks they're doing testing Caldwell a fever and I and I certainly don't think they are I Would be with him and who are highly offended don't let me in with you ...\nYou know my my mother always said that you are who you hang out with but if you if you rented out what somebody who limped eventually you're going to limp fields there's the dollar and a and that's a that was her metaphor for but you know choose your friends wisely\nUm and she is still out there so by some people that like yesterday I actually wasn't I didn't reply to emails yes but I didn't even looked at them because they said you know what\nThis campaign mode we've got a month ago and I was out there campaigning speakers of the people of all of my district\nAnd I cover a good part of ...\nAnd and um and but then some people were taking screen shots of some tweets that were going out with some of her friends one of them was actually one that ran unsuccessfully for the state Senate\nOr nearby Dale Johnson or Lincoln wherever that district there's and the files stuff that came out of her mouth like I said aren't they supposed to screen these things from Twitter I mean brought a bomb like they were going out of style but then there's pictures of just being cold well and this woman\nThough you know eventually\nEventually the truth will come out as I said it may not be her but those are her words and she started that whole attack mode back in January when um when when one of the state reps\n... me too and then all of a sudden they have to react in a you know to make it look like it was the right thing to do politically to have a a sex or harassment training at the state house\nThat was three by any means so when she said well he was offering you know if you give me sexual favors I'll get you bills passed and she didn't named the person who sent it allegedly a and then yeah then you then you were all told to ah well let's have some sexual harassment classes is that what you're talking about yeah\nExactly so that so what happened there is I I did that night because I said you know I'm a I'm a professional I have I have my own business have lots of employees and most of them are women and I am very sensitive for that we've had training in my business and we have things posted all over the place that we've never had not even one\nIota of a problem with with management staff stuff was baffled vice versa and and I took offense that someone in leadership is is saying you pass your bills are new to this that the other and yet you don't mention who it is\nFirst of all I have a problem with that because there were Fifteen year old girl was running around in that building and I want to know we have a good lawyer in that room I Want to know who would it and she never even mentioned whether it's a former all of a former rap or current left\nSo I had a major problem with that and then for them to put on this and
