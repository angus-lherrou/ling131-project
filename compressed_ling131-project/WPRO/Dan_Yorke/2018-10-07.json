{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WPRO", "content": "If you call and ask specifically for the family organizer\nHim give us your your name and address and contact info and we will send that out too hard copy free of charge\nJak these are all such great tips and strategies where do we go from here\nWell you know if we're if we're looking at trying to get organized in case you pass away\nThere's other things that you should consider not many people think that life insurance has for younger people\nThat have a mortgage there are so raising their kids and that is an absolute correct way to think about it but it doesn't mean that as you get older there's no good uses for life insurance so whether you're in the fifties sixties even Seventy some older\nWe have put insurance is in place for people to really to leverage what they can pass on to their family so there's two two things that you want to look at uh you want to take care of your spouse number one and if it's important to you to\nPass on the legacy to your children\nI've trademark something called the IRA leverage legacy plant\nAnd that is discussed in my book if you happen to go to Amazon dot com or mass and money dot com and click on the the book button it'll bring you the Amazon and you can purchase that book and it fully explains what that irate LeBron's legacy plan is and it is so effective for passing on\nMoney from you to your children\nThat's income tax free and it's a wonderful plan and it has so many other benefits that you can pull into that as well it's such an important thing to look at\nSo if you care about somebody heavy life insurance provide some some dollars so if you want to have a plan on yourself so that your spouse has more money to live on in their last years that's a great a perfect place for life insurance\nAlso if you were to have taken a retirement or a pension plan\nAnd let's say that like many people think that sixty five years ago and thankfully I haven't seen this in a quite a while back but years ago I met with so many people that were Seventy five years of age and they were their pension was ending and I'm like what is going on why why is this happening\nWell these folks these guys primarily said you know what I was sixty five I could barely get out of bed in the morning I fried there was no way I Would live past Seventy five and here I Am I'm healthy as a horse and my pension has ended because I took more money for just ten years instead of doing a lifetime guarantee\nSo if you took what's called the life only pension and you have a spouse then you should consider having insurance in place that will replace that loss of income that your spouse will have to deal with if you pass away and your pension goes away with you\nAnother key areas that we look at to make sure that the spouse if if one passes at the surviving spouse has what they need to live a you know a nice life for their final years as well\nGet conscious about the importance of naming beneficiaries\nYou know this is a topic that I talked about every time I get a a group of people together whether it's a public seminar a client event I always talk about this because it's something that people tend to overlook\nUm but naming beneficiaries you know this is part of the whole decision tree that you go through as to who will get what\nYou know who gets us again it's that account or all the accounts going to be split evenly you know after you pass away your name them on insurance policies annuity policies retirement accounts et cetera\nThey also will supersede what you see what you're putting your last will and testament so simple example let's say you have four children and you say in your will my kids split everything equally but uh let's say on you\nOr a let's say you have an annuity that's going to have some cash when you pass away but\nYou only put one of your kids' names on data nobody for whatever reason\nThey get it it doesn't matter that the wolf says it should be split equally among saw for children so the beneficiary designation will always take precedence over the last will and testament as my attorney or when he's talking to her clients he says look the will speak slashed\nAnd the will only handles assets in one person's name\nThat does not have a beneficiary listed and that's what has to go through probation court and deal with all the delays and potential pitfalls with dealing with probing that's why we suggest you named beneficiaries on everything and it's so important to look at your bank accounts because those seem to be the most overlooked\nSo with the savings accounts checking accounts CDs make sure that you've got beneficiary designations on all of those now we're getting some feedback that there was some financial institutions out there that limit you to one beneficiary on an account\nAnd you know in today's world the of supercomputers in software\nI ... a boggles my mind that they're restricting people's beneficiaries like that but just just know whether your financial institution limits it or not as an act accordingly so you may want to have you have four kids who might want to have four counts and have one go each of them you know it's very cumbersome to do that or\nYou know maybe change institutions that's always an option as well the one that's a little more flexible with what's going on so checking beneficiaries is always part of our conversation with the folks that we meet with\nOr whether you become a climate that we will always say look check your beneficiary designations it's worth the few minutes of it takes to find out what you've got\nIn and how it's structured and then fixing it appropriately now I remember when I set up my trust in my forties I mean it it's a big thing to sit there and sorry if something happened to me what do I want to have happened to my assets\nIt's weird to do that I get you know I I Do I'm going through it but once it was done I have to tell you that I just felt kind of relieved that it was all laid out\nNow as I say this I'm like I maybe it's time for me to relocate in mind too because it's it's been a while since I've done that\nI Would suggest that you look at that at least every five years or so or anytime that there's a major a family event if there's a birth if there's a death if there's a divorce except for\nThen you may want to re look at your plan to see if everything is still appropriate the way that you have to stop if not we'll take some action our number here is for one three three three eight thousand or we

E. W. I. C. O. R. C. R. A. N. dot com or they just give me a call okay five await for for three one three three two\nOkay so that's you know that's a great way because again\nPreparing your house for sale the first thing you have to do is you make that decision you made the commitment look we've got we're going to sell this house and get something bigger like we're doing in my family or we're going to be getting something smaller like a lot of\nOther folks are doing well maybe you need to go you're a little bit older and you want to start planning ahead and you want to get a single levels home maybe you're living in a multi level home now and you want to uh prepare yourself to age in place\nThese are the types of things you need to do you need to you of course you want to maximize the value from your transaction and a great way to do that is one\nDo things to make it more attractive for to a prospective buyer by declaring and staging a has appropriately\nAnd then also if there are things in your house that you may not want or be able to take with you maybe they have some value so you know then you're going to go to you know if you give Kevin a call and get an opinion on what something is worth and you know what you can do to um you know turned into cash money\n'cause there there is like two different ways in which we can help consumers like liquidate their homes obviously if you have fine arts in antiques and we have sales at a set up to do the higher end antiques and fine arts but we also have the what we call a discovered cell which we are where we get rid of a lot of home accumulation which is just from the washing machine right down to ...\nYou know you have some great old copper pans they might not be worth a lot of money but people still like them so lose that have been in a very important spot where if you're going to sell a home\nPeople don't decorate with those old China closets just filled with old China or any more it's very important that he goes in there and removes those or has a company like mind go in there and sell them off of the for the client they'll get the money because his clients and not looking for a house cluttered with\nBig entertainment centers and China cabinets loaded with old China in ... they have to be more neutral and more modernized the fire today is looking for houses that are much more modern inside or even seeing a lot of the old decide homes and when they're being bought up\nTo the developers of going in there removing a lot of old ... making a lot of ... around in doorways and changing things up quite a bit so so the value of working\nBoth ends of the coin you want to really get into ... de clutter made out of house with a really great for sale but you also want to maximize on that stuff because there is still value behind just about everything in those old homes\nYeah and that and that's the thing too because a lot of times I Know [noise] you know in my family there'll be things that you see it every day and you walk by that you know that curio cabinet or that you know what that\n... or whatever and maybe you don't realize that it actually has value now in all likelihood if not thousands of dollars but cheapest if you have something that is just a vase and it's worth a few hundred bucks and you got four or five of those things in your whole house that adds up after a while [noise]\nSo we had a ... it's important\nWhen you're going into the whole transaction process that you have information you the consumer and be aware of what is out there and what opportunities there are for you to maximize value and now as a realtor typically when I talk about maximizing value it's helping to buy or sell her\nEither pay as little as possible or sell it to get as much as possible with the best terms for their home but there are other ways to get value to and you know working with Kevin ... you can really help\nI can help my clients maximize their value and if you look back at the consumer are a lot to be proactive you can certainly reach out to them too because you don't have to wait for a realtor to give you a call and\nYou get now ... do you get most of ... do you get most of your referrals from realtors or from me you know direct from the consumer or is it ten even split or\nI get more from the real truth than I Do from the homeowners retinue get calls from homeowners yep [noise] um is there are very interested in maximizing devalue the home mhm get top dollar for it and of course they weren't in the south quickly yeah which is the whole purpose of the staging into photography\nNow Kevin when you when you have um\n[noise] let's say you have one of those old east side homes let's say the the owner passes away no there are no family members who want the furniture and other items in there and so you will go in and you will clean out the house you have a crew that will take get everything out of the house and it'll take it to your show or on your warehouse\nRestart rate from ground level we go through a discovery process to see where all the valuables all you want to find other things at a house that are really worth money things that are going to be in a higher and sells things like going to be marketable to people that they actually want after that we'll say after a couple of hundred dollars and down it kind of falls off to the where it's just\nFun stuff that people like to buy for it you know it does nothing important but you just household household things and that's a whole different\nKind of ball game of things to liquidate in a home and then you also have everyday junk that needs to be removed from my house prices kind of like three stages that happened when you actually working with a company like mine we're going to go and find your money mhm never going to liquidate the rest of\nThe things that we all live with them and then you have to get rid of the things that are not sellable or the piled up all day long\nAll blades and things in the garage and parts to this and whatever the tub to the washing machine so that's all things we can't sell\nInside imagine it's almost like an ex got like an excavation where you go and you find the most valuable stuff and it may be like out and you know visible readily readily visible and then you probably get the stuff that's like a little less valuable but maybe it doesn't have antique or collective valley but maybe there it's you know you get the\nAh that you know thrift shops that maybe those folks would want to be interested in buying that and then you get the stuff where you get\nTo scrap metal guys come in and take a lot more blades and in return them et cetera hundred\nPercent perfect guy it's kinda like three stages when you actually do and how she got to remember everybody's house is pretty much like that\nYep okay very very interesting and I now have you ever come across any hoarders\nAll the time yeah all the time I don't know any different degrees and good degrees ended bad degrees there's some people who horde really great stuff and buy more of it then you could ever imagine him as other people who\nDo you ever see those trees that have those big long beans that hang from them once in a house that had about a hundred trash bags filled with those old long dried out beans up in the ... what are you going to do it all them be among like [noise]\n... along with you know\nI did a house one signed a soda tax that when you walk on the path way she would scrape your head on the ceiling because they had piled on the floor about two feet of newspapers in the walkway that was only about a foot and a half wide\nSo they had the the bubble like popcorn ceiling yeah if you stood up straight you wipe off the popcorn ceiling with the top of your head [laughter]\nSo yeah this whole they are [laughter]\nI Know that she had already had every car they don't since the sixties still on his in his driveway on cinder blocks in every one was filled the room with\nLike old rappers from McDonalds burger chef every place you never heard of I still packed in the car and he drives his car today is still alive to drive a seat available the whole cause filled in and this is someone in Rhode Island I have pictures of it I can prove that show no he lives in Connecticut\nOh okay I don't want to see those pictures after the show is unbelievable yeah they're out there I Wonder if that someone carry knows from Connecticut [laughter]\nSo while that is amazing um yeah I've seen a lot of crazy or things like that and I've been in thousands of houses over the years and some especially during the banking crisis or the housing crisis went back so I went to all these\nHad someone come in and take all of their furniture and then they got rid of all the furniture and they just basically drove down to Florida and bought all new furniture not everybody can do that when they move but um you know that that is probably the least are the worst way that dinner to extract value from your home just to give up your furniture away\nYou know but um [noise] some of the other things I Want to go back to Kevin for a while and talk about other types of value that you find in homes I mean are there things um where you'll have like you'd mentioned like you know artists are artwork where something is attached to the home if it's like a beautiful you know if it's a [noise]\nArt it's like in late or in the house has their kids that's something like that can be extracted you ever do anything like that or\n[noise] it's funny we just had a a ... a ... and ... from the Eighteenth century that was in an east side homes garden\nAnd it had been there since uh the houses built up to was Nineteen oh five it was installed and it actually wasn't part of the house but it's part of all the all the all the yard work and get out of all all the beautiful you know walk away outside\nAnd uh yeah we actually sold it right in spots\nWhy advertising on our website ... doing what we do in our catalogs and then later the client was able to come up and just\nHire the bulldozer the hold out and take it out of there and move it out to the ground so yes things I also had another house one time that was a you know I'm\n... this was many years ago and it was a whole entire bathroom that was filled with bachelor tiles which are a very uh by make a ... a very expensive at the time to a two to three hundred thousand dollars a tile home I knew was literally\nYou know Fifteen hundred tiles that came out of that wow [laughter] yeah it was a lot of money that came out of the ... tiles alone\nHoly cow yeah you know it's interesting you hear stories\nIs that is a long story ... lawyer nine I only got half the bathroom because her son was kind of crack addict well as he was hammering them out trying to get them out one at a time destroyed how hot on and when he finally destroyed half the\nBathroom she came back from Florida and called us to finally do the rest of the bathroom right in while to get some money out of the bathroom yeah that that happens in in this world for lot\nBelieve yeah [noise] you know it's one of the things about living in New England there and the and in the north east we have a lot of old\nA lot of old homes and buildings and folks out west they want a lot of times the materials so I Know there was a matter of milk fire in a when socket several years ago\nAnd they had to knock down the building all of those bricks the owner of the building was able to sell those bricks to a build their somewhere out west and they they needed old bricks ... old ... worth more than ... right now two cents more than a New Britain\nWhere when you're talking about when it's fucking about a male building is five stories tall and a hundred thousand square feet per floor that's a lot of ... a lot of Brett that's a lot of bricks you know so and even though it burned down those those bricks still\nLook good so far into they sell the flying out of milk like having any architectural type stuff is still pretty hot in the world today now we cycle you know people have it on their mind so\nYeah so folks who are listening to our I living radio

P. R. O. I'm Joe Luca president of the Rhode Island association of realtors were two thousand Eighteen and I'm your hosts thank you\nFor tuning in and we are talking about ways to extract more value from your home\nOther than by pricing it one way or the other and Kevin Bruno has had some crazy amazing stories where he goes into house and he helps people\nGet more money for the belongings that are in the house and out folks that have elderly parents pay attention here\nBecause sometimes you know you go back to your parents' house and you find things in the house maybe that were yours from your when you were a child or or even older from you know when your parents were younger\nThose things those items could have value and it's not just the old one man's treasure is the only one man's trash is another man's treasure these are things that have real value\nAnd Kevin he off area just told me a story and I'm asking to share it again because it's just really amazing to tell us about that comic book out about\nIt's not uncommon just in general for anybody in the ages of forty to sixty years old who ever had will say superhero comics back thirty four years ago you probably have a small little\nOr is it up and ask if you kept them in pretty good shape because recently we had a restored seven point oh amazing fantasy Fifteen sell for cash we sold a cast for twenty four thousand dollars that was last year we did it mhm comics are on such a rise that book today if he can signed it back to me now would probably be do thirty to thirty five thousand [noise]\nAnd they remember people don't want brown wood furniture anymore they relate to it they relate to super heroes and things they see on TV the world of comic book superheroes that whole thing is huge today in Aspen since Nineteen thirty eight when Superman started to so many people that collect that stuff and have been since that time it's only getting hotter and hotter as we become more Internet\nYeah people that we are and now you have the people you said that that it was eight restored so if it were not restored if it were in like quote unquote original condition how would that have a fresh seven how\nAmazing fantasy of talking over a hundred thousand dollars for a non restore non restored ... Superman one just so not too long ago I took it was a a nine oh condition which is a great console for four point five million dollars\nAnd so when you say seven out of that seven out of\nTen seven out of ten is a whole rating a process and we do all that for the comic books a week with the CBC us but\nThere there's a whole grading process for comics that comics go through because once you have them graded they become a true collector's items okay like having a van Gogh print or whatever you might have been ... electric there as important as those type works were which have fallen out of flavor and now works\nYou know how they handle uncovers by the artist by the comic book they're selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars to the right holy ... that that's the hottest thing going today is a superhero comic book toy world that's what it is constantly on the solar\nMan I Wish I kept all of those comic books when I was a little boy I'm at the BBC the city's just to bring comic book over every week and I don't know who knows whether it was when\nMy dad had a variety store I used to get one of those every week to allow right and my brothers too and we never kept him\nYeah and that's why they're worth money though 'cause we never really kept them right yeah we've had him we went ... yeah ... right yeah or something else okay so so that's the amazing comic book story that we had and then I Know Kevin as another one about\nI'm Tiffany but we're going to come back to that later ... some an interesting story in your experience it's kind of that will make everyone go wow\nI'm not to put any pressure on you [laughter] the big the biggest thing\nUm in selling real estate is the photography yeah resin did a study a number of years ago actually not too far in in the back on the past um and did a study with the listings in Massachusetts MLS system as well as those things out on Long Island ... and they found that\nProperties that are shot with DSL ours you know professional photography equipment sell anywhere from as much as as little as nine hundred dollars to as much as a hundred and sixteen thousand dollars more\nThan property shot with point and shoot cameras or or your cell phone camera right and there was a big reason for that uh the professional photographers are using the lighting for the space um you'll find that if you use a safe points you camera the flash and or even a cell phone camera\nThe flash on those units are good for only about six to eight maybe ten feet max\nAnd a lot of the rooms are larger than that um you find that a lot of these rooms probably don't have enough lighting in them or just not sufficient lighting in them so I myself would bring in a flash or a number of flashes to help lighten up the space mhm\nAnd most important thing today is how your property looks on the Web online because more than Ninety percent of all home searches begin on line I'm On the Internet and that one little you know to buy to photograph that people see when they were cruising across our living dot com\nOr needs to really knock someone's socks off for them to click on it so they want to learn more about that house and of course using a professional photographer and having everything staged appropriately\nAs a great way to do that and Lou can certainly help you do that [noise] so ... what are some of the I guess the top three things that someone should think about it would be concerned about before putting their home on the markets ...\nThe first thing to think about is um ensure that you know the condition of the property is such that you know you don't need any repairs that you have any repairs that need to be done to make sure that you're done okay we want to clean the property to tip playing my that I don't mean pick up the cue tips on war\nI mean you want to get in all the nooks and crannies that you can think of it especially in the kitchen to the bathroom if buyers come in and they see dirt in the in the kitchen or bathroom they think the properties dirty no matter how clean or does she want to make sure it's cute to clean mhm uh you wanna do personalize it take the photos down take anything that\nSays you ... off the walls and out of the room because you're selling the space not yourself mhm and then of course you want to\nDo clutter ... as you want to maximize the space for the furniture for the room that its intended purpose and you don't want a lot of stuffed in that property fight that those three things alone will help you maximize the value of your house and and help you sell your house and the shortest amount of time possible\nRight and so I I Know some of the things that um you know art\nThings and make a house look cluttered and slap your books\nAnd magazines like those magazine racks you have on the side of the year in the living room where the family room and\nYou know you like to read the magazine to other people to get rid of that stuff and kids' toys you enjoy you know food dishes and water bowls right and you know not to say that we don't like kids because we do right but you have to get rid of the evidence\nRight at the same thing with pets because one of the first things I Do as a realtor when I Walk into a home with my by our clients is I I Breathe in and what do I smell\nThat tells me a lot about a house do I spell you know pet owners do I smelled cigarette smoke do I smell\nUm ... or anything I mean ... you know middle do things like that those are all different things that you could smell it's going to tell me a lot about the house ideally I shouldn't smell anything because if I smell or the ... and I'm Wondering what are they trying to cover up you know you want the place cleaned right\nWhat you describe as what we call ... ... yeah you live in your space you can smell the smells right out we can smell when we walk yeah\nYeah that's very true very true and Kevin what are they I guess three takeaways that someone would be ... you know they need to pay attention to when they're putting their house on the market are preparing to well\nFor us we're going to go in there and obviously help you find things so number one don't throw anything away and I always say if you're going to make a phone call to have somebody come in and see if you have anything valuable I don't think it's your job to make the house look straight by clean and get out first before we get in there for his Ninety nine percent of the time you throw away the value you threw away anything that was worth money\nBecause they're going to throw

Wilkinson we affectionately call her chameleon around here\nUm many of you know that she was on the show a lot I gave her a lot of air time because she had\nPromised to be a Second Amendment support or\nA she seemed like she was in our corner she actually did a couple of things that were good in Warwick to help with concealed carry permit to that\nWe're most appreciative but then once you got up to the general assembly was like things changed\nAnd I'm I'm not surprised because that's how politics works so she wanted to be and she is a Democrat I think she leans more progressive and if you want to be in the in crowd up there in Rhode Island as you know that's the way their politics works in the ... you got to get on that side if you want to get anything done and she was also\nOn the Judiciary Committee and that's a pretty nice position to have\nSo she just voted status quo and unfortunately it wasn't in favor of the second amendment ... a community most of the time and I was very taken aback by that and very surprised so shame on me\nBut you know you have to take people at face value some of the times and realize that you hope that they're being genuine genuine and and not taking you for a ride in just using\nAirtime to stroke you\nAnd apparently that is exactly\nWhat happened and it got thrown in my face a bunch of time so mayor culpa shame on me or what are they safe for me once shame on me for a huge fool me twice shame on me\nSo my Underwood is making a valiant effort to run against and I know we're kind of hidden behind the computer there it's tough at that thing is like static I Can't even move it so don't worry about it you can just talk I can see I can see your eyes and little scar above your nose where you've got hit with a rake yes [laughter] and bite it was like chameleon it with\nA scout master ran into each other on knocking on doors [laughter]\nUm and so I can still see you over there um you are running you you wonder if you won your primary which is good you are running as a Republican yes yes and district Twenty one in Warwick and we've got to get behind you because you're a Republican and you're a Second Amendment supporter\nI Am I've and hopefully not just for now right no not at all and then when you\nGet up there you are going to go with the with the speaker tells you because these is going to twist it [laughter]\nNo not at all and and my understanding is ... before the election was even over the last time she was already at the speakers headquarters cheering and rooting and everything and she has pretty much falling in line with the progressive right and vote while you're told ... won anything right\nAnd that that's that's so disheartening because I really thought\nWe had an ally up there but that's what happens and it happens more often than not so I'm always kinda I'm skeptical about having people on the show and letting them use this as their political forum and allowing them to get on the microphone and few their stuff\nBecause I even had Patricia Morgan on the show and I'm getting ... backlash from that that's like as a good journalist and an open minded one letter come on the show and speak her mind and that doesn't mean that I support her it just means that I wanted to hear what she had to say so now that she's totally turned our back\nOn the second amendment community and completely turned her back on the Republican\nYou know that's the way that it goes I mean how is this is nothing new this is the way that\nPolitics works not only in the state but all over the world this is the way politics work so\nI'm I'm going to cross my fingers and say ... I had my mother saying something for us to that or you know when you go up there that you told a line for us because this is what we need right now\nEspecially especially if if Gina gets in now hopefully Matty yellow will retain his speakership I Hope because he's always been an ally in the second amendment community so we'll see what happens with that but\nUm why should people elect you Mike Underwood\nI'm I'm an ordinary average guy I took this on because I couldn't sit and watch the TV and scream at the TV anymore I'm frustrated with the way the state's going uh we seem to have a spending problem uh we seem to have a a corruption problem um\nWe seem to have a lot of dishonesty in my opinion that that goes on up there and I I think that a lot of the progressive that have gotten and\nDon't understand what their approving or trying to pass or what they're voting on and and I don't think a lot of them had decent jobs where they even understand what they vote on and how that affects anybody\nI I think that that that is a key point that you just made about jobs you're a business owner I'm a small business owner yeah yeah and when you're a small business owner as as I Am as well you see the difficulties and you you you actually hands on day to day you're handling transactions are handling money are trying to balance things\nSometimes you don't know how to Rob Peter to pay Paul\nAnd it's very difficult and we don't have like unlimited resources where we can just go to the taxpayers and get bailed out every time um so I think that having that business background\nIs very beneficial now is this your first runner view held elected office before\nThis is my second run the first time I ran as an independent I felt I didn't really fit with either party at the time um I I kind of physically speaking we lean towards Republican and\nSocially I somewhat believe that we should help people that you know need help you know somebody elderly people or you know situations like that so last time I kind of felt that incident this time I really feel more towards the Republican than anything else so\nAre you getting any help from the Republican Party\nUh no I'm not getting any help from anyone except for myself I'm not the only one in that situation though\nHave you reached out to brand about\nI've reached out several times to 'em I Need people to walk around and I need money yeah so ... as a small business owner I with many hats on during the maintenance on to the quick meant I'm operating equipment on during the building of\nTaking the trash out taking this every day I I you know when the when the guys don't show up right where you're cranking up that lawnmower right yeah and you know when they don't show up that means a longer day for me so unfortunately in my time in on the on the streets\nI Can't go door knock as much as I Would really like to and actually meet all the all the constituents and all the voters have you started walking yet oh yeah I've been I've been walking since um\nOne was a on may last time I ...

complicated so we're going to talk about this executive summary\nUh of the working group for gun safety pursuant to governor ... does executive order February twenty six two thousand Eighteen where she forum this committee\nAnd it is a very partisan committee\nIt's supposed to be bipartisan but it's not there's not one representative from the gun community on that thirty three committee parents three forty three forty three forty three\nA committee panel I'm not one representative from the second amendment community and and so there are a couple of police officers there ah one of them is actually a chief men DACA from\nCentral Falls and I don't think he's a good representative out all considering that he's had been arrested for a couple of domestic violence charges had his gun stolen outside of a bar one time when he was in the bar drinking and it's going got stolen\nUm these types of people that are actually dictating the future of our gun laws here in Rhode Island\nAnd this executive summary was posted I guess it was in the Providence Journal on friday\nCame out on friday Thursday thirty mile than it was yeah yeah and we got a little heads up on it um site posted it on my Facebook page if you want to go on my Facebook page Daria Bruno Facebook page it's it's a open to the public you could read it for yourself\nAnd I mean I'm I'm actually not surprised at a lot of the things that are in there but we'll outlined some of them for your Richard have it out of\nIt isn't surprising on the\nWhole thing as a whitewashed for governor Raimondo if she gets re elected than she is going to use this as a springboard for legislative action\nShe's got people she's hired at least two people on staff at the state house who came from the Bloomberg organization so you know they're her policy advisor so they're involved in this as well and and none of this none of this is\nIs law or executive order anything like that this all would have to go before the general assembly right in in the form of\nTo be passed on by the general assembly but you know this is what they have in mind\nFor the upcoming session yeah so the one of the real big ones is\nTo make the Rhode Island attorney general the sole authority for issuing permits for and concealed carry permits and what they want to do is make you go to the AG to get a blue card to buy any firearm not only a hand gun belong gun as well\nAnd uh so the um does that now no that's not good enough they want to send it over to the agency\nAnd then um you know this this is a situation where if we have an aging like we had a few years ago gardening White House I think he's got a different job now and he came out and he said don't we're not issuing we're not going to issue concealed carry permits\nSo if you have the guy with this much power he basically he or she can simply turn them fight it and they say no more permissive camp without a blue card you can go down and by any kind of a gun and you certainly can't carry because I'm a good issue any\nIt right in the screaming problem with that is the way the statute as written eleven forty seven eight teams says that the attorney general may issuing whereas eleven forty seven eleven is shall issue and that's it at ... so that's local that you go to your town police for that\nUm and when you give that much power to one person then you really are putting yourself in a position where what what Reagan say the government that can give everything as a government that can take everything away and so\nIt becomes very a political it's very political at that point he might do as friends a couple of favors but as we know Sheldon Whitehouse said Sheldon Whitehouse sent a letter when he was attorney general\nTo all of the police chiefs and said no more even though it's a statutory law and they're supposed to issue he sent a letter out on his own and said no issuing I Want you to send if\nThey come for concealed carry permits to your town I Want you to send them all to me and what did he do he was like weren't on her showing and of course he did a couple of political favors for people that he ... come to me I'll hook I'll hook your daughter up with one of those yeah no problem\nBut the average guy you know who went into law abiding citizen has a completely on blemish criminal record is flawless\nPages tax is phases taxes votes he's a suitable person to be license um who's here legally exactly he can't get one up\nIs for loss of the firearms it is not for misuse of the firearm so\nFast well no it it can be for theft but for theft yes well in Lhasa theft but if that firearm is used by someone to injure kill another person like that that is what we're talking about is if you come back and say Brian ... or somebody\nGets you on the stands it's our follow suit and says\nYou didn't secure that firearm properly and therefore that's why my client got injured therefore you are responsible under the law and we're going to sue you for a million boxers do charts for that\nThat is if it gets stolen out of your house and it's used in a crime or or or yeah well there you know they're they're going to pull all of that anyway well that's\nNo matter this uh this is the recommendation kinds of things are looking for right they want to as far as mental health and Nick's reporting include reporting to nix determination of competency and probate guardian ships\nSo well most most states do report to nix we don't\nWell we report if someone is a Judy catered as mentally incompetent very very difficult to do\nBut for example one of one of the things they wanted to do at the federal level that got beaten back by the n._r._a. is a person who gets old has a elderly parents no longer can really handle their checkbook or something\nSo they make that person up of the power of attorney to sign their checks and keep that they want to report that to nix database as a person being incompetent\nWow there's so much more to we're going to continue this conversation that we're going to talk about the rest of that that's in there because it talks about face to face a transfers\nAnd there's a couple of other points that we want to touch on two in this uh executive summary of the working group for gun safety pursuant to Gina Raimondo San executive order which was signed February twenty six thousand Eighteen or again

and what this guy's even just been accused of\n\nNot that it's a great thing to do the thing if he was found you know if that was true that he didn't need to think not that great but the difference between him and like Bill Cosby what Bill Cosby was convicted of and evidently what are what are your Harvey Weinstein has been accused of others things he he's a big difference there\nBut the modern politics is what we do we just take one little thing we conflated with a bunch of other things we make one things stand for everything else and so therefore it's all one big pile of terror\n\nSo you know we got to step back and start to him you know understand it's a small example of it but I saw this today and I said you know listen to the audio and over and over and again and you know as far as Trump goes is it very presidential no is it something that he should even be kind of flippant about or be litigating\nBut I ... at a rally when we're in the midst of this and it's very delicate negotiations in a delicate process no\nWhen you have a I mean he's he's sitting there and they're at a rally where was he ... he's in Mississippi he's in Mississippi to uh you know obviously red meat crowd Heathrow in red meat to the crowd in Republican circles right now they find doctor for it to be completely um\nLudicrous in terms of\nHer ... her viability in in in veracity\nAnd I will tell you that's on top of that you know this whole Supreme Court nomination has become something of a um\nIt's it's a symbolic victory rather than an actual discussion about whether or not a person would make a good justice you know the idea of being a good justice or not is you know it's it's like second or third on the list\nNow you've created so that's one team versus another and losing is a is a shot and not in not like oh we lost this guy okay we got to find somebody else it's\nIf you lose\nThat's not the worst thing in the world the worst thing in the world that the other side would win and so it's become like this political Rorschach test you can make the cabinet appointment about whatever horrible thing you want it to be about\nWhether or not it's actually about that doesn't matter it's about whatever you want it to be about whatever your cause celebrities whatever your cause does your is whatever it is you're you're the thing that you're most upset about more angry about it can be whatever you want it to be\n\nBecause you know when somebody says words you can take those words and as long as they're loosely kind of created an loosely connected you could make them out to be whatever it is you want them to be\n\nJust read the story with Cory Booker was it yesterday afternoon talking about you know even ultimately I read the quotes is from the daily wire\nUltimately not whether he's innocent or guilty this is not a trials that Booker but ultimately have enough questions have been raised that we should not move on to another candidate\nThe people on the Supreme Court ah should preserve the integrity of the court and be beyond the report to these difficult partisan times he wants to get rid of the guy now and get a new candidate because there's too much stuff around it\n\nSo you know to me I'm sitting here and I'm watching this old it's it's it's really got into an absurd level everybody's got now I was reading the story of last night about the uh the FBI investigation that could wrap up at some point today supposedly\nUm and\nYou know they have it usually with this kind of things background investigation they give it to a junior agents who are just trying to learn how to get to learn the ropes and do the the proper um [noise] uh you know paperwork and things like that\nAnd so what's happening now is they get these guys and they're going out there to get to agents going out there usually be probably be like one now they got two agents the supervisor because you know God Forbid there going to be they're gonna be crucified no matter what comes out of this thing\nThe question of whether or not there should be made public as being out there or they'll say no it's going to go to the senator's only 'cause that's what they've always done but it'll be leaked in about three Thirteen seconds\nOr and everybody will be able to read it and of course it'll just be a bunch of this is what they said this is what was told to us this is the information we found will be no different than we were a week ago today or we could go friday and everyone's going to have to go ahead and decide what they think\nAnd the acrimony the um symbolic nature of the vote will then take its course people will make accusations about what a vote for does to this person does to the does says\nAbout the individual senator they'll they'll use it to deeply divide the people going into the mid term elections and ultimately one of those two parties will prevail or lose and you and me will be sitting here with the wreckage\nThe social political inter family inter societal wreckage where you know the idea that people walk and we have this some form of rape culture in the United states and that you know we put a rapist on the on the Supreme Court without any sort of consideration for evidence or anything like this\nIs going to be now commonly front about whether or not this reality whether or not it's it's real doesn't\nMatter reality does it matter\nIt's whatever perception they can hammer into your forehead about an individual about a party about a situation about a person\nWhat actually happened doesn't matter\nIn this case the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh has now become a an eight blocks north ... like everybody knows what it means\nYou don't you think everybody knows what Russia test is the name blood tests you know what do you see that it's like when you're a little kitten you standing lay there and the grounding look up at the sky you say oh that cloud looks like this that looks like that your kids still do that by the way probably not 'cause not a computer screen 'em they probably have an app for that\nBut you still laid out that we took a dog it was like a dinosaur oh really I think it looks like I don't know\nOh okay so that's pretty much with this has become it's the patriarchy rape culture that is what it is now though it's there's no evidence that as a matter of evidence doesn't matter\nGuilt or innocence doesn't matter it's the it's it's whatever ... whatever for form of of of political manipulation we can achieve a mass basis that's reality doesn't matter which true or not\nSo you know\nThis is what I see today a you know Donald Trump making a great strategic move that not really as he mocking a victim of sexual assault\nThat is yet to be determined number one whether or not she actually was or not\nOr you know I tend to believe somebody says they are because those types of things are very serious and I think it only took a ... human being to lie about them but some people live out them so it happens um and on top of that you know sitting there and and making fun of somebody wouldn't make it funny was poking holes in the argument heckling me here sorry\n\nThat's the way I see it you want to look at the block and tell me what you see my phone numbers for three eight WNPR oh the toll free number one eight hundred three two one WPRI this portion of the show sponsored by guilt appliances guilt appliances Columbus Day sale September twenty six through October tenth enjoy meeting saving showing some personal Middletown or online and kills appliances dot com\nAnd I have people on Facebook saying that you're always anti Trump and I got other people calling saying come on Matt wake up he was mocking her\nSo there you go let's look at the plot together you and I we can sit down and can analyze\nEach other's insanity flatulence flatulence as well speaking of which\nOf of him anyway not of which I'm next hour Kim calling in from channel twelve gonna join us I Want to know she came as close as I can tell from anybody else to actually seeing face to face the person who may have called children when I was his office about beating and Brett Kavanaugh\nKind of like somebody who's seen big foot that's coming up in the matter which will stay right there\nNews talk six thirty and Ninety nine seven have him W. B. R. O. along with WPRI twelve by witness news more sense newsmakers and they said he lives with you on a Sunday nights as sick as Tim White House ... interviews with southern new England's top politicians and the other newsmakers then at six thirty join host ten leasing\n... showcases emerging businesses interviews business leaders owners and highlights local business drafts\nNewsmakers a sex offender executive suite at six thirty Sunday nights on news talk six thirty seven Ninety nine seven half hour W. B. R. O.\nI wouldn't have seen since you about whether or not they they do is this like the by rote thing they do offer me ... he was voted on we don't do any sort of work on Iran to determine whether or not legit we just for that and that's it\nSo he if he expressed to me that he thought he had done the proper thing you know I got to some place we wanted to make sure that was bought for the proper channels and he was frustrated and upset that it had been sort of both right before it was properly\nAnd that's why I wanted an apology because he said that to to put this stuff out there will be identifying or the ability to identify the Twitter account anyway right on right that was something that wasn't a problem because this guy was just a regular guy who was just a regular constituent is\nRight and and if you've seen the transcripts you know that his name is redacted transcript but those are the tweet and the Twitter bio are are identifiable um and as we also know from that Twitter account this man has said publicly we're attracted a story that he supposedly told us that are White House so\nUm it's been an interesting thought that a try and follow I Wish that um someone a preferably me could talk to this\nGuy [laughter] I have a I was\nThe one outside of your door you know I think it's an interesting story to tell\nA regardless of what that story it\nYeah I mean she show\nAssuming that you know obviously there is that that Twitter feed Twitter name belongs to him and that he was the one who made the phone call um the the ... the name of the door and the Twitter name match yeah yeah that's about all we know show somebody using that name has at the same name as a person who lives in an apartment\nIt's like you know we really need a human [laughter] yes hes forward\nAnd say hello to me yes that's my Twitter account yes and the same person who called senator White House right now it's all sort of you know we're trying to connect the dots um but I I think it\nYou know we haven't really been able to pin that down yet and until we have a person of for 'em and and talk to us face to face a I don't think we can ever really know for sure I'm even though all signs point yes that at this person a this Rhode Island man is connected with his Twitter account and with that\nComplaint that with me and being a dog a reporter that we know you are you obviously tried other messages well I Would imagine right to try and get some kind of confirmation of connection to this guy to no avail though huh\nYeah yeah of course I mean like I said we we tried calling him as an emailing him we've looked on social media for relatives or some of whom have responded to us but uh some of them have been to and it's\nBeen a it's been really tricky to even try and break through a I think the closest that we've gotten again is just going to have department knowing that he called down his supervisor and said I don't want to talk of the media which to me is a good sign that were on the right track 'cause of someone who is not confused about why the news is outside of his door\n... right right okay yeah because ultimately if you're if you're confused you open the door but what's this all about right\nTo have ... who are you what are you doing here [laughter]\n... facts may may seem as though that this might be the person who did it and we just don't know why\n[noise] oh right right and that's really why we went and knock down his door because by the time friday morning rolled around he had already\nTaken to this Twitter account and said the story told is not true um I've been getting a bargain with sweet\nAh and so what we really wanted to do was not question the validity of his story anymore but the question him on why he felt it was necessary to make that kind of call in\nAnd if people can recant stories for all different reasons right does not for me 'cause I was made a mistake or it wasn't true it could be made a mistake by even bringing this up is now part of this morass that I Want nothing to be part of you know I don't want to part of it so I when I mean over my head and I want to get out and um\nSo it's interesting All right so I mean as far as I knew you were the only one that actually tried to get a face to face with that person in terms of\nPhysically being there that you talked about it publicly anyway I'm sure other people maybe you've tried so I wanted to kinda see where you were in and um and so you're still available should the person who want to reach out and told the lady who knocked on his door\nAbsolutely lady who was at your door if you if you wanna get in touch with me I\nCan do so on Twitter if that's convenient [laughter] so yeah I think I think he has an important an interesting story to tell we just got to see if he's willing to tell it\nCan thank you for everything I appreciate it thanks Matt or ... and German channel twelve\nSleep you know is this a situation where the simplest explanation is the correct one right don't use of this to me early today is usually the simplest is the simplest explanation is that is the right one\nGuy call center White House in the White House's here if you want to go tell your story you know it's interesting because it could to the committee they're gonna investigated\nAnd just in case you want to go ahead and tell the media about this go right ahead here soon\nSo and then you know whatever um\nAnd then for whatever reason this person and it could be a very viable explanations person doesn't um\n[noise] see I was when I was wondering if we couldn't find anybody\nIf nobody's come forward nobody you know is this is a person who's who's\nPhone number was was on you know wrongly assigned\nOn the Internet\nAnd we don't even know there's no picture and the Twitter feed is nothing like this was this person even a real person who was just somebody screwing around on the Internet now the Kim's been toward door someplace in ...\nWith the guy's name that matches the Twitter account on the front door it leads a little bit more credibility to the fact that there might be actually a human being behind this now what they were trying to achieve if anything is still the mystery is this is one of those things where somebody has a memory and they go oh\nThis must have been the same thing and then realizes later on oh no that was not it was somebody trying to pull a prank or somebody's trying to get involved in something you'll people do there are so much is happening here but then some kids situations people actually tried to go ahead and get involved in things that they're not involved in\nAh to get attention to to be able to you know puzzle chaos or whatever reasons that they have\nBut um you know the idea that some of the White House is not famous person should get an apology or something like this to me\nUm you know when you if you make a a you know when somebody says hey we can't something I made a mistake to me that is you know they they screwed up and they made a false allegation\nIt doesn't have to me that but that's what I take us\nAnd so for me this has become now part of this uh this Kavanaugh um [noise]\nYou know so called the last hour the or the blood test right there ... where you know ultimately my mind on your mind goes is that there's partisan politics at work here and that you have either somebody who's a willing volunteer or somebody's ... knowing ah\nIn a partisan war between the Democrats and the Republicans when it comes to the Supreme Court justice and if there's anybody on this earth we can say is a virulent partisan it Sheldon Whitehouse\nAnd as Bob planters pointed out the other day if you're going to sit there and talk about a ... and in in in a an offer of people who called complaints media contacts ignored or reporters\nUm you're you're I Would say that you are in my mind back to what I think your motivations can be called into question and all sorts
