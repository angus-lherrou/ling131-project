do now will look like a team\nNotion I enjoy working with you but I have limits [laughter] uh the uh um\nDifferences in structure and because the Republican Party\nNever had the kind of structure I think it needs to succeed and the kind of a you know earned seed money to get that done it will continue to wallow in this in this in this place and they will have good moments and bad moments it'll have synergy and lack of synergy or depending on the cycles\nBut this notion that ah is dysfunctional it's kind of interesting and the solutions for the dysfunction or the analysis of the dysfunction was kind of you know it was a take the Kathy Greg and her team over there the promise journal had today a and I thought it was interesting ah the one who got closest was professor Wendy Schiller brown\n\nShe should listen in politics no one's own loyalty they have to earn it in this case fog has not done that with either ... or Morgan and she's absolutely right\nShe's absolutely right\nThere were no mysteries about Patricia Morgan or Joe true love having thoughts about running for governor of months and months years ago\nNo mysteries\nAnd Alan ... had an opportunity to to seek out those those relationships mend them if they needed to and figure out strategies no you can't always guarantee that you referenced going to be a ... bear fruit\nBut he had to know that they were lurking and he had to know that he couldn't win would then lurking as independence I mean if you beat them in a primary and it's one thing but if the if if one of them goes rogue goes independent it's a huge problem and that's what truly did\nAnd so you have that whole situation going on and it is right now ... unless something incredible happens I don't know what will be what they ... they reprint the ballots this notion that show has it get out of the race you guys are going to stop that his name's on the ballot until election day\nEven if he made announcements that I I Would draw my candidate she there'd be this there'll be four percent of knuckleheads out there would vote for him because they don't pay attention till they go to the polls and then they see the name of go on the ... he makes a little news can boom\nSo they they ... the genie cannot be bad in the back in the bottle\nYou can't help\nBut I'm dysfunction Lou you're on ... to get this party started high ...\nWell I just want to point out that article that Cathy rake or wrote has a a couple of inaccurate inaccuracies in it it's very it's it is most of it was a good article it's probably an\nHour and I remember the well number one what what's his name widen theme came in last minute each the guy that threw his hat in the weight\nAnd she didn't write it she just didn't mention his name and they don't\nKnow what she said that uh that the guy tense came to the rescue pets has been running for a year yeah he's he's he's a complete non starter yeah\nBut he didn't want it for a yeah he he he's actually got his own for a year and he's never called us\nYeah I'm just saying though that the article itself was incorrect water if you came in last minute he was recruited in fact he didn't even know that tents within the race I was there that night he said I didn't even know this guy was running who did I watched that he he says I didn't even yeah we've covered the nomination he says\nI why is it important to us at the end of the theme of this article what why is that an even even close to where you're\nGoing to be accurate though when you want a truck about dysfunction you can't make statements they're not true those are two non non starter statements that are not true I think you're going to be accurate when you're making a\nPoint it's like well they're not they're not non starters the if they're inaccurate their neck nonstarter is is a concept that that that doesn't matter\nYou're showing the you're showing the you know how dysfunctional they are but you really have\nTo start from the beginning ... yep she writes an article this is punishment revenue to our idea of peace dysfunction tell me a few things is functional and be if it is how to fix it\nWell it's very difficult to fix I think the national parties written off the Republicans here in Rhode Island I don't think they want to have anything to do it Rhode Island I think they realized that Rhode Island it's gonna be it's overwhelmingly democratic\nUm there's some independence that are really Republicans but they don't want to you know they don't want to say that Republican\nSo the brand of Republican in Rhode Island is dependent on national support\nWell that's a that's a hell you know when when ... when they didn't help him they didn't they didn't give companies rescue yeah to a little shot of maybe an seeding Sheldon Whitehouse Flanders doesn't seem to be getting any support from the national party I think they've written him off\nUm Fong I I don't think fungus really looking for and I can't speak for fun but I don't think he's looking for Trump to come down here in in campaign for I mean may get somebody\nElse that would be disaster you can't\nWell that's what I'm saying so I think of all those all those issues the Republican Party has their hands full in the sense that they don't have the national support that they need to have at least to you know to get to first\nBase so national support is is is I'm just asking I'm not ... not judging I'm just asking your your note is that national support is required for the ... for the Republican Party to what itself ... ...\nIt's a piece of the puzzle obviously you've got you know this state is overwhelmingly a blue state it's going to be like that you know it's it's very hard to to change the dynamics of what's\nHappening remember large both the largest voting bloc in the state is what\nIndependent that front and you know that but that's not that's not the point the point is it's still a blue state and it's a very difficult it's very difficult to get the support\nYou blue state that elected Republican governors\nYeah they have but they've put dominant we have a elected haven't elected a Republican senator or a Republican congressmen for hot on how many years and very difficult for them to get you know national a representation\nOf what what what what's the purpose of the party be well\nTip tip trip to promote\nThe refinancing or Republican based on on this conversation\nYeah I think to promote our in our agenda we don't you know we want to be conservative in the sense that want to promote economic activity you know we want to promote a we don't want to be a sanctuary state one of you know we we\nSupport the second amendment and in in most cases I'm so those are the that's kind of part of the Republican platform\nBut Rhode Island is as I said it's mostly democratic and it's very difficult when you've got a machine going on here just like just like Hillary she hadn't machine did your national she had that machine but the superdelegates\nAnd you could see how the sticks with that in Rhode Island the fixes and in the sense that you have a lot of people that are dedicated as you said the volunteers to the Republican to the Democratic party\nThey won paid but you know they get the union support and they got all these volunteers and the Republicans don't have that so you know they need to have more support from Washington a nationally and they're not getting that support\nAll right well that's another thoughtful answer I appreciate that they spent four three dirty bureau toll free one eight

know White House ... around the table with gene which I'm sure it was a constructive atmosphere I just checked the some of the um the audio I haven't had a chance to see the whole thing if you saw the whole thing and\nStruck you with the winner and loser\nI'm didn't had tremendous impact on you that somebody said something so compelling that that that stuck with you\nEffected use voter you know all the reasons why you have these things called me for three eight WPRI toll free one eight hundred three two one WPRI all it does feel like channel ten doesn't feel like this or that tore all race is either competitive or prominent are both\nEnough uh\nI mean I you know if there's an Eighteen point differential and always pull between about ... in the White House it's not because ... isn't a really really really important guy around here\nHe's a former state Supreme Court justice he is blue chip in capability the campaign has not been blue chip in my mind that because they screwed up because they just haven't brought it now bringing it's hard\nBut here's something that seems like it's a little bit of a bring on the part above Flanders just to create some\nSome some some gene asked a question of a very good question let's let's listen to the two or three minute thing go ahead\nYou don't have attacked the senator from being a born with a silver spoon in his mouth to plant a privilege um you know I'm just thinking the Roosevelt the Kennedys\nA lot of people including the ... and the Chafets level one silver spoon to them out yet the great work why as well then coming from a background of ... which diminish your job you might be what public service\nIt doesn't necessarily but in in the case of a sudden the White House I think in some ... from the fact that these are not in touch\nWith the everyday needs of Rhode Island there is and I think around those would appreciate somebody who comes from a background that most of them share\nA background of um middle class working hard uh getting ahead through education and ended up giving public service back and we know what people are looking to and unfortunately uh his he's he's from he's on the permanent social register down in Washington is more of a citizen now that I'm that area of the news of Rhode Island and\nSo I you know his it's and it look he's a he's [laughter] his wife is one of the largest shareholders Bailey ... beach club which is allowing explosive but doesn't uh admit or blacks and Jews so that's not a good thing either\nLet's get them to respond to senator you come from privilege and not in touch with the Rhode Island losing you belong to bally's address that\nLook I grew up in the foreign service my dad was a foreign service officer we were posted mostly in Africa and Asia I was sent away when I was a love him to go to boarding school 'cause the place where we live didn't have schools any longer um\nI Am very proud of my parents and I have no intention whatsoever of expressing any regret for wide shows or to be born into [noise] um\nAs far as the sort of valley speech club and you had a few times on that it's a very exclusive license ... excuse keeps people out if somebody goes to a club I don't\nThink the ah my Republican opponent has characterized good at all fairly uh and frankly is the man from the dunes club I'm not sure that this as much of a a strong argument for him but my point is that I think this is a unfortunate discussion to be having\nWe have stuff going on in Washington that is important\nWe have health care programs that hundreds of thousands of Rhode islanders depend on that are under attack we have a a\nIncome inequality in this country that has depriving a great number of Rhode Island areas of the fair reward for their hard work we have a political system for this flooded with dark money and to be talking about beach clubs rather than raise issues I think is certainly a part of the problem is that\nMy Republican opponent is on the wrong side from Rhode Island based on all of those issues let me hold a bit of it was\nLike so that's interesting that's interesting\n... we have to guys you got to keep listening through I Know we're playing catch up here because you'll Flanders should not have he he should not have a let that go\n\nI mean the idea that show the White House\n... we've been through this before is gene correctly said is that an answer for for this particular club and I don't remember specifically what the answer is worse uh as to\nYou know his discussion legitimacy a that he tried to make out of their membership policy at all\nUm but at least that is that's the kind of\nYou know effort that I thought not because I Want to see the much lung in a in a in an election but somewhere along the line ... you've got to throw a couple of those punches\nAnd if you're trying to create a disposition of out of touch in the minds of people you know regarding show the White House you have to you have to say something that creates it that particular you know you know\nJab do the job the Flanders throughout White House there I think using legitimate campaign thing to do Sheldon definitely you know push back and said listen this is you know this is you know\nYeah I I guess Bob blenders belongs to the dunes club like I don't I'm guessing the dunes club has a much more open and Roman policy he wouldn't be that stupid uh [laughter] to pointed Sheldon saying they don't let the whoever they do it in\nAnd the dunes repeat the same kind of process uh you know both guys are of means and so it's kind of a category of\nYou know there's the of means every man thing and there's the of means not every man thing I I don't I don't I don't know I don't know whether that sticks but at least its effort to do so\nI'm\nFascinated do do do you guys hone in on this stuff is just a matter to you for three eight zero toll free one eight hundred three two one W. P. I'm Talking about talking about coming from money either coming for money or making money\nYou know I think it's pretty clear Sheldon Whitehouse came from money\nThis is this coming from money feel different than making money is making a lot of money um you know feel different to you is is this money thing something that you worry about how could it possibly be\nHere's the thing we just elected a president of the United states who will try to tell you he's worth ten billion dollars I don't believe it or is that he's even close to that but I'll I'll I'll acquiesce to the idea that you got to be in front of his net worth\nCourse it'd be nice to see some of his financial materials so that we can make some determination is not just in his net worth but you know who's relationships with but I digress\nI I think it's awful hard to um to be pointing fingers at each other about who's\nRicher and who's less connected to the every man and every woman in Rhode Island based on the money now if your club excludes a certain type of gender indoor race that's problematic\nYou know that that's that's that's that's a problem\nI mean in in in modern times that that should be a problem [laughter] ...\nAnyway uh forgive me for throwing motion the show and playing catch up on this thing you know kicking myself over the idea that I didn't see this debate between these two guys 'cause I didn't even know about him is that just missed it just went by any it doesn't only happen and\nI've been asking a lot of people on taxes you know did you know and they're like no no no I just don't see it

yeah anyway Sony or I Can't find that if you want to get a part of the broadcast brought to you by Carolina barbeque will definitely watch it and record it because it's important\nUm\nBy the way I don't see that they chose not mentioned in the we'll check would check with shrill oh is he going to this debate\n\nThat would be interesting if he was eliminated from the debate I they haven't lifted their hold on track with an art um okay so you're on the website\nI Know I have the press release right in front of me it's a who's press release or it's coming from\nOh for God's sake there are your eye marketing okay W did you have your eyes really yes I'm looking at ... that's where I started this conversation Iran into this information I again I had no idea they had a debate tonight\nBut they do and we should pay attention okay\nThis mess sponsored by Carolina barbeque no better place in his mouth watering lip smacking fault among ribs twelve hour cook brush get pulled pork in twenty varieties wings Carolina barbeque company reservoir evidence and Cranston for three eight WPRI Rosa number toll free one eight hundred three two one WPRI but the point of my conversation before we get distracted\nWas that\nYou know the Republican Party this this Republican uh slash independence\nUm eat your own dynamic going on between funding trailer right now is is more or less guaranteed to have gene reminder walk into this given a sheet unless and until something dramatic happens but I don't think it's because of the dysfunction of the party it's the ... the the party cannot be functional\nAnd its current skim magic it needs to operate differently okay enough on that when it comes to Sheldon and Bob Flanders and the audio that we were in there at the top that's the worst that you're going to get\nFor you know\nThe latest variety the lights spread of mud slinging that could happen in a campaign\n\nAnd because of that and because there really aren't any opportunities for Bob Flanders to do such nor well he there are opportunities if he wanted to engage in them but it's not his style and because he doesn't want to do that\nThat race is predictably over as well\n[noise]\nAnything could change but I think everybody knows how to read the tea leaves\nAnd and so I Will tell you there's there's there's when it comes to the races the things that we're going to have to pay attention to or the other other down ticket races down ballot races and I will tell you that we haven't spent enough time on the matter of yellow a Steve fry is racing district Fifteen and we'll start to do that soon\nI'm and over the course of time it will be interesting to see what the Republicans are able to do to gain some ground in the general assembly a which is not going to be the worst thing in the world for the state if we get some Republican ground gained in the general assembly\nBecause for those of you want to hang onto your wallets you got to know that we've got we've got a pretty serious\nA progressive agenda here which is which is continually gaining ground seat by sheet\nAnd that's\nI mean there's some progressive ideas of even I can say yeah makes some sense but the the the all the questions have got to give them back to what we can afford it with our financial priorities are\nAnd that hardly ever comes up\nOn the progressive agenda you know one of the reasons why we're in difficult shape years because of our tax status and because our cost of doing business and because of all those things and uh you ought to be paying attention to that stuff is is is my general point on this you know second full week in front of the election there's only two four weeks in front of the election\nYou know this one of the next one and then it's over then the decisions made and then we got to go back to doing business with whatever the people have decided\nAnd know that for those of you who listen to this show who who feel this ...\nThis this this notion at least you know the the color based on the show is is much more right than left I don't know\nIf we can make that judgment about the general audience but know that you have a little time to make your case make your point I Wonder how energized many of you are behind any of the candidates right now or whether or not this fate accompli that I'm predicting exists is your is your take to\n\nSpending I'll get some emails from people say Dan how do you ... you know how dare you to send you the color race on soon my I I'm not here\nTo to prevent or to hurt any particular candidate was telling you what what what it feels like in right now there's just not much going on other than the kind of weak that was last week of of of of\nDown and dirty mudslinging than involved two guys who can't get out of their own way to make hay to be able to actually take on the challenger who I think for all intents and purposes most of the Saudis believes ought to be challenged\nOught to be challenged and I'll just keep believing you with is\nIt the it is so frustrating to me just see at the very beginning at get go at the announcement for Bob plans to run for Senate when I'm looking at this guy thinking man he is that why is he running for governor\nTo see him running for US Senate trying to bite off way more than he could reasonably chew based on not wanting to go where he needs to go to beat him\nAll those all those suits that were around Bob landers I should I respectfully you know all those suits though around Boston actors on the day that he announced in Central Falls
