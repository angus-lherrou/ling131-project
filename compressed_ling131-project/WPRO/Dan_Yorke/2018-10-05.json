I think we had to because or in the next five weeks we're going to be making the case for island that they need to elect more Republicans to the house and the Senate\nAnd I don't think you can effectively make that case when your your leaders and even endorsing a Republican and frankly I think she's endorsing someone who doesn't really have a chance to win and the fact that Joe ... is\nTrumpeting Patricia Morgan who is my friend but she's been\nAnti Democrat for her entire political life and she's done a great job at it but Joe Trone attack towards the middle and even take democratic votes\nAnd how by having Patricia Morgan working on his campaign surrogate as I think they said she would is that going to help them take independent and democratic votes it's going to take Republican votes\nSo it seems to me that what he's doing is more about eating out when Fong than than actually winning the governorship\nYeah there are now there's a lot of there's a lot of ah\nThere's a lot of analysis that can be offered there and I'm not suggesting that you're unreasonable well you know what it makes sense to me now that you've explained it to me to be honest with you it it it makes sense um in terms of\nYou know marketing the brand your reflection on what's happening inside the state Republican Party it's the turbulence has been ongoing for every year I've been here will be Nineteen years next month so I\nThis is not new news for me in terms of watching this is a citizen and as a broadcaster but right now it seems even more fractured thought\nWell I mean a party is made up individuals individuals have personalities and not everyone can get along people have different perspectives on on the direction the party should go maybe some people just don't like each other I think it's the nature of any body we can get a lot of people into the Republican Party needs to better job of electing more people to office yes\nBut we have a very interesting state where a good portion of the Democratic representatives and senators in any other state with the Republican so it's it's not a question of conservatives not getting elected its it's we're not getting enough members of party elected but I think the conservative movement in the state of strong\nA given that the majority of the representatives and senators are kind of a conservative and not progressive leaning\nYeah no it or to just to me listen I'm not going to keep you I'm sure you're enjoying a beautiful evening on black island it makes perfect sense to me and um\nYeah the final word got anything on you gotta you gotta anything on Kevin off you're going to want to Medicare I mean it should feel free\nFascinating news day yeah I just kind of disappointed that it went the way it did
