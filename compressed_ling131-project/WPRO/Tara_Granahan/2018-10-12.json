Providence public safety commissioner Steven Perry says that if it is ours didn't last night at the bus yard people responsible to be prosecuted to the fullest extent and a half dozen school buses damage in a fire last night city council president David Salvatore\nSituation again has has escalated now to a level that I said last week and I'll say it again it's really unacceptable both\nParties meet this dog just today or the city is prepared to move in another direction\nShould released a statement condemning the property damage done last night's fire essentially they see anyone who's in their causes advance by that fire is sadly mistaken death toll is now eleven as a result of hurricane up Michael in Virginia they now say for people to drowned and a firefighter has been killed you know nowhere in the state\nPlus the teachers um according to the um teachers president a union president ... told me last week that morale is at its lowest it's ever been a they're struggling with a contracting situation with the mayor just it it I don't know if we can get worse ah hopefully can get better but ... what how does this affect the teachers and students\nWhy the teachers I mean we have very professional teachers and they make the best of the situation that they're in and\nUm you know I think during school hours in the classroom um I think business is proceeding as it always does for them and they're doing the best that they can come to work every day they're working on an airplane and they're less than\nA coach and their teams and they're writing those college recommendation and then when you go back to the to the business of negotiations and its agreement than you know that's why they have a very capable union president they ever very keep or Ernie and executive director and you know I I felt like\nWas progress hearing from both sides that progress is being made I don't know if that's been disrupted by the by the issues here obviously with the bus or the buses have become the primary crisis that we're confronting in the\nThe school district but you know prior to this standoff with I'm related to the\nAnd the teachers mhm [noise] I get appointed on the heels of of every teacher in the city having been fired in the wake of that you know a hundred and ten million dollar a structural deficit that the the prior administration was working hard to close and\nThey confronted a tremendous financial crisis and they handled it as best they could\nUm it you know at that point I think the teachers morale was as low as it ever been obviously um and with the ... administration the school board and Steve Smith and Mary Beth collaborator at that currently we work together\nYeah to repair the trust to repair that relationship that continued in the Lord's administration\nNow obviously as this contract situation is\nHas a cover up we've kind of taken a step in the wrong direction on morale but that's going to happen I mean there are always going to be disagreements between municipalities and\nLabor unions and you work through them and they'll eventually get resolved it you know we'll get back to where we were a but to come you know to get to do and you have to go through the night and we're going through the night right now\nAre certainly a wishing when they came in he is the board chairman of the provenance school systems will department\nAgain the students I you know I I I Can't stress enough how um I I feel badly for you know the families and the students involved what happens at the end of the year if we if kids have already been no fault of their own if what if they could make it into school if the classrooms are behind because you have a you know three quarters of attendance\nAre there any plans in the works for what happens to make up the work or do you have to make up daisy enter ... what's happening go up\nSo our overall attendance right now is um you know we're up in the ... I think I told you this before in a good day we're about Ninety percent on a great day we're about Ninety two percent right now we're kind of eighty eight eighty nine percent so I'm overall the nine thousand kids that ride buses\nThe the great majority of them are getting school the kids that are not are are most vulnerable students have bought a hundred special ed students that have not come to school since the strike started and\nWe have a little over two hundred students overall um that have not come to school and eleven school days so what we're doing the areas where we're coming up with um you know make up work plans homework plans\nParents that have access to technology because again in Providence not everybody has wife by it All right um so the ones that do ah there's got to be some electronic uh in in online portal based access to make up work\nUm and then as we're you know working through this trying to find a way to serve them as best you can ... they're all over the other thing we've done is put the our fees out and you know we're not going to wait\nWe're not going to wait we're going to seek beds where removing the preferential treatment for a bus yards it'd be located in Providence hopefully open it up to more companies to make that bidding process for competitive\nUm than it was the last time and if we can get someone who's got the buses\nOr someone who's got the drivers and put them together if we have to make that match ... you know we're not going to wait so we're trying to move as fast as a state law will allow us to move\nWe're going to go through that purchasing process we're going to go through the Iraqis and you know hopefully we can find a new bus company and now you know I I'll call whatever special meetings on my end that I have to call to the vet and approved those contracts\nBecause it's just it's it's it's it's absurd it's ridiculous\nIt's it's a tremendous inconvenience and it's probably the most negatively most negative thing in terms of impact on students that I've seen contract our school district in\nThe seven years that I've been on the school board\nI I Would agree with you but haven't we been led to believe Nick that there's only the one company that has the amount of buses in the island\nI mean I think right now as it stands today\nOnly one bus company has the buses immediately available but with a contract available can these other companies get buses here from other states\nUm to serve us but you're not going to do that on speculation if you bit and you say I can get two hundred buses here's what I'm going to pay it is by labor force and the ... and you make those available then yeah I think that it is true that on\nOh we kind of neat to help right now thirty days or so you know I don't think there are companies that can do that but for a long term three or four year agreement\nYou know I think they go out they find the capital and they get the buses here um what's what's been the barrier I think is the idea that the bus yard I think there's a misconception that it required the bus yard to be here with the current tracked into big package that is it was preferred the bus yard be here then they want is\nAn offset payment\nFor the costs mhm associated with the transportation the buses here\nTo me that amounted to a requirement that\nThe buses be here because nobody wants to be paying the taxes where they're located and then have to take a pay the taxes here private so by opening it up we can see what's out there we can know for sure other than speculating um and and trying to work with companies that we talked to on a daily basis we're going to cast a very wide net\n'em and see what we get a response is you know from what I've heard from from folks in the in you know I'm an attorney so other attorneys I Know of said oh I Know this company I Know that company or you know we're going to put the ... out there we'll see if these companies come forward\nUm who's leading the charge Nicki Minaj is it the mayor is a David Salvatore as it use it a combo\nNot I think the mayor is the leader of the city um has been leading the charge you know I don't think everybody sees it I mean he has been deeply involved in trying to mediate the situation you\nKnow I served um you know basically at his pleasure confirmed by the council I served as a member of his team and doing this I'm trying to help or where he thinks I can be helpful to the city and um you know I think he and the superintendent have been working pretty much twenty four seven on this is before it started as a\nYou know I think he's the leader of the city and he's put\nTogether a team of folks to try to help resolve it the rest of us are all doing our part to do that I think the ... president I think of the other members of the girls who have had tried to be helpful to try to really try to hold everyone's feet to the fire and as a community we all have to continue to work together to to get through the situation\nUm and or if we can't resolve it then we'll move on from it\nA realistically Nikki ... is the board president Providence public schools how long do you see this dragging out\nOr I have no idea to our you know these things and I think a couple of times from what I hear that they've been close and then it hasn't happened um you know I oh I can say is I think we plant\nThe responsible thing on our end as we have to plan that it doesn't it and you know because it does no good to sit around and say well I'm hopeful so I'm not you know we have to play for the worst case scenario and I think that's what at least on the school board level that's what we're doing that is what um we have to do\nAll right Nick ... president of the provenance public schools I'm sure we'll be chatting with you and a present your time what's going to try to get the latest on what's going on with the actual buses that were on fire last night uh coming I'm Still this morning thanks Nick\nThanks there are four three eight nine seven seven sex boy ...

I see that the mayor lords of scrambling it's it's almost too late and the governor's hands off I'm not interfering in this one will know the buses are on fire\nAnd isn't the ACLU suing is that just the city or is that the entire state of Rhode Island we see more federal fines coming and just keep saying oh I'm not going to you know this isn't this isn't in my we'll have I'm not getting involved when when does the governor get involved for three eight nine seven seven six Carol is in North Smithfield Hi Carol\nHi how are you good good I don't know anybody thought about this stairwell dialing it meant that the U.S eight like bussing a while back\nA student got that contracting that's all well and good so they could actually drive it's been the or the young\nBut old or a student driving a union not particularly this union union so no unions going across the light so they can get another bus company they all have the special ed classes\nI don't know what the may I think he's going to do\nOkay so you're saying that they're saying they have three options floating around let's find another company maybe least their buses and you're saying though those other company employees would be union and wouldn't cross the\nYou're right and that's where I go in\nAnd if they get into them\nAll those up and you're not going to go on strike and you're going to have the whole steroid Allen doubt\n... oh I did a listen I don't know the extent that first year student like you know these are the kinds of things you see the school buses I think the average person thinks that he'd city and
