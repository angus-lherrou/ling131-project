HBO and he said that he is going to target a what we call them anchor\nBabies although some say that's a derogatory derogatory term in other words a Mexican mother crosses the border and she gives birth here bomb that's that baby is an American citizen a Trump says that is not in the spirit of what the founders wanted\nUh we got to stop this anchor babies so he says I'm gonna I'm gonna probably target that with an executive order\nA meaning that you would not be a citizen just because you're born here no other European countries follow a different model you're only a citizen if your parents are citizens that appears with Trump is trying to do he would sign an executive\nOrder that would undo the the ... the law or the the rules that\nWe follow that if you're born here you're a citizen no matter what the circumstances are if your mother just crossed over the line gave birth to them you're here and that keeps already or to\nA Trump is going to target is apparently with an executive order certainly setting up a court challenge we'll see how far it gets\nWhether or not he needs a constitutional amendment to do that he doesn't think so so that's a little news that I'm sure they're gonna ask about that watch me on the news at twelve o'clock I'll be there at noon and six o'clock don't forget we got the debate coming up Thursday at seven o'clock paragraphs has next to keep the

I think all the negative press has gotten the last few weeks I think that's really start to have an impact on his campaign\nIn the head to head match up on like our last poll Raimondo now leads with all age groups\nThe middle age group she was traveling by a couple of points last time now she's winning by a couple of points\nDespite the negative opinion most voters have a joke Grillo our poll shows he was able to inch up support in the race from our last survey from seven to nine percent but my kitchen and we should note this poll comes to the margin of error four point eight percent\nThat's Tim white obviously on the set WPRI\nTwelve and we're going to talk to his colleague Ted nice he break down the numbers just after nine thirty or so again I eat a lot of people say well what did they\nAnd how many people were called I don't get a call nobody called my house phone I don't have a house phone so [laughter]\nThis is what we've we've been here at least I've been hearing and I heard it loud and clear last night at an event with people that want it to talk politics they you know they showed up and I appreciate all the listeners I came out and they they like to talk about it it was a ... I Want to set this up before Ted comes on it was a land line and cell phone interview pole\nAnd then people say well when did it happen was before Joe ... flipped off a you know the guy that said he dumped\nIt was Saturday Tobar twentieth through Wednesday October twenty fourth okay so today's the thirty is a ten days ago it started and it lasted four days plumbing an associate so they had an overall margin of error the simple error which is about as you just heard him say four and a half percentage points for pointing and he's been doing this since Nineteen eighty four\nJoe Fleming so uh let me get to the to the good stuff governor ... according to eye witness news forty five percent Alan ... thirty four percent Joe ... nine percent\nYou've got to know that there's a chunk of undecided voters still or those that you know [noise] ... didn't want to you know didn't want to say either or now there was a woman last night at the event that I was at and we were talking about polls because you know the before the game came on you could see all the different\nNews programs were on and she said I I've gotten one phone call from from a pollster and she said I played with that person I had more fun with that person so I ask you if I Want to hear first of all do take stock in these polls\nFor me and I usually say listen I work in the media so I I don't want to waste their time I feel badly I think a lot of people are volunteers and I have the you know the Catholic\nGuilt or whatever I got going on and so I just cut them off I say thank you very much for your time good luck but I with the media and I don't answer anything\nAnd [noise] but I think people do I mean my my dad always keep somebody on the phone for ten minutes if it's a telemarketer having some fun just having a chat\nI don't know how much you know stock we can put in this I don't know who who answered these polls either seriously or legitimately because there is a feeling of I'm telling somebody who I'm going to vote for I don't want to be aligned with so and so\nI don't want them to think that you know my son has his job because of X Y and Z I Know that still out there in Rhode Island I Know it and I heard it as a last night\nSo I ask you do you believe and take stock in the polls and I'm not pooh pulling them because they're very they're done very very well especially this one\nDo you take stock in them do you do or have you participated in them in a legitimate way that's what I Would like to know and I got to be honest I still have a house phone and it rains and you know what I Do I pick it up and hang it up because I can see it either says spam with a question mark now or\nI don't know the number and it's you know it's either the pharmacy saying you can come pick something up you know it's a robocall so I'd like to hear what you if you have been part of any of these polls who is taking part in these polls is what I Would like to know and are you taking them seriously\nFor three eight nine seven seven six four three eight WPRI and boy did they break it down\nThe favorability factor those those numbers and of course the unfavorable are ah eye opening on this one really eye opening so again four hundred and sixteen likely Rhode Island voters so first of all they had to say yeah I think I'm going to go and vote next week\nForty five percent with Raimondo governor Mondo and then thirty four percent both of them are stuck for Alan ... the Democrat in the Republican they're stuck\nThat leaves you you out there who are undecided you could have more control of this governor's race than you actually understand\nForty five and thirty four and eight that leaves a good chunk of people that go where to uh Lewis Daniel Munoz who is an independent candidate also an Armstrong from the compassionate party and independent she's listed as an independent or moderate bill Gilbert\n... no offense to any of them but they are lesser known\nAnd they could get what two three four percent between them so you have forty five thirty four nine and fourteen you've got a chunk of undecided and those people who either fudge the numbers when they answered the phone\nOr we're playing a game with the people on the phone so I don't eat as much as I think has it if I were asked today to put money down and I don't gamble except occasionally the Powerball in the mega millions if I were asked to put money down today\nI'd say governor remained as walking away with it and I will tell you that maybe two weeks ago\nI said something I thought I probably I don't know if that if I should have said that at but I I stand by and she could hit fifty percent she couldn't I said it a couple of weeks ago she could hit fifty percent and that would be\nAn enormous win for coming to remind do because when you go out and you talk to people there's a lot of indifference trying to find people who really cling on to governor among do there's indifference or oh I don't want to do this again\nOr for three eight nine seven seven six let me go to Steven Smithfield talking about the polls and well how much stuff do you put into them Hi Steve\nI checked out a warning the morning uh\nI I Believe the legitimate but I Believe that people believe that I Will I Will oh we're ready to vote the way I ...\n... ... because the old way we'll be All right well well it will last day one of ... actually I don't want to see that the way it is\nI think they should be out what is your stock or get a break up a book about water ...\nOr ... ... ... ... ... the biggest wish people's bull\nSharks and again I I put it any other well that's okay listen we can only report will you know people that a lot of time and money into these well but yeah\nYou know everybody talks about what's changed the race for what reason ... the race but what other cities you when you talk show host ... books about Billy Joel was if the photo wrong she wants to get rid of ballot for your you'll walk show all that much\nOf what was that they candidate for his oil listen they can they can everybody can believe what they want you you you're going to walk into the poll Steve with your own opinions um ... we can't I Can't make you do anything up\nPeople won't the judge won't\nLook I don't think that if someone's going to walk into the polls because of a talk show host any one of us\nDo I mean I just want you to get in there and and and and vote your conscience but I I don't think we were waiting on what you're\nBritish show ...\nI'm Sorry to say and like you\nKnow I think there are I Do think there are I think Steve you're hanging around the winters are hanging with the wrong crowds\nWhich that\nYou're hanging with the wrong crowd\nOkay\n[laughter] have some faith and your fellow Rhode Island or Steve they'll do the right things but I Want to know how how much stock you take in the polls I'm not saying if you think they're done well I Know they're done well I Know I Know the people behind it they've been doing this for years they're the experts at polling\nI think they're done well I'm just saying you individually do you go ... well\nShe's up he's down he sideways that

I'm sure there's lots more to come [laughter] oh my goodness boy like ... for a small amount of people up there that there's there's plenty of stories going around how a lot of that and I mean\nYou know frankly I it's why I'm I Know people have their frustrations with the media but it is why I probably read more reporters in Rhode Island because I I think there's more stories then all of us can even get to some of the time [laughter]\n'cause you need a couple of hours of sleep a night that needs to yeah I agree I texted me last night after night it was at twelve thirty at night you and I say

the general election dog Ninety nine seven six or ... feet\nFrom Europe Central on corners of\nThe revolution self Washington center this is the double the news the ten o'clock this morning a person from middle year with the internal way now to me this is the Associated Press reporting\nThat the topic of birthright citizenship is come up at various times President Trump does actually send HBO he wants to end birthright citizenship for babies born to non citizens and immigrants not authorized to be in the U.S\nHere's our men at the White House correspondent ... it\nWould prompt months if not years of constitutional court challenges but it could be done by next Tuesday's midterm elections the president has not indicated that season tension Mr Trump tells the political program Axios on HBO he's looking to end the citizenship birthright\nNow they're saying I can do it just was an executive order now how ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits\nOr tennis Tim white obviously I and the and the a\nTeam at channel twelve WPRI WPRI and also WPRI dot com and appreciate ... analysis and break down this morning as well independent candidate for governor Joe ... a has heard the numbers has seen the numbers and he's calling in to respond to that poll good morning Joe ...\nUm [noise]\nI saw you last night I was at a fundraiser for a sergeant a labor job\nBrian St your main foundation so I appreciate you and you had some teammates with you and your wife was with you and you made a donation so that being said the family was very appreciative\nAnd um I saw you and I said hey I'm you know working this event and you and we talked about the polls for about a half a second because it was a nice crowd there and they were talking to you but um\nWhat's your take I Know you I I think I Know you're going to say but let's hear it\nWell first some of the way the old I disagree with two it's very complex they're asking too many questions\nSometimes they try to keep people on the phone for ten minutes answering a variety of question\nWe've done internal polling and the way we do it is very simple we don't know the voters or we don't know their names but we'd go out on the street\nAnd we we approach people asked them I registered voter\nIf you're a registered voter would you be voting in this election cycle\nIf they say yes who who would you vote for for governor and when we do we purposely leave my name to the end so I'm not skewing the vote Gina Raimondo Allan Fung Virgil trailer in those polls I'm pulling\nPretty odd\nAnd we do ... roughly where Joe what all the way into Providence okay was pretty high give us some numbers but you know what I don't want to give up his mind I can tell you is that let's go back two weeks ago\nDo vote me pull out of Harvard University had me it's Seventy percent [noise] is that is such a contradiction for the older came out\nDays ago and if you look at is pull off four weeks ago yeah I'd be at six\nPercent so\nI don't know what's going on with the polling all I Know is I don't believe it for a second or it's not what we're experiencing out there in the real world and when it the the the problem with the Fleming bull is the first question they asked people is let me speak to the youngest voter in the house\nWell that's not my voted to start off with ... so he's got his own reasoning for why he says that bottom\nLine is they gave Trump or one percent chance of winning the night before the election one\nPercent any one show I tell people\nIf you want to believe the polls you can believe the polls but the polls are all over the place\nWell they are Joe in in that and that's why I think people when they hear you saying you know All right let's let's let's hear him out he's in this race he's on the ballot he's working hard and then you say you did\nYour own internal polling and and you don't believe the the the polls have been published but then you don't want to give us numbers are you in between those two polls channel twelve and a ... or ... higher than they'll all be on the other thing you you are pulling shows you hired and Seventeen percent\nYes yes so my my whole point is that\nToday that try to get too much information out of people the other thing is when they call somebody they know they they know their age they know if they're registered Republicans Democrats they have all the demographics on them so if you're registered Republican and you would be you're going to vote for Joe ...\n... if it's the foreign campaign they're going to come out have you with vengeance we've seen this happen over and over\nYou know there's a woman in a west fully bought for ... there was a long time Republican she is been persecuted by the Republican Party because she stood with me since day one we had a young girl who came on board with my campaign\nAfter the last debate Roger Williams University College or rich it\nShe was removed from a Republican position because you were supporting me\nThey selectively going after every Republican that publicly came out in favor of the including Patricia Morgan who they really have it and they just mean in in a vicious\nKnew who was ...\nSo I never realized when I became a Republican that I was going to sign my life or wait till the party because it looks like that's what they expect you you were Republican trouble how yeah you ever become an independent\nIn ... I think it's absolutely ridiculous I think it sends a message out there for how bad the funk campaign has run his campaign because it's Sam that have been maliciously going after white support is\n... so you're so I just want to make this clear you were saying I ...\nThat went different polls and posters he may have a list of um you know admitted Republican voters everything about them\nUsing people does the does the person on the other end of the phone oh you think that they're assuming they have all my information so I'm not going to give them a legitimate answer\nOf course but you know they that's why they're targeting of\nThe callers this morning already saying no I I told I I I you know did it with ... ...\nYeah well I think some people do it legitimately I'm not saying that they don't but I I some people just lie and say whatever they think they're gonna they should say that you like the the other caller said\nActually tell me she just said it and that is that the campaigns are constantly doing their own bully\nThey are but they're all doing voice for it\nAnd they're all always looking for other questions like where do you think about this what do you think about this issue with that issue because they're looking to get into the issue what I'm saying you the best way to pull is where the pure question one question who you're voting for it's a simple question\nAnd if you don't have information about other people because you're approaching them at a supermarket or an older people or places where they're commonly visiting and you're doing it all over the state\nYou're going to get a much better pool but it's much more difficult pool to do what I'm doing it internally we're volunteers\nHi so what so you've got a week left Joe ... I I I Know you're going nonstop by your calendar is full what can you do in this last week you get you ... you say you're over Seventy percent even further well\nWe're going to just keep doing what we're doing it you know the people after ... can't win this race\nAnd uh you you know the majority of the voters that I Need would come from him and if you want somebody that's honest\nA political person your your your vote for me if you want a guy that invented themselves to be anything and everything they thought he was going to need to be in order to get elected you vote for him but you are voting for a facade he's a facade of a candidate there's nothing real beyond that first saw\nIt and he's proven that every item to everything that I've come out with he is stolen it and try to marry as his policies\nHave your your determined to say that Allen's on can't win why do you not go after governor among do\nI go out to the governor mother won't\nDie give me an example you know I've I've I've constantly\nGoing after it just for the last week I've criticized the fact that she did the pension reform which hurt a lot of people we need to go back reopen and look at it and see what can be done to make some of these people\nThere were people that have retired with Eighteen Eighteen thousand dollar pensions with low Social Security and know coal is\nThat's correct that could go for Twenty years I said I Will form a special commission to look into what we can do to reestablish a coal I've set it off and then I'll and fun picked it up and he uses it five days later I I've\nCriticized that Governor for you it you know that I've said it with you many times on the radio I going down to you were part of interview people she lost six hundred and fifty million dollars because server inability to hire the right people to fix it\nAnd now we find out that uh the the war has got lawsuit all over the country and all over the world for mistakes they made with computer programming from states that country\nAnd she keeps feeding the money\nI mean it goes on and on\nThe other thing I feel is people know Ninety percent of what she's done wrong they don't know Ninety percent of what our fungus thought\nAll right Joe Turner low always\nKnow I'm getting in getting emails as we speak you you definitely make the these social media people\nAnd say you know here you know you're you're in this year in this to win this Mr ...\nIn it for\nThe phone much better vote for that is a little too old for you want to change which they\nAbuse President Trump's headed to Pittsburgh today's the first funerals are held the eleven victims of this weekend's synagogue shooting the president expected to meet with first responders and community leaders are there\nSome familiar with the ensuring the White House debates is the topic of birthright citizenship is come up various times ... an HBO or send us through the ship for babies born to non citizens immigrants who are not authorized to be in the U.

C I witnessed there's\nOh that is a quite a dilemma up there this woman the state representative has been\nReaching out and and and ... I don't know how you want to put it if you're an active bravery I don't know\nThere's a few women up at the state house right she's very young\nUm she says that's the guy he's part of the leadership team and quite frankly nothing done except they shouldn't be near each other and I don't go over there don't don't don't bother with her and when she gets up to testify you you get down get away from her that's not how you handle that situation\nNow all of a sudden ah he's like he's on administrative leave it as his I Wanna see Israel job you know what I'm saying is his uh\nHis position at his

channel twelve declined to discuss\nThe behavior of the person she's accusing she said the emails speaks for itself and all I wanted was a fair hearing why didn't you get a fair hearing why didn't anybody do anything\nSo I heard last night this is the story was buzzing everywhere um you know that it's a\nIt's an interesting situation in the sense that I I don't know how much you wanna get into people's business but it's all it's all been published she came forward that's what's gonna happen she's young she's married he's older she said he's been harassing me for a long time nobody did anything\nFrom what I understand he just had a baby and his family and this is just an an a nightmare I'm sure for everyone involved however\nSeven thirty last night speaker Matty yellow\nAnd as Ted

him and I have removed him as the chairman of the house to do the Judiciary Committee pending clarity of this issue what do you do hear should should have her\nA complaints and allegations have gone to what police um governor Monday put out a statement she weighed in\nAnd she said these allegations of sexual harassment or disturbing and they rode the public's confidence in government there can be no tolerance for sexual harassment at the state house anything less is a disservice to the victims and to the public\nNow there's other Democrats that I'm province represented represented ... he's a Democrat he said he's not going back ... yellow obviously the uh\nRhode Island GOP has weighed in you know going against the Democrats the national organization for women of Rhode Island they have

accompany Catherine ... when she appeared before\nRepresent of people's committee so he he took the initiative to give her someone as she appeared before ... committee and in April of this year he forced cable to leave the hearing room when she was testifying in front of the committee\nThis is kind of wacky is it not I mean am I the only one that thinks this this this is odd the way this was
