I didn't think he would stand me up so I'm Glad you're here um I we we've texted and things like that I Know that you're working with different Republicans to try to help them with their races and you're also on team ... correct\nI Am and how is that going\nI think it's going well uh I think it's going well I think he's out there every day working hard um I think he's\nIs in the air he wants to win that he wants to make Rhode Island a better place for all of us to live\nAnd you stand by your decision even though they you know the Republicans turned around and said okay if you're going with the independent than we're we're grabbing your leadership role year you know you're on the sidelines here\nI'm fine with that I Would I really I ... I I was only going to be there another thirty days anyway I I actually\nLook at the three candidates who are the front runner I'm In that election and I chose based upon what policies and principles they stay in body that I think or ... Rhode Island forward or you know I've always been a policy parts and I've always\nAbout what are the things that will move Rhode Island and Rhode islanders to a better place um\nAnd ah I chose Joe ... low and I am I Am I'm Still I Am still convinced that he is the right person to be our governor\nWhat kind of feedback or you're going going door to door or are you working with local races what's the priority here\nUm you know I Am working for local races as well um I obviously the state house is really important in Rhode Island um the state house or the the general assembly um controls the budget or the governor controls very many parts of government and so nobody can tell me\nThat it is powerless because we have seen that gene or a bundle has absolutely been a disaster with the power she has she has hurt Rhode Island and she has has\nHas made us go backwards not forwards but when it comes to the budget it really is the general assembly that has has the has the rains there so it's important for us to get better people into the state house so yes I'm working with them trying to move them forward\nAnd who are they supposed to we've got an audience here and they're saying\nAll right well ... Collins obviously in my district at George and our don't in Cobb and tree\nI'm Sherry Robertson Coventry my Gary down in Hopkin ten and westerly area um we have a Dan Eliot in in Warwick I'm\nMike Underwood\nWarwick these are all great candidates who would make such a good different in the state house\nShould\nLook at them people should give them their votes\nOkay and so you so these are all Republican candidates obviously I'm a Republican and independent\nAnd independent okay where do you go ... Morgan after January are you going to be I'm Still working I knew the parties is kind of\nTorn I'm a citizen in January\nOkay back to work on a politics what\nI'm back to work yeah you know I've always been a financial adviser um uh so I Will continue to do that I I have no idea what the future holds for me I you\nI'm a person who doesn't sit still very long I Will find some good things to do\nOr not be in politics I have no idea\nYeah I Know in the last couple of weeks um you're going into the primary you were getting a lot of support I was watching it on line you were doing a lot of things on line you're getting a lot of support we're to those people do ... are they are you trying to grab them to go with Joe ... do you think they said oh I've got to sleep with the Republican Party\nYou know I I Hope that they will look at the ... that they will not look at party labels and really look at the people\nAnd the policies de ... that that these these different candidates have and pick the right one for me it's Joe ... so I Do hope they go to Joe Jr although uh\nYou know our state our states in trouble the national economy is growing at nearly ... percent\nWe're bumping along at two that's not acceptable is it better yes\nBut it is not good here in Rhode Island we we really still are the third highest state for losing college graduates nearly Seventy percent of them are leaving I you you texted me yesterday about our educational a report\nYou know they um they're normally uh they're normally released in August so we get to know how our schools are doing generally in August ... what is it it's almost November and we haven't heard yet do you think that that's that's not um\n[noise] that that's a mistake of course it isn't\nWell I did ask you know I got an or\nHas not done the hard work of re forming a really focusing on K. through twelve yep she's thrown free college education out there so that she can buy votes yep she's added early childhood so she can she can buy vote but in\nBut but we she hasn't got the fundamentals down our K. through twelve is still in a bad shape too many kids are are are being graduated without the skills and the tools necessary for them to get jobs\nAnd you know it's it's always about let's throw more money at the problem instead of doing the hard work of reforming our school system\nOf reforming our economy of doing you know getting rid of the bad policies that bad practices that are hurting our small business climate nope it's just about hey I'm let me grab more money from the taxpayers and I'll throw it at my friends or I'll buy votes with it\nYou know I listen you do you have been so vocal and you have been a adamant about on your criticism of of governor among do which begs the question why would you go with your true when he pulls from the Republican Party and gives it to her\nI I don't think that's true Tara I think a vote for Joe ... is a vote for Joe trail oh not for Gina for Joe ... and there is a pathway for him to when\nI Know that that uh the other candidate in the race has used that as his monitor that's all he is running on but that doesn't make him the best person to be our governor\nJoined about Alan ... yes you don't want to name him\nAll right Alan son uses that as as much but that's all at least God that's all he's got because he doesn't have the policies he doesn't have the backbone he doesn't really I I you know if\nHe's been running for six years and I don't see that he has developed a real understanding of state government of what's broken what needs to be facts how it will be fixed I think Joe trailer was up there yeah he was up there for a long time he has a lot of experience to call him an insider is not fair\nHe is experienced he was fighting all that time against those bad policies so\nWe know where they are and he knows which one is to choose and he knows which ones to reform\nGovernor for Rhode Island that's why I endorsed him\n... Morgan is on the line right now do um I also asked you if you knew anything about a D.C ... report is that an overall report that's about to be released or yeah you\nKnow I did call 'em they're worth Thirteen death or near death\nIn the last year or the little a little boy who died just what it was this weekend\nYes a would be fourteen um\nThere is there's a I really really liked the child advocate by the way she has\nUm she is going she's doing the work she's studying each one of these cases she comes forward with\nA really\nI've read the reports they are heartbreaking to hear about these little children who are so badly abused and treated by the people who should loved them the most um but\nShe weighed into it she finds a she treats won as an investigation and comes forward with recommendation unfortunately again governor ... do\nIgnores the recommendations um she is not doing the hard work of making sure that D.C YIF works well for those poor children um there are children and\nAnd we should we should hold her accountable\nTo have Thirteen desk or near death in one year\nNot acceptable and I believe\nFour of those were death um and the rest are near death\nThat's just not acceptable I guess it's five with the little boy who died\nA this weekend so five death\nOr not acceptable we need to do better she needs to do better you know she she got the title and she checked out of Rhode Island she went off to for fancy cocktail parties\nHer political pro cronies in place and then didn't monitor them\nUm she has been a disaster for Rhode Island we need a better governor and for me that's ...\n... will keep in touch and ah let us know off things develop if anything comes amazingly long before election day\nOkay thank you [laughter]\nYou'd have representatives in March he says you're going back to being a private citizen or after after January right Chris hold on for three eight nine seven seven six four three eight WPRI we'll discuss\nWhether it's um he's getting down to the wire and it's getting nasty with the emails and pick your candidate you've got a little over a week to make that decision for three eight WPRI them\nFormer China it's an employee you stick to ... am on the gubernatorial candidate for spilling motor roiling war with somebody if you're a sleep lab can cut off as a matter of fact he says more evidence Joe ...

I don't know if I was with us a cell that evidence and let me know you think wait in\nLove with what we're looking at ... yeah that's right we're we're told that that's a that's the place or where the arrest of may not have don't believe this is the home of the effect\nOf the suspects live a few miles away or in another location there this is all in the suburban area of Miami all of this\nIs all within a few miles of each other the ... a postal processing facility is just down the road in ah just north of Miami a plantation as a southern Broward County and the ... on the side effects\nLives not far away also in the same general region so the FBI or has been a certainly moving all their resources or the ATF and the uh the u._s. postal inspection service\nAll of them were sending all of their resources to the same area because they knew\nThat that is the likely place where this was all going to and and so uh what you're saying there the pictures you're seeing there I Believe is home it's a it's a business and this uh this person was a was ... was put into custody a there this morning without incident it appears according to sources we've been talking to\nThe way a part of your stars is the first or second investigated visit us not his or her I\nBelieve this was not as home a movie lives in another location or not far away from there\nAnd just watching us with you trying to see what else we can say as a tow truck is moving in obviously positioning of this and we're going to keep an eye on this as as the same time also getting out from CNN was stark I'm ... Evans that I'm Jeff Sessions is actually at the White House as I say [noise]\nRight right that's right the uh just Sessions is frozen briefing the president this is exactly how this and this is a situation where you would do is a case of this kind of national importance\nAnd given the fact that this is something a touching on ... on politics and political figures\nAnd we are a few days when the election this is the most important case going on in the nation and so this is something that the attorney general would definitely go personally brief the\nPresident's let them know how this has been resolved and I believe one of the things that you're looking at the pictures they're of a of a vehicle I Believe that might be um a vigorous associated with the suspects and that's the reason why you're seeing the tow truck and\nAll of that activity there but this is how\nOr what they would do is take us back to make sure that these are the components anything\nThat's associated thing can be of concern they want to make sure they're secure its so that nobody in the public gets harmed but that's what you're seeing there in uh in those pictures is a is anything associated with the suspects will be taken into custody would be searched by the FBI to make sure that uh that is render safe\nAnd to make sure that the businesses there can go back to to their works\nAbsolutely can we just say and the song is around that I mean we started the morning with an eleventh and twelfth package being picked up bombs was being called back in\nMore fear more talk of domestic terror and this moment of relief to see an arrest made out of ... in this case um\nFor everyone involved in a ... for for us to you and then people in the public eye and then also law enforcement what's happening right now
