[noise]\nWelcome back in Nineteen fifty three on this Monday morning it's been a very busy time and a late last week I was reaching out to the\nUh executive director of the ACLU here in Rhode Island that Steven Brown of course um and he's been busy with a a a big case\nAnd so over the weekend we we said you don't want to I'm going to he put out a statement but I said I I really wanted to speak with him talking about the situation in Providence which I haven't seen this ah I don't think I've ever seen something like this before and I don't know if\nIf we have in general it's a\nVery specific case involving Richard Gardner who is a convicted\nServe a convicted child kidnapper and rapist\nOr served on was Thirty years in prison his case\nPredates Megan law so certain things don't apply to him\nAs far as being a registered sex offender and where you can live and et cetera and he uh technically can live anywhere he wants to prominence Washington park neighborhood is not having it at all they've been protesting his house banging pots and pans shining lights in the windows they want to get rid of him\nOh by law or according to the ACLU I wanted to speak with Stephen Brown so good morning Mr Brown appreciate your time good morning [noise] I Try to set it up I don't know who is in on aware of this story because he you know it really\nTook over last week pretty much um the news cycle you put out a statement ... where's the ACLU on this it's tough I there seemed like there's no answer here\nWell I mean it it certainly does have a lot of issues and you know I understand the emotional concerns that the residents of the neighborhoods have but you know there there are few important yeah back to what matters to keep in mind um and this has to do with the way\nThe law and others treat sex offenders generally that's often not only ineffective but often counter productive in promoting the safety of the public so for example um it certainly would seem better to know a rare where Richard Gardner is living if people are concerned about it than\nA forcing him out of his house making him home with you know what's happened with other laws the general assembly as an active here and having no idea\nWhere where these individuals are um everybody has a lot safer knowing that he's in a particular place the police know where he is a it doesn't help to\nTo make people like um like him homeless\nOr you know I think another important point is to keep in mind you know this is a high profile case but the fact of the matter is there are hundreds of people who spent time in prison mhm whether it's for sex offenses or other serious crimes who are living\nUs up there in the neighborhood um\nAnd particularly when it comes to issues of child sexual assault which ... which is you know I hate crime um the statistics though are overwhelming that the fear you ought to have is with people you know family members um people you trust\nI'm not about Ninety percent of all child molestation cases are or not you know strangers are people like Richard gardener the\nPeople you know um and you get a false sense of security if you focus on him and say well if we get rid of him now we're going to be safe um that's just not the case I think it's really important that you know everybody try to think through what are the ultimate consequences\nOf of focusing on him trying to kick him out I'm I'm not sure really does what everybody is thinking it's going to do yeah\nI had just about twenty seconds I Know I see you in here because of scheduling buy off the brown you sent sent your statement and a letter to a narrow lord said do you think he handled that poorly by a kind of revving up the crowd and saying we don't want him here yeah\nI think that was very unfortunate uh you know the last thing that is helpful is some sort of mob mentality and you you would want the mayor and other public officials to try to\nThings down and not hype things off I I think those comments were unfortunate\nArts even brown the taking of director of the road island ACLU and thank you for your time thank you are All right we're going to continue this conversation yeah more it was very

O. Y. and we look at about twelve or Thirteen different factors\nThat measure more broadly prosperity you know I mean what were you know we hear from the left off and while if you're working a job but you're not\nBut you're not rising out of poverty and really what good is that job and there's a point to that that's true so do we what we look at three areas you know what basic unemployment rate numbers we look at all the ratio of taxes paid to private income burned\nAnd we look at the number of people working as compared to the number of people earning social services and those are the three broad factors the Thirteen so factors break into when you look at that\nYes every state reason or the governor's staff looking back in Nineteen eighty nine 'cause the the the national economy is performing historically well there's never been better as the president but never has been in every state is rising because of that the problem is four dollars rising slower than almost\nEvery other state so while yes things are improving on Rhode Island all the states are doing better and we're being left behind\nSo forty six [laughter] what about our neighbors in Massachusetts you look at that in comparison\nYeah we do um their um ... where the ... were the worst of New England by far let me see if I can pull up the chart for them a Massachusetts to see where are they are charged here\nUm my three little current there but I'm just I'm I'm always wondering because we're so very similar granted there thirty ... thirty cents okay\nConnecticut is I'm thirty nine so you know high tax states or that but again it's a ratio of tax income the unemployment rate doesn't care if you work two hours a week or two hundred by lugging check the box that I work this week right doesn't care whether you're earning\nWhat your work or not you might be it might be worth eighty thousand dollars on a forty thousand dollar your job that doesn't care how much you pay in taxes\nMm all our factor looks at all those because we we believe those are more fairly represented a true prosperity are not poverty right how how much leeway earning a much by paying taxes and how many\nAm I working at full capacity or not the unemployment rate doesn't care about any of those things that's why for the governor or anybody else to pick cherry pick that I'll\nIt it's really such a narrow an incomplete inadequate metric of what's going on in our state yeah I'm Glad to see things are improving our state but other states are doing more\nRight help there are people become more prosperous and we'd like to see what I Want to do the same so where\nDo you say you know you get rewarded if you were encouraging small business grows and creating the quality jobs as opposed to the you know the spice sporadic jobs and what is blocking Rhode Island can you tell from the next Mike what is blocking us from growing at a faster rate as some of our neighbors would they\nWell the the um factor the of the three ... a self made yourself back or the one that we do the worst is what we all the prosperity factor which is that I mentioned earlier the ratio of this is statewide totals out like total income orange comparative total taxes pay\nAnd that's where we do the work I think Iraq forty seven on that one factor alone so so that means that we're not it means we're paying a high amount of taxes\nCompared to a relatively low income as compared again with the rest of the state so we've got to reduce tax burden we've got to bring in more and better jobs\nAnd we've got to do that by we believe by lessening our tax environment lessening are burdensome regulatory environment we don't think corporate welfare strategy of the governor discusses\nBrings in enough jobs that brings in a couple of hundred maybe a

Mahdi Potter it can a party candidate William Gilbert Gilbert and independent Joe ... plus they asked independent Luis Daniel Muniz the doctor Dr moon is\nOr how they would respond to three questions written by the journal and the public's radios and honest if given the opportunity\nSo they all rode back their answers there were three questions that they didn't quite get into this debate\nI think that's pretty smart right your time runs out but there are other topics that they want to cover so they said would you write back your answers and will publish them\nSo they all did except for Joe ... he didn't write back now I don't understand that you're up there in the debate you say you know ... you know I'm I'm very serious my campaign but he didn't answer them back I so I don't know\nWhat that entails but I'll just tell you that that's what they're printing the Providence Journal that everyone wrote back but him but the question that I wanted to tie into what the what we were just talking about with my extent house\nAnd you can weigh in on I Know or a couple of people before the break that wanted to talk about what Mike was saying for three eight nine seven seven six four three eight WPRI all the question that was opposed to the candidates for governor\nThe state budget is more reliant on gambling revenues and it was four years ago\nAnd there are proposals from lawmakers and the gambling industry to expand gambling in the state is the state's reliance on gambling a cause for concern that if elected would you support allowing either on line betting or bending it more locations other than the current Wind River casinos\nSo that's the question that was put out there\nAnd then the has the other one um this is the one I wanted to to tie in with my extent if economists expect a recession at some point in the next decade with the state budget up by eight hundred million dollars", "show_name": "Tara Granahan", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "22"}
