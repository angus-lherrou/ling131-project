will be there until further notice as well as an angry community medium is built into the streets the city's Washington park neighborhood last\nNight you know it's it's a only option so we'll see we'll sit down this morning rethink\nWhat we can do with this and but for now the ... who would say in you know what's that we've got to keep him safe\nTo Providence released made you David low pay new tells is that the neighbors in that area Washington park that they are justified in their concern about Richard Gardner\nNotification upon release of your residence before you leave for pool all before you're out\nUm if they if the um sex offender move they have to notify within twenty four hours the police of where they're going and they cannot live within three hundred feet of the school originally it was um a thousand and over the years it was amended to um [noise]\nThree hundred image and the bill was in Nineteen Ninety five and it's been several upgrades to it over the years but the issue has always been that the local police departments\nIt's always been hot for them to keep track of all of this and um I might say I was listening to your program and um I I'd be remiss if I didn't say that the correctional office used to have um\nA monthly newsletter called the guardian\nMhm they would\nPost all sex offenders where they lived and it was ... when a map and their name mhm and it was\nA a service to the community that was a free paper and it was put in all the neighborhoods I don't see that alone anymore\nYou know so I'm able to\nGo ahead what how does that play into when I was saying oh Joanne Jean and he's on the line former state rep um you know if you have children in the public school system\nAnd I don't know about the private school system because my kids went to public school but you would get a letter when someone was released from prison sex offender you'd get a letter with the address that the the right down to the you know the number on the house where they were going to live\nI don't know if it's because of you know where it is in relation to schools locations of schools but I I\nKind of dropped it up to their warning you that there's a level whatever sex offender right up there within a certain amount of radius to where you are so if they're you know so many miles from your home and you get that letter if you have kids in school because I don't get them anymore\nNo and and they also would have a website which I Believe they still do that you could go on and check but a lot of people are not aware of that and ah they could go on the local police department and check\nOn these notifications but some people do not and and\nBasically the only I I it was interesting I read the paper this morning and it said the police\nAre the only ones then notified if the address but\nCouncilman upon T said that he ... he didn't disclose but a police officer anonymously gave him the address so the address ... posted on Facebook\nWould sure did I saw it a couple of nights\nAgo and I did too when I saw it I cringe because you know I mean we can't\nAs much as we don't like these things cattle and we're all upset we cannot take the mad as into our own hands up police have enough of a hard time\nDoing this and I'm sure the mayor's upset I Know that people are upset but we can't you know they they will I mean when we did when the bill was done the ACLU I'm opposed it there was some ... voted against it the ... and being a vigilante\nComing forward right and also the fact that people if they serve their time that they deserved a right\nTo be able to rehabilitate and live in society\nTo the best of your knowledge ah Joanne he can live any I I like to to all of the reporting he can live anywhere he wants he can go over the state lines do right\n[noise] yeah once he's lived or if there's no restrictions especially since he doesn't have on the ankle\nRewrite on he's got he can go anywhere he wants ... and so you know that the that the the thought process probably for those people those neighbors that are altogether now and there there are they are you know becoming a force because they want to protect their children and their neighbors\nUm if they figure probably will push him out and maybe we'll go to another state well and get rid of a ...\nOnly was convicted I Believe he in Massachusetts yes and so I mean I we end\nUp in Washington park I don't know he\nServed in both Massachusetts in Rhode Island presence\nBut but what happened but I think I bet he was originally from Massachusetts\nAnd they had a woman on last night that was a one of the victims selling if that was talking about it but I mean\nAt once they serve their time and as long as they do that notification process yes he can go um where he wants the unless the judge it puts some stipulation on his uh\nOn his sentence which I don't see and I don't think that they they have done so I see no evidence of that from what we have about this um I I don't know exactly\nWhat the mayor can do other than the police will do I feel a little pay and on this morning and he you know all they can do is monitoring it\nRight but I don't believe that under the law now they talk about wanting to go back I saw a legislative want to go back or you go back in January you put the love and it's going to take a while to do that right and what what will they do you also have constitutional issues here\nI don't know if they were able to do I remember all the it wasn't an easy bill Ben and write the is it hasn't been easy and um the notification process I mean the way it was a divided into um [noise]\nThe sex offenders themselves were divided into categories to so different um provisions will put on each category\nSo it it is an easy thing to get to where you can say well I'm going to go back in time and fix it because it doesn't work that way some of these bills take is to get\nRight well that's what I was in even if I'm speaking with former state representative Joanne gene any even if you did like you said if if if the general assembly goes back in ... after the first of the year after elections after this after that she gets all settled in and they want it to you know pick a\nNew look at the at the laws ... that's not going to apply to this guy\nNo he's glad ... you know I use the\nWord grandfather then but even when when I when we were done like things like Brendan for\nI mean it was on based on the case of Brendan Koerner who's um who's father had had 'em beat him to a pope we could not go back and prosecute him he only received like in six months and he was out there were no laws on that\nAt the time ... so so you can't go back you can't go back to active you can only go at and and um if they perceived that they can\nPut in legislation to strengthen the law which they can always do it doesn't become immediately affect of and it takes time to go through\nHaving ... and both houses and having 'em in both the house and Senate and then uh it has to make it to the host for and then it has to make it to the governor of the signature\nSo I mean it'd be interesting to see what kind of legislation they will put it I mean they have a a lot of um attorneys in the assembly\nAnd and these kinds of laws and not easy to get brutality\nRight no I I understand we all we often say you know why can't you just go up there and ... and everybody sign on board you know but then someone's going to ... everything takes time\n[laughter] it does everything I just said no it doesn't work or you know unfortunately\nIt took years and it takes is that these things to go to so\nI mean right now all the police can do is monitor the situation and try to keep a piece from happening on both sides you know but it is upsetting and the only question I had and I said this this morning is I wanted like they had to know\nBefore they can they knew he was being released a long time and they had to know quite a while ahead of time where he was being released to why did this just come oh\nJust now in other words it just seems like the notification I'm just cut known now and after it was already done you know so\nIt it's just something to think about it's one of those cases that it's almost stand alone right it probably will never happen again like like because the laws have been changed but like when he predates his situation predates making law and they are ... and\nIn the oil and and even if they would go in and make a law if it's not going to apply to him unless he did something else to\nTo let him back into the system right you know\nAll right Joe in gene any former state rep are representing Providence for many years you want to politics now Joanne\nWell still in now [laughter] you know supporting people on\nThe
