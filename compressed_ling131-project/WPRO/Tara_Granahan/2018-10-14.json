exam on the property that means is titled example go back forty or fifty years depending on the circumstances\nAnd make sure that there are no title issues that could be a red flag for your purchase\nWhat else would you ordinarily do uh most of the time the closing attorney will handle all of the adjustments will make sure that the mortgage is a paid off\nWell also make sure that any proceeds that you bring to closing a distributed accordingly you know oftentimes you read in the paper that you know unfortunately escrow attorneys and things of that nature been having problems with\nEscrow funds and utilizing them for their own purposes and that's that's a shame and it shouldn't happen but it does happen unfortunately and you want to have somebody who you know you can trust look you're making a purchase of several hundred thousand dollars it makes sense to pick your own attorney\nIf you're allowed to do it why wouldn't you why would you want somebody or a third party person to represent you when they don't even know who you are\nSo listen ordinarily starts with the purchasing sales agreement and then it moves forward through a closing\nNow very different types of closings that you can have you can have a refinance closing you can have a purchase closing and also you could do commercial real estate let's say you're buying selling commercial real estate there are many different issues that come up now I'm just going to give you an example\nUh you're selling a piece of property let's say you have it in a limited liability company if you aren't represented and you're trying to do this yourself you're going to hit several road box because\nSo in order to convey good title when you're selling commercial real estate generally you need to get a good standings ticket from the Rhode Island division of taxes you need to get a good standings she's definitely get\nFrom the Rhode Island ... secretary state corporations\nThen you also need to have a vote of corporate vote for all the members voting to sign the purchase sales agreement in to buy the property indoor borrow money so all of these things have to be prepared and if you try to do it yourself I'm going to tell you gonna run into\nProblems especially if you're an able to perform you certainly don't want to lose your buyer or your cellar\nSo think about it you have the right to choose who you want to represent you make the choice and hire somebody such as myself who has the experience and expertise in the area who can help guide you through the process\nAlready so what kind of questions how we had a this week in you know I like to make a note of questions that I received and talking about different things\nAre very recently a brother and sister while the brother came in and saw me so he inherited a house with his sister it was their parents' house and in fact he's living in it with his sister now it's a two family house who use on one floor and she lives on the other\nThe intention between them\nWas that eventually they were going to sell this property\nBut now it's been several years and he's kind of stuck he doesn't want to be in this house anymore he wants to sell the property but he's been told by several attorney said he can't and the reason why he can't is because he needs her signature on the property\nSo he's stuck in in addition to that he's paying all the taxes he's paying all of the insurance and utilities so he feels like he's being taken advantage of apparently he's tried to discuss this with his sister he's had open conversations with her and that was the first thing I asked him I said\nHave you had these conversations with her and he said yes I Am but\nThe reality is that she doesn't care and um and now she stopped talking to him after he said he saw an attorney\nSo you want to do is what is right so what can he do to get himself out of this situation he wants to move on he wants to sell the house well his obligation or his rights are\nTo seek judicial in intervention I mean to go to court and ask a judge to force the sale of the real estate this situation is very common and it happens\nMore often than you think and you would say why does it have to come to that point to get out it's because when somebody's name is on a deed and they refused to sell or they refused to do anything convey the property writing\nThe only way to get their name off the deed is essentially the force the sale of the property and that's called partition in real estate essentially what you're doing is you're going to the court and you say in court I'm a fifty percent owner of this property I Need to partition\nBreak up our own ship so that I can get out of the off the deed and get my equitable interests and in fact unfortunately that's the type of complaint that we're gonna be filing and a and I'm sure that's going to be more headache before it's going to get worse before it gets better\nBut the court will not the court will order the property to be sold the property can either be sold by use of a commissioner which is essentially a court appointed attorney which costs both sides a ton of money\nOr it can be done privately between the parties so ordinarily the filing of the complaint the service of the complaint getting the initial orders from the court\nIs sufficient to compel the other side to do this because they don't want to waste their money for no reason now the ... she's probably going to understand that he's very serious on this and that this is what he wants to do and you know it's too bad that he has to spend the amount of money that he needs to spend to get this done but\nHe sees no other way and the way he's looking at it is\nIf he pays another year of taxes if he pays another year of insurance I mean that's that's what he's paying to go through this partition action and essentially it's a wash and he needs to get out so you know when you inherit property\nAnd somebody doesn't have a will and they don't tell you what they want done with the property for example\nUm I leave my real estate to Joe and sue and but Joe has to buyout sue or they have to sell the real estate within a year whatever have some sort of condition on it\nOftentimes folks get trapped with multiple loners on deed for example five and six children could be on a deal all at once and you know the old don't get along so these\nActions happen more often than you think and these it happens because people can't resolve their differences unfortunately and in this case he's kind of trapped and I kinda feel for that so anyway this is attorney\nSteven ghosts of legal for heading into our first break the number here is four oh one fourth reexamined seven Seventy six but what how to three two one

I wasn't happy with my I I really want it to just say forget it\nBut when you clear it up and we'll pass but he showed me that there's not a big deal and I went with it and I went by and they said they couldn't find it and I thank God I found that with my papers I went through all my ... and ... across\nI brought it back to them and I said I Want the fund immediately released than they did okay let it happen if I couldn't have found that this shot\nWell here's the thing like for example when I when I represent people at closings if that issue comes up um there are services and so\nBut the issue is ... and just so everybody understands when you have a mortgage on your property that is an discharge even though it's paid off\nIt creates a lean on your title now this means that the purchaser really has title insurance but in order for them to get title insurance to get a mortgage or they have to be able to show the bank that they have good title to the property right makes sense now in this particular circumstance\nThe part that I'm not really following for you is that maybe somebody didn't know something that maybe I Know for example\nUh when this comes up when I'm representing sellers in real estate I use a a a title insurance company called ... title insurance I'm a registered title agent with them which means I can write title insurance policies and I can issue policies of insurance for mortgages and owners\nAnd um [noise] so they have a\nThey have a process where if you run into this\nKind of bugs or of a situation\nWhat they will do is they will verify that the mortgages paid allow you to get your money and they will chase down that discharge for you they actually have a complete service for this which means that you could have gotten your Seventy five thousand dollars they would have a team to discharge your mortgage and um and\nThey would have gotten process probably a lot faster because it sounds like Joe if you didn't find that discharge a mortgage or probably you would have been calling me saying how do I get my money\nRight yeah so there were there are services out there for this exact situation Joe and it sounds like you weren't advice of that\nNo I mean looking back I should have just said I'm not close in on this property until it gets settled in in the cloud over it I mean I'm sure that they could have found that eventually but at what cost you know attorney said and are we going to try to correct the style of\nCourse of course like well not only that Joe think of the interest you lost on your money it costs you money to get through this transaction and and to show up at the closing in somebody to say by the way we're going to hold back Seventy five thousand dollars my opinion would have been your your gut instincts were a hundred percent correct I Would have said to you\nJoe perhaps we don't close today was give it a couple of weeks let me see if I can research ... let me see if I get in touch with my a title insurance companies see what they can do you know what I mean and that way you know when you close\nYou get your money the worst situation is when you close the money is held in escrow and there's an escrow never do that just close and B you want to closure transaction and you want to be done and move on\nIf I mean if I didn't find that a lot of that money\nNot as a result of my era\nI was defaulted but I still want my day in court now Ninety nine percent of the time unless there's a real unusual circumstance the court will allow you to do that in in this particular circumstance\nWe're going to go on the grounds of what's called excusable neglect now what excusable neglect is it means that look\nI neglected to answer the complaint but I have an excuse and my excuses I gave the paperwork to my attorney he never filed a she didn't file anything with the court and now I've been defaulted listed I still walk by day in court so unfortunately\nThis client is now paying me to do that in addition to defending the mic in court and it becomes you know a little bit of a sticky what'd you and it adds a layer to your case that you really don't want to have to deal with\nSo listen if you get served paperwork maybe it's a paperwork or it could be anything left and it could be on a partition action could be as owning action\nIt could be appropriate action what you served with ... understand you must respond it's harder to set aside a default because once the other side gets a default they don't want to give that up\nBecause that means it's like they get to spike the ball they won the game so why do we want to give that up they don't want to do that to just be sure that if you served paperwork talk to an attorney who's going to respond to you and who's going to get the job done already know the question that I received\nHad to do\nWith the uh issue we talked about last week and last week I was talking about nuisance and what a nuisance says and that there are two different types of nuisances and I said for example\nYou buy a house you live in your house and somebody constructs next to you for example a recycling facility and that causes orders and noise and and now that's a nuisance so you you have a ... allowed to ask the court to intervene\nIn this particular circumstance\nThis neighbor is having a problem with their neighbor the neighbors playing loud music every night of the week and this is in a very nice neighborhood and you would think that things like this really shouldn't be happening but they do over\nUm you know it's just over something that was said to somebody and now all of a sudden there's all this hate in anger\nAnd unfortunately this person now doesn't know what to do they\nThey're sleeping in the opposite side of the house but they can still hear the music they called the police the police come out the people lower the music down\nAnd then they put the speaker back in the window and turn the music on so what is a recourse you know I said number one you want to get a camera and put a camera up someplace on that side of the house or you can actually have video evidence of it\nAnd number two we can petition the court to get a temporary restraining order on the grounds of nuisance on the grounds that it's creating a hardship and interfering with your enjoyment of your property in addition we may be able to ask\nFor legal fees although understand in Rhode Island um of Rhode Island follows what's called the American rule now this means that if you go to court ordinarily you're responsible for your own cost\nBut in this circumstance based on the grounds of nuisance we're going to be petitioning the court\nFor a temporary restraining order and possibly a permanent restraining order restricting and enjoying the neighbor\nFrom sticking a speaker in the window and blaring it out the house I mean you know sometimes you say to yourself is it necessary to go this route but unfortunately there are no other avenues\nHow does this person get this problem resolved and that's that's how we're going to fix it for them and hopefully once we get a court order the neighbor who's got the speaker in the window will realize that they don't want to have to spend tons of money to go to court over this and maybe a little cut it out\nAlready another question that came up\nHad to do\nWith I'm dealing with with um what's called well let me put it this way\nYou own real estate for example many times people go see an attorney and the attorney will prepare a deed now sometimes a deed is there to add\nA spouse to the deed or to add a brother or sister to a deep or to add a significant other or a child to a deep many times however I find out that people really don't know what the deed means\nSo let me just talk about this a little bit because this question is about many times in my office and matter of fact he came up on a recent case in this case had to do with a gentleman who added his second wife to his seat\nNow in the same time he had a will\nThat said that his fifty percent interest in the house goes to his children and actually his new wife would get his other fifty percent interest and in this situation he ended up passing away but the deed was worded wrong\nThe deed said you only tenants and what that means is upon his passing she gets it entirely it never goes to his will\nSo when you're signing a deed understand the difference between tenants in common which means you're fifty percent goes to\nYour state or joy tenets means that goes to them this is an attorney ... west signing off this week what a wonderful week we had thank you so much for listening and thank you for calling in\nI truly appreciate you and I know you appreciate me and of course if you're dealing with a problem you can give me a call four oh one for nine zero forty nine hundred for one for nine zero forty nine hundred\nAgain we'll be back next week we'll see that [noise]\n\n\nWhenever it rains it's hard not to think about the folks right here in our community who have no roof over their heads wouldn't it be nice to give them a dry place to sleep tonight or

Amsterdam New York yesterday for the funeral of age of twenty people killed in the limousine crash a week ago\nSeveral times and maybe we can talk about a little bit in the future but they've been talking about wanting to purchase bank owned properties because when they're looking at the marketplace they're seeing that those are the lower end of the market property\nI'm I have to tell you that I Do not love\nSelling a bank owned property to a retail customer a retail customer meaning somebody who is going to buy a home to move into it okay um I I Love getting people a discount Idaho which many times you can get from buying a bank owned property but it doesn't come\nWithout some problems um you know\nNothing in life is free so yes you get a value or a ... a perceived value on a property but again it comes with some underlying problem the first thing\nThat uh I think is a problem for a retail bar buying bank owned homes is just identifying a property to begin with okay many bank owned homes are listed on the MLS um others are listed at various websites REO real estate owned and and that's a term that the banks use to talk about their\nProperties that they're selling so there are many REO Web sites that you can go to to find the stuff\nBut a lot of it is quick turnaround\nUm you know might might be just a matter of a day or two before those properties go under contract or it might be a you know even a week or two before they go under contract before they're willing to accept a bit but a lot of times you know um\nIt's tough to get the buyer who has a job and their spouse has a job to match up their schedules get them out there looking at the property um\nThen maybe identify what's wrong with it a lot of times\nThey want to bring in contractors are bringing other people to get some advice and be time by the time that happens the house has gone and has sold to somebody else okay um so that's you know that's a big problem and and these\nThese properties a lot of times they're they're not well just scripted on the Internet so you might only see one exterior photo um or a couple of photos and\nVery limited comments about it so you don't really realize how bad they are to get out there and then you know like holy crap this houses even worth what they're asking for it so there's a lot of running around um then let let's say that you do identify a property and it hasn't sold yet\nWe're winning that competitive bid is definitely difficult for a retail buyer\nOkay many bank owned properties have deferred maintenance because the person who who own the home before obviously didn't have money they didn't have money to make improvements in in this market where we've seen prices continue to rise if they weren't able to get out of their home um\nYou know sell their home and pay off their mortgage many times it's due to the condition of the property so\nThe banks understand this and the banks aren't going to want to sell our home to somebody who has a traditional lending product that is not going to allow for\nThese issues that the home has so a lot of times the banks are going to choose a bitter that is paying cash 'em or using private financing so they're going to if you had 'em all things being equal they're going to go for\nThe the option that has less a barrier so they're going to go to the cash person so that where they don't have to worry about an appraisal because if you try to get a certain appraisal program now many first time buyers they're going to use F ha or they're gonna use VA they don't have a large down payment to put down um\nYou know these programs are going to allow for houses that have problems they're also going to require that utilities be turned on to get inspections and many times in these situations you can't get utilities turned on so\nIt's going to be tough for you to get that winning bid and like I said before you have to be nimble like a guy like me drives my house and makes a bit on it or I can look on the computer and make a bid on it if you have to get your your\nFather in law in there you're you know a friend who's in construction and you're going to do all this stuff\nUm [noise] never mind that the bank isn't going to look at your offer\nThe same as a cash offer you're not even going to get a chance to get your offer in there because you you took too long I'm In and you know if you get a low ball because of of the house needs work\nYou know you need to understand what the work actually cost and then price you're offer accordingly because if you do a major low ball you're not going to get the home there's people that are willing to work on short margins or if they are and owner occupant they're willing to to work on and just getting a little equity and you know you can use it to all three K loan which\nIs a way that will give you money to do the improvements I'm too if there are necessary improvements so there are the chances that you can get through a competitive it I'm just telling you that it's difficult for you now let's say you do get through the computer competitive bid\nA lot of times these banks will allow you to do home inspections but again the utilities aren't on so maybe they don't want you to put your Chili's on maybe they allow you to the winter rise to turn the utilities on 'em and then\nOf course you have to re which arise and that's all your expense um\nAnd you know if there's a problem found\nIn many many occasions they're not going to fix it so you went through all this expense\nTo uncover these issues and all that does is allow you to get out of the contract but it's not gonna give you the opportunity to move forward again unless you get a different type of loan program that provides for this and that's something that\nIf you were my client and you were looking at bank owned properties we would talk about that in the beginning um so\nYou know the inspection and then we'll ... we'll throw in getting through the appraisal as a problem along with that as well the appraisers are going to new things um maybe there's some safety issues that you know like there's no railings on the stairs or there's peeling paint 'em\nThere could be other issues that could lead to long term problems like a leaking rules for leaking pipes are some things that they're not going to allow you the bank won't give it a loan with these issues and then finally if if you were fortunate enough to get through all those issues\nA lot of times it's difficult to get clear title on these properties um\nYou know it takes a takes a while to get through and worked through some of the legal stuff that they have to do because\nThat these homes were foreclosed on\nAnd because the the loans were sold at some point in different banks have closed in different issues I'm so like if you were planning on oh let me let me by this bank owned a home and we're going to go to a closing in thirty forty five or sixty days like we would a traditional sale all's well and good and maybe that you would but you have to\nFigure out that there may be a clear or a title problem which if it takes a long time you know you might be homeless if you gave notice for your apartment you know that that might be a problem or if you sold another house um and then you might lose your great luck so\nYou know there are problems associated with these by bank owned homes different sites offer different problems in different solutions I find that the best place for a retail buyer to buy a bank on home is through the HUD home store which are\nFormer F ha homes that got foreclosed on but they they do come with clear title and they've had they've cleared the title before they put them on the market they do come already appraised and somewhat inspected\nI feel like you have your best chance of getting to the finish line\nThere um they do look at your ... as a dollar for dollar bed so they don't um\nThey don't look at a cash videos any better than an effigy aided so that's something you have some sites like home steps are home path which offer Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac homes\nThose homes you know they do have some advantages for\nA home buyers as well with maybe some things pre inspected maybe special financing programs set up um or you know and and maybe they offer them to owner occupant first so that might be a good place for you know in Iraq to look at\nAnd then there's other sites like hubs zoo auction dot com and some of those that I just feel like a really made for the investor and uh\nYou know if you're an owner occupant difficult they're All right I'm getting\nThe take a break signed for my main man Tyler on the other side of the glass and you're getting the call up your boy Paul's relative side right now

have the pre game and not the real estate insiders will get in here now we'll get your real estate questions answered All right we're going to go to the phone lines\nTo Jerry in darkness good morning Jerry how are you today\nYet I'm fine thank you and good morning\nA I have a broker a ... a fellow property for me and\nA a indicated we now have an ... which looks like it'd be a reasonable ah the control buyer gun owner financing and I'm not against that\nUh what I was going to ask what ah what what questions do I need to uh ... what do I need to have coverage not giving any details of the uh control buyers offer a preferred that in person we meet a this week\nAnd I just want to be prepared to cover whatever\nTime frame is being able to accept or reject the counter offer\nDo you own the property free and clear\nYes you do I mean now that property I knew that there is a mortgage\nUs so you you know for you to ... ... well does he want you to take on second position owner financing like meaning he's gonna get a first mortgage and you're holding a second or does he want you to hold the first mortgage\nThat one of the other is not mentioned to me yet to do that one and we meet but\nUh that's one of the questions or I Would have but I I don't and and to be in second positioning\nOkay so then if he wants you to be in first position than for you to hold a mortgage are going to have to pay off\nThe current loan obviously 'cause 'cause you when you hold a mortgage induced seller financing you actually transferred title to the new buyer should they ... they own the property you're acting as the bank so you can't still have your loan on the property that your paying so that has to be paid off you you have that right\nGeron yes yes I understand okay okay so\nThen let's look at the important things to you I'm a I Want to know how much down payment they ... they're going to be able to put down if I'm going to provide owner financing I'm hoping to get us [laughter]\nI Want them to pay over market right because if if if they're just paying market price I can sell it to somebody else and not deal with the owner financing um that right I Want them to have significant skin in the game so\nI'd like to see a big deposit um and then we're the we're the rate in terms of what are they going to pay you back is this going to be a short term um or do they have\nLike why did I Want to know why do they need owner financing like a lot of times it's like okay somebody had to bankruptcy so many years ago\nAnd they need to be so many years discharged before they can buy a home or it's oh they have a settlement coming because they got injured at work and they just want to get ahead of it and by the house now and you know the settlements or just a few months away and and they're going to have that and then they'll pay it off then are they inherited or\nOh they they just opened a new business and they need to have two years' tax returns\nFrom their new business before they're financially qualify Abul so um\nSo that's why like I don't want to you know like I Need to know a real reason why they're why they're\nI'm finding using owner financing and depending on what their down payment is I mean the bigger the down payment the less I care you want to give me fifty percent down\nThen I'm not so worried about how you pay me back because I'll foreclose on you if you don't and I'll gain all that equity in my property and I'm pretty certain that most people that are going to put that significant\nAmount of money down aren't aren't going to let it go right but if they're put in five grand down\nThey could they can get in your house for five grand they can stall you out for months and months and months and months with a foreclosure even more than a regular eviction would take so so\nYou know that's not enough to get them to let them in my house I I don't know I get you know you're going to look at the whole entire picture and and before you could really make a determination on any one individual factor I'm\nRight this is a a mix huge property I got a residential and and tell them I'm\nA retail office space for it so it's not a good thing but I was curious if I should be looking for\n... a financing a fixed\nRate financing with them or if if I chose to do it at all\nWhich I'm not sure yet because I don't I don't have the uh but if you're a fixed rate uh and and I guess I turned it down by the by the link or a a a a term that he won\nRight and then and then the truth is Jerry maybe you would rather I mean I don't\nAnd what your position is maybe you don't mind having a a an income peace where you can collect money every month so maybe you don't mind keeping it so you could you know\nI Would think that you start with a fixed rate and that you um you increase that rate if you wanted to like you could start it all depends like you know you could increase that rate over a certain amount of time like All right we're keeping here\nFor two years if you don't pay me off my two years then you know you have to pay this new rate or you have to pay these additional points or ... ... so so you have your own real estate agent you of the listing agent who's coming to you with this information or ...\nSo I I mean I'm going to say you you're going to listen to him him or her first and see what what they're bringing to you and then if you'd like to talk again and you have any questions or ideas from there I'm I'm happy to you know help you out or you can call me\nAt my office I'll give you the number it's nine for two zero two hundred and I'm not a you know God Knows I'm not trying to get involved in ... in between you and your agent or anything like that but if you're looking for some friendly advice to say that um this is what I Would do and and and if that's worth two sets and I'm happy\nI'm happy to give it to you know\nI I appreciate that Richard you every every Sunday so ah I just thought I'd call in and get your site ...\nThank you you know it's not it's not a horrible thing and then you know being that it's it's um [noise] a mixed use property\nIs more difficult for you to find a buyer that has that thirty percent down to put a put down that they need you know so I may be the idea of doing some owner financing if you can get top dollar for your property maybe it's a good idea so ... good luck here Gerry

begin traveling outside of Italy corresponded\nMan I Love that you brought up by the false jak because one of the things that comes up a lot is there's a ton of information out there there's a ton of resources\nBut not all of them are geared towards actually helping you were guiding you like for example you know the essence say dot Gov or the Social Security office gray or a wealth of knowledge when it comes to how Social Security works\nBut if you ask them how does apply to me\nThey can't give you an answer you need to make sure that you actually have a financial income planner who actually physically works with Social Security and income to actually get the answers you're looking for and that's few and far between you've got to find people that know that\nLet's jump off that point a little bit when you call up the Social Security administration office they really are great people they really are a ton of knowledge they help yeah but they have to answer and yes or no that's right that's tied in your hands or handcuff how are you thinking so when when a consumer or a baby boomer somebody calls that says\nHey can I take it yes should I take it I guess\nI Can't answer that yeah yeah so you got a call some of that actually does know what's going on you needed income plan or not just the financial planner but you need a financial income plan or you need that that's a really important distinction I'm Glad you brought that up you know it in the financial income planner\nThat planners going to be putting together a tax plan for you oh ... that's that's Ninety percent of an income planned in my opinion or just because it's so simple fact that you have to have that if you don't have the plan for the taxes that you're going to be paying whether they're high or low ... you're never going to be able to get 'em any lower than they are\nYeah and the income plant in the tax plan is a component of it\nWhen you're sitting with your income planner\nAnd they should be able to talk to you about Social Security in terms that you understand like your full retirement age do they actually know what your real flipped for retirement ages because depending on what year you're born it can be somewhere between age sixty six in age sixty seven and that can make a difference depending on when you actually want to trigger Europe for one hundred percent benefit\nSo you've got to make sure they have that information as well\nYeah when we're thinking about this I think we've got say one step further\nIn income planner is not just thinking about taxes\nAnd income they're also thinking about legacy where's this money going to go after I die what's going to happen after this right how's it what is the chain of command does it go from husband or wife to children does it go

we're talking about how your Social Security affects your retirement plans and how do you actually affect your Social Security\nIt's an amazing concept don't want to blow your mind grab your you know pets Turner's radio up let's talk about Social Security let's get everybody under control when I take it how to take it how sick it again and again and again no you only get one [noise]\nSo you can only take it when it's your turn but remember your spouse or benefits your benefits and all their retirement benefits are only a portion of your income you have two different times and your life to choose you can either take a pre retirement before sixty six or after you take full retirement\nIt's still you have to you know where we took a commercial break we were talking about how\nTaking early retirement affected you and we have to really go back into that I think\nYeah Josh you actually just kind of late where my mind was going just before you said you only get to pick Social Security once we get one time to turn it on and the one thing that\nI see is a big pitfall is that people say I'm going to turn it on sixty two because well I Want to get every single dollar out of Social Security that I can get but as soon as I hear that I literally cringe because once you turn it on there's no going back and it can create a lot more issues down the road if you ...\nSure why it fits aware fits like for example we were talking during the break about Bob he was talking to me after one of our Social Security events and he looked at me he goes hey man I Want to turn on my Social Security at sixty two but I don't know if it's a good idea\nAnd as we were talking about well why is that do you need the income well no I've got a pension from my own company but I wanted to take it now and I feel like I should just turn it on now\nAnd I was like whoa about if you don't need the income now let's take a look at all the recounts let's just make sure that your Social Security doesn't do more harm than good\nAnd as we went through a discovery meeting not only did he have a pension that he was collecting all of his retirement accounts were in IRAs so turning Social Security on at sixty two would have been the worst decision for him his Social Security would have been eighty five percent tax will pushing his entire family into a higher tax bracket that he could have never gotten out of\nAfter we went through his retirement income report it became crystal clear the best age for him was the turn Social Security on sixty eight it was amazing to see Bob understand how Social Security fit into his entire retirement strategy\nBut the only way he was able to see it was my sitting down with me here at the office and going over his retirement income report this report lays out the most optimal time to take your Social Security benefit\nSo if you want a written income plan you've got a call you could financial services here for one\nSeventy seven to seven to seven\nRemember you only get to retire once so call us now for all one\nSeventy seven to seven to seven\nI Love that you have Bob I didn't know about that story it's absolutely amazing 'cause Bob if he would have triggered all those IRAs and his income from his employer and everything holy cow buddy you talk and that's a that's a tax burden that is a bomb you can't turn back off\nAnd on deal it's oh it's a done deal and it was absolutely definitely this is All right now and he had his he had\nA permanent income stream coming in Odessa answered a higher now hard at you know turning that sets the minimum income level now are out there should be listening to this and the thing was is his goal his mind was I'm going to never take the IRA money until I have to thinking he's never gonna have to\nTouch it but even realize his arm decent age Seventy one if he had that anti Social Security on it hadn't spent any money yet he would've jumped up easily to tax ... oh yeah and never been able to get out of it and it would have severely impacted\nHis life he would have had more money coming in the had less to actually spend because out of and in fact that his entire family than I Do not tire family income\nThat's right he his neck would have been yeah the law so in that have been would have been crushed to Oh yes you know as talking with Bob here you know I think we're talking about pitfalls they don't think about the actual income itself\nThey're talking about missing the pitfall of actually maximizing and when people say that they believe that it's oh well just wait to turn Social Security on age Seventy it's really not it's it's really how can you minimize the taxes on your overall we're sweet spot on your tax rely\nOn that list and yeah the taxes change but they don't change but every ten years so we know what it's gonna be next year the year after year after year after so or they're going to be very close [laughter] that's what I'm saying even if Trump the changes that right if a President Trump changes the taxes\nIt's not going to change the calculation in which we're talking about the threat as well that's absolutely it's absolutely mind blowing to me that people say oh I got I got to figure this out yeah we do have figured out but not for the reason", "show_name": "Tara Granahan", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "14"}
