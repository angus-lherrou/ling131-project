Greenwich and she's running for office the offices\nThe seat is now held by representative Anthony Jay Russo who is a Republican uh and uh so over the weekend boy he comes to Rhode Island for sure a hideous letter is a sent out it's called the pink wave is coming\nAnd I'll tell you I it's it's it's full of ridiculous but it it it's damaging and it's a problem and no one of course we'll cop to writing this letter\nBut it starts with the pink wave is here and that's a hash tag the pink way this year boat Justine called welfare state house well right off the bat sounds like it's coming from someone who supports just being called well she wants nothing to do with it I spoke with her on the phone this morning\nShe said um my statement stands for itself\nAnd it has a you know I did not write that letter or women of Rhode Island it starts unite us nothing to lose what your chains unite behind my sister in the struggle Justine Caldwell east Greenwich as ground zero for the war against

house we can send a message to all men by voting him out like so many women around the country we knew it was time to stand up to massaging is like representative ... women are being harassed everywhere everywhere explanation point\nMale sexual predators roaming around our streets and representative gene Russo remained oblivious to the needs of women this is like oh this is outrageous in fact I think\nUh someone should have to be held accountable for this letter ingesting Caldwell he goes on and on we're organizing thousands of women to come out and vote for women like chess deans is going to take a big female effort to be successful it's it's hateful against men in a tasteful against one person in particular which is why I wanted to bring him on this morning represented the

conversations and I don't have a negative bone in my body I hate the fact\nThat this negativity in a house race is bad enough we got to see it on a federal level and and so the Senate and the Congress and the governor it's enough is enough negativity is just as white noise I don't even hear anymore\nBut does that kind of stopped bothers my wife for a bit of bothers me because she looks at me as a husband and the father of her children and the the son of a mother in law and so on and it bothers her a lot more than it bothers me but I\nI just I don't even I don't hear it but when I got that letter you first of all I was it was brought to my attention\nA when a constituent called gold on my uh my 'cause it's red line and I never met this person before he was appalled are circuses ridiculous this letter that it is the first I heard of it this was a friday afternoon he called me\nI don't know if he received it Thursday or friday but then when I got home lo and behold there were two of them in my mailbox and I'm so one one was addressed to me one that was addressed but my wife\nAnd whoever did it didn't spirited expenses because I Know when you send out political campaign letters or any mass mailings the house\nYou duplicate the list so you're not sending once everybody that's in that home like in my case they will be by that I have five registered voters in my household right they wouldn't be spending the five votes\nSo they didn't even do that so there are some homes that receive more than one but this wasn't a it was not inexpensive campaign by any out so I have no idea who's behind it but as I said I'm going to say that they signed off on it because it's their rhetoric and all that he will stuff\nUnderstood representative or Anthony junior or so from east Greenwich he's a Republican challenger this is I guess I guess you could call it a hate letter but it depends on how you know which side you're on so listen we'll talk again in the future about

the you know where the minority party um for the Democrats have a super majority I'm not as if you and your officers do know that [laughter] but um and we're trying to make a difference increase our number is up there I think our ways\nOur policies are better way and uh you know it's interesting I think of it from the perspective of aid to say that it's worse than the other side but it is you know uh there's a civil war going on I'm On the Democrats and they fight about policy in there\nAnd they have major major differences I mean they are like literally\nOn both sides of the spectrum\nI'm you know I think the Republicans are you know we still are a big tent and if you notice the Heidi is not a policy we still agree on policy would pass all dissidents who do support certain candidates and\nThey fight about it and I don't want to see it I Try to discourage it as much as possible um I myself have unfortunately been dragged in a couple of times in\nA you know and and and unfortunately a\nWar with a a representative Morgan um at times she and I had a hot and cold relationship and I I Believe in\nRegular a loving women you know I'm not ... not speak ill of a\nLot of Republicans are but there are times in which you just have to defend yourself I mean a pipe organ brought our struggle on a short a gate is still literally going on as we speak two years after I almost two years after I filed a complaint in the first place on the board of elections that with all due to Patricia Morgan\nUh Patricia Morgan is um you know a has caused a lot of division chiefs cause chaos and that minority caucus\nAh she's fired people left or right ... so he can understand why some of her colleagues up there are upset and I'm not you know I guess there and take your product\n[laughter] oh yeah I mean you are because you get the whole show on a thing that so that that was a woman who was running just as most people don't even\nKnow what that that is an and it's only because they're not heavily invested in you know local politics I explain a\nVery easily so we we targeted\nUm speaker Matty yellow as a seat which we thought we should we could either win\nWhich would be you know two hundred years of history and they if we were able to not speaker of the house off but uh certainly to put a lot of pressure on the speaker of the house and I give him a really tough race back in two thousand sixteen\nYou know as the head of the party I'm I'm pretty much had to all things but I like to delegate will and get a lot of help I don't want to be the only decision maker and\nA you know

two years we've had terrible problems you have\nA the D.C why it has always been plagued by either mismanagement not enough caseworkers children falling through the cracks but this report I don't think I've seen something like this in a very very long time it is a federal report it is not good [laughter]\nIt is failing and department is failing but at the expense of young little tiny children and has the governor responded we'll she replace people over there will she tried to streamline get to the bottom of it I don't know but this is something that uh and I don't I Can't even\nYou know with a with a I Can't even say it should be used in any kind of a political sense because it's young children involved and to to use them would be\nPretty rough I Know there's a commercial out there uh against Gina Raimondo that shows little kids looking out the window and they're crying I talked about the failure D.C laugh\nBut the hard facts are there now we're going to put it together for you and something has to be done some kind of action needs to be taken and I don't think in the next four weeks this governor could get away with trying to avoid it I don't\nI mean think about that another four weeks will we get another press release saying oh the D.C Wyeth is being cited for you know putting a child in harm's way you're not going to like this report it's tough to to listen to because of children being involved but it's got to be talked about and I do believe that this administration has to say something\nFor three eight nine seven seven sex for three eight to leave hero
