{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WPRO", "content": "I'm willing to say clearly they're going to be much higher than they are today because of where the federal deficit is that it's been building up\nNot just for one president but multiple precedence over\nDecades you know it's been building up it's not anybody you can point to currently it's been building up for many many many years so it's important to understand that and understand that if taxes go up you're going to pay a lot more in taxes from your retirement accounts we have strategies to help you kind of\nIn the long run reduce your tax exposure so it's about well preservation and wealth transfer that we talk about a lot from our clients to their family\nSo it's having a well thought out retirement plan intrigues you our number here for a one three three three eight thousand\nIf you save two hundred thousand or more for your retirement please give us a call we'd love to sit with you\nSee what your vision and goals are for the future and if we might be able to provide some assistance with that if we feel we have a chance then we'll gather your statements do a full report and come back in a couple of weeks and say look here's what we see here is what's good here's what we feel might be able to be improved\nAnd then you decide what you want to do from there are number again for a one three three three eight thousand if you save two hundred thousand more of your retirement we'll look forward to your call\nJeff when you have that strategy and you you're looking at that road map I Would think having an actual strategy something that we can refer back to that is really going to keep people on on the right course her retirement\nAbsolutely you know becomes a lot easier to stray off course when the stock market is behaving rather unpredictably\nBy off course I mean people tend to make financial decisions in the moment that might not be in line with their long term goals\nSo having a form of strategy in place helps you refer back to it and say oh yeah that's right you know we did talk about there can be some ups and downs on that portion so we're not going to jump out the window because things aren't that bad\nYou know and so having that they're\nThinking of it as as a providing a certain level of comfort to you because you know it's part of the plan and you know it's been addressed\nYou know not having a financial strategy for retirement just helps you to know all the noise you know that day to day week to week movements of the market and of course the media attention is paid to them and I keep in mind when it comes to the media\nAre they telling you like all good stuff no their job is to get your nervous so that you tune in whether\nThat's on a TV show a radio show even or the newspaper their job is to try to get your back\nAnd get get you connected so that you're constantly turning on the TV show listening to the radio show or reading the newspaper\nSo when you have a plan you can say yeah we have a plan we've got a professional taking care of us were in good a good place we can kind of relax a little bit let the professionals do their job and we're our job is to have fun retiring [laughter] that's your job when you retire\nA big picture of financial strategy that at a great thing to have leading up to during retirement and and pretty much at any stage of your life for that matter so get do you suggest that we sit down and we hammer out a strategy on our own is that ever had that idea\nOr you know if you listen to the media you know do a YouTube or Google you can do it yourself with pretty much everything you know there was there was a story of of a doctor who was up at the north pole and his appendix first and he was yelling when there\nHe had to operate on himself oh dear I don't know if people remember that would literally this guy had to take out his own appendix 'cause he was the only one there otherwise we would have died\nNow let's face that is the ultimate do it yourself kidding not that he had a choice but my God that's not what you want to do with your investments for your retirement lifespan\n'cause we're looking at making key decisions that are not just for this month this quarter or this year we're talking about potentially two or three decades that can be impacted by decisions you do or do not make appropriately now so what's most important is this\nSo with the professional that specializes in retirement and complaining\nBecause that's the most important thing that you can do so that you have a plan put together that will help keep you focused on the long run and less focus on the day to day ups and downs in the market because we know the market will do both oftentimes that does both in the same day\nRecently there was a big drop like five hundred points midday and then it corrected most of it but it was still down at the end of the day but those are big swings and those I think it's just my personal opinion I think it's more the traders that are causing those bigger swings\nThat's just my opinion and computerized a programmed trading happens at certain levels so if the market dropped a certain amount\nAutomatically computers are selling things and if it goes down to a certain level again they'll buy back in and it's all pre program so how can that the quote unquote little guy compete with that it's very difficult to do a\nGreat show today as always any final thoughts for us\nWell diversification is key in the different types of asteroids that you're using and the different tax a position whether it's pre tax money your after tax money non retirement plan money having all diversification all those areas makes you a plan that much more solid\nIn a workable as you go forward\nOur number here at massing associates thing is for one three three three eight thousand we look forward to your call if you save two hundred thousand or more for your time\nAs always

Jessica dean and Pittsburgh this morning says none of those shots were children\nWe now know from the criminal complaint that eight of them were male three other than female she learned more about them today at this as they're not formal charges for that have been filed against the fact that in this case twenty nine federal charges including including hate crime\nThey alleged shooter is forty

made virulently anti Semitic post on our website popular with far right extremists including a post made shortly before the attack special report on ... cruise the Centers for Disease Control says fewer American adults got a flu shot last\nNow many give you another example so this is another case that I had a handle and deal with so obviously the Sally case was a very unfortunate circumstance and\nFortunately mom and dad was still alive\nAnd so they came in and saw me and they said you know what can we do and we had a family meeting and fortunately a Johnny decided to be queens or give his interest\nOr interest for the benefit of Sally ... children so that was a a a lucky thing that happened in I was able to help navigate the family through that complex situation\nBut in other situations it's not so easy and so you need to make sure that you understand what you're signing for example\nYou sign a purchase in sales agreement now maybe you're selling your house so you sold your house now you sign an agreement to buy a house okay\nSo you're going through the whole thing all of a sudden the person who's buying your house asks you for an extension on the contract now I'm going to tell you the general rule of thumb on perch than sales agreements the courts have ruled\nThat if the request for the extension is reasonable and the length of time for the extension is reasonable then essentially they get the extension but what does that mean for you\nWhat if you don't close and the other person says I'm not giving you an extension you could lose your deposit you may have already put your property into storage so when you're in a time crunch words matter\nAnd you want to express your agent you want them to know that time is of the essence relative to the closing date so if you ever closing date on your contract let's say November first\nAnd on that closing date you intend on selling your home and buying this other home for you that November first date is of the essence that means when you put time is of the essence in the contract\nIt means that you are saying to both people when not going to request an extension and we're not going to give an extension it show happen on this date\nOr won't happen at all and that's and that's the reality behind it\nUm you know so these are situations that come up and and you know you need to be advice and listening to the show and getting this information so that you can understand the questions to ask when you're faced with the situation now\nWorst case situation and you know unfortunately I'm In the middle of one of these now a in individuals house the we're buying the people backed out so they told the people who are buying their house they said look we're going to give me a deposit back\nWe obviously if you had any out of pocket expenses this was my recommendation\nReimburse them for their out of pocket inspections and any out of pocket expenses that they had\nBecause the other deal is not going forward but what ended up transpiring was they decided not to sell their house because of that and they didn't want to be displaced and basically have to move into a hotel either something they ended up\nUm in the middle of a lawsuit and what happened was the buyers said listen we this market is so tight we can't buy another house what we're buying your house for so now we've instituted litigation called specific performance specific performance which means\nTo make you specifically perform under the terms and conditions of the contract which essentially says to sell us the property\nNow this case just got started they just got served with the ... obviously this is a tremendously stressful situation and they're doing everything they can to get out of it in our defenses\nTo specific performance but they're very limited so if you have a contract and the seller back so you can enforce it or if you're the seller you can enforce it against the buyer although\nI Will tell you it's a little bit more difficult to wars the buyer to buy than it is to force a cellar to sell a only because if a buyer can't get financing you can't make them do something that's relatively impossible to complete\nSo you know my name's attorney Steve let me come\nYour whole sphere of illegal tip number here is four oh one for three eight nine ...\nAll one eight hundred three

I'm ... he was so here is the ... here is the just okay so let let let me just work through this process with you all talk about it as we go so\nWhen you're selling your home your home has a it's one continuous partial so it's all one parcel of Eighteen acres\nYes okay what is the minimum lot size but where you live in other words is it anyway and I know\nIt's one acre oh okay it's a one acre but there's actually\nOn those two acres I've had it surveyed and everything you can leave on those two acres with the house\nOkay now does taking that back sixteen acres um does that do the value or reduced the market value of your home\nNow I don't think so it is um it's kind of I don't want to say it's unveiled a bowl but you have to go across it pretty good size for up to get there and um it uh\nI I'm selling a lot on the road from it and this is a conservation land behind Oakland\nNow have you had the land in back this proposed sixteen acres appraise you\nKnow I have not yet okay sure quota go for that young and uh well\nActually that's not a hundred percent true I've talked to a couple of different ... uh and I got various um quote so I'm not sure what the right one\nRight so this would be my take on it and what I think would have to happen in your particular circumstance I Would think that what we would end up doing is um the initially contacting Leon trust association to make sure that they would have an interest\nIn acquiring this additional property generally they they do um secondly\nI'd want to make sure that we have this sixteen acres properly survey of properly appraised by a licensed appraiser so that we we have a value for donation purposes third\nWe've probably gonna have to go to the town to uh do what's called an administrative subdivision to cut off that sixteen acres and then we'll have to have a\nSettlement or closing of the transaction will probably go to the land trust attorney's office so that you can actually do the convenience so there's a few steps to it but it's a very nice gesture and it probably will offset depending on how much you're going to be able to take as a deduction for sixteen acres\nOkay All right so I Will get a talk show on that I that was the question I had um\nKnow I Know you go to the direction with a\nTax on exempt organization and I know the town isn't taxing them so I was confused on that so\nWell right and so it sounds like you would get a deduction on that now\nThe way it's going to impact your income taxes I don't know I you know I don't know what your income tax bracket is whether or not you're deductions are going to be phased out at all at some point for example whether or not you're going to encounter the alternative minimum tax\nBut you know we can kind of delve into that so that way you have a better idea and have a better understanding that if you do make this donation what is the net effect you\nOkay All right so that that puts it a little bit better in my head what I've got to do so\nUnfortunately we even when you want to give things the way\nIt can get a little bit complicated and uh the reality is that you want to you as the don't or or the person giving it away is the one who needs to cover your bases to make sure that your protected in this in this a gift\nA now one question I Do have you and I don't know so I'm just gonna ask you this do any of the other a lot need eat grass across a passage through this sixteen acres to access\nAny part in other words other other any ease ... rites of passage to access okay\nNo it's just the conservation land\nOK okay perfect well you know married he wanted to give me a call I'd be happy to talk to you more about it\nOkay my office numbers for nine zero forty nine hundred and or is it something that I'd done before in the past or help people through this process or to make sure that not only is it done right but to make sure that you're protected in that you're going to get the maximum benefit for your charitable gift\nThat will hopefully get you what it is that hopefully it's going to compensate you for your last time out of work you medical bills and things of that nature so just a good story that we had a very good results of this quite All right mix up we have Christine enough Providence Hi Christine you're on the air with Stephen\nBut morning Steven trying keep grave I have a stepfather and step\nDaughter stepped out at least the stepfather ...\nYep father passed away okay ... term\nDamage to the car and I don't know why you didn't pay for it but they want sixteen hundred dollars from her um\nHe went past initially no assets in a small state was open and step daughter when he had ministry trick 'em executive tricks when am I saying okay um I don't know\nAnd\nI my question is the just the stepfather stay\nOn the hook for sixteen hundred\nOr so [noise] are the here's my question why was the smallest they opened\nWhy yeah hill to transfer title automobile and okay to get on there was a little something something to do with his pension\nAlready but now she as a co signer is also responsible for that obligation right correct\nOkay so if the state is not liquid in other words there aren't sufficient assets to pay that sixteen hundred dollars unfortunately and ultimately she's going to be on the hook\nFor that um that damage it'll it'll come to her it'll affect her credit because he's not here to pay\nIt once it got no credit anyway all [laughter] well the the you know they're going to the it'll still ... or credit they'll send it out for\nDebt collection you know they'll harass or whatever with telephone calls but I I'm just going to tell you a little story Christine I bought my own personal life and situation so I'm uh in my household we own a car and we leave their car and on one particular circumstance we turn the car in\nAnd they said that there was some damage on the car and and I usually keep my car's very nice and they never in accidents or anything and so when I called them up and they really couldn't give me an answer how they evaluated this damage\nAnd eventually after going back and forth for a couple of months they started they want to two thousand dollars for this damage and then eventually they accepted three hundred dollars\nUm so my advice would be number one to call and to see what the damages for in how they evaluate it number to explain that he's deceased provide proof\nOf the uh state and then number three see if they're willing to accept a much smaller amount and based on those facts and circumstances they may rather than have to produce the documents that show what the damage was be willing to uh settle for less\nNow Christine why have you on the phone you mentioned two words\nAnd I just want to explain to everybody is because we're kind of wrapping up the show today you said in ministry tricks and executive who are\nAll right so those two things for all people listening essentially mean the same thing it means to the person in charge of the probate so one word administrator is when you die with out a will you have a person who administers your state [noise]\nThe other word executives for is when you die with they will it means you have a person who's going to execute the terms\nAddition of your will so one is to administer without a will and one is to execute whether we'll just see everybody understands that those two words mean the same thing but they're just used in different context in probate\nSo can I ask you one quick thing for them to this yes well\nProvided for state than that I can come out of the pot where all the bills are paid\nAll right so creditors ordinarily have a period of six months to file a claim against an estate so if there is money coming into the estate there'll be that timeframe when creditors have to come forward um and then ordinarily you can negotiate with the creditors\nAre so generally that's how it works but on a small a state that means his assets were less than Fifteen thousand dollars so that probably highly unlikely that any creditors are going to come forward All right Christine\nSo she won't close the day probably yes okay thank you all righty\nRight question on a probate questionnaire and what a great way to end the show I got to\nSay thank you so much everybody listening thank you for calling in I truly appreciate it I

and stuff\nYou know the cities and towns I once had an inspector I had\nIt's funny I had a home inspector\nThat was a real tool he came up with an attitude and uh I wasn't even the agent on the property I I was the cellar and he went down to to investigate what building permits that I had gotten on the property and then um\nYou know put in a complaint that we didn't have the proper permits so I went out there in ... with the building inspector of this particular city\nAnd met him at the property and now this guy's retired since then so I can tell the story he said to me I said listen I did this this this this this I don't need permits for those things you know and and he said Paul Korea I'm going to show you the code book\nShe takes me over his car shows me the code book and it and I was right I didn't need permits for those things he said ... Paul people have been coming in here for years\nApplied for permits for that stuff and we're going to continue to take their money when they come in and apply for permits for that but you're correct you don't need it so there are times that you have a you're doing work that\nThat you don't need a permit for maybe you need a permit for a small portion of it and so they can't be charging you a the full cost of the work that you're doing to to um\n[noise] for the price of the permit because some of that work is is not necessary to have a permit for but anyway that's what I Want to talk about to never good for me to talk about that kind of stuff um\nWhat do we want to talk about how about how about whether you're we're getting to that time of year\nWhere it's like well I mean they're going to do this thing or I'm not you know like I'm going to put this house on the market and tried to sell it and get outta here some time over the course through the winter or maybe I'm just going to stick it out through the spring so you know ... why don't we take a break now when we get back we'll\nTalk about that should you sell now or wait until the spring some of the issues there if you're real life example of this and have questions I'd love to hear from you our number four three nine seven seven six one eight hundred three two one WPRI of\n\nI just a WPN ... being informed voter listen to news talk Ninety nine seven FM and am six thirty WPRI and then get out to vote on election day to make your vote\nCount sponsored by Marshall building and remodeling when it comes to choosing a company for you a new roofing signing our windows the winner by a landslide Marshall building in remodeling\nAttention seniors at Williams distort real estate we know that it is important for your home to look it's best when it's time to sell that his wife for a limited time only we will be offering qualify lifting clients\nTen hours of home preparation surfaces\nTo help you get your home ready for sale that's Roy Williams assert real estate can help you get your house cleaned and organized and ready for sale at no additional costs to you have your uh sixty two are older all you have to do is mentioned this to add one calling to receive this benefit when you list Williams in Stuart real estate three nine eight Twenty one hundred that's three Ninety two one zero zero\nRaj headquarters in your local family business offering you ask them designed to match the architecture of your home with our design center somewhere we take the guesswork Adam choosing just the right door which comes when the door price guarantee that are dealers factors service Palestine even for same day survey\nLet your family count on our family ... family of certified tax in New England all\nThe credit products are made by ... returns very basic reading history Amazon ... sponsored this promotion other restrictions apply the website for details\nI did I get into credit card debt a trip to the emergency room\nMoving expenses there's a million ways to get into a credit card debt but one sure way to start getting out of von avant offers access to online I'm secure loans from two thousand dollars for thirty five thousand dollars a competitive race and no extra charges for being back early over five hundred\nThousand customers have experienced the convenience of alone through avant no wonder about has an a plus rating from the better Business Bureau re application takes minutes ... by four\nThirty pm central time Monday through friday funds are deposited as soon as the next business day and now if I Will also give you a fifty\nDollar Amazon dot com gift card after your first name and it's made on time to check your loan options and to get their special radio off or go to Yvonne dot com today and enter promo code for the three fifty three one applying backed a B.

I've had at least [noise]\nTen producers [laughter] [noise] we've had some good ones we've had radios crystal Adams we've had Jim Laos\nWho produces the patriots pre game in post game and a show down the road we've had ... canals as a producer who um\nHas his own show down in Virginia on ESPN Now\nWe've had a John Crow as a producer of the show and then of course we had our our beloved friend Jared Gagnon who passed away um so we we we've had a lot of great producers on the show over the years I've been very fortunate to ah meet a lot of people in radio through this and it's been great All right\nWhat do we got here we got the Angelo in Warwick\nIs DeAngelis ready to come on ... good morning this is Paul how are you\nDo it Angelo All right I think what it could be it could be\nOn V. Angelo that's where the\nGuy how are you sir how what what's going on\nUp by the way I'm listening I you're right on the question should be the marketing\nI'm Out in um you know I don't want somebody right now\nTrying to understand their social media and if you really think the real estate market a market\nUm you know I always tell my agent that nothing works but everything works it's like a symphony you know if you're just listening to the flu play its part then it doesn't sound so great but if you if you've got everything working at once so I think social media is certainly\nPart of a marketing campaign\nI see a lot of real estate agents are are using social media to build their real estate business but not effectively using it to market your homes you know what I mean\nWell well I mean you know they talk about [laughter]\nYou know how many if I'm friends with a million real estate agents on Facebook or not quite a million but so they they post you know after they've sold their home a picture of this old signed with the client\nAnd that sort of thing you know the client doesn't get a benefit out of out of that obviously what a client gets a benefit out of his somebody having a professional\nPhotos John professional chore or you know good right up on the property and then if that is shared through social media networks you know then then a point does get a benefit I mean the the most eyes on property the better return for the most out of\nWhat you're saying everything and I really do any work well and this is what got something that you don't feel that it be enough and I have all these but who's got much\nOut there are ... they're all full of you know what you know if if they have a buyer for it or how that\nI'm you know if they yeah that that\nStuff [laughter] so\nAngela which I'm a cellar to like I have right now a few few houses listed with other agents in my office and so I feel the same anxiety that you feel and I feel like the same thing like what are you doing to sell my house so so I mean so for me\nSo I Want to be All right\nAnd and I know you want everything as a seller\nAnd but for me like I Do both things so I understand like I money I have a partner at one of my property and he's all up my on my agent really tough you know\nAnd and then like I'm I get him but I also get her because I Am I where both hatch so like if you're telling me how can you say to me oh this is one thing sellers will say oh you know what in Boston this house would cost three million dollars and so you should advertises in Boston because then people will think\nThis is the ... and I understand why a seller might think that\nBut um as a as an agent I'm going crazy I'm going to go spend six seven hundred dollars to put an ad in the Boston Globe on hoping that I'm going to find somebody that's gonna that's gonna come down here and I'm going to tell you that if someone's coming to Rhode Island from Boston they're going to be looking through the Internet\nAnd all the Internet sites pulls from our MLS so like\nI don't know what I'm asking is a mark on watch no that's all right no\nI mean everybody I'm going to give it to\n[laughter]\nYeah they're trying to push\nI that I buy it\nI can to try to sell my I Try to make it\nUm it does make a difference oh shit it's not supposed to but let's just look at it this way okay um\nIf you're if an agent is getting paid\nFirst of all I can I start this by saying I think the agents should all negotiate their own fees and we shouldn't be having the sellers have to be the ones offering the buyers agents or money because I feel like the ... working for them\nNot\nMe I'm going to stop ...\nNo no but but but so I don't want to I think I think they should pay I think the buyers agents should negotiate don't feed but in the environment that we live in like at my office we minimally offered two and a half percent to ... because\nBecause my concern is that a pro broke if they're going to get paid more selling another property than they are selling mine that human nature might take them down the path that they'd be more interested in selling them the price the house that they are going to get more money than\nWe are asking non human nature not common sense I'm asking\nIt technically it's not the same amount of the same amount of\nUh buyers are going to view that property no matter what you're offering for compensation to the co broke but the ... you know they're the ones in vi buyers they're the ones right so they don't have to\nThey don't even know any man has to know that this person's a moving them away from his property but they're doing it and and and and but you know\nThat's you know don't my friend the aid that do this so this one that won the there are a lot of that going on you know and and I didn't realize it was so I've been doing this\nWell you know then they have like like there's some agencies that are fighting with each other and like they have special protections that says oh if this person shows my house we're going to pay them less than they have ... and that\n... to me if an agency is getting their clients involved in that type of crap then then that's a mistake like I wouldn't I wouldn't work with any agency that was that was doing any of that business you know because because all it is is\nYou know you want you want to get your house so that's your goal and you want to do it and you don't mind paying your agent now you don't want to give them an arm and a leg sometimes you look and see what agents making go chiefs they're making a fortune and it's sometimes it feels like we are you know for for a in some cases for what we're doing\nBut for everyone that goes smooth there's another one that\nThat you know I have a house right now I'm going to have been some for two years\nOn my house I got a job at my house so I got to decide do I draw my out of the certain amount or do I ... I got to know and I'm like oh or like I said\nThat's not going\nTo the gym and a half percent is not going to make a difference except for the fact that industry you know\nBeing you know half way through a transaction and having something fall apart which could cost thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars\nUm you know so\nYou like any industry you are going to have to pay if you want somebody to service you properly and somebody that's good at their job\nAnd going to put you in the best situation and when we're talking about real estate you're talking about big dollars so it's important to have the right protections in place for you and um\nYou know had a ... a a guy called being the show and we he was talking about a lot of the paperwork involved with a real estate transactions with a mortgage and as I said a lot of that is to protect the agent or in the bank or or buyers and sellers from getting sued or from a suing each other\nBut your best way to stay out of trouble in the first place is to hire a cop but in real estate agent because they're going to be the quarterback they're going to be the Tom Brady of of the\nOf the transaction they're going to make sure that the other people are in the right place doing the right things and then they're going to get them the ball that's what it is so All right let's take a break when we get back we're going to wrap it up\nHere nicely maybe put a bow on it and the real estate insiders [noise]\nGarage headquarters is your local family business offering you custom designed to match the architecture of your home with our designed center somewhere we take the gaps workout um choosing just the right door which comes when the bats door price guarantee better doors faster service policy I knew them for same day service\nLet your family count on our family ... family of certified tax in New England or\nThe termites in ... your home the infest your less than impressed arrest a pest may I suggest fees in mice in your addict they nest fictions upon request arrest a pest at your behest bed bugs and fleas your blood they ingest you're not stress\nArrest a pest as I've expressed\nCalled eight hundred three three ... tests the rest of the rest of the pest dot com\nCredit products are made by ... rates in terms of credit history Amazon sponsored this promotion other restrictions apply the website for detail how did I get into credit card debt a trip to the emergency room\nMoving expenses [noise] there's a million ways to get into a credit card debt but one sure way to start getting out of violent avant uppers access to online and secured launch from two thousand dollars for thirty five thousand dollars a competitive race and no extra charges Burbank back early over five hundred thousand\nCustomers have experienced the convenience of alone drove on no wonder about has an a plus rating from the better Business Bureau re application takes minutes who never grew by four\nThirty pm central time Monday through friday funds are deposited as soon as the next business day and now if I Would also give you a fifty\nDollar Amazon dot com gift card after\nYour first name but it's made on time to check your loan options and to get their special radio offered to go to Yvonne dot com today and enter promo code for the three fifty three one applying bats a B.

got me right\nSo I mentioned term it's not really my area but I Do sell homes there but I think I'd probably enlisted another agent to come with me to help me so now I I brought Donna from her office

so they line up very well to time frames guarantee is for the entire life so from the go go years to the no go years guaranteed gonna come in with or without my permission\nAnd then you're predicting
