you know I just say like a dog like this story about throws the ball\nUm that's actually a crime and what what um ... well it was an accident he still has a history of being a hothead we all went with a a month ago when he was talking about you know when the city ... by an ... you do that over by\nHave you ever heard that the bottom of you've ever heard him say he's not a hot headed and he's not bombastic\nWell but that that looked in either so do the whole the whole point is accusing all all of the same thing and it off or what but of course there was no drugs or alcohol\nOh no I understood I understood and he he you know he might want to walk that back but I highly doubt it and I will I Will stand up for the fact that that probably cross the line this morning when Joe ... said you know I don't know if there were drugs and alcohol involved with Alan ... accident he had an accident he the grand jury did not find any of that and they said he fell asleep so yes I Will stand by that\nHe

seventies\nListen there were no cell phones there were no cameras on your house\nIt was the neighbors watched for the neighbors and you know they were there was some fighting between dirt bikes and the kids you know the ... friends and the kids in the family and ... saying they were painting my you know what and I called the police on him so we were always fighting but then when the kids were banging down the door and the girls scream and I went over there and I broke it up and I\nSweat it out them and I guess I hit them or do\nI remember all those kind of days in a way that you're going to leave your door a lot and then they did at the swap [laughter]\nYeah most people say ... delay the stand there and videotaped them breaking in the door [laughter] right I ... you gotta love the the the sleazy innocent people videotaping crimes or fights or things like that that you see all over\nSocial media back back in the day and uh again I don't want to sound like an old poop but I'm the

you\nI'm just calling to make a point or another speculation on chemicals that we want to call it the story of all of the independent there will also say that this isn't something that was you know perpetuated by the Democratic party ... almost ... she just sitting back and watch a lot\n[noise] um well I you know like ... and I mean all you're right you're right you're right because something we're sure um I didn't say that the ... campaign dug it up\nWas mentioned earlier this morning when he was he was on them and all that\nBut I Do say that they're running with it oh and somebody handed it to them let's put it that way\nSo I'm gonna handed it to them now each campaign has their own operative some of them are on the payroll some of them are not some of them are just better from the
