popular of help and it talks about what is rabies and how does it spread and rabies is basically a deadly and I mean deadly viral disease\nThat affects the nervous system the brain the spinal cord and the nerves it spread by coming into contact\nBut saliva of uninfected animal or being by bitten off scratched by uninfected animal so animals most likely to carry rabies up believing that dogs and cats hopefully have them vaccinated up a bat skunks raccoons\nFox in wood ducks or a potential rabies carriers\nSo you have to be careful you know people that say they put food out in the yard for the animals and stuff like that first of all it's against the war to feed wildlife and without those who who do not know that you can I put out food like apples and things like that to feed a deer and stuff and put out a little bits of food to feed the or the raccoons and stuff they will fend for themselves there'll be okay\nBut what you do do you know if you come into contact with an animal if you're bitten or scratch or touch the saliva\nWash the area which soap and water for at least ten to Fifteen minutes to help kill some of the virus and then call your doctor or get too when you are right away\nOnce rabies shot to infect you and it gets to a certain stage there is no cure\nSo you need to take action immediately and if you find a bat in your house flying around and if you're getting exposed to it or if you wake up and there was a bat in your house that had been flying around you need to contact your physician\nDo not take it lightly call your physician get them involved right away because that bats flying around could have drip some saliva\nAnd there have been instances where people have been bitten by bats in their sleep in did not even wake up if you're a heavy sleeper\nSo remember do not do any\nHandling or touching of those bats if they're dead or on the ground or if you find a live one and you want to try to catch it to see if it's rapid than you do catch

of what the you know [noise]\nThe standings worked for the series that's a huge win for us\n[noise] game for is tonight at eight in game five tomorrow both from Los Angeles while we've got a stormy Saturday going on with rain to be measured in inches in many places\nThe nor'easter will be mostly through our area by dinnertime WPRI ... accuweather meteorologist Steve traveling says at most will get some street flooding or Ponting around here but the winds could be a problem\nThe winds are going to be quite strong especially late this morning and in the afternoon wind gusts around forty five miles per hour in most spots but along the coast can see some guts to fifty even sixty miles per hour for a time when like that could be some trees that come down and some power lines certainly will be possible as well\nThat you want not even your spouse I especially your spouse don't tell anyone as soon as you tell anyone everyone's going to know\nAnd that's really scary because not only you're going to be bombarded by requests for money from family and friends but also total strangers your safety is also at risk and I'll talk a little bit more about that in the second so when you win the lottery what you need to do is take that ticket and keep it somewhere safe\nLike banks safe deposit box no not not under your mattress not somewhere and you know let's see cripple is my house no\n... positive box do not signed the ticket not yeah\nWhat I Want you to do is to photocopy photocopy both sides and then put it in a safe deposit box then get a lawyer get in the state attorney someone who is expert and experience in dealing with wealthy families because guess what you're not wealthy\nAnd left the lawyer tell you how you should sign the ticket should use on it and your name only should it be join with your spouse should you put it in a trust should you have an owned by an el ... limited liability\nWant to get legal advice tax advice financial advice you need a lawyer you needed a CPA and you need a financial planner\nBecause if you don't handle this correctly you got to be aware of the studies that have been done on lottery winners there is a preponderance of bankruptcy we're not going to a lottery winner go bankrupt hey Michael Tyson had three hundred million dollars and ended up bankrupt\nPeople think it's a bottomless pit more okay one point six billion is pretty bottomless but it's not it's only four hundred and Ninety two million other taxes in a lump sum\nIt's not a bottomless pit like you think it is and when you start throwing out a lot of money to family and friends and charities you'd be amazed how fast you can put the cash so a lot of lottery winners end up bankrupt they end up divorced the end up with drug and alcohol abuse they end up with suicide\nThey lose their jobs are friends even their family and if you're going to say all of a kid growing in my work every day like always know you're not you know why because every time you show up at work all of your co workers are gonna be resentful\nBecause they got to be there because they need the money and you don't and they know it and if you're going to go out to lunch and not treat everyone\nYou're going to be a pariah so if you think your life's not gonna change Oh yes it absolutely well you're going to lose all your friends you're going to be ostracized with family if you don't give them enough money to satisfy what they believe\nIs how much money you ought to give them\nSo in addition to having a lawyer and an accountant and a financial planner you need a personal security team is well the first thing you gotta do is get out of your house because everybody knows where you live he's always do Google your address not only strangers but crux\nMight come and do you harm they might come and challenge threaten your family members in order to extort from you blackmail\nYou so you need to go to an undisclosed location choose a suite at the rich to be with me and have a security detail around your your life is going to change in ways you've never thought possible because you need personal security\nAnd when it comes to gifts to families and friends well let's think about this for a minute how much money you're going to give your mom you're just method after tax\nFour hundred and Ninety two million dollars unless you give them a million bucks you cheap little sun come on you're going to give her ten million\nYou just got a hundred and Ninety two million dollars how much you've given your mom\nHow much you've given your dad how much you've given your brothers and sisters how much you've given your children or grandchildren let's say that you decide to give ten people ten million dollars a piece that's a hundred million dollars\nGuess what you didn't give away a hundred million dollars because when you give away a hundred million dollars\nYou know my friend not them you\nHave to pay a gift tax guess how much the gift tax is forty percent\nWhich means if you give away a hundred million dollars you incur a forty million dollar gift tax now you've just spent a hundred and forty million dollars so of the four hundred and Ninety two that you did you just gave away a hundred and forty of it you know down to three fifty\nWe haven't even talked about charity let alone Bentley's do you see my point my friend you got to recognize that winning the lottery\nRequires a massive change and lifestyle\nMassive calculation and preparation and planning because your relationships are going to change was virtually everyone you're not going to be able to trust anyone because they're all going to be wanting to know what you can do for them and whatever you do for them ain't got to be enough in their opinion\nLet me give you another reason why I didn't buy a lottery ticket instead of buying a lottery ticket if you were to say take the money you would have spent on three lottery tickets three dollars a day instead of buying a lottery every single day you take that three dollars and you invested into the U.S and the five hundred stock index and you do that for forty five years\nI'm On a bet you'll have more than a million dollars\nGuess what you'll have won the lottery of course past performance was known kitchen future results I mean especially in the country as a federal ... and therefore my friend now you know why [noise]\nI didn't buy a lottery to\nBecause as I often say to friends and family well okay not friends and family what I often say the enemies may you win the lottery because it's often the worst thing that can never happen to you and I mentioned all of this one simple reason trying to make you feel better for not having one so I'm\nGlad that you didn't win the lottery I thought so that's why I'm here to help you make you feel good and the reason I'm trying to make you feel good is because you probably have been noticing that not only did you not win the lottery on\nTuesday you saw the

a plan not just for inflation but income financial engines advisors have been doing that for more than Twenty years for everyday Americans and they can do it for you to\nDo to financial engines dot com schedule your appointment today [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nWelcome back to the wreck elements show we invite you to send me your questions by audio and that's exactly what George did here says question he sent to ask Rick and Rick Adelman dot com\nIraq this is George from California my in laws are both over eighty five years old and have an investment balance that likely could pay for a long term care for those is needed\nMy question is should they maintain any stock investments since they could earn over three percent in bonds and it is unlikely their life expectancy will expose them to significant inflation risk so Rick what do you think thanks\nSo that's a great question George and a lot of folks face this question in my older years I'm In my seventies eighties nineties I have far more money than I Will ever need to spend even find curb massive medical costs are long term care costs\nBetween pensions and Social Security and the money I've accumulated over my lifetime I have lots of cash and I'm not spending it because I live kind of frugally\nSo therefore we would argue traditional financial planning strategy would argue that you should place all of that money in very conservative investments you should put the money into bank accounts you should put the money into treasuries you should put the money into guaranteed\nInvestments that they might not pay much interest I not only pay one or two or three percent but so what you don't need to earn high returns it's more important that you have protection of your money they make you try to double your money because doubling it isn't going to change your lifestyle but losing half of it could\nSo traditionally we would argue don't take any more risk than is\nNecessary to achieve your goals\nBut let me turn that inside out and give you a different reason why you might want to consider\nA riskier investment strategy and their strategy that includes investing in stocks to some perhaps even significant degree\nLet's say that you've got a few million dollars saved\nAnd you're hardly touching it and you don't think you'll hardly ever touch any of it because you get plenty of income off of that money you've got plenty of income from pensions and Social Security you only spend a few thousand dollars a month your house is paid for your expenses are low\nAnd you've got this money now ordinarily I Would you know we would say like I said a moment ago\nBut the money into those call today but think about this when you die\nWho gets that money\nI'm willing to assume that you are going to leave that money to your surviving spouse and ultimately to your children and your grandchildren\nIn other words if you have a very high degree of confidence that this money will outlast you and will ultimately be transferred to your kids and grandkids\nYou could argue that that money really isn't yours it's bears and you are merely the steward of that money\nYou're the custodian your the caretaker of that money and if you know that you're going to transfer that money to your children and grandchildren who will use it for their lifestyles and they're\nFinancial needs and the achievement of their financial goals well then maybe we should be investing the money with their goals in mind meaning that if your\nSon or daughter had the million dollars they would invested in stocks because they would have a long term time horizon and they would want to earn a return that none of taxes and inflation\nIs growing in real economic terms\nTherefore we could argue you should be investing the money not based on your age but based on bears and if your kids are in their fifties or sixties if you're a grand kids are in their twenties or thirties then maybe you should invest in a portfolio allocation that mirrors them and not you\nKnow we want to make sure we're not doing so to the point that we are really placing you at financial risk or jeopardy\nBut I think we could strike a healthy balance between protecting you for your lifetime while also having an eye toward the legacy of protecting your children's financial futures as well\nAnd on that basis we could in fact argue that you should have stocks in your portfolio\nTo what degree should it be ten percent of the portfolio fifty percent of the portfolio somewhere in between the only way to know for sure is to meet with us all sit down with one of my colleagues here at the farm\nSo that we can examine the entire family dynamic look at what your true expenses are relative to the income available and the resources\nAnd design what that strategy might be taking into consideration the circumstances with your children and grandchildren so don't automatically assume that the older you get you shouldn't have any money in stocks\nInstead look at it as an intergenerational family dynamic because after all that's exactly\nWhat it is so George thanks so much for your question if you would like to have this conversation with us you can do so just cause to Tripoli to plan wreck or visit us online at rice ... dot com\nYou know we've got some of the aftermath of Hurricane Florence and Michael we've seen just astonishing

P. R.

... there was really no idea about his political views and he was viewed as a fairly friendly person very different of course from the manager of the pizza delivery operations who said he was very vocal about his conservative views\nAnd a very clear that he had problems with blacks with a gays and with Jews\nHe had been arrested in about eight times a dating back or Twenty years so there was a lot for the police to work with\nThe word has come from the FBI Director himself in the news conference just yesterday saying we're not out of the woods yet\nOr in other words the postal inspectors service the FBI other's needs to be vigilant in case there are some other packages this is as you know a coast to coast investigation with packages found in New York California Delaware DC and right here in Florida as well [noise]\nA little bit of the news coverage from the rest of the suspected bomber I guess they pretty well got the guy uh that\nAre sent these improvised explosive devices to a variety of democratic opponents of Donald Trump and others and ah\nYou know it's fascinating to me how quickly or law enforcement was able to narrow this down and figure out exactly where these came from an in how\nYou know how the devices were constructed and so I wanted to ask I did not realize this but we have in Rhode Island at you All right we have a center of excellence and explosives detection mitigation in response or in with me on the line right now is professor Jimmy actually in a professor actually\nUm you know I Know when I was in Iraq we would encounter improvised explosive devices and we typically would detonate them in place and I I guess that uh that obviously didn't happen in this case um what's your the clues to the you look for in this sort of thing\nI at what point when you find the package you know when you rush it was classic\nIn terms of ah about what we warn people again or something that has too much posted the strange a draft from somebody you're not affecting something from\nSo this this is always something if you get a package from ants citizen you know maybe chit chat with that is that right most of us don't have these kinds of packages mailed us but I can tell you just since I've been on the News I'm getting crank letter\nAnd it just never know what people are going to do when they're ... it's called\nYeah it's amazing to me that they they're able to to like I say so rapidly determine um who was the perpetrator in this case um obviously it's better for the investigation if the device has not been detonated a but it was that pose a safety risk to those investigators\nOh that's true but we already had seen a few days ago wind up the devices outside Hackett a nowadays almost every bomb team has the portable X ray we have like four hundred and sixty different ENT squat across the\nCountry mhm and most of them have the the type of uh\nX. ray units that they can take a look and see how the material is meant to be initiated and whether it is set up to initiate on opening in this case we're told they pulled a fingerprint\nOr I don't know exactly where but it would be great you got it up outside of the package it didn't go any further\nMhm and and so they're able to obviously check with a fingerprint database and figure out who that fingerprint belongs to and and kind of trace it back that way I'm I'm told there or I guess news reports are that these were amateurish devices that um that I don't think any none of them went off today\nNone of them went off but I'm not sure on what basis\nOr they're saying there are met Trish that that may puzzle me nothing up high bombs are not overly sophisticated than the first place right ah people resort pipe bombs first and I'm using it blows to\nAllow for biological or\nRadiological materials because it just readily accessible we make everything very acceptable in this country noticed what he is he didn't use a metal I write a that might have raised questions to buy a short metal pipe with red Donnie chin\nHe could have bought long PVC and just cut it up and then ...\nSo it's easy to do doesn't mean it's crude\nWhat um how would you classify these you'd done where they were they are actually relatively sophisticated\nI don't know anything about the initiating system at that point ... haven't told us on the timer is hostile because nobody would put a timer on something going to the U.S now\nBecause you know how erratic that you can be a you don't know when do you get it may have to live like\nA and the ... mall you want them to be open by the end and that it them right but maybe he doesn't care is that that maybe he had just making a statement it's puzzling to me that he thinks such an important people might actually open their own hearts full\nWell obviously the lack of sophistication and that is certainly in that regard a because as you know the president United States than in the vice president former presidents they don't open mail for obvious reasons you know it's my first of all the volume of male and secondly\nI'm you know potential threat so those are always handled by a security personnel are ...\nAnd I think that somebody like cure is probably has the whole ... team because anytime you're in the public eye you get threat for whatever reason don't ask me why that I don't understand\nWhy a lot of lot of crazy people in the world now you're with the ... center of excellence and explosives detection mitigation in response how long has that been around\nA we have been around since two thousand and seven\nUh we have I've been studying loaf is longer than that but the state of Rhode Island has been really very supportive of our research at birth my senators and representatives to try to make a our soldiers safer\nOr people who handle explosive normally is a part of the job mhm a lot\nAnd especially working on improvised explosives it's trying to show them how to handle do we do a lot of training for TSA for example right here at University of Rhode Island\nAnd that's that's fascinating that you've been around you've been involved in some um some fairly or at least the centers been about some fairly big cases I assume you as well\n[noise] uh we have trained a lot of people that you realized that didn't trained right here are currently with the navy the army the FBI so you ... ... state of Rhode

great work you do\nA become this or that I Would love to do that will do a live show there [laughter] there you go do you mean actually I Want to thank you professor Oxley for being with us in ah in
