it be Jersey's problem or do you know go somewhere in the in the woods in Massachusetts\nI I think everybody in Washington park would like that message to get through however um he might be better off going somewhere where he's not known because he doesn't he's\nPre dating right he's pre dating Michigan's law so he can actually go anywhere he want he doesn't have to make any kind of a big announcement the only I Believe and I'm trying to get some clarification from Providence\nUm I Believe the only thing I've heard so far is he has to tell Providence police that he is leaving the city other than that he doesn't have to say All right I'm going to go to a\n... um Somerset, Massachusetts he doesn't have to tell Somerset police I don't think because he is pre dating our laws and that's

doesn't have a even a monitor on him\nNo no no let's see let's report on it but of course you know all those little dirty rotten stinking we we ... that are in a state it was read through the least of all this by not doing that doing by always\nGotta yeah he doesn't have to do any of the above this is what this is the conundrum if you want to use a good Scrabble word\nOn this is where where where our hands are tied in in in Washington park there ... all over the place there so I understand it there so distraught over in and then you get revved up and you think if I even see this guy on the

that\nYucky stuff so I you know\nThe mayor came in and kind of riled up the scene which was so wrong we've got a Johnson and Wales professor that ah goes on the record to say that as well\nOr prominence police the public safety commissioner trying to get a voice on this morning just update so we can kind of keep things come over there\nOr they will of course continue to monitor the situation and seek various options and remedies with a goal to provide as much safety as possible to the community which I applaud and appreciate that coming from commissioner Perry we'll see if we can update some point throughout the morning\nBecause it doesn't seem like anything come down last night for sure it certainly doesn't seem like it and it actually seems like an elevated some of those voices were a couple of pitches above a the first night out their gyms and Warren on WPRI talking to Tara Hi Jim\nCharlie doing good how are you\nGood when I was thinking about it the diagnoses them

full\nWell from what I understand in the beginning he does not\nHe he chose they I Know it sounds funny imagine if someone said you would you like to wear a GPS bracelet just so we can keep track and he said no because he actually had the option so most people don't write if they if he's got this weird situation where he he predates most of our laws\nBut I see what you're saying Jim if there's some kind of a liaison maybe it's through\nSafety officials or what have you or the city of Providence where they actually get to talk to this guy I don't think he he doesn't have to do squat\nHe can go and he can apply at a job at a a big box store he can apply for a job at a gas station I it's just a weird situation where he predates all of these things that other registered sex offenders have to do\nAnd [noise] I ... it it's just maybe because it's a I don't wanna say special because that doesn't deal because it's a an a specific case that is just\nKind of one and a thousand right um he predates the laws et cetera media does need a special handling maybe it needs someone to sit down with him and say listen we can't continue like this maybe look to live somewhere else where you don't have to make it a big announcement or maybe you\nOut Jim could appoint maybe you where the bracelet so we can\nWear the ankle or whatever it is so we can track you so nothing happens to you as well or if you have some kind of an urge and you you go into a school district or or what have you but I don't think the guy the temperament on him he doesn't seem to it's not he doesn't seem to to remorseful\nWhen you see him in court and coming out of court I don't think he's going to apply to help out the situation it will be interesting to note\nAnd maybe any of the neighbors who are listening or\nI'm a reaching out to the police officials um has even come out of that house\nAnd when he comes out of the house I Know there are police um detected their\n[noise] you know are they

know a real smart move I'm not sure what's happening but\nI wondered if I'm condition or parents will give us an update\nThe public safety commissioner in Providence and he said we have nothing further to say on this publicly so I Will take that and I I appreciate the response we will continue to monitor the situation and seek various options and remedies with the goal to provide as much safety as possible to the community and we have nothing further to say on this publicly so on\nThat's it I I understand maybe\nYou know they want to just contained the situation get a handle on it and as I mentioned a little earlier maybe someone goes in from the city and tries to be some kind of a liaison with this guy who like it or not has the right to be there maybe they talk him into some kind of a\nI don't know a procedure to go somewhere else\n[laughter] and I suppose if he moved out of state he wouldn't get all the let's play a major oil painting just because people are calling in and
