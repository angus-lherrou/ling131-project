I think it's called sunrise show and she was out there and she's got a piece of video here with the sun coming up\nAnd you know here come the buses rolling in will she'll sauce at the scene for us for three eight nine seven seven sex for three eight WPRI oh uh-huh\nWe um [noise] ... so some of the teachers have been writing to me over the weekend saying you know this is just one piece that the teachers have been without a contract and I've been covering that with Mary Beth ... she is the president of the Providence teachers union\nUh one thing at the time though right folks so we can get the kids back to school and they won't be so far back in their studies I think that's the key here um I'll just tell you there were some photos that were being shopped around and I say shopped around spread on social media that that the teachers were getting deleted somehow\nUh I did receive them and of course it's you know classrooms and break rooms in shambles leaking what have you [noise]\nOh so they they'll they'll get to that I don't think after friday um we've got union workers cheering in front of\nA thing that the strike was over on friday the tentative agreement and they were screaming we did we did we did it now still no I don't believe there's been any further information on the fires with the buses\nAnd who that gets a tied to love to see what happens there but as of now the teachers are sending me a information day for all for without a contract so they're obviously there's still a disgruntled there and they're working towards something with the mayor but he did listen I'm I'm going to give a little bit of credit to mayor lord so\nHe said if by friday the two sides can't come together I'm ongoing in another direction and then late friday they came up with a tentative agreement alright for three eight nine seven seven six four three eight WPRI here's the scene this morning from channel ten Lindsey I had to look a\nLot of cars coming down right can weigh this morning as the buses will be back out on the roads this strike impacted over nine\nThousand students also the students that lived in Providence that went to private schools have agreement like you mentioned was reached over the weekend between the union and the company for students to vote on the plan was almost unanimous over the weekend from bus drivers\nTheir pension will start to a crew\nFor the drivers beginning January first but there is no employee requirement to invest according to first students they will contribute on behalf of employees to the Teamsters defined plan mayor Jorge ... thing that he's glad things in the city will be getting back to normal as\nIt was a major major headache was a massive disruption for everyone throughout the city um most of all preparing for\nA job I'm just happy that they're going to be I'm going to be transported back for you to go back to normal come Monday morning I'm sure all the parents are really excited and happy as well\nOr the mayor also noticed that for the students that were unable to get to school and may have missed work that they will get the help that they need to get back on track I live in Providence Louisiana ... and they\nAre it's they have it so let's so we'll see what happens is the day goes on and uh and whether or not the mayor will come out and say how the day what the teachers are not thrilled because they still have they say a a long way to go but as far as we can see 'em the buses rolled in and hopefully school gets back on track and prominent part if anyone wants to weigh in on that\nUm I I'll take your phone calls on that I think it was in a very important story and\nYou know credit where credit's due they had it took them a while but the mayor had to step in\nThe governor didn't want to get involved in that of course there's a\nYou know a union struggle three weeks before election day she said no I'm not I'm not interfering and she was from on that and she didn't but it seems that Providence is back on track for three eight nine seven seven six four three eight WPRI the union wanted the a defined benefit it's called\nA but first student refused to contribute to what's said was an under funded teamster pension plan so they're compromise is a defined contribution plan it's all in the wording I guess\nInto which the company contributes fifty cents per hour rising the dollar per hour after the employee has worked two years the teachers weren't thrilled needed at the mayor said listen I'll put some money on the table and they're thinking\nAnd they're saying allowed um and I had the the union president on last week Oh nice of him to be able to find money when we have been struggling without a contract and what we're looking for all these weeks so that's still is at an impasse however the pension slash\nA defined contribution plan has been worked out it seems uh after Providence mayor Jorge was a set on Wednesday if you don't get your act together by friday will move in a different direction so they did and they got it together and the buses are really for three eight nine seven seven six four three eight WPRI all that being said what are we doing with the governor's race\nThere is a call\nFor the independent candidate to get out so it can be a two person race and at least one\nOf the gubernatorial candidates has already calling it a two person race

million dollars for a DNA test realism its warmest jumped by the way soon to be wheels up\nThe quality of life in the state of Rhode Island and with three weeks and one day left which is exactly what you pointed out Tyra I Want to hear about it stop all the other noise\nWhat do I I totally agree with you and I think a lot of people are we're getting a lot of emails but but the fact is this whole this this week this last week a\nHas a big call for Joe ... to get out and you were set to if in fact Patricia Morgan made it through the primary and now she's with Joe ... so people want to line you with team ...\nUm does it change you any way shape or form that if you know that I don't think he has a shot of getting in and I'm not saying that to disparage him at all but just looking at the poll numbers where does that leave Arlene Violet they weren't using your name and your good character I think to say like hey if you vote for us you get a package deal\nWell as you know I didn't endorse either one of those candidates I endorse the idea of an inspector general I never said it had to be made for Thirty years I've been talking about the need for the inspector general and that's\nWhy I have supported that concept don't want to continue I in fact to support that concept but you know on the underlying issue of\nFor telling other people to get out of the race\nA tower I again I Can't stress enough you know the ... that is involved in that people have a right to run for office number one number two to say that somebody should get out so that my candidate wins is tantamount to saying well your vote somehow should be more important\nThan somebody else's vote who might want to support the candidate and it's exactly the same attitude for example that excludes a doctor Luis Munoz\nFrom the debate tonight oh he's going to take time away\nFrom the other candidates knows\nHas probably the precious ideas on what to do about the state of Rhode Island and all the rest of the lump together right but he won't be on that stage because he's not a multi millionaire that can fund his own campaign and he's not out there shaking the trees from political action committee and in a way\nYou know the so called public radio in the so called you know journal and you are right there were complicit in instilling the voice of people who have a way to be heard but the attitude old taken away votes\nForget about it these people are running they should have the opportunity to be heard and uh it's just very discouraging to me it away the anti democratic position that people take yeah struck bad person up where you can hear from him or her or whatever\nFocus on what is going to happen to Rhode Island and let's hear what the plans are with three weeks to go in this election\nI'm speaking with Arlene pilot I couldn't agree with you more and yes I have a interviewed Dr Munoz a couple of times and he does he's really good ideas\n[laughter] and he bought them through but you know he ... they don't even invite him to a debate even though he's got the freshest concepts\nAre possibly is a medical doctor that does research all his life to benefit people and find cures for people [laughter] at all no we're not going to have him on the stage it's outrageous really when you think about it\nI I couldn't agree more I like to hear from on them and I like to hear them you know interact with each other so tonight uh you mentioned in a couple of times Arlene that they're going to be you are I it's not televised though correct I don't think it is\nNow so if you would have to show up or I guess yeah read the excerpts from it tomorrow um that should be interesting in light of all this what's happening so I'm just wondering because I think that this latest round of chaos and and you know circus like stuff\nIt it certainly I don't think in the beginning of may have some people may have laughed it off and said oh that's Joe you know blah blah blah I think it's hurting him I think the two percent comment is hurting him have they reached out to you to say help us get through this mess\nNo not at all because they know of course that again and I did not endorse or either of those candidates I endorse the idea I and I continue to endorse the idea of an inspector general is precisely because how this race has degenerated\nInto you said he said thirty forty or even Eighteen years ago and released\nThe ... the accident no I Want to hear all these kids that it's going to do to improve the quality here in Rhode Island ah you know go local product did a story today\nAnd it's about something like one percent of people have like a proficiency in math in high school I in Providence or three percent a a and a science so it's it's ridiculous the state is bleeding for crying out loud we've got to do something relative to putting this\nState on track and helping middle class people constantly ignored and what we're doing is talking about this stuff\nI agree but wouldn't you say now on the opposite side of this if if if this is the condition that the state isn't and it's been under the rug onto administration she's looking for another four years that's where people say listen let me get a two person race\n[noise] well I can understand people saying that however the underlying principle I from my perspective is that under dogs have a right to run as well you know again I said earlier that to me the most creative ideas that of emanating out of this campaign that nobody knows about has come from a doctor Luis noodles\nAnd nobody knows about it okay and that's a shame and I'll stand you know for him to death that someone like him should have the opportunity to be her and\nI and ... and and that's what we're lacking this this this subtle complicity of silencing people who don't have a million bucks to put into their own campaign\nAnd that's wrong for democracy and all of us should just be listening to what people have to say not condemning is saying you get out and you get out no you don't belong on the stage that's not what democracy is about\n... people will be heard but make them talk about what the real issues here in Rhode Island we now is going by I got a I got it I understand enough already three weeks what are you going to do for\nParticularly the middle class here in Rhode Island\nAll right Arlene violent appreciated we'll talk to you again in a day three weeks in a day\n[laughter] I get on the right [laughter] they say this to you in the list of all very much\nArlene violent yeah I hear that I hear that on the front page of the journal over the weekend for three eight nine seven seven six let me go to rose who's been holding Rosen jeopardy I rose\nHi good morning Hi I'm so like a [noise] [laughter] so the reason that I was calling because I first want to say that\n[noise] Joe what's your comment about the cheaper than a I think even though it might hurt him by saying that um I mean I don't think it's going to hurt them enough\nI think he's still get the same amount of votes that he would have quiet just saying that it's kinda like how a federal thing before he got\nIn and everybody was like oh I Can't believe you said that he said that he is but we did not saying that\nThe end that you're going to get in because of the obvious math but\nEverybody has it in this race a right to say what they want that but it's the ... they're not going to be nice to each other they're not going to say the things they're not friends at it as a ... fighting to get in and apparently a lot of people do um I think there is a larger reason\nIt that someday I Hope well here\nI Know well when you when you like to hear before November ...\nYes I Would definitely what um so that's what I wanted to say about that and I just wanted to add and that I read an article about why and Lady Gaga and I just I\nThat as well [laughter] I'm working on I'd I'd like to make an event around it believe it or not we see so many great wouldn't it be fine if we can all go together\nWere ... and they said that Bradley Cooper um I guess I didn't realize he said he made a friend with her for life

think we all would like to do that it's the kind of movie that just it stays with you and then you want to see it again so when I'm trying to do is 'cause I Know a lot of people may have already seen especially over the weekend\nOr an email me if you did ... at six thirty WPRI dot com you want to go back and see it again I had to hold myself back from going this weekend loan with my popcorn\nSo

B. R. O.\nWelcome back to ten thirty six on this Monday a more twists and turns in the governor's race than we could ever probably want to deal with and getting away from the issues and uh some of the mudslinging and digging up\nStories from the past and I'm sure you're well aware of them I had never spoken to this woman before but I Know she recently spoke to the Associated Press her name is Robyn she's calling in from North Carolina and Robin you are a one of the two surviving sisters of\nMr skipper James skipper who was the person that was\nKilled in an accident involving Cranston mayor Allen find is that correct\nThat's correct\nAnd I I I listen I appreciate your calling in my heart breaking for you because I had said you know you can't go this low and you can't bring another person's family into this and yet this is what's happening and and I know that you want to lash out so I'm going to give you the moment to say what you want to say\nIraq thank you\nI appreciate it I'm really the purpose of my call is not to deport Allan Fung politically I\nI don't live in Rhode Island any longer on is that not my objective on my the purpose of my phone call is to respond to the end all\nThat trouble in a way it has put out there um without any concern whatsoever about the family about\nMy brother's death on I think um for him to to to just a throw this out at long\nIn response to something that he actually did um years ago\nIs really wrong I mean in his situation it\nWasn't a death\nOr it was a simple assault on he says it was accidental I mean whatever I guess you'd have to be there mhm um but um it\nIt isn't no comparison to my family's last and I I really I take great offense with the political assault\nSo you're ... you're asking the ... campaign to stop using your brother's death to zing o ... yeah\nYeah thank you very much you've you've said that really quite well I it's a matter of fact I'd like an apology\nIn writing ...\nI really would a public apology because it's just it's it's completely and consider it\nWrong if he doesn't have enough good things to say about and self without having to bring up nasty stuff like that that maybe he shouldn't be the governor [noise] also\nIf he's he shouldn't have to to worry about on people bringing up his past why didn't he put it out there in the first place\n... well yeah I mean I I think I Would I'm just going to answer when I think they're going to say and that would be you know so long ago he barely remember side but\nCertainly it involves a people that that we all know including the speaker of the house so I'll listen Robin I I understand what you're saying um there's a line that you need to um\nAcknowledge if not honor and I think you know bringing up someone who who we you lost a family member that you lost just to get a political jab at another person probably is a\nA new low so young you listen maybe he will hear you and maybe it'll turn this into a positive for himself as well by saying you know what I was wrong and I apologize to the family and I think that would be a good way to approach it right\nI think so yes well any race on it if you don't have any questions for me that's fine\nAnd driven cops backed by being only twenty five you know we lose your Seymour which is ... ... you know get special introductory precinct on the all new ... beach much financing will be able to read you recall one living under one ...\nSubject for the brutal the store for details\nThough it was a good on your legs below zero literally all of them were thrown in with family law they're all going to\nGo alone\nAnd and the wrong\n[noise] well you need some extra cash when that sound nice so we can do a couple of different things but I'll tell you the quickest way to get it is to go right into your own basement your attic\nAnd find the things that you're not using and I'm Talking about silver plated items maybe it's the tea set serving platter utensils anything that you think is\nA silver plated hall aware flat where\nBringing the entire set goals I promise you're not going to miss them you haven't used them in so long you don't even know they're down there they could be up in the attic worth the trip to bring it all to Rome and Jewish and see what you have there in cash one thousand reservoir having cramps and you bring in the silver plated Holloway or and flat where all your silver plated item then\nClean out some of those jewelry box is a little pouch is that you have a box is that you have every once in the ... and the underwear drawer you find them everywhere right one way or these hearings anymore gold silver and if you have a high end what you want to see what it's worth diamonds of course make that trip to Rome and jewelers worth it and you'll get the cash your unwanted gold silver diamonds high end watches\nAnd get rid of the silver plated items to and walk out with cash on the spot\nRome and jewelers laterally in and tell them I said hello you you're going to need some money for the holidays stop in Roman jewelers one thousand reservoir as in Princeton [noise]\nThis you're going to show those talks six or seven W. B. R. O. [noise]\nYou're going to go about forty years would be you know every bring this up I'm going to bring up the facts and kill the guy and he knocks them maybe for the season here [noise]\nI'm like in politics\nIn writing I really would a public apology because it's just\nIt's it's completely and considerate it's wrong if he doesn't have enough good things to say about his self without having to bring up nasty stuff like that then maybe he shouldn't be the governor all so\nIf if he if he shouldn't have to [noise] to worry about um [noise] people bringing up his past why didn't he put it out there and the first place [noise]\nThat is I'm Robin who called in from North Carolina one of the sister surviving sisters of the a gentleman who was killed in the fatal accident involving Cranston mayor Allen fun that has now re surface and she wants them to stop using this accident and the loss of her brother and the governor's race and she asked\nAnd and as saying she wants an apology\nFrom Joe ... and that is the new layer in all of this absolute it's turned into a complete circus for three eight nine seven seven six bodies in Providence W apparel Hi Bobby\nCharles oh good good why don't we [laughter] have you thought about that but what really so what\nDo you see these ... years old and I noticed like Donald Trump started to be with Donald Trump becoming or would I think he's only like\nToday three weeks out for three eight nine seven seven six one thing I Want to get to represent a Blake flipping good morning\nIt's MORNING ...\nAnd thanks for holding on I appreciate I Know you're you're busy during the day tell us a little bit um we've been talking about all the craziness that's been going on between the candidates are it seems to me the governor among do is doing a wise thing uh in the sense that she's not getting involved in this and it's really Alan ... and Joe ... Joe ...\nSo that being said what's the condition right now what what what are the changes that are you're going through right now what's your role right now with the Rhode Island GOP represent a philosophy\nI I like to respond to a little bit I don't I don't have much more to say about the gubernatorial race officer Christopher true man he nailed it [laughter] it's it's been ... suicide\nShow and I think that jokes rose job and he's done that a heck of a job at it and and I appreciate appreciate his boosted interview uh\nSo the Providence Journal where he frankly admitted his job was to take away from our song\nAnd so I I think a real issue in addition to the specific policy issues that Christopher are men raised is that we live in a state with a poor out voting system where whoever gets the most votes with even if they don't get a majority or we have a third party candidate who was especially admitted that his job is to be a spoiler\nOh so that that's something I think is highly problematic and I think ... and we need to reassess our per ... per hour the voting system and look at a system of this runoff voting or like Maine has done and will avoid these forty percent governors in the future so that that's my comment on the governor's race I'm Sorry what was your question\nI'll actually let me just let me just ask you one thing was what you just said you said that's Joe ... job you see him you you feel that he was put into the governor's race to what throw it to Gina Raimondo\nI don't know if anyone put him in or he put himself in just throw it but he's\nPretty been pretty clear that he wants to take votes away from Allen song he hasn't talked attack Gina Raimondo\nActually kept to the right when if you really was a winnable race do you have to talk to the center to pull independence and pulled Democrats but\nInstead he he brings on my good friend Patricia Morgan who's known as the anti Democrat I don't see how that would even help his chances of winning if he wants to pull democratic votes it hurts his chances to pull democratic votes but it helps his chances to pull Republican votes\nThat is not a winning formula is losing formula for him and our phone\nSo I think will Joe Joe is finally been honest with us and told us what his motivation is in his recent interviewing the Providence Journal and I think we all need to take heat of that as we go forward in our electoral ... deliberations\nSo let me ask you this representative cylinder you ah are have been up at the state house um since what four years or\nSo since the beginning of two thousand fifteenth before years\nOkay and you came in as an independent right yeah OK you switch to the Republican Party when\nIn two thousand and sixteen and I was a Republican or for two thousand as well as well and I kinda got just to solutions were the party and the way they treated libertarians that's a few thousand as well as convention\nOkay I'm just 'cause I you know when I used to type in you you put in the a little ... D I or are you are and I know you're in our so [laughter] um but but that being said you your position now to take a leadership role you're in the interim since represent Morgan is out\nThere is no leader now there's ... ... ... bacon I I'm the the ... which is the number two yeah uh but especially the the new leadership team will be selected after the election\nRight so do you have any insight into what this is all about as far as ... and Alan ... now I you know representing ... Morgan I Know wanted to run is going to be the governor she did run she didn't make it to the primary\nShe was very deflated after the primary and then she kind of pulled it together and went with Joe ... that was supposed to be a huge upset and it didn't I don't think it lived up to the billing what is it behind the scenes do you know that has caused such animosity\nI mean I it's clearly personal\nUh ... I think more jokes were low side and out bombs I think I was born wants to focus on the policy issues that we need to focus on\nBut it's hard to when you're constantly being attacked being called a Web being called a fancy it's frankly disheartening that that is is what Joe throws turning this election into and it it's personal invective\nUm so I think Alan ... has to respond to it but really Joe truce turning this this race into a circus where we're not talking about the issues that we need to talk about\nSo you you can't find anything you know you haven't heard of anything that would cause\nJoe blow to dislike Alan ... so much I don't know of Alan's on dislike him as much as you know vice versa because he doesn't come all the way out with that he just says you know always a blowhard but it really feels that Joe ... who is angry about something you don't have anything with the Republican Party in anything going back and forth\nI don't know and he did I honestly I don't know anything about the one thing I could think of is that Joe church do you need a National Committee men for the Republican Party and he isn't any longer I think he was replaced by these ...\nI don't know if that has something to do with it I really don't know what the fact that this was our gubernatorial election is turning in to what is clearly a personal vendetta and not about what is in the best interest\nOf the people the seat of Rhode Island I've learned in short time in politics when you start forgetting about doing what is right for the people\nAnd instead of seeking out your own personal issues and advancing your own personal interest that is when you retire and it is clear that it's time for Joe to true to require retire because he's not doing what isn't the best interest of the state of Rhode Island\nHe's taking out his personal vendetta against Alan song and he's going to hurt the state in the process\nSo its retirement time in my opinion\nBefore the election listen as soon as you develop a mindset where it is your own personal interest that from the interest of the public\nThat when you need to go in ... ... people hang on hang on too long and they forget what we're off your for your just shouldn't be in public office anymore and I go to Joe truth is for ... what we're doing off here\nOr I represented Blake ... uh you have what's your race shaping up to be\n...
