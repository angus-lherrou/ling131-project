out too hard copy free of charge\nJak these are all such great tips and strategies where do we go from here\nWell you know if we're if we're looking at trying to get organized in case you pass away\nThere's other things that you should consider not many people think that life insurance has for younger people\nThat have a mortgage there are so raising their kids and that is an absolute correct way to think about it but it doesn't mean that as you get older there's no good uses for life insurance so whether you're in the fifties sixties even Seventy some older\nWe have put insurance is in place for people to really to leverage what they can pass on to their family so there's two two things that you want to look at uh you want to take care of your spouse number one and if it's important to you to pass on a legacy to your children\nI've trademark something called the IRA leveraged legacy plant\nAnd that is discussed in my book if you happen to go to Amazon dot com or mass and money dot com and click on the the book button it'll bring you to Amazon and you can purchase that book and it fully explains what that IRA LeBron's legacy plan is and it is so effective for passing on\nMoney from you to your children\nThat's income tax free and it's a wonderful plan and it has so many other benefits that you can pull into that as well\nIt's such an important thing to look at so if you care about somebody having life insurance provide some some dollars so if you want to have a plan on yourself so that your spouse has more money to live on in their last years that's a great a perfect place for life insurance\nAlso if you were to have taken a retirement or a pension plan\nAnd let's say that like many people think that sixty five years ago I think I haven't seen this in a quite a while back but years ago I met with so many people that was Seventy five years of age and they were their pension was ending and I'm like what is going on why why is this happening\nWell these folks these guys primarily said you know what I was sixty five I could barely get out of bed in the morning I freak there was no way I Would live past Seventy five and here I Am I'm healthy as a horse and my pension is ended because I took more money for just ten years instead of doing a lifetime guarantee\nSo if you took what's called the life only pension and you have a spouse then you should consider having insurance in place that will replace that loss of income that your spouse will have to deal with if you pass away and your pension goes away with you another key areas that we look at to make sure that\nThe spouse if if one passes at the surviving spouse has what they need to live a you know a nice life for their final years as well\nJust talk about the importance of naming beneficiaries\nYou know this is a topic that I talked about every time I get a a group of people together whether it's a public seminar client event I always talk about this because it's something that people tend to overlook\nUm but naming beneficiaries you know this is part of the whole decision tree that you go through as to who will get what\nYou know who will get this account gets that account or all the accounts going to be split evenly you know after you pass away your name them on insurance policies annuity policies retirement accounts et cetera\nThey also will supersede what you see what you're putting your last will and testament so simple example let's say you have four children and you say in your will my kids split everything equally\nBut uh let's say on your uh let's say you have an to an annuity that's going to have some cash when you pass away but you only put one of your kids' names on that I knew what he for whatever reason\nThey get it it doesn't matter that the wolf says it should be split equally among saw for children so a beneficiary designation will always take precedence over the last will and testament as my attorney or when he's talking to her clients he says look to will speaks last\nIn the will only handles assets in one person's name\nThat does not have a beneficiary listed and that's what has to go through probate court and deal with all the delays and potential pitfalls with dealing with probing that's why\nAnd we suggest you name beneficiaries on everything and it's so important to look at your bank account because those seem to be the most overlooked\nSo what do you have savings accounts checking accounts CDs make sure that you've got beneficiary designations on all of those now we're getting some feedback that there is some financial institutions out there that limit you to one beneficiary on and account\nAnd you know in today's world the of supercomputers and software\nI ... a it boggles my mind that they're restricting people's beneficiaries like that but just just know whether your financial institution limits it or not and then act accordingly so you may want to have you have four kids who might want to have four counts and have one go to each of them you know it's very cumbersome to do that or\nYou know maybe change institutions that's always an option as well the one that's a little more flexible with what's going on so checking beneficiaries is always part of our conversation with the folks that we meet with\nOr whether you become a client or not we will always say look check your beneficiary designations it's worth the few minutes that it takes to find out what you've got\nIn and how it's structured and then fixing it appropriately now I remember when I set my trust in my forties I mean it it's a big thing to sit there and say All right if something happened to me what do I want to have happened to my assets it's\nWeird to do that I get you know I I Do I'm going through it but once it was done I have to tell you that I just felt kind of relieved that it was all laid out now as I say this I'm like I maybe it's time for me to relocate in mind too because it's it's been a while since I've done that\nI Would suggest that you look at that at least every five years or so or anytime that there's a major a family of that if there's a birth if there's a doubt if there's a divorce et cetera\nThen you may want to re look at your plan to see if everything is still appropriate the way that you have it a stylish if not we'll take some action our number here is for one three three three eight thousand uh we help guide our listeners through the maze of all these financial road blocks and hurdles that she might get\nA throne your way and the what ifs in life\nIf

will ensure that fifty percent of your state or forty percent of your state be set aside in this separate trust\nA so that it's treated as a separate gift or a separate property or and then you would receive the balance um my only thoughts whenever I set those types of dress up is that you want to make sure that\nI'm upon your spouse's passing that you are left with enough to live with\nAnother words you don't want to divest yourself of everything um to that extent in other words let's say you're a state is one point two million you don't want a a million to go into the trust and only leave yourself with two hundred thousand so it's just a little a little sticky which used to think about\nWhat was that that that was my next question because I Know that a coach\nOr my wife would remain salt trucks are both the marital ... family you know you don't have the money that you wouldn't have our own well 'cause I I I was told you [laughter]\nWell ordinarily you could take income distributions that ... maybe what they're telling you so income distributions is different than a principal distribution\nWith an income distribution if the trust itself doesn't earn income whether it be through investments or a or you know simple banks savings types of income\nThen you won't take any money out and it also depends\nAnd how this trust is structured so sometimes if you're left as trustee with the authority to borrow against the trust to take money out sometimes adult or create a problem with the tax the non taxable issue the ... what you're trying to accomplish you got to be very careful with that\nOkay I guess my last question I'm not sure the question attorney or it out but it's my understanding of marital drop out and get a stepped up ... at the data that out\nThat's right so that is correct\nYes that's correct you got to step up basis on inherited property yup\nOr is it a cause that I you\nKnow it'd be from the the person's death that's when the market value it'd

but with the eating yeah and it was in a parking lot\nAnd he ended up going forward if he asked me\nOh my goodness and so\nHe was speeding right state is that right now I get a letter\nFor clothes and I think she has you conduct what caused the accident\nTen thirty in the morning oh my goodness\nI didn't even know the president was when they asked me right now the thing that was in one store and I was just going over to the max\nAll right well I mean that's that that's I'm not sure why your attorney would send you that letter\nMost of the time pat when you meet with a client like when I meet with clients about car accidents or about any sort of injury that they've received\nUm maybe it's a boating accident or perhaps it's a um [noise] it's a slip and fall you know you have to make an initial determination about liability and about whether or not you are partially at fault or whether or not you weren't I mean based on what you explain to me if\nI'm I'm gonna just suppose here that there are alleging that you entered the Ilene of travel I Would say and that this person was speeding at an excess of rate which means that you wouldn't have been able to prevent the accident\nOr either one of us had a stop sign right\nNow like a mall\nOr how did they determine you are at fault or is it just the insurance company and saying we're saying you are at fault and so your attorney doesn't want to deal with it\nAnd it was kind of conduct and I understand that\nIt did you call your attorney you ask\nI just got to let me get\nA you know I I Would call and find out specifically what their referencing with your conduct I'm an only because I mean you don't want this accident to be assessed against your insurance in other words your insurance rates go up because now you're the one determined to be at fault\n'em in also you know you're entitled to\nUm without having to file a lawsuit your entire in Rhode Island Rhode Island has a um an arbitration statute that says that if your case is worth less than fifty thousand dollars you have the right to go to a non binding not court appointed\nA arbitration where you can actually sit down with a neutral third party and see what they think about the facts of the case I mean you certainly have that right in that your attorney could certainly ask for that\nAnd and see if you can go and present your case and see why you know what is going on I mean there has to be something here going on but\nUm yeah that that's unfortunate how many times have you met with your attorney and ... or have you ever met with them\nI met with one\nOnly once yeah no\nI mean I usually I usually meet with my clients on a regular basis I tried to meet with them maybe once a month especially in cases like this one more than that but yeah you know\nSt Thomas and I'm ... speed and the fact that he went for a seat asked me that couldn't be a factor\nOh you know ... I think you're owed given the context of that letter I think you wrote in a meeting in an appointment why don't you call them on Tuesday and see if you can get in there and uh and talking to a face to face\nOkay thank maybe get some clarification on that that's some something doesn't seem right or maybe they think it's just not worth pursuing and maybe that's the honest answer I don't know\nI write a Wright Patt your welcome all righty so you know a\nThis was attorney Steve will make your hopes of legal to zero WPRI oh four oh one for three eight nine seven seven sexual one eight hundred three two one W.

B. R. O. one eight hundred three two one WPRI\nSleeve and already\nWe're back this attorney the ... of legal tips air on WB I rode for one for three eight nine seven seven six or one eight hundred three two one W.\nR. O. N. so um we were talking about a lot of a recent cases in recent developments in the law and and things that you know may not impact you today but now you have some nuggets of knowledge that if they do impact you in the future number one you know who to call but number two\nYou know what to do and you know what your rights are and that's the\nThat's the important thing so a very recently a case game you know through my office and I obviously I have a lot of cases but um this was an interesting case say individual was sued in a different state and when they were students a different state they did not respond to the lawsuit\nSo they were sued or they didn't respond so they would be faulted in the\nDifferent state which meant that uh they basically lose the case and uh the creditor went on to obtain a judgment against my client\nNow they came to Rhode Island and filed a lien against their house which brought them into my office the say wait a minute what is this we didn't know we had to do anything we didn't know we had to respond because they sued us in this other state\nAnd um you know unfortunately a lot of contracts that we signed today\nHave what's called a forum selections clause now what that means is the contract itself says that you can sent\nTo the jurisdiction of Vermont New York Delaware wherever that is which means that if there's a contract issue a breach of contract\nI'm a contractor issue for um [noise] you know or maybe they broke the contract or they're trying to collect on the contract\nAs was this case they have the right to sue you in that foreign jurisdiction and when they see you in that jurisdiction if you don't respond by retaining an attorney there and filing the appropriate paperwork you automatically lose now\nUp until recently I Would say well recently I I don't know I've been doing this Twenty one year so I Would say probably maybe five or eight years ago in order for that judgment lean to be effective in Rhode Island\nYou would have to take the paperwork from the foreign jurisdiction file in Rhode Island in ask that that be certified by the court so in other words the Rhode Island resident or in if it were Massachusetts Massachusetts president would have the right to go to court in object\nTo that well the roar laws change and so states provide each other comedy which means that they give one state the same jurisdiction will effect as another state\nAnd so in nowadays if they get a judgment in a foreign jurisdiction all they have to do is open a file in Rhode Island and filed the document and it's automatically certified by the clerk so\nYou're right you get very limited now how do you protect yourself against this thing happening well number one is to read contracts but I Know I mean look I'm a very practical realistic attorney I understand I mean I signed a Cox contract I mean probably says in there that they could sue me in New York\nYou know so I understand that these things happen\nBut when you have the ability to control\nA contract for example you're negotiating something as a business owner or maybe you're negotiating with a builder or a contractor you should read your contract and if it says that you want to draw a line through it you want to print Rhode Island or you want to print Massachusetts or Connecticut whatever ...\nAre from an initial it in that way if a case is brought against you you're in a friendly jurisdiction your in your home state but you also have the ability to defend yourself in that state now this is an interesting issue because\nIn this case the reality is that they can sent it to that jurisdiction and now they have this lean against their house and so what do you do with a lien against your house you know it's very disconcerting when somebody does something that that that way\nBecause it more highland when somebody records leaning against your home it's good for Twenty years in other words once it's on your title\nIf you ever sell your property or if you want to refinance your property you have to either pay off that lean and negotiate some sort of settlement\nBut I'll tell you I'll be honest with you most of the time the liens earned twelve percent a year interest and while they're earning that interest it's just growing and growing so after so many years after what eight years the lean has doubled\nIn what the original amount was you know so it just continues to grow in so it's a scary thing so listen\nIf you get served paperwork it doesn't matter what jurisdiction that's from you have to answer that paperwork you have to respond otherwise you get the fault in you know I'm I'm In court all the time and I see this people sued\nBy these debt collection companies and they never respond they just never responded so they get all these wage garnishment and judgment leans in attachments against them personally and you know and that's\nThat just makes everything worst you have the right to defend yourself you have the right to speak up and you have the right to get your own attorney to do it for you and and and especially if you own real estate or us assets you never want to let those things go on checked\nIn especially in that case so you know ... you know this goes both ways so if you are in business and you're listening to me you certainly should make sure you review all of your contracts because businesses can get impacted significantly when they're doing interstate\nA contractual work All right so that was an interesting issue and I hope maybe that cleared up some things for folks who are going through that and going through that very similar issue now if you're dealing with something and you have a question the number here is four oh one for three eight nine seven seven six or one eight hundred\nThree two one W. P. R. O. and um how much time do we have before next break Mr producer you're got about four minutes four minutes running it's hot all righty so it's time for KOSU yeah plenty of time for the call so\nI should not be concerned about the truck because both our names are on it\nAnd he has every bit as much right to have been trucked in my yard as I have to want it not done a quiet changed lawyers\nAll right so now that you've changed lawyers I recommend that you ask your new lawyer to file a motion with the court and it may seem trivial\nBut honestly he they may think distribute ... I don't\nBecause it almost feels as if it's a way somebody is maybe continuing abused or causing you distress knowing that causing you distress and allowing it to happen so I Would ask my new attorney to file a motion with the court specifically to address this one issue that the truck either be sold\nAt fair market value and the proceeds are distributed\nThat the truck either be removed for salvage if it's unreasonable or that he simply remove the truck and take your name off the title immediately in in that way you know that those issues are addressed I I don't think that that's unreasonable and I think your attorney should be able to get a court date within the next four to five weeks\nOr and and I think you should ask them that okay\nSo I I don't think you're being unreasonable with that I think you should ask you ask your attorney\nTo please file a motion with the court to address this issue and probably just the filing of the motion will prompt a response from the other attorney said his client yet the truck out of there because if you're going to have to pay me to go to court to argue about this issue\nSo that's that's what I Would recommend you do\nSo I could theoretically have to wait another four weeks for the papers to get even care\nWill know ordinarily ... you know Donna when you file paperwork with the court the court will assign a court date view so like for example I just recently filed some\nDivorce related issue paperwork in Rhode Island and I got a court date in about four or five weeks so you may conceivably have to wait for the five weeks until you get that court date before the vehicles move but at least you know what to do to get the process started that's the important thing\nSo on Tuesday or Monday you're going to call your attorney's office and you're going to tell them listen this is what I Want number one I Want a motion filed that either the truck can be sold for ... market value and we split the proceeds or to the truck be removed and my name be taken off title I'm within\nFive days All right and and I would I Would say that that's what you want and be very clear about what you want in that way you know that it's getting done and then you should ask\nThem all sore her to send you a copy of whatever's filed with the court you should always get copies of your court filings are right\nThat that makes sense but you said that you've never heard of anyone either asking for or receiving storage fees\nNo I [noise] I not that I've never heard of it you can ask for\nIt I'm very rarely will according to that\nIt would have to be an extreme circumstance for them to impose storage fees on personal property that's being stored on a piece of real estate it so I I I Would just advise you that probably at this point\nYou you you because you haven't filed a motion before\nSo let me let me explain it this way let's say you file your motion you go to court and the judge ordered him to remove the truck within five days and take your name off of title and he refuses to do that at that point your attorney can file a motion to a judge in contempt and you can ask for specific fees for damages\nSo that's how you get to the the issue but because your previous attorneys had\nNever done anything for you on that front I I think that that's the issue or write Donahoe\nOkay think statement\nAlready have a good day I Hope it works out\nAll righty so um you know we're wrapping up for today and I just wanted to say thank you to everybody who's listening I really appreciate it and I appreciate your calling

of Haiti this all falls on the ring of fire which was an area where tectonic plates shift and move and over Ninety percent of the world's earthquakes occur in\nYou know the the frenzy that we felt in the spring is definitely\nTurned back a little bit and is that because that we had a lot of people buying on the anticipation of prices going up in rates going up so we stole some of our buyers of the future or is that something because\nRates in prices have gone up and it's it's changed the affordability for our ah\nOur buyers you know I'm looking at the thirty year fixed rate and I I have been telling you guys for the better part of five or six years that uh\nThat rates are going to go up and you better you'd better locking your long term interest rate right now get your refinancing make your purchase well\nYou know for a long time I felt like a liar and how it's happened the rates now the thirty year fix average as of friday was four point seven eight percent\nWhich is the highest that I've seen in a number of years um the Fifteen year is a four point zero seven percent\nAnd if you're looking at how that those\nJuice rates changed your payment\n\nLet's say that you are somebody who needed a two hundred thousand dollar mortgage and we go back a year or so ago when rates were three point seven five percent just\nThe principle in interest portion of your mortgage so this does not include any insurance taxes or a mortgage insurance\nBut for two hundred thousand at three Seventy five that payment is nine hundred and twenty six dollars okay\nIf you take that same two hundred thousand at today's interest rate will put four point seven five that same two hundred thousand is going to cost you a thousand in forty three dollars so the same two hundred thousand dollar loan\nFrom three point seven five percent a four point seven five percent is going to cost you a hundred and Seventeen dollars more per month\nAnd if we project that number out to a five point seven five percent which I don't think we're going to see here anytime soon but I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility um that we get that high\nYou know you'd be looking at a payment increase of another hundred and twenty four dollars to eleven hundred and sixty seven dollars and those are just interest rates compared to interest rates you know if you if you took that same two hundred thousand dollar loan\nAnd you add the the increase of the the one percent interest rate but then you add\nThe increase of them say roughly ten per se in mortgage you're talking about at payment that's going to go up another hundred and twenty dollars anyway All right\nWe got somebody who doesn't want to get bored to death with with numbers don't we [noise] we have Mike and Chuck it Mike thank you

some friends in the marijuana business and you know there's certain things that they can and can't do with their money because of federal law but I don't know any provisions of title insurance\nThat that the use\nOf the property would negate the title insurance because the church is for something that's already happened in the past so I really can't see how they use could make a difference now um you know your homeowner's insurance if you had a loss that per change\nTo the grow maybe be a problem with the irrigation system or if you had a fire or something like that I'm not quite sure if they use would you know if because of that particular use if you would be protected I don't know that you wouldn't but that might be something to do\nA little more research on but um but as far as title

him the professionals a photographer for Glenn designer sign company maybe even a seizure because it's important to put your best foot forward when you're home comes to market next up our advertisements in open houses other agents may tell you that these don't work\nReally maybe they just don't think the job is important not to spend the money or time you see it Williams is a real

info\nYou're listening on the real estate insiders on WB oh Rhode Island's most trusted real estate advisor halls around a call now once we ate somebody we are more one eight hundred three two one WPRI now welcome\nBack to the real estate insiders I'm here until eleven o'clock so calling now for three nine seven seven six of one eight hundred three two one nine seven seven six in anything real estate is on the table for you today [noise] um [noise] I did just get a tax from one of my clients\nThat says he's listening with a friend who had a question so I'm gonna\nTry to answer that question for them to charge you ask me how do you get rid of private mortgage insurance on your on your um\nOn your mortgage so first I guess let's talk about what private mortgage insurance is in any time that you're putting down\nLess than twenty percent to purchase a home you have to get mortgage insurance which ensures the bank against default so it in most cases they charge you a certain percentage like like they do interest rate you just figure they add it to the interest rate so um\nDepending on what type of loan you get that percentage is different it could be you know half a percent it could be one point one percent um I haven't because I just got this Texan I haven't really research that I'll just can tell you that it's a certain percentage okay so\nThe way you get rid of mortgage insurance is by paying down your loan to eighty percent of the original balance it's eighty percent of the original balance um\nOr or off the original homes appraised value I Apologize from from the purchase um or when the balance drops of Seventy eight percent the mortgage servicer is required to eliminate private mortgage insurance automatically so um\nDepending on which who you have for service sir I Believe there are chances that you can get an appraisal done\nAnd that if you're if you're alone a loan to value in relation to today's market value is below eighty percent I Believe there are some services that will allow that to happen um you know another way you can\nYou can get rid of it is of course to refinance um if if prices have gone up and you are not allowed to get a new appraisal to get rid of private mortgage insurance\nYou could refinance of course today's rates are higher than they were I'm not that long ago so it's likely that the money you would save my mortgage and ... by getting rid of mortgage insurance you would be paying more in interest rates are might negate that um\nThat savings but maybe maybe you want to take out some equity grab some money it might be worth it might work out for you so hopefully that answers your question All right we're going to go to the phone lines to travel in Charlestown your morning is Travis or ... or or either\nA Michael nice driver but you go by Dr yeah that works ... he typed out travel I don't know if he's just being lazy or what\nNot to do\nAll that good Travis you sound young to be a listener of the show\n... well I'm thirty five I don't know that young\nOr old that's in the young young range of of my a general college here how you doing\nI'm Wondering short by an alternative and helps or hurts it yeah\nYou I appreciate your your kind words there so I'm curious [laughter]\n... and buys a lot\nAnd the marketplace ...\nUm well you know what they're really is no different so what happened is what their\nAgents are always coming up with a new way to market themselves a new vernacular so\nYou know we're real estate agent doesn't doesn't sound is warm and fuzzy as real estate advisor does so now you know people are saying real estate agent there saying real estate advisor or actually in your in your example ... a ... on the\nScreen here says sales associate versus real estate agent I think real estate agent was what they called them\nTwenty years ago then we call them sales associates ten years ago\nWe're trying to call them real estate advisors but really there's no difference the differential there there's two things that differentiate one real estate from one real estate agent from another one is there um\nThere's a difference between a real estate agent only in a real tore a real chore is a member of the national association of realtors were held to a higher standard with code of ethics and we're about we're bound by their code of ethics and buy their disciplinary um\nCommittees and whatnot okay so\nUh most real estate agents that you're going to meet our real tours as well and if they're on and on the MLS system then they're required to be real tours\nNow you you go one step higher than a real chore or real estate agent and you are a broker and a broker is actually when when somebody from the public is engaging in a contract with a sales agent or a sales associate they're actually really\nFor signing a contract with the broker of the company so the broker um has a a higher level of experience\nAnd they've had to go through more class time and take a more difficult exam um and they oversee all the transactions of an office\nSo that I Know I'm I keep going on here so traveling the old days\nYou would the brokers name and I think this is still a law in the books but it it's being a\nIgnored by many people in our industry and the old days you had to have the brokers name larger than the sales associates name so everybody knew who the broker was and everybody knew who the person that they needed to talk to if there was an issue was\nNow you have a lot of these people I'm at ... there's a few companies that really tell the agents hey you run your individual business and go off and do your thing and we don't really care as long as you pay a monthly fee\nYou know and I'm so those people kind of portray themselves as brokers they have their name up they're bigger than the name of the company bigger than their\nThe brokerage name and and but they're really not their their sales associates so\nUm that's it because I it's I\nAs it compares your neighbor's house you know what I mean\nI understand you know so um we've had some good feedback you know people want it and then you don't if oh\nWell uh yeah I don't speak\nThere in your yard you know it's very relaxing the water and so forth and so\nOn suit and it's pretty to look at very pretty to look at you know with the fish the Korean there and uh when it was up at night and uh relax so you know you might\nMarket this you know you might market visit places such as like a pet store you know like just like may get some material there or in in publications that somebody might have the interest um I think anybody that was interested in flowers and things like that\nAnd gardening that would be helpful for this or even somebody who does meditation or something along those lines somebody you know so there are certain number of people that would embrace this type of feature and consider it um\nYou know to be a positive so and like you mentioned you've had people\n... what did they said that they'd be interested in purchasing your home is because of it is that where you were saying\nNot ... not because of it in general it has a lot of experts how oh the well kept on the

semi utilize what I had and uh like I say we've enjoyed\nIt but it like on the you\nKnow what there's going to be the next person that enjoys it and you and you mentioned if your house is meant then this feature is going to have even more value you know because I'm is because\nThe totality of the property is in in that same condition you know and and I meet with a lot of people have been in their home for a long time and I I have to say\nYou know a house that is totally correct a buyer is willing to pay more money for that home you know we we all think about the updates and this and that and
