O.\nI don't know if it's ... or ... how do you pronounce that refers to flash was we were sixteen okay [noise]\nAnd so when a your friend mark judge said the same with the same thing as your ... back to you at the same media was flatulence\nI don't know what he did but that's my recollection won't talk about flatulence a sixteen year but it's\nUm [noise]\nAll right that is that the real testimony\nJudge Kavanaugh and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse from Rhode Island and it's of course made its way into Saturday Night live and to you know comedy sketches never thought I Would be sitting in Studio with a\nJudge Robert Flanders talking about flatulence so there's that I'd like to get that right on the other way [laughter] oh so ridiculous good morning judge planned on good morning to you know we've gotten to\nWould would you have ever thought it'd be hearing these things in the halls of the U.S Senate if well\nNo it was embarrassing I think ah for everyone to listen to it and uh I think unfortunately Rhode Island\nUh played a role in this proceeding though I Would rather not have because it was a totally embarrassing and I don't think children what else did himself any favors by opening up this year book line of questioning about to suffer more references and\nThis man's your book to slang nicknames for his classmates when they were teenagers in high school\nI have to say last week we were a lot of us were saying I you know if you had your your book and you took it out I wouldn't remember half of the people I wouldn't remember half of the nicknames I I kept journals and diaries myself all the time up until I had my children and I can go back to high school and college and say I don't even know who these people are so that's a challenge in itself\nOf course and that's the problem was going back thirty six years to try and reconstruct what happened here and that's\nThat's the fundamental problem that the Senate committee has having and trying to parse through these allegations and reconstruct what happened when the details are so sketchy\nAnd people's memories fade and legally this is you know frankly why we have such a limitation because uh even for civil cases it's when you have to go back decades to try and figure out what happened\nUh memories play tricks and people can't naturally remember things so it's very difficult and the law in a legal proceeding would not even in most cases let let these claims to see the light of day because of that very reason\nSo this is I'm just coincidental timing right but you're in a in a race in Europe putting a lot of time and energy and I would imagine money into this race to unseat Sheldon Whitehouse he's now\nOne of the key you know people that are being focused on one of the key lawmakers rather um because of his line of questioning whether you think it's funny or not\nBut here's the backstory this this this fake person right because we were looking at a Twitter account who has apologized for saying hey I Know about another incident in Newport on a boat with these two guys and a woman and I went over there and beat him up the next day because they attacked her and one of them happens to be you know this is according to the\nStory that went out\nHe contacts Senator Sheldon Whitehouse his office and from what all we can understand is Senator Whitehouse then takes it to the FBI but also to a reporter somewhere\nWell that's where that's where he really went off the rails because I think it was a dishonorable of him to do that he was trying to feed a media frenzy over this whole situation instead of just living the investigatory process take its course by having the FBI or the Senate committee look into this\nHe also simultaneously apparently sense at all since his him off to a ... a reporter to investigate this supposedly but knowing that once you get it in the hands of the reporter the story is going to come out before it's been vetted before it's been investigated and not surprisingly it turns out to be\nA false accusations of men re cans a yet in the meantime it as a to um the ah the Lynch mob mentality around a this candidate\nHi Kevin Mahoney here with New England truck solutions ... we have to say that when New England industry leader and sneak out production insulation entering\nFor a true one stop shop because we all aspects of the job without having to outsource any way specializing in vehicles ... changes\nAnd well one of the few graphic phase anyway that off the highly acclaimed three am MCS brand mourn\nSix five nine zero zero zero\nOn line to anti trust solutions that\n\nFor referring to Georgetown versus Louisville and what you want any more on the Orioles versus Red Sox in both of us thought who won any way or who won that game any way\nShould we draw the conclusion that a loss of recollection associated with alcohol was involved and you're not knowing who won the games you attended\nNow a first of all the Georgetown Louisville was watching it on TV Party\nAnd the that's inconsistent with drinking and not remembering what had on I'm aware and the point of a vote for us we in essence we're having a party and didn't pay attention to the game you been out of the game was the excuse we had for getting together\nLike that is a part of the real testimony I Know a lot of people are having some fun with it because it's Saturday Night live and making all kinds of social media means and things like that that is part of the testimony or with a judge Kavanaugh and then the question and coming from our Senator Sheldon Whitehouse there in Washington and now this\nYou know as we were saying before my goodness Rhode Island somehow gets in in the thick of things here we're in the middle of this now\nBut this is actually benefited your campaign Robert Flanders judge planted in Studio with me this morning at night that detail\nFrom all across the country you're getting all kinds of feedback donations what's happening\nFrom all over the country people are emailing texting me sending donations after watching Senator Whitehouse to his ah uber cross examination another was mistreat a judge Kavanaugh who for strange reasons he persisted in calling Mr Kavanaugh again a sign of a disrespect which he showed throughout the hearing\nAnd this is enraged people they they can't believe that this man is a U.S senator and so uh they've been\nContacted me every way possible and sending donations from from as far as way as California and Arizona Tennessee Nebraska obviously this wasn't happening before I don't know it's it's been amazing to see the support that this was generated and look I think we'll continue to generate so\n... you know it's time for a change here and uh that's been my message from day one that we need a climate change in Washington and this whole situation with his hearing as exhibited a it's just unbelievable\nThe partisanship that we see\nAnd so I think we need folks who can work together and\nActually it was good to see the compromise that Senator Flake or in his Democratic counterpart worked out\nFor another week of investigations I don't think that's going to end anything by by by the way I think we're going to see more requests for delay from the Democrats but I liked the fact that there was some old fashioned effort to compromise here and work together and that's kind of spirit I Want to bring to Washington\nCertainly I well I said he got a lot of he's not even running again right Jeff no\nNo I'm stepping down as he's frankly set on sixty minutes or last night I couldn't have done this if I was still running but\nBut he he felt liberated by the fact that he wasn't and was able to reach out to his Democratic colleagues and say look for the good of the nation let's let's get another week here of investigations see if that is able to calm things I don't think it will or at least not on the Democratic side\nBut I I like the effort that he made and I'm hoping that it will help to secure a some a wildly Republican votes that are in question right now\nSo we ... we have red rather planted in Studio right now is that about five and a half weeks little little more than five weeks till we get to go in and vote and you you've got a couple of debates coming up the banks with us\nSenator or yes so we have two debates as of now and I'm hoping for more of challenge them to ten debates night but obviously I Will debate him as often as possible wherever he wants to debate I Will be there\nAre we've got to um a as so I'm a one rock to liberate them one later in the month or so [noise] I think voters will get a chance to see us in in that context as well as out on the campaign trail\nSo in your own state wide circles right you're going to events I'm sure you're going out and shaking hands how much is this Kavanaugh hearing saga situation besides the donations that are coming in but but the here I don't think people are following enough to push you even closer to Sheldon Whitehouse\nAbsolutely uh people are coming up to me left and right sing for God's sake we got to get this guy out of there he is not helping us he's embarrassing has\nA he's not doing their country any favors please you have to win and this is a message I've been getting over and over again as I talked to people at at all the events that I'm going to\nA so it's a generated a lot of interest\nOr as you know the the governor's race has got a lot of attention but now with the center White Houses despicable performance during the Kavanaugh hearings\nAre I think this is a a energizing new voters to say wait a minute this is not the kind of man we want representing us in the Senate twelve years of do nothing obstructionism is not going to be rewarded with yet another six years\nAre you finding how are you finding the female voters are they in because they would tend to you would think in Rhode Island pretty blue state I'm pretty liberal state that they may be all about Senator Whitehouse getting out there nailing this guy you know and\nThis has happened to other women and you've got all of these you know really dividing themes with this one particular case how are you finding that as you're out and about\nA many women are coming up to me with the same message and I think what I understand what these women understand is that\nThere's no need to disrespect women who have gone through this horrific experience of sexual abuse but at the same time it doesn't mean that every time somebody accuses somebody of something that they are automatically guilty\nAh doing this that has to be proven and so people understand the false accusations happened that can be a man that could be a woman it could be anyone and so\nWhen you're accusing someone of criminal misconduct there was a heavy burden of showing that that this person who's actually done it and you're going to need some corroborating information before you take down person after so many years of of good behavior\nReal quickly I Am I'm almost out of time but would you we will you be using nothing your political ads I mean not that you want to put the flatulence in your ads but would you be switching things up because of this whole you\nKnow I think I think we will use is it's hard not to and so by I think it will point out the fact that I'm running\nA on a platform that wants to pursue bipartisanship and this man is one of the most partisan senators down there and this is a is a is a perfect example of it so yes I think this will be fair game for for future comment both an ads in the discussion\nAll right judge Robert Flanders thanks for coming in Studio and we'll talk against him thank you so much Hartley take a quick break right here and we'll come back president speaks at eleven o'clock and will break down also some activities in the governor's race as well as the race for US Senate when\nProspect charter care the parent company of Roger
