my daughter don't go to the bathroom alone don't get a car loan don't take an over alone to leave you drink I've been saying that to her since she was whatever go to a sleep over say with their little friends\nOnce you release them and actually allow them to go have a sleep over right that's your what are you early traumas it gets worse young parents\nAnd it's funny because I have\nI had my kids are little sooner than most of my girlfriends so not I'm not the one with the oldest kids but um maybe second or third all this\nAnd so those that still have kids in high school or their their their right now going on the college tours and I'm so jealous because it was so fun and I want to go back to you All right but I Can't [noise]\nAnd it was such a blast so this whole picture of drunk in sexual attacks I I think I think the young people are fearful almost young kids yikes [noise] I just I think this whole\nScene is so unfortunate and I think the young\nNeed to be talked to just as much as the young girls and listen I wouldn't be I wouldn't be no room alone at a party with someone unless that's your girlfriend that's your boyfriend a no need for it stayed with a group I mean you said that to your kid we said that to our kids repeatedly if not you crazy\nI'm Sorry you don't allow them to go you know once you get a little old and they wanna go to a concert you don't leave each other side meaning the girls I don't go to the bathroom alone you don't go in a room alone you don't walk home alone I don't care what happens to you know if your girlfriend's\nFalling down knock on her teeth out your drag her get her home\nSo my big problem with the first story was Dr Ford was something happened to her she believes she leaves a party\nAnd where is the follow up story with the one other girl that was there why did you leave me why did you get outta here what happened if that conversation and that's a lifelong friend and I have lifelong friends second grade\nAnd then a big group of us as the seventh grade and we are talking about this now we're going back and say remember that party remember that kid we're all doing it I find it hard to believe that people are not discussing it\nAnd you know you had kids girls and guys that would be the one ... yeah sloppy drunk falling down I've gone to high school reunions all for the love of God pick her up really still right not now that I'm not going to say it's one of my closest friends but you know just ... somebody you know give us some water give her a cup of coffee not a good look at this age\nHowever you know that people can turn it around so it was in fact I mean one of the stories today folks against judge Kavanaugh is that he was in\nA bar there was a fight and he threw ice and that is what they're looking at that is what our FBI spending time and money on\nAnd keep in mind and I'm not defending him in the sense that maybe he wasn't a couple of these\nYou know stupid parties and things happened I don't know if he was a part of it but there's not enough evidence there's not enough proof there there are accusations this third woman we're going to walk through it because I Can't believe I I really can't believe\nAnd I don't even think that the reporter wanted to sit there and do it I mean there's a there's a lot of us that are highly competitive yet wow I'm going to get this woman on the air if you know that she's spewing\nUnsubstantiated almost remarkable statements that don't make sense you have to sit there and interviewer that's a tough position to be put in and they went with it you know 'cause I got it first I understand that\nBut it's so detrimental some of the things that she is saying and no backup at all no corroboration\nUh her lawyer is often ... who is the porn stars lawyer he's he is like a shark in the way he's looking for anything he must have people scouring that Montgomery County area for anybody that was around in the eighties and anybody who had something to do with that class they they are\nScouring they've lived the clock is ticking\nAnd he just wants a chunk of the limelight and you know what I'll say it out loud this third woman she she's enjoying the limelight heard her presence in her recounting of whatever she says was going on is nothing compared to the first woman who was visibly shaken\nHurt traumatized if you will this woman is just loving sitting under the lights okay I said it now women go ahead bang my head up against the wall I don't believe her at all\nI'm Talking about the third woman not Dr Ford I'm Talking about Julie sweat Nick let's play another chunk of her\nAnd we'll go with a\nWill go with nine and ten she's talking about party she went to she was Nineteen and community college she was going to high school parties she said oh everybody did they were ages from fourteen Fifteen up to twenty five okay now let me tell you something I was in part is when I Lived in Virginia\nI was a very open door kind of a thing the whole based a basketball team would go to this one particular I can say the name 'cause it's Alexandria, Virginia we went to um [noise]\nHave to remove a chinchilla was their last name a ashes and we chinchilla and their parents were there and they would just go upstairs and everybody would have a party and I don't recall anybody really misbehaving except maybe you know being stupid but certainly nothing sexual\nOr this is what she said that she saw happening nine intend this was last night NBC with Kate Snow in this is the third woman coming forward sweating it\nWell and so what happened and he happened to me I didn't put to ensure together\nBut I Would save boys standing outside of\nRooms congregated together sort of like a gauntlet and I didn't know what was occurring out but I Would see them laughing a lot of laughing I'm standing in line outside or on the line but definitely huddled by Doris and I didn't understand what a to possibly may\nAnd and your declaration and you describe Brett Kavanaugh and his friend mark judge standing outside same them stand outside the door\nSuggesting that in hindsight you think he was also said I Would say\nI it's just too coincidental\nI took to this guy standing in the hallway talking to each other and she's describing the scene as their drugging women putting something in their red solo cups and taking their turns with a drunken girl behind the door but it took her nine to ten parties\nTo figure it out and then she says something happen her she went into very little detail but if in fact something happened than you know my apologies but she she basically just she is so solid and her presentation is if she's she's in a play\nAnd you know what maybe the women are going to be mad at me but I don't believe this woman I Do believe something happened to the first woman came forward I don't on this one I think this woman is looking for the limelight she's finding the light jak as in Providence on WPRI hijack\nA ... um agree with you this woman is kind of I'm not really you know even if he's out of a group like that but I Do believe you feel you bought I bought a ... at all what probably wants him at this point\nIn your view you know people left and right I think who just leader and calm who went on and he stressed at all and I'm always impressed that I Need I'm sure you\nDespise I'm ... I'm Sorry it was so angry at the hearing and then his attack on the Democrats and the left and here's what I don't understand that but if you go in there to a woman that don't push them to um uh to nominate she's even walk conservative on him\nYeah I wouldn't want her is on the Enron beret Amy Coney Barrett yeah it's like\nAt this point I I don't know you got to really question any any oh Clarence Thomas set of ... things when you go in and he said this was a lynching so but she didn't go all out I mean when when you are kind of annoyed with them to go to me that's like a a very still\nOf the right that the Clintons are still involved and stuff like that all I'm saying is I don't think he had with them and I think he touches there's going to be in the in the far right\nOr some of the er at the Washington so worried about that about to go through it all the way because they don't want to try the court trucks overturn roe the way they don't want to have it all through the state is an angry man you know to help with the government should be on drugs that are on the left\nWell I'll tell ya jak that was that was the one thing I'm at you know as opposed to him saying do you like beer you know all this stuff in the in the in the year book and all that that we talked about an awful lot yesterday I I Will say that that was the one thing that surprised me if you go back and you have to watch it a couple of times because it was so emotional in the beginning that you um I felt for him I really did I thought wow this whole man's life is\nIt seems like it's coming to a crashing halt\nAnd and and you gotta figure you know we hadn't even heard any we heard the one woman right we heard the one woman and she was believable so you think wow a heated something and and he's going to pay for it and that's fine because that's just the way life goes\nThen when he did get angry like that and and uh he I thought he was just gonna leave I thought he was going to pull his own name out of a mix\n[noise] so I get what you're saying if that's the guy that you're sitting in front of your life is on the line and he's having a bad day I mean that if you sit in in any in the courtroom you can see and\nI have many many times just because of covering cases and you have to wait for your story to come up so say it's a\nI don't know the politicians in trouble you have to go through the whole you know day to get go through the calendar to get to your story ... ... you know the the case that you're waiting for Jack and you'll see what mood that person isn't the robe you'll see what the judge all sometimes she wouldn't get away with it and sometimes if you even\nYou know blink even for the media I remember getting yelled at because I put my arm unlike the back of the bench I put my arm off put your hands up okay I Can't chew gum if they're in the mood there in a mood and they're only human but there's got to be self discipline and I know exactly what you're

I don't think he ever did that\nSo this has gotten very very money for Senator Sheldon Whitehouse he's saying this guy deserved and apology and this guy maybe under investigation\nSo I don't know where are some planes or not to be credible this is the journal the Rhode Island man who based on details from his Twitter account first of all you have a goofy fully Twitter accounts there are\nThey've been identified and am I going to name the moment I guess his name is out there you know Jeffrey catalogue of tempered in ... we don't know if that's the real guy 'cause I could make a thing and say I'm Derek catalogue of temperature and\nHe contacted White House's office last week according to the journal about sexual assault of a female friend that he said had occurred in Nineteen eighty five in Newport fight then ensued leaving the assailant significant injuries according to the man\nSenator Whitehouse also alerted the FBI and gave a reporter's contact information to the guy cattle on according to a letter from White House released by the committee\nHe did so at the constituents request a spokesman for Senator Whitehouse said yesterday Monday no media reports ever came out of the White House I guess they did channel ten story [laughter] we have Patrice talking about it it's\nIt was a story because it's part of this will Kavanaugh situation a spokesman for Senator Whitehouse would not identify the constituent\nGuess anybody can say anything and then it gets leaked to the press and it can be fake and in the meantime someone's life is hanging in the balance Republican committee staff ask Kevin ... about the catalog allegation the next day that's the guy in Rhode Island and he said it was simply not true\nThe committee released transcripts of the interview and redacted the man's name so the guy on Twitter whose last name is supposedly catalog could not be reached for comment\nI'm kind of surprised that more people are looking for him especially if he's going to be under some kind of an investigation\nWhite House talked to reporters on Sunday called it a very unfortunate situation and said he was not the one who ousted the man or his allegations this is a stunt pulled by Republican committee staff Senator Whitehouse and I hope when things come down a little bit there will be appropriate apologies made to our constituent how would you\nGuys getting involved in a giant national\nSaga with false as for all that we know false information it's an apology\nOh no now listen I I understand Senator Whitehouse saying okay oh here we go is a fifth accusation fourth or fifth I've got to take this to the FBI I'm going to take this to authorities I don't know why he took it to the media\nAnd and and now he's calling for an apology to the guy who got him in the gym quite frankly [noise] oh I don't know\nWell he was on good morning America this morning so we're going to listen to that it's only about three minutes for three eight nine seven seven to like this is the guy who if even exists made up making making a false allegations and just muddying up this whole thing 'cause you get an apology\nOr should he get investigated I think there's got to be some common ground that could be something wrong with this guy I think there's something a little wrong with the woman asserted accuser that we were talking about just out in the first hour\nI think she wanted in on this story on get get in here and make up go on NBC if I'm wrong God forgive me which I Do not believe ... eighty five Ninety percent of what that when we're talking about couldn't follow it don't believe her she was having to go to the time that's it\nNow Senator Sheldon Whitehouse has to do I make some kind of a decision here whether he's going to back this guy who if he exists if I Hope nobody made 'em up right Twitter accounts and he backs off of it nobody can find them and nobody can identify and his name's been rejected the Twitter name is still out there what a mess\nAll right let's hear Senator Sheldon Whitehouse on good morning America this morning we'll roll the whole thing it's just a couple of minutes for three eight nine seven seven six\nAre you satisfied now with the scope of the FBI and worry and can they finish by friday um I\nThink I'm sort of why we don't know all the details yet but clearly if they have been given a free rein to interview him ever they want so that's a very good sign the last thing we want to push 'em investigation I also think that there is a fairly small universe of witness was here at a very big FBI so yes I think they probably should be able to ah go\nSystem by friday or food really put the effort into it\nYou say it's a fairly small group of witnesses I guess the question is what exactly are they investigating or they simply investigating the two incidents one with Deborah Ramirez one with Dr Ford or are they doing a broader investigation into red Kevin I was drinking in in college and whether he was truthful about it before you're committed I think\nProbably a little bit of both I'm clearly for\nHis testimony is\nA very important choose the witness who wrote her story aired or very publicly that she was the subject to frame cross examination and she came through with flying colors are one hundred percent identified recovered and all of her attacker so that's got to be front and center\nOr the Ramirez shows how has the same ... but there are witnesses around vote him so that's what made the food and then ah I'm not quite sure where they're going with respect to ... shows but ultimately I Do think that was somebody's coming before\nThe United States Senate and they want to be fixed before a judge tell us the truth and if they're lying about something that is just qualified to do you think that he told the truth to your committee\nAre very grave do so at this point but that's one of the reasons we're so badly wanted an investigation so we could go to the proof of that rather than have to deal with surmise or suspicious\nOf the things you're saying from Brett Kavanaugh centers is that if he did in fact not tell the truth about the entries in his high school yearbook even about this incident at a at a bar and yell and Nineteen eighty five who was about things long ago about relatively trivial matters how to respond to your I think\nIf these things really are trivial over some minor or you know missed you if you will um [noise] what you're looking at a perjury case you were part of the ... the material same with a false statement case\nSo tiny little slip ups I don't think are the issue but if he's lying about something significant gotta worry about he would clearly be cautious about he was ... I Wanna testify to us that's pretty serious stuff\nAnd you believe it happened I'm waiting to see what the FBI or for comes back with I certainly would not rule out there's plenty to believe and what he said again it's very hard to sort through this and to have the investigation which is why we push so hard to make sure that took place\nOr whatever to witnesses he says there one hundred percent certain things you should investigators\nAlright Senator Sheldon Whitehouse on was just obviously George Stephanopoulos from a good morning America this morning we are investigating a bar fight where he threw ice\nAt someone in Nineteen eighty five [laughter]\nUh well I'll read it to you will go through it uh the New York times publisher Kavanaugh was questioned by police after a bar fight Nineteen eighty five let me ask you something\nThis is a I'm a I'm a ... just slightly bit younger than this whole craziness so eighties right Ninety mid to late eighties nineties whatever eighties I seen a fight in a bar or anybody tried to break up a fight in a bar or at a party\nA throwing ice is now considered what it's really nice on another patron according to a police report have we lost it

department does it stop you from being I don't know an elected official right running for for the mayor's office or for town council\n'cause you're through I said a patron listen all the sexual allegations have got to be flushed out if they're legit you got to get in their witnesses let's go\nThat to me is understandable going back to a police report in Nineteen eighty five after a concert where people were hustling in a bar and he threw ice on him for some quote unknown reason\nProbably to stop a fight you know it's like you put the hose on the dogs oh my I don't\nI don't know for ... for some unreal unreal reasoning through the ice yeah because people are fighting and there was stupid and they were drunk and college a witness to the fight said that ... basketball player was friends with Mr Kavanaugh then through a glass that hit the man in the ear in his ear was bleeding\nOkay that's not him that's a stupid friend anybody got a stupid friend out there\nFor three eight
