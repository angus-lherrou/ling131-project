{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WPRO", "content": "Well recently the Providence Journal our number one newspaper for the state because it covers the entire state because we're so small\nBut I had an article about a woman that is a hundred and ten years old right here in Rhode Island\nAnd and I was like wow that is amazing now oftentimes I talk at seminars how we are you know living into our nineties a at a higher percentage than any prior generation but when I saw that a hundred and ten\nI was pretty impressed site I had helped classes that Rhode Island college a while back and there was a gentleman there who said he helped care for his aunt and then ultimately she went to a nursing home and she passed three months before her a hundred in fifth birthday\nNow to me that was the eldest I'd heard or seen and then we see a hundred and ten years of age man\nHow do you make sure that your income is going to last that long\nWell we know how to do that and we use specific products that are geared to do just that and that's what I think makes us special\nBecause we do focus on getting that income that you can rely on for the rest of your life regardless of how long that may be sore number here is for one three three three eight thousand\nWe look forward to your call we will sit down with you get to visit get to know each other a little bit better determine what your goals are for your retirement either when you may started or what it might look after the fact if you've already retired\nAnd then we do a deep dive in analysis of your portfolio come back as a second meeting and then lay it all out for you and say look here's what we see and at that point in time we should both know\nIf massing associates and can help you with your planning as you move forward so it's pretty straightforward we recover a lot of ground and those two meetings\nAnd we are looking for people that are serious about their retirement planning so if you save two hundred thousand a more fuel retirement our number here is for all won three three three eight thousand\nYet are there any risks out there that you think people sometimes forget about\nYou know the one we see the most or hear about the most people don't pay attention to the health care aspect of retiring early\nBecause if you're not sixty five yeah do you do not yet qualify for Medicare part a ... or be so then you've got to take that out of out of pocket and that's a big deal\nSo it's important to keep that in mind and for those people that are nearing sixty five or if you're already sixty fiber older and you have a Medicare supplement plan\nNow is the time to give us a call for one three three three eight thousand\nAnd we can help you with making a decision do you have the best plan might you be able to get a better plan for yourself or for those that are already clients of ours 'cause I Know we have clients that are regular listeners if you have a Medicare supplement plan and you would just like us to take that over for you we'd be happy to do that for you as well\nSo if you're new to the Medicare plan you can give us a call if your existing on Medicare and have a supplement plan already we'd be happy to evaluate it for you and perhaps help you with that going forward now is the open season it started October fifteenth and we have a couple of months to get that done for you\nSo what people forget about the health insurance if you're if you go to health plan through your employer you may only be paying a portion of that but if you have to buy your own plan and you're in your early sixties that a good plan could cost you eight nine hundred thousand dollars a month for each of you\nSo that can take a big chunk out of assets for those first few years until you get to age sixty five\nSo whenever possible we encourage people to at least shoot for sixty five however we can do a plan if you want to retire at sixty two we've got plans were folks are looking to retire at fifty seven and fifty nine but\nWe worked it all out and say are you going to have to draw more money for the health insurance until you get to sixty five and then we can kind of turn turn down the withdrawals from your accounts because then you'll shift over the Medicare part a party and the supplemental plant so those are important and if you do not\nHave a plan ... foxtrot or a planned season Charlie Medicare supplement plan they will be going away after the twenty ninth T season if you will so they will still be decent planes available but the better plants in my opinion or see an F\nAnd if you don't get them like on this go round\nYou may not be able to get it after twenty Nineteen so it might be a good time to consider changing so now is a good time to really evaluate what you have\nAnd we're in the open season so call for one three three three eight thousand and we'll have you sit down with one of our professionals to review what you have and see how we might be able to help you with that so you know make a great segment with David Bach and I do look forward to help me out with his workshops in January and February\nOf ladies only workshop so if you want to get on a mailing list\nEither call for a one three three three thousand and ask to be put on the list or send an email to info at Massey and associates dot com that's all spelled out and just in the subject line for David Baake\nThe AC age and then say please ask me to your mailing list and then we'll we'll build that list over the next couple of months and be able to invite our listeners first because we're going to be have limited seatings will invite our listeners first and then we send out invitations to the public as well\nSo I Hope you enjoy the show as much as Megan and I have this week and

protest in London yesterday opposing the country's upcoming split from the European Union say more than six hundred thousand people showed up including mayor or city calm\nEverything is within reason everything is within a certain context all righty so I had a bunch of questions this week very interesting questions\nAnd you know I like to write those questions down and bring them to use it that way you have an understanding of what people are asking me on a regular basis and um\nThis question had to do with a somebody received an end you know you hear me talk about this all the time answering complaints responding to lawsuits\nSo somebody had received a document stating that they received a judgment against them on an account that was opened and closed in the year two thousand\nNow they said that they never got noticed before this they would never notified that they had to go to court or that they had to file an answer and it appears the person who signed the summons was not related to them nor were they living at the house at that time\nSo now they have this judgment and apparently the creditor is recording a lien against their home what's going on yeah apparently they went and saw another attorney who said there's nothing they can do pay you all the money the issue here is that they're selling\nIn their home and they don't want to pay this debt of four thousand dollars a because number one for all of a variety of reasons that I'm going to talk about\nSo fundamental in our rules of law or that you receive service of process that you received notice that you're being sued or if somebody is making a claim against you\nIn that notice goes right to due process it means you have the right to be heard now in this particular circumstance this individual was not residing at the property we're the creditor up presumably\nServe them with the complaint and initially my radar went off and I said well wait a minute if we can establish where you were residing than their service of processes materially defective and we can get rid of this judgment we can get this off of your property\nSee the judgment wasn't just for four thousand anymore the creditor was asking for four thousand plus statue tore interests of twelve percent a year for over ten years and um you know so obviously that's a boatload of money so what we were able to find out\nAnd I had them research by pull up there all tax returns was that in fact they were not sued they well they were sued but they were not served with process and in that\nParticular circumstance I'm going to be filing emotion with the court to vacate the judgment and release the lean because it's unlawfully upon their property so these are fundamental issues that you have to get to and I don't know I ... for them I didn't understand\nWhy there are other attorney said just pay it it didn't make sense to me because the creditor did not follow the proper course of action\nSo these are questions that come up so like I always say listen if you get served paperwork respond to it make sure you have the chance to talk about it\nAnother question that came up had to do specifically between spouses and liability between spouses so this comes up a lot [noise] [noise] and what I mean here is\nThis person called me and said their husband was being sued in civil court\nAnd they want to know if they are going to be responsible for the person's injuries so what happened here a little background\nUh apparently they had a home the husband owned a house where the wife lived and uh I I guess the insurance for whatever reason laps on the home somebody didn't pay or renew the insurance at some point somebody was over the house and and was pretty badly injured apparently\nI I mean like a broken bone type of injury and so naturally they retained an attorney they tried to find out who the homeowner's insurance was there was no homeowners insurance and now they brought a claim against\nThe husband so the the wife's question was look he owns his house I own my house this was a second marriage situation am I going to be responsible for his obligation and the answer to that is no spouses just because you're married to somebody\nDoes not mean that you are responsible for their\nObligations you are not responsible for the contracts at the other person signs or enters into now the key elements in this case that protect her and protect her property from this lawsuit that he is now going to be involved in\nOur number one her name was out on the deed which means that she did not have liability as an owner to the person who was hurt number two they were married but they never signed any sort of agreement which said that she would assume his debts so\nIn this particular circumstance her assets as long as they remain in her own name and her name is in on that property are protected from his creditors and his liability obligations and I'm I'm afraid for this gentleman that I'll be representing that\nThis is going to be a large obligation because of the seriousness of the injury that occurred on his property and we're investigating the issue of the home insurance but the reality is that it seems he failed to make his payment\nThe insurance lapse which means that if you don't pay your insurance on time they have the right to suspend coverage and naturally this is when the individual got hurt during that period of suspension\nYou know this is very similar to car insurance if you miss your payment your insurance lapse is the next thing you do is you get in a car accident and now you're being sued for ten Fifteen twenty five thousand dollars it's absolutely crazy\nSo in this case a spouse is not legally responsible for another spouses contractual obligations or somebody else's personal injury [noise]\nThere are exceptions to that which have to do with medical care and treatment for example if your spouse is in the hospital for emergency medical care sometimes you could be held responsible for their co pays and prescriptions\nBut generally the contracts for personal injury and things of that nature of this spouse is not responsible for her husband's issue okay just so we understand that uh when\nWe come back from break we're going to have Peter from Lincoln who has a question about suing attendance ensuing a contractor already

B. R. O. one eight hundred three two one WPRI\nYears we've already went\nBack this is attorney ... host of legal tips Iran WPRI oh so very interesting question and this comes up\nWith the families a lot so in this particular situation this person gave me a call and the father passed away and he had two or three bank accounts with a particular big\nNow he had two children two daughters they go down to the bank and they say he has a death certificate my father passed away you know we need the money we got to pay first funeral and there was maybe I Would estimate about three hundred thousand between the two accounts\nAnd they said that that's while there is to it right you would think that's all the rich do it well that there is a lot more to it than that and unfortunately the bank said\nNo we cannot give you the money or release the money because it was in his name alone and so what does that mean that meant that it became an asset of his and in order for that asset to be transferred\nFrom him or he is a state to them that they needed they said that specifically\nA piece of paper from the county clerk\nSo that's how they came in to see me and they wanted to know what this piece of paper ... so\nWhat happens when you have bank accounts in your name you pass away your ears or your beneficiaries need to file a probate with the ... court and what happens is in this case because he passed without a will that's called ... in cash state probate so there's\nTests state which means you die with will in in ... which means you die without a will\nAnd so they need to be appointed as the executive or or rather administrator of his estate\nWas never appointed as administrator of the state they will be ... piece of paper from the ... Kirk saying you are the administrator of the state in that particular circumstance they can then go back to the bank with that paper the death certificate and get the funds transferred a into an estate account\nSo\nThat go through probate a assets that are you and your name individually at the time of year passing assets\nThat don't go through probate our assets that include for example joint ownership you and your husband joint we own real estate and so at the time if you're passing it was your husband\nJoint ownership or bank accounts with beneficiary designations\nYou say to the bank when I pass away have on death this goes to my two daughters\nAlso life insurance contracts do not go through probate they go by beneficiary designation end retirement accounts also do not go through probate they go by beneficiary designation\nSo a couple of rules of thumb here number one\nAnd if you can't have a we'll done it saves your family so much trouble number to check\nYour beneficiary designations I Will tell you that many people go through life and never checked the beneficiary designations or changed them now I'm going to tell you a little story and give you an example\nGentleman came in to see me now he had a four O. one K. and his wife had a four O. one K. both of them had their retirement accounts before they were married\nThe wives four O. one K. left everything to her mother and father well because before they were married she set up the four o one K now they've been married Fifteen Years they have two kids she\nPassed away suddenly ... awful circumstance her four oh one K. was worth almost four hundred thousand dollars\nHowever the four oh one K. was left to her mother and father\nAnd father do not have a good relationship with son in law\nMother and father gets a four O. one K. money and decide not to give it the son in law so naturally the son in law was in to see me to talk about what his rights are real to this money the mother and father say that they are going to give it to his kids when they feel that they're ready and of course the kids are only six and eight\nAnd who knows if they're if they're holding that money and they pass\nAway then it'll go to their state and most likely they're other children so terrible circumstance and I'm sure this woman did not plant on happening\nSo vitally important check it beneficiary designations make sure things are up to date it just saves everybody a lot of grief and aggravation and in this situation\nUm you know he feels that he's never going to see the money and I'm based on his representations to me I feel that he may be right I I just it's an awful situation\nSo um that has to do with fake accounts now another question that I had received and I'm going to talk to this and we have Jack and Jamestown has got a question about zoning\nSo we'll get into some zoning topics in the minute\nI had another question about a um [noise] somebody came in and saw me and I think I Do I have two more minutes\nUm you've got like one now okay alright what other more somebody came in and saw me and they had to do with um setting up a trust or putting their children's names on their real estate and a a life of states so they had gone and seen another attorney he said oh just do a late to say it's really cheap\nYou put your kids' names on the deed and if you die you're all set your all protected\nWell here's the problem in uh this is the problem that I deal with on a regular basis with folks who do that number one one you put your children's names on your deed to real estate the first issue that comes up is if they have a debt problems\nSo when you sign of listening agreement with the real estate agent ordinarily that listening agreement says that if the curing party in other words the other party who bring somebody to you and you owe them a commission if you accept the offer\nAll right and um one still listing agreement is terminated most listing agreements have a contingency clause that says if somebody they brought to you previously um\nAnd it ends up buying your home then they're still the PR curing corps and you still owe them a commission although I haven't seen this uh enforced\nAs much as probably\nIt would be most of the time when the listing agreement is over your relationship is over and if you read market your house on for sale by owner as ill oh dot com whatever it may be and you ... and you get something then that may be the resolution to your case you know you you sell your house\nHowever doing it alone my only recommendation is that you do have an attorney represent you to make sure the contractors correct to make sure you give adequate disclosures\nAnd also to make sure that the ... the money is held in escrow so in other words what I'm saying is\nYou want the money that you're going to be collecting not to go into your bank account because sometimes buyers feel very skittish about that and if they know that the money will be held by independent escrow agent they feel more comfortable\nOkay and my next question and I believe that this is if I decide to go through um ... uh you know you'll be able to handle an eye on you and maybe NGO that side of it\nAbsolutely Steve that's not a problem and a Steve I'm going to put you on hold for a second okay uh I'm going to finish up Steve I've got Donna from her home if I got

George Donnelly by Dunkin' Donuts\nTakes on Sunday I somehow Mr said would you lose the markets employment gravely zero turn more often twenty five how many months actually advised shot this market I found out about\nThe\nScreening of rent them as you've been hostile in federal credit you next to the integrity from Marvin autos general Cancer Center charter spectrum you in New England foreign dealer has by far the great fire commenting on the fight over Sean hardware\nThe times they asked him to pass protector chip on D Ford so you don't have to worry about ground doing that either you know Twain Allen is a very good blocker but\nAny limits a lot of the weapons or the patriots and really makes it a little bit more of a perimeter game I mean obviously doing Edelman being a slot receiver that he is will will move the chains and go over the middle but when you got drunk house you can just gas you down the seems there\nThat's a real concern for defense so when you take away you know one of the top weapons that that obviously makes it easier for the bears to decide how they're going to defend the\nPatriots you know big part of today was also what was going to be the status of Julian Edelman and now we hear from from chapter that has to go I didn't think that he was not going to play but uh is he a bull help and if he is it all out shouldn't that make us feel better about the situation I Know that I Do\nI mean absolutely I mean you see what the ... has been like\nYou know since he was able to sort of get back in the flow here and how that has opened things out by that you know there's no question about that that he is Tom Brady security blanket he's somebody who can move the chains for them who if they get into a situation where it's a third and long they can go to Adam in and he can get that you know and you also sort of\nI'll keep them out of some of those thirty longs to with with those little four or five six yard completion over the middle on first and second down so you know the beginning of the season so much of the talking so much of what we talked about was\nTom Brady report with his wide receivers and did he trust these wide receivers what we know that he trusts join Edelman implicitly and and I don't mean is a big part of the engine of this off ants those little completion that just keep you out of\nBad situation you know keep you out of thirty eight thirty nine thirty eleven because he picks up six or seven yards earlier in the possession\nSix or seven seven seven night zero Ninety eight five the telephone number ... patriots preview Chris Gaspar is in Chicago on back your inbox for oh patriots are taking on the bears today what do you think about the spot of his game Chris just in terms of where the patriots are at the coming off a big wedding last Sunday or they've got some other big games that are coming up on their schedule\nIs this is this one of those games where it's uh not to be overlooked because the bears have certainly improve this year and made a major edition defensively ... his availability today and how much he plays is a question but just the spot for the patriots plane fares team where do you think the bears around and sort of their their growth\nWell you know there was a bears obviously coming off of disappointing loss to Miami with broadcast while they're in there and an uncharacteristically they're run defense let down there but they've been they've been a really good defense\nThis year and I think this is sort of a proven game and a lot of ways for the Chicago team with matinee do you know people want to see are they for real is Michel ... offensive side for real is this defense for real they've done a great job forcing turnovers this year fourteen turnovers\nThat they force and we all know that they can get after the passer so I I think this is one of those games where the bears are looking at it and saying well if we go out and beat the patriots here you know that sort of establishes us as legitimate\nAs one of the legitimate surprise teams in the NFL you know from from the patriots standpoint you want to keep the momentum rolling but also the last two times you've gone on the road you're going to hand it to you or so as you know so we know that this group of patriots can play well at home but I think they have something to prove\nIt coming on the road playing a team that's in first place in the NFC North that has a very good defense and what should be a hostile environment I think it's an important game for the patriots in terms of the growth of the team you know it's not a great spot I think for really for either team health wise right I mean no ... Mac\nRise banged up so I think you can look at that and and neither team really has that excuse but both teams have something to brew but I think it's more about the bears the bears can make a big statement today if they go out and play a very competitive game against the patriots or beat the Patriot\nYeah I totally agree with that and that's why I sort of ask you that question because it seems to me like the patriots are again a team after winning\nAll these games at home they're sort of okay established as another team in the league that will continue to have the target on their back right because uh when it gets the patriots is always going to be considered a good big win for whoever it is they're playing it for a team like the bears their young they've got a young quarterback they've got a young head coach\nSort of working to establish themselves and their program this feels like one of those spots where the patriots are getting it all they can handle from a team like Chicago today\nAnd without Rob Gronkowski I think that makes it more difficult for the patriots is it a question here here's a question I Do have yeah and and I have thoughts on it and that is who's escape bigger for for the patriots is a bigger further off ants because of the bears defense or is it bigger for their defense given that they gave up forty points a week ago at home\nI think it's bigger for the defense you're you're facing matinee ... who is in Andy Reid disciple\nAnd we've talked about as you look at what happened last week against Kansas City you give up to forty points you gave up forty one and the super bowl to Doug Peterson Andy Reid disciple last year in the season opener agile as you gave a forty two so it would seem that there are elements of that scheme that give you some issues there are elements of offenses that have\nHave speed space and that's something that maybe has with this bears team are going to see you know to recall when and Taylor Gabriel those guys can really run so I think if you're the patriots you sort of have to prove that this is a scheme and this is a a plan of attack that you can do a better job defending against than allowing forty points Everytime you face it\nRight which has been their problem as you mentioned the super bowl as you mentioned last week but I have to be honest with you I don't think much differently about the patriots events after watching last week's game well we're like yeah I don't I don't\nFeel that I expected them to be better my expectations for this defense were\nWere were higher than they work for the last years okay I Would agree with that in my work too but I've sort of a justice of as we've moved along my expectations for the defense of the pre season have sort of been adjusted because\nI think linebacker at times is still very much an issue for them at times it's not\nA times they're they look okay but I I feel like my expectations from two months ago or a little different now and I think you know what I think Chris I think that this team and this doesn't just apply to the defense this team is a lot like last year's team\nThey're very similar they're not all that different and so I look at the defense so yeah you know the events is worse than it was a year ago right you would agree with that\nYeah I Would agree with that deal worse as well but but but that's pretty to me it shouldn't should automatically be better I mean it I thought it would be a better defense\nI did too we seen so I Do too and it's not and I admit that and I agree with you on that but I feel that this team is remarkably similar to what last year's team was and I would say what you believe they can achieve should then be similar to what you thought of last year's team and the fact is\nAnd I think you've written a call about this [laughter] you get to the Superbowl celebrating throws were five hundred yards and you lose the game and if your defenses better you win the game yeah I think if you play that game now if you play that game ten times\nThe patriots all when some of those games so the expectations of the team overall for me or hey getting in the super bowl and and see what happens that's how I sort of feel about it so the biggest rate will it all this to me is the Kansas City chiefs the team that was there a week ago\nAnd they won their side you know the patriots won granted the games at home that's a big factor but\nI don't feel any different than I did a year ago and I don't feel different about this event that I did two weeks ago\nSo here's what I Would say I understand what you're saying in terms of not feeling different about a year ago but a year ago you had\nGuys like markets flowers and Johnson data most e and Jordan Richard trying to play line backer running around you don't have that now so you should be better I mean high towers back in their right\nOr you you you added a guy like a drink labor not that he's going to be defending people in space all the time but it's you don't have cash is marsh we're running around out there you you should be better because you were putting guys out there\nWho really were below replacement level players\nAnd eventually they got exposed which is what ... what happens\nYou know bell checked does a great job of masking the deficiencies of players like that and maximizing their strengths but at a certain point you know it's not about access knows it's about Jimmy's in Joe's and if a guy's just not good enough he's not good enough it's a little different when you look out there and say wait a second why it's ... or ... not good enough to make that tackle\nThat guy should be good enough to get that guy on the ground that's the difference for me from last year\nTo to this year you have guys that should be talented enough that zone China yeah I I don't know if they had the smoothest ride soldier field or\nYou have guys that should be on paper talented enough to make these played and they're not making them\nRight which [laughter] which which means you can't just look at the names and count on the talent that's been there over the years right so OK Deb ... Cody maybe as last this that dot the I's tower I think at times has looked like he's lost more than one step at other times you looked just fine he's looked like the same player so\nYeah I guess you're right they have high tower back and you look at guys like him accordion say why can't they make that point while\nThey're with an eleven million dollar tap even getting older spot you know they've invested in that spot where it should be a strange again going back to the super bowl it wasn't those safety did not player tackle well and the super bowl and I didn't think that they played well last week\nNo they didn't they didn't play last week in fact a Nobel check for Twenty one voice on Devon LaGuardia online and I mean when was the last time you've ever heard that\nUh the last time a guy decided he didn't want to renegotiate his contract when he was asked to do so oh wow so there's more to that story huh that me and said on this I'm just saying interesting I mean okay all your jokes aside had you ever remember that happening period um\nNot off the top of my head no no yeah\nI mean I remember two thousand six I remember him basically ... Gabriel after we fumbled and the jets game they lost in a quagmire Gillette yeah I think they had the lead Gabriel caught a long ball down the sideline and fumble than and turn the momentum of the game and end up losing the man Jeanie and that was pretty much the plate to more snaps before he got released so\nFour hundred and sixty two point three yards of total often so before we were so concerned about this ... and now it's it's definitely founded groove\nSix one seven seven seven nine zero Ninety eight five or do you want to get to a little news item on the patriots salary capitals hang on to that for a couple of minutes we're going to fill in winter I feel\nHey what's going on they feel\nOkay so you ask for about ... schemes bigger for the office of each other yeah absolutely the science and we should not have to report about forty five ...\nA ... and the\nWhat are they going to be prepared to do a lot to help the secondary help helping the secondary yeah ... absolutely like Kyrie ... watched us last week hugged cost us last week\nI all all they got to do is run flip over the middle of the ads will get passed a law and back as ... and ... and the whole free nobody's given the owners any help ... what are they gonna do you know\nSo why would you didn't say the majority of the least of their worries sounds like\nYou know I I mean ... I I mean I wouldn't say she's he's beliefs that no that's not what I'm saying it at all I'm saying it defense or all is\nIs a big worry I'm just say ... ... what are they going to do I mean it it ... I mean it looks that that they're not getting any any any uh they look and they push up fraud I mean yeah you said high tower he looks you know he looks like his old self sometimes\nWell bill you know what believe it or not your calls gonna be the perfect transition to the next part of this pre game show and that is this step on Gilmore has restructured his contract to create cap space for the patriots his cap it\nHas moved out from twelve point five million to eight point eight million the patriots currently have five point a little more than five point three million grits and kept space that was\nCreated by this restructure by step on Gilmore which means they've got the availability and the ability I should say to go out and make a deal before the trade deadline which comes up nine days from now do you think that's what that move was about I think that's\nPart of it I mean you always want to have the flexibility to make a move you know there are a lot of people who had\nA reporter do you know on Twitter um that you know part of this is they have these not likely to be earned incentives that are now likely to be earned that they have to have the cap space to be able to pay out ... and um you know Boston sports journalist who's all over that stuff\nWe did that out so I think that's part of it you want to have some space in case somebody shakes free where you can make a move there but I don't think it was just\nJust about going and getting somebody at the debt I I think it's the patriots being the patriots want to be in a position where if something happens they compounds and they also want to be in a better position to be able to pay out these incentives and not be completely hamstrung against the cap\nSo ... it could mean it could be multiple things is what it could mean\nYeah I mean and what I'm saying is I'm not sure they did this to targeting one base if a player oh sorry Chris yeah I'm saying I I don't think they did this and said okay we're targeting the specific guy we need this amount of cats base for this guy I think it's generally speaking more okay\nIf we have an opportunity here to to improve our team and make a move we want to

is one of the more memorable plays a radius career that one just stands out out of all the all the great things that he's done that play were Brady rabbi or lack run that after the plane went up to him and passing them on the back [laughter]\nThat's the one that if you were you know if you lived through this Tom Brady era and you remember watching that what had happened you you just remember that for every one of those types of plays\nWhat about your balls in New York I'm enjoying this I'm enjoying everything that's going on with the New York giants so all your giants fans listen up your team's screwed up they drafted a running back they didn't draft a quarterback now their guy can't play anymore and you spent Ninety five million bucks on a guy who doesn't really care to be involved in the team\nGo forward going work they're nice franchise you have there I oh I hear the people in New York pitching about the front office there right fishing about all the GM\nWhy do they not go after the owner in New York for the thing I ever go after ownership there I feel like there has to do that in New York ... at some point you got to look at your owner and say have you put the right people in charge to run the football team have you have you done the right things because your team is terrible and has been for a while\nI mean they had the uh the Lebanese five record two seasons ago\nBut other than that you know their regular seasons in the last five six years have been downright awful absolutely terrible and I'll tell you what Chris I'm enjoying every moment of it\nI Love it I Love seeing the giants fail and be as bad as they are right now I Love it I Love that they drafted sake one Barkley I'm enjoying the hell out of it so there's that that's what I wanted to say about the New York giants today\nLet's go to your politics on seven seven seven zero Ninety eight by Dardanelles in Quincy died out\nHey guys how's it going what's up\nOh no I just wanted to call and get

little bit of that with us recalling blows up on the\nI think that he's a he's a dangerous threat Chris do you think tire recalling good appetite that night that you saw a tire retail out of a week ago [noise] I\nI you know I don't think you're going to see it as much down the field like that but I think it could be more like the night that cream hunt had\nYou know Ninety eight receiving yard sort of out of the backfield so\nHe's definitely a weapon to wreak Cohen's definitely a weapon for the bears and that sort of would fit into the theme of when you're going against the patriots that if you have a running back or third down back someone that you can put out in space or that you can foresee linebacker safety to cover down the field\nOr that you can take advantage of that and you can take advantage of the patriots there so I Would think he would be a big part of this game plan\nFor the bears also you know the other thing is he he's run the ball really well this year for the bears as a runner a five point three yards per rush he actually has been more effective running the football than Jordan Howard\nSo you know Jim Murray and I had a bill ... bears blogger on\nYesterday and he was talking about the fact that there's a lot of talk here in Chicago you know sort of what's up with Jordan Howard and is he a fit for this system with Matt navy whereas to Rico and you know is a fit for the system so it's not just in passing game you have to worry about going into running the football too and he and he's a big play a guy in a home run threat\nBlast your games receiving wise or seven catches for a hundred and Twenty one yards at seven catches for Ninety yards victory going so in the receiving game he's been a big factor yeah or the or for the Chicago Bears but as you mentioned ah he has run the ball well\nSo far this season he's averaged over five yards and carry although he hasn't really had that many carries\nHe's at nearly as many catches that carries Twenty one cat just at this point thirty two carries so definitely the ... the guy who could do with both on the back you know but he's got some he's got some speeding catch the football and he's already out

Davis or you're inactive for the patriots a rock rock housekeeping downgraded out he's dealing with a back injury and markets cannon Bob are not able to recover from the concussion that he suffered last week was threatening us way at the end of the week you didn't practice he was lifted it's doubtful\nWhat's your level of ... to do the job and the canon today\nYeah but I think you know you go back to ... game and the patriots did very good job of containing ... Mac with mark is Ken and our rights alcohol remembered all Adrian ... had to take over for Canada for much of the year was\nA water rather than a cat and black against Mac against the Oakland Raiders in that game and Mexico City but the thing about today's game as without walk and of course you have no other ... and Alan you expect principally not to stay in\nAnd block but it's not just ... what he does in concert with the ... and eddy Goldman and the other guys in that front seven for Chicago\nThey make so difficult a lot of theme slot protection toward Mac and as good as each bed\nOr the feeling around here even as expressed by defensive coordinator of banjo is that\nHe's created opportunities for a game of Hicks and that's why they play next to one another on the line almost exclusively on one side of the Chicago defensive lots of the patch I got in the past to contain Mac pretty well even last year with water rather than can and but I think the group as a whole is a lot different than what they saw when math was a member of the writers\nBobby and if I see when I look at the bears side of things with these inactive that looks like they're guys they really needed to go are going to be able to go here Brian Callahan is a goal for them Alan Robinson a goal for them and you're obviously mentioned we'll Mac\nWhat does that do for the patriots some of the ... people are bears reporters I've spoken to it's that bright Callahan arguably been their best corner this years this last guy yeah Chris I think this\nTeam for Chicago last week not withstanding has been very impressive and a lot of different ways and the development of ... the last couple of weeks now granted the quality of the competition that he's been in a year's lackluster when you consider Arizona and Tampa Bay but this is a team that is only a handful of points away from being on ... and at this point\nAnd you look at the player the secondary they've got ten interceptions a lot of it's created a because they don't have to send extra pass Russia's they've gone to the quarterbacks Eighteen times this year thirty three quarterback kids\nBut they're not sending typically five six guys so\nThey've been able to match up so well and again that a lot of that goes back to the fact that you have a guy like Matt whos so good from the edge in someone like Hicks who's done such a great job for them more than a loving sex the last two years combine ... getting pressure on the quarterback and they've covered with more than they've been able to take the ball away a lot\nWith Bob Sosa ... broadcast booth in Chicago up Bob when you look at this game and and you look at the game of patriots played a week ago against a um an Andy Reid disciple excuse me this week against an anti read the cycle last week\nAnd then you read and what do you think we see from the patriots defense today\nBecause I I uh America we see a lot more of what we witnessed last week in the first half against Kansas City because I thought that defense all things considered a especially based on the expectations going into that game and the production of Kansas city's often and the defense did exactly what it had to do the first thirty minutes of that game\nThey got a couple of turnovers they got stopped in the red zone and they gave their often an opportunity to ... but obviously there was a let down in the second half and that's been the case the last couple of weeks they've allowed fifty two points in the second half more than five hundred yards against the Colts\nAs well as the Kansas City chiefs are not just the second half of Kansas City but I think even the previous week despite a big lead that was disappointing uh in their performance and the thing about Chicago too as they may not have a ... hill but they do the same type of things that Andy Reid does with Matt nagging remember he took over ... late last season as the caller\nFor the change they have a lot of different types of skilled players who really force you to defend just about everything and they have a lot of formations maybe not a lot of complex place per se but how they get to them\nCan be very confusing for defenses and we know the papers of health problems whether it was Andy Reid Doug Peterson or Matt nagging or as a head coach raw sense of coordinator going up against that type of ... the last few years\nBob Baer's run defense for the most part has been very good this year for thing that we you know eighty three yards pregame but Miami was really able to run the football against them Frank or went over a hundred yards one one I Can't even drink or added fifty seven at a hundred and sixty one yards rushing\nI bring that up because we seen each week that Sony Michel has gotten better and better and better and more decisive with the decision and his cuts for the patriots is this the Sony Michel game or do you think the patriots just try and\nThrow it all around the yard yeah Chris I think it's a good point about Chicago's rushing defense because they're having a lot of rushing touched down this year they've allowed only a handful of rushing first downs and you go back to the absence of Gronkowski as good as James devil and has been as a full back to lead the way and a lot of those inside runs for Sony Michel\nO'clock with a wound block and now not having the combination of the two titans therefore him how does that affect the way they used doubling today\nI Do they have to offset him and he was more as an H back then they they might otherwise\nUh you know those some of the things that I'm Wondering about going into this game I think it's going to be tough to run on Chicago or the way they've been able to run almost the well the last couple of weeks they I think having a good all fence of line and I think Sony has really progress but Chicago has been solid today and I always take into account the conditions in Miami\nWe've seen patriot teams go down there and not play well in a very hot day last week game time type of eighty nine and heat index much higher than that\nThen the the bears had a Twenty one to Thirteen lead early in the fourth quarter and they turn the ball over was it really careless play the game Miami the chance to come back and eventually get even before the bears regained will eat I'll be a briefly\nAnd so they weren't control that game despite the statistics really in the fourth quarter and then let it get away from them\nBridget Bob looking forward to your call the games that I I look forward to guys thanks\nThe Peterson
