I'm\nA short so I was I was actually at home at the time um and got a text message from a friend of mine just saying have you seen the events in Bergen I really hadn't been looking at a news so I didn't know what you were talking about immediately what my computer and\nYou know your heart just think um you you sort of\nIt it's just one of those moments where the range of emotions all flashes or are you all at one time but over arching it's just that profound sadness how could something like this happen\nA in a place of worship where people are coming together to to celebrate community celebrate east to celebrate the day of rest and and it was um it was just heartbreaking\nAnd so ... you were home Adam and rabbi Sarah Mac is also on the line um where were you Sarah\nSo I had just finished a tour steady at my congregation that and I sat down at my at a daycare of his faith and on my cell phone started a ... a ... with the news coming in from\nA from local community partners and enter a a friend and colleague sending their love and I'm just really heartfelt condolences and and wishes\nAnd I know you think about your own community and you're and and and your local houses of worship and whether they're safe\nOr how how does that play out Adam\nUh so that was you know sort of him after the shocking to sadness immediately turned to how do we make sure that\nCommunity it's safe and then all of our congregations I mean we had services going on throughout the community\nOr as this news was unfolding and I I have to commend um you know law enforcement across the community they were proactive and we've been working with them for years um unfortunately working with them for years on on you know these kinds of plans\nUm and they reached out socks and very quickly if they were working with our staff\nTo um make sure that there was an increase presidents throughout the community that there was an increased presidents that uh all of the synagogues or and and Jewish institutions across um across Rhode Island\nAnd we're I I Want to just say on behalf of the community just incredibly grateful I'm for their support and and um\nFor the for the hard work that they've done really um you know before Saturday but since Saturday helping us to just make sure the folks in the community feel safe because I think it's natural that\nAt a time like that um we all know Jews and non Jews question our safety or going into places of worship\nI think a lot of people are thinking the same thing I one of my relatives I popped it on Saturday and they were watching the news developments and she said she's afraid to go to church and you know why can't we have a you know what it was a police officer in in the back of the church and I think everyone is\nIs feeling the same way but just the horror of this\nHe crime just adds even more devastation to the story rabbi Sarah Mac you are I'm the president of the board of rabbis of greater Rhode Island how many places of worship in the Jewish community here just say in Rhode Island roughly\nOh um well you know there are several congregations both large and small in the city\nOf Providence a and then there are some smaller outlined communities and on its Greenwich Barrington um Narragansett Middletown I'm Around the state as well\n[noise] uh\nWords the police presence I don't I Know certainly I've been in temple Beth fell in Providence a ... I Know police presence was there more more so obviously the news will not usually is so um it was far as we can see 'em was ... obviously more presence in Providence how about the other spots around the state absolutely\nAnd so you know I Will I Will agree with Adam you know the public safety response has just been incredibly supportive and I and the alliance has been wonderful working as a liaison with the Jewish communities around the state I and I know that\nUm that certainly law enforcement has been in touch with many of the communities I'm Around the state as well and and certainly it's an ongoing conversation and sadly not a new conversation about a safety and security and and whether or not we need a police presence every time\nI had that agreement and rabbi Sarah Mac on the line I'm Jewish alliance with greater Rhode Island and have a board of rabbis have greater Rhode Island are the organizations that you represent but um you know it's it's only Monday right so it's it's still hard to wrap your head around what actually happened\nThere are vigils across the country for the people that were killed in the Pittsburgh synagogue\nYou want to have your own event here so that people can get together and and I guess just pulled together it's it's really hard to say OK moving forward because no one really moves\nForward after something like this but on a Monday people's families have to get their kids up and you have to go to work and you have to go to school and and things like that in in life does you know ... ... it does go ahead of you sometimes what um what are you telling 'em\nYou know when when you are with\nYour peers or those who are you are worshipping together what what are you saying to each other\nSo you're absolutely right you know there are layers of Congress and hear the first is the logistical the safety\nAnd security and then of course there is a much deeper layers of grief of morning of um disbelief of how this could happen anywhere um a lot a you know of the reality that you know all of Israel is that I'm responsible for one another when Pittsburgh\nSuffered we feel it in our heart you know there are many a folk than our own Jewish community who have their friends and family and Pittsburgh um there are just many layers of you know how we're\nWe're dealing with it as as a community and I think there's a great deal of comfort in being together on and not raising our voices and prayer for peace um for hope for the world we hope to build 'em and uh and that will you know that will take us through the weekend the conversation will continue to unfold\nAnd I I I Would just add that I think out of tragedy has community it's been just so um you know if it's warm to heart to you know see the outpouring of support not just from the Jewish community locally and the Jewish community nationally but\nFrom all of the different faith communities from\nUh from all of our elected officials I mean there and I have\nBeen fielding phone calls for the last forty eight hours from people just saying you know we're so sorry how can we help\nUm how can we make sure that we can bring this community together and um and it's one of those things that\nYou know this is so tragic and we mourn the loss um but there's also this this feeling of hope and that will ensure make itself seem more in the in the days and weeks to come\nUm because it does bring the community together it does sort of make us reexamine um the power of community and the power of you know working as one toward a better future\nSo there is um I'm an interface I guess you would you could describe it um\nVigil an action this vigil ... this afternoon really into into this evening and I want to just to put a Adam and Sarah on hold if we can and if we can take the break right here and then we can go back and give people details there in their cars are getting ready you know walking around the house and they might want to go to this prayer services digital\nThis evening so I Want to tell people where it is and how they can get involved\nFor three eight nine seven seven six four three eight WPRI come right back with the details in just four minutes\n[noise] coming up after\nStarting a new mom used to be nicer than I Am somebody we ought\nTo know what I'm going to be somewhat of a money I'm six or W.
