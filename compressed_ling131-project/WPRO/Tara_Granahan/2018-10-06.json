virtue of the research you've done the challenge is in discriminating all that information and filtering in editing it\nYou know I had a patient once shedding was purchasing supplements from a national company so that our national companies some of them make high quality supplements many of them do here's the problem\nWhen you use the the provider of supplement as your exclusive source of information there motive in some degree is to sell supplement\nAnd that can be difficult because there's not a relationship that is exclusive above the supplements selling dynamic\nSo my patient calls was company up because they said you know it was on some of these cells in stock I wanted to see what I could get off of\nI said how to go he said I hung up the phone and I bought my free more supplements and now the ... oftentimes doctors Susan I Will start at a relationship with a patient by asking them to bring in all their supplements put them in a bag bring them to us we go through bottle by bottle\nEverybody has a limited capacity of what they can swallow\nAnd what they can pay for and you want to have supplements individualized to suit your greatest need you know you read the tagline on the male some great I'll take that I'll take that that's good for all the ... that's good for the heart that's good for the brain holy cow All right I mean I take a fair chunk of supplements\nBut I like to believe that they are thoughtfully applied now do something you know I we take exception\nTo the vast broad deep well of ignorance that exist in many orthodox providers of health care when\nIt comes to nutrition health and supplements their fallback is it's all fraudulent it's all a waste of your money it's expensive urine supplements have no merit vitamins have no merit nonsense the research supports its merit and value\nYou want to be thoughtfully applied so let's look at some of the research we talked about bipolar and co Q. ten and its than its merit if you're on a Staten drug people\nYou should be on to Q. ten why because the Staten drug blocks production of the most important inside and that support your mitochondria supports your cellular health\nOne of the series of aging is that it is a degradation of ... that is your energy packs within your cells stayed away as you get older we'll co Q. ten supports those energy packs and if you're

five percent success rate we have white papers to prove that our patients will validate that it is the there is nothing more comprehensive are effective that we have seen nationwide that a fair statement sham\nOkay so yeah we we study what's out there there are other great doctors many here in Rhode Island\nDedicated to this pursuit of treating obesity like the disease state that it is um intellectual medicine certainly is one of those outlets but it's not the only one we advocate for you to do your research look for doctors in health care providers that manifested a specific interest in this field\nI have a preference for doctors are doing primary care and we've this into it\nWe have concern about any program that is exclusive weight loss product related that has come to our program take this protein shake and lose weight those programs concern us because they are not durable\nI'm looking at we had to talk with ... minutes left the connection between big pharma and the way they steal supplements so here's a story we're following there was an oral supplement called el ... mean ...\nIs a a natural substance it's been used by many patients and their supplement regimen\nA drug company a mess is a drug company the drug they have created is called and ... and ...\nIt's on the process of being approved as a new drug and diary folks is no good I mean they took out ... economy found supplement widely available and read it through the FDA patenting process to producer drugs has reached sickle cell disease no follow the linear progression\nThe drug company develops a supplement into a prescription drug gets impacted by the FDA the cost of this drug to the patient is going to be about forty thousand dollars per year\nFor the ... you can buy two hundred a year maybe maybe if you look for the most expensive all good I mean you could reach for maybe it's two hundred year forty thousand a year and the next step in the process the drug company using the FDA to shut down\nThe subtle and producers because we're encroaching on their patent\nThis is a reinforcing cycle it is one of the things that occur roads information and health care because there's so much money at play so many dollars that play it's hard to know where to get good information\nSo we advocate for the thoughtful use of supplements we advocate for you to pursue anti aging we advocate for you to stay young we advocate for you to be on your home on replacements at the right time you have one of two choices replace your hormones or suffer the consequences\nWe advocate for you to test your heavy metal led equals brain damage that article I referenced in the journal bullet and Shannon highlighted the tragedy of young poor people that are stuck in bad housing with lead dust and the permanent brain damage it does well guess what people it damages the brains of adults as well\nAnd unless you know your total body store of lead you can't have a full appreciation of the risk so get the lead tested we do it all the time intellectual medicine in East Bay and in Warwick\nYou've got to address free radicals that is neutralizing free radicals 'cause they accelerate the

that are feeding the healthcare machine\nYou will not find preventative health care at hospitals you will not find it in advance tertiary care centers across the country they simply don't have the time to address at the knowledge to address it during the financial incentive to develop it\nThe next time you see a hospital really really doing preventative care will be the first their definition of preventative care is to cast the net to capture disease that they can treat and turn into profit Centers for the hospital hey folks you know I don't begrudge them their beds to fill right\nBut you don't have to be one of the people filling their bed [laughter] so are we advocate social and quick study aspirin and liver cancer they did an extensive study a hundred and thirty thousand patients over Twenty years of treatment they found that low dose aspirin twice a week at a reduction in liver cancer\nAnd they had us or another study over two hundred thousand nurses reevaluated a twenty three percent reduction in ovarian cancer when taking low dose aspirin they don't know why and that benefit did not extend to other announced a rental drugs like Advil et cetera\nIn people over sixty five aspirin has not been found to have a mortality benefit it's quite possible that because cancer takes in some cases decades to evolve that you need decades to be on the agent to gain benefit doesn't mean to\nRun out and start aspirin but it's a far\nHow far we like you to think we like you to think for yourself we like to be part of that conversation we invite you hear every Saturday

Murkowski the Alaskan Republican though says she opposes Kavanaugh tend\nNot to say that he is the right person for the court this time on this thing all the little\n... like ... it is hard choice this call of any that I Can't remember\nNo but like they have to do it one bedroom they have to take the whole floor up okay\nAnd I don't know about the second bedroom but the one the main bedroom oh I have my bedroom set mhm I Can't even go in my bed I had a ... on the couch that bat that's yeah it it's going down hill towards the end of the ...\nWow and uh yeah it's very bad and I don't know how that could have happened mhm well I just don't life cycle of well\nTermites in southern New England um the termites or active from ... the end of April all the way through November if if the weather stays warm if not then maybe some mid November and indirect can be and then they go dormant and then they come back to feed at the same area again the next year\nYeah they have um colonies in the soil we only have one ... and so we are kind of lucky or other areas of the countries have three or four or more different types of termites but we have just the eastern subterranean throughout my\nSubterranean means below ground so it comes out of the ground to feed on the wood in our house they'll build mud tunnels or\nUm use the cracks in between the foundations to get up into the woods and if you've got that much damage they've been there for years in southern are we going to get a lot of damage like that they have to be there for years yeah\nAnd it just may not not not notice a lot of times these people see this swarm of what they think is a little flying ants every spring or may flies and during that those are usually the termites warmers easy or sometime next one to the outside or in your case\nAcross race they might just warmed downstairs ...\nYeah that growth has ... has no found out notes that meant\nNo ... yeah and that's a perfect area for journalists to come in from\nYeah I had that treated about maybe ten years ago on loan them from the outside but I don't think anybody is it just it didn't do what he did across\nYeah yeah they should have done the cross me too\nAnd now it it's really bad so you would think I should call you guys have a ... now because I have a ... I hopefully not we place in a beam soon ... in order to get my furniture out of that room he said he has to put in one\nSupport being in December of ... a while for a flaw or else you know you cannot walk on it it wouldn't make throat\nWhile you have a lot of damage that that's a shame it is you can at least give our office a call and we can set you up with a free inspection um and and again we can't do the treatment before everything's all done\nAnd wouldn't know how the guys if you have to go down there to work\nWell if they're going to be digging in the soil yes\nBut if they're not going to be I mean and and the with the one thing you can do it in because they're going to be digging in movie stuff around or even in that soil maybe you do want to wait until everything is all through yeah no and then they just finished and then we could come in and then make sure all your new stuff is protected\nYeah he said he would use pressure treated being drug which the other ones were in ... so that one will get made it and that's the bedroom he will have to take the whole flock to apply what a hot what\nAnd it would have to put a whole new life and then I asked for a lemonade and ... and the other bedroom he said he would it only takes maybe ten beams yup they would do it from the bottom up I don't know how they're gonna do it because there's only about three and a half feet\nYeah Hi there it's going to be tough but but that's when we got a low cross race like that that three and a half feet it's very easy for termites again two plus the soil I'm always has some moisture to Italy dance yeah right so so that that that gets into the woods the old water in it and it it makes it more conducive the termites makes it easier for them to feed on\nThat because I asked him if he sees any you know anything moving down flying if there's any activation down there and you know it's nothing you\nKnow the anything but then you know I'm Still you know I have nothing but sleepless nights\nAnd I yeah I can imagine but but yeah you definitely should get treated right after everything's all complete\nAll I Do that All right thank you guys I don't know what I have to wait to to put somebody they come you can't imagine\nThat we we come very quickly we have to do the service then we have to call dig safe because they have to feed the inside in the outside I'm In order to have not allergic\nWeeded I'm\nI'm a I got to look it up with it maybe ten years ago\nYeah ended up reading what it was treated with the may need to be retreated to mentor them next yup yup yup that's a possibility but if this trend might damage there you may need to retreat the outside to in order to get a warrant gee\nYeah well they can come out and take a look at that for you and they'll give you a free estimate\nAnd they would go downstairs Oh yes downstairs to the cross race well they've got to do that\n... or ... you know when I was younger I Would go my husband and I could go down there we we we we bought that housing pipe\nWhen even insulated well we had to do that job to do all that that's how they used to build a house that's it back then ...\nYou know and we went down there but now I'm I I probably could you make it I could make it down\nOr up [laughter] I Know the feeling [laughter] so\nUm and you'd think or I should not call you guys now to spray down\nThat well no we were which you can do is have at least you could call us now so you know what has to be done and how much it's going to cost so you can plan on everything\nI went through this Monday you know and then they'll come out and they'll do a ... value ration\nYeah because I like to know because I asked the guy if there's any activity down there he says no but then you would never know and\nRight executives they could be in the ground if it's cool down there they might even be starting to go dormant\nYeah yeah that stand down there of course it's cool now right it's cooled down there and because I had a problem in one of my store room and lead to something that was eating my wall paper from the floor up\nMhm yeah that could be termites two years ago they won't pay paper is is a byproduct of water and they feed on that too so we we can look at that whole thing to do a whole\n... at that storm was sitting on top of cement if you're out of the garage\nRight but but but where it said there's a there's a a joining a crack where they pour that foundation after the walls that they did a joint right around me and and that's where they come up from sometimes they'll let us at least take a look at it anyway\nI don't see anything swarming or anything you know doing that I first saw it turned out that were there might they are I Know somebody to these are flying\nAnd you

Scott thanks for calling fire away with your question\nSo I worked at a company for Twenty years at a a a four one K. still was a it it's through fidelity and it's about four hundred thousand dollars and a lot of that is tied up in that your your property stock\nI Would like to bring that from Fidel on my current uh but somebody mentioned something about that might be a comedy because it's in stock and movie that I don't quite understand that\nScott there should not be a penalty but you probably won't be able to transfer the stock from your old employer to your new employer\nSo I don't want to have this years I'd like to sell off okay\nPretty good price right now so I Would like to take the lump sum up but I'm not sure so first of all there's no penalty then what would you suggest I go to what that four hundred thousand\nSo let's talk location first you can sell the stock take that four hundred grand from the old plan then move it to the new four one K. or you could move that money into something called a roll over IRA with both of those you know we're just dealing with account type\nNow regarding asset allocation\nAnd that's just the investments that you're going to buy with the money right stocks bonds cash\nWithin the roll over IRA you open this on an open platform Schwab and you know theoretically the sky's the limit thousands of stocks bonds mutual funds ... all at your disposal but if you move the money into your new for all and K plan\nYou'll likely see a much more limited selection of funds or institutional holdings\nThe thing is some plans give you access to a lot\nBut others you only see a handful of investment options\nGreat thank you so much alright man have a good weekend you till\nWhen you think about it you know folks who change jobs pretty often it's so easy to lose track of old for one caves and I'm guessing that there is a pretty good number of Americans that have for one case that are not being attended\nOh absolutely it's a common situation and it could end up being a huge issue for investors down the road if you can relate if you could use some help simplifying consolidating investing your savings get over to investing sense dot com start talking with our local team\nSo let's go back to Scott's situation and talk about holding a large position in the stock of the company that you worked for within a four one K. to scare us through those considerations\nWhen my clients hold large positions in their employer stock\nIt's usually a pretty emotional situation yes it's normal yes it's a human reaction but I see this attachment to the stock like they do not see with any other holding\nThese emotions can sometimes make it kind of difficult to objectively analyzed the risk and the risk has to do with holding a highly concentrated position in one lone stock or even more and written really importantly you've got to take into account where you are in life\nDo you really want to risk most of your retirement obsess on the performance an outcome the success or failure of one lone investment there's a just a huge risk here in these situations\nWell and I can hear some people asking well wait a second the risk and holding a concentrated position in stock and go both ways there's the potential for a high reward or return but they just like you mentioned there's also the potential for big big risk\nOh yeah and you know here's two examples let's say you work for Apple you hold a large position in a ... out in your four one K. it's done great over the last few years and you've been rewarded for taking that risk but\nNow considered to former American blue chip stocks that General Electric and Sears won a famous industrial giants or the other one of the most iconic retail brands in this country if you worked at either of these companies and\nOh you own was a concentrated position in that company stock the risk is that you would not have been able to retire because of all you own was GE or S H O D you probably would have lost a ton of money in your four one K.\nAnd by the way the broader stock market has been in a bull market for more than nine years and that means an index fund would have been a much better place than either of these two stocks over that same period of time\nOr lighting your money on fire would have been a much better for you know kind of outcome you know worst case scenario is that your stock goes to zero\nAnd even though this doesn't happen very often it can happen I mean remember names like leeman ah WorldCom Enron these companies had employees who held lots of company stock and for one case they loved it when the stock went up but what do you think happened\nWhen it didn't yeah it just went down to zero\nZero okay and the only defense against this company specific risk is diversification and we build this into all of our clients personalized plan if you could use some help get some help get over to investing sense dot com and and start talking with our local team\nWell that brings us to this week's portfolio review and a quick reminder please consult with an advisor before acting on anything that we discuss and you can find a local advisor in your area by\nGoing to investing cents dot com now in future shows if you would like to have Andy review your portfolio here during the show\nAsk Andy at investing sense dot com is the email right portfolio review in the subject line but it's pretty easy ask any at investing sense dot com\nSo Jackie set us for portfolio last week and she writes I have a question regarding bond funds and CDs\nWhich is better at this point bond funds seemed destined to lose value in a rising interest rate environment individual bonds pay the stated interest rate is held to a majority but Kerry default risk CDs pay the stated rate is held the majority and our FDIC insured\nSo this is where the conversation started with Jackie but I wanted to dig a little bit deeper so I ask more about the overall situation because look planning an income stream and retirement is difficult enough to begin with but now you've got rates where they are where they could be later on\nThe market in the environment or going to get even more difficult and Bob you have you have Jackie's reply\nI Do she wrote back I'm retired sixty seven have a pension and drawing Social Security my spouse is also retired and draws Social Security combined we have about a hundred thousand dollars in annual income from those sources and saving a portion so we don't eat into our savings\nYeah right there okay it's a key point that I Want to you know real kind of you know they focus on here they are still saving a portion of their retirement income stream\nNow I'm going to circle back to that in the second Jackie may not have realized it but she revealed to me of a little bit of risk aversion by mentioning these CDs\nSo in our email conversation I suggested some alternatives and realize you know we use any or all of the following types of bonds in clients' portfolios a you've got\nRight does a rate hike now and do continued rate hikes through the rest of the year what are the politics of that especially here in a in a midterm election cycle if I think\nWhatever politics are are done uh there's not going to be I think there's not another meeting until after the terms okay ... maybe just a day or two before but uh I think the fed has made it clear that they're only going to rate hikes at alternating meeting okay um [noise]\nEven if they surprised by doing a rate hike just before the terms a\n... and then even if that rate hike was a mistake that slow the economy right there's no way that we have the ... effect on anybody or anything for months and so the idea that that would make anybody\nYou know less satisfied with Republican leadership um you know it was the vote or you know that kind of narrative there are many different narrative or if it's just absurd is is just that whatever affect the fed was going to have it\nIt's going to have it sort of a habit so if it gets up the election it already has well\nLet's talk about in terms I mean you have you've gone out there and said that you know midterms are basically a referendum on whether America is glad I got what I Want to talk about that talk about how you are looking at the at the midterms right now and what you're tracking versus maybe what we see you know in in in other in other outlets\nUm typically in the terms and you can go back many many many many years and look at the historical record others it's quite clear it seems that with the economy is strong or weak whether the president was popular or unpopular what tends to happen is whatever party\nDoes not control the White House makes big games in the house and Senate okay and that appears to be a pattern that is just part of the American soul and or maybe it's part of the human soul except the American system a little unique but the so we see it here but for most people politics\nIs like the Olympics were were you get interested in sports once every four years right or at least you get interested in things like gymnastics once every four years [laughter] so the uh\nThe people who will get interested in it just two years later yeah or the people who are really angry about the way it turned out two years ago okay and this time around that Democrats for years ago it was a Republican\nYou know one of the things that that were asked a lot about is what we're kind of seeing what we are tracking um especially on the trade side you know as the as the U.S China story kind of continues to move forward or in some\nRespects metastasize as we see the additional terrorists um you know they they've taken effect after their announcement\nAfter promises of you know the Chinese retaliation and you and I talked about this in the past in terms of then kind of coming out and saying you know we're not going to devalue\nWhat happened right after the recent move or the the recent announcement on the tariffs I especially as it relates to us equities in Chinese equities ... you know you were tracking that but what happened after this announcement\nOr a question because what's been happening all during this trade war which really started march is us stocks of basically crawled straight straight up and Chinese toxic crawled straight straight down there the downright Berra market and their currencies\nDone the same thing so if you're a non Chinese investor who had to buy the Chinese currency to buy Chinese stocks you got hit both ways on the stocks and the currency like two or thirty five percent this year [noise] so what happened after\nSort of the worst of all there for that sort of came out a week ago if the u._s. stock market went up the Chinese stock market went up twice as much so that wasn't supposed\nTo have [laughter] yeah\nI'm One of the things that was driving the sink or early conclusion was the financial\nIf you're being put other Chinese by their stock market by their currency market by their bond market and all of which are in great distress and we're sending a useful signal to the Chinese that as painful as it is going to be for you to capitulate the Trump is going to be even more painful to either of your economy imploded have\nWhat would really be the first ever recession in

to be you know the Democrats would cry foul and said it was a whitewash and you know ... whatever uh but if you listen to Susan Collins testimony yesterday\nA it was it was incredibly informed in incredibly reason and she's not a lawyer by the way but it it was very loyal lawyer lead you know she went through decisions and in case law going all the way back to the Nineteen twenties\nOr and just basically took apart every argument that they've come up with to to stop Brett Kavanaugh I mean every single one of them and as far as the the doctor for stuff she said you know look none of it's corroborated none of it\nNot even one thing is corroborated so how are we supposed to take that\nAs prime aphasia evidence to throw throw up this guy and she says it's not a court of law\nYou know it's not beyond a reasonable doubt it's they use the grand jury standard which is\nA region is it I'm more likely than not that the offense to place if you've ever sat on a grand jury that's what the charges to grand jurors they give you this charge and they say basically is you're more likely than not that a crime was committed in this instance in ended it more likely than not\nThat the individual committed the crime and if that's the case then you you send a troop buildup it's nice to know true bill and you get an indictment\nAnd that's where the whole thing you can indict a ham sandwich and an Susan ... look ... and use it more likely than not in there just wasn't the evidence to indicate to her that it was more likely than not and then she went through it piece by piece and she even left out some stuff that's come up recently\nUm you know there was this part of a doctor Kevin a doctor forge testimony was that she became so upset about the um you know suppressed memories of this incident that she had a second front door installed in her house because she needed to have another way out\nUh and then it came out later on that no she was going to rent out half her house and needed a separate entrance for tennis to get in and that's why they put in the second door there was a very detailed story she told about saying Hi to uh this guy judge or at the Safeway and she in very you know gave tremendous detail them a story about walking in\nA separate entrance because she was embarrassed to be with their mom and when she walked in the second entrance of Safeway she discovered there was Mr judge and she said hello to him well first of all if the guy had attacked you why would you say a load of 'em but secondly\nSake we only had one door in Nineteen eighty two it didn't have two doors so there's no way that she could have walked in the second door 'cause there was no second or a an innocent in constant even touch on any of that stuff uh but uh more and more then there's a whole lie detector thing\nIf you notice the prosecutor that they hired a asked her specifically have you ever coached anyone on how to take a lie detector tests which I thought it was kind of a non secular it was kind of an off the wall question\nBut ah she answered no nope nope never did that no absolutely not and then come to find out her ex boyfriend under oath you know penalty perjury all that good stuff um signed a statement as low yeah when she was a psychology professor she used to coach people and how to take lie detector tests\nSo you know they they were just a number of holes in that story that just never got that shooting constant even touch them but she didn't have to her testimony was so powerful and so riveting or in so well reasoned and thought through 'em dead boy I'll tell you if if she's if that's the way she approaches every issue in the Senate\nOr than Maine is well served with Susan Collins and I and I don't necessarily agree with her a lot politically because I tend to be more conservative as Susan Collins but\nYou know she she takes the time she had all the reduction of rose yet every possible back I you know if if we had a Senate that was that was like a real deliberative body instead of a partisans will house which is what has become then Democrats would decide you know what after listening to Susan Collins I'm going to go ahead and vote to confirm\nOr because that was it was that well thought out well reason a and factually based\nUm and so you know naturally Hollywood is all up in arms in in a calling Susan Collins every name in the book and they run ads against or in in Maine and all kinds of stuff and and that's unfortunate because you know I think that she did a lot she went a long way to restoring\nThe uh the value of the Senate\nIn this process and the advice and consent role anyway we can talk about that we got to talk about the earth shattering announcement from the ... campaign\nA that was heavily embargo wouldn't leak it at all ah and then the announcement came out that it was Patricia Morgan the former ... house majority leader or minority leader er and former candidate for governor that was going to endorse Joe ...\nUh and then he tried it out is it and I got a John rubber tire who lives in South Carolina a and I can block\nNow you know a lot of this doesn't pass the Colombo test [laughter] I mean first of all this is a general election right so if you're running to run in a general election as an independent then ... you need Republicans and Democrats to vote for you you can't get just get Republican votes because you know there's not enough of them\nSo why would you brought out Patricia Morgan because you know no matter what I can probably name a hundred Democrats in a hundred independents who don't like Patricia Morgan who maybe could have taken jokes are low but for other reasons don't like Patricia Morgan in the same is true for can block and the same is true to maybe to a lesser extent for John Roberts high\nSo you know if he was really trying to be governor which I suspect he's not like I really do I suspect this is not about George Tiller becoming governor then you would try it out Democrats\nYou know show me endorsement from Patrick Kennedy show me an endorsement from Sheldon Whitehouse drumming endorsement from earth York um show me an endorsement from any elected Democrats any elected Democrats not one\nSo why would you do that unless you're you're a sole mission in life is to destroy Allen phone suppresses vote total ensure the genome under wins they that's the only reason that would make sense to me\nAnd and I've said this before and you know certainly said again and You're welcome to comment on it uh this is a math problem this is this is literally a math problem and when we come back from the uh the important commercial announcements that we're about to embark upon I Will explain what I mean you're listening to John
