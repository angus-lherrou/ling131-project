I was I was looking at the debate on my phone streaming it and I remember sitting there saying whoa\nUh that I don't want more convincing do you need\nTo have the office of inspector general I Would vote for someone on that a couple of other things too on that\nI thought it was a given I thought it was one of those things that\nYou know they're going down the road with candidates and I thought they would all say certainly yeah we need to have a an independent set of eyes and we need to get to the bottom of certain things that you can't get out of your own way up at the state house say for example maybe it's the grant program really need that the legislative grant program or maybe it's you know\nTo to bloated you know positioning within our state department's maybe we have repetitive positions people getting paid to do the same job over and over again for years the hideout jobs up at the state house and then the different departments on Capitol Hill maybe we need to just you know with all the old general fund\nPaperwork and dig into that and have in order to that I don't know what Gina Raimondo is thinking saying I don't know if it's necessary\nIt is incredibly necessary and free up these committees that really go nowhere and again no offense to the legislative\nFolks that are up there trying to get answers you get the answers and then we go back to work on Monday Night and then we go back to you have and stand in line again going back to the registry and we stand in line again it never ends\nFor three eight nine seven seven sex for three eight WPRI losing Lincoln calling and talking to ...\nI I agree with you I don't know how ... can I absolutely say she's not sure if we need an inspector general with all the fraud and waste in this state\nAnd all the politicians that have been brought up on charges for criminal activity within the state and the fact we have a a [noise]\nAttorney general in the state that's pretty biased I really believe we need an inspector general and I think that is a definitive moment in time\nThe governor's race I thought it was too and they got it got glossed over and when I realized it and I said well you know go back and listen to that again because I remember gasping I thought it was a given I thought even if she didn't want one she would just say you know we're looking at that too but to say I'm not convinced we need it well I think\nI think part of it is you know she said she was going to open the doors on the investigation for thirty eight studios\nAnd be very transparent with it and she wasn't and I think the fact that if we had an inspector general the the citizens and tax days of the state would would have got what they deserve\nA full investigation that was unbiased and protect the taxpayers money but we're right back in it with you know you hit McDonald being involved with that you hip and then also her being involved with\nA D.C while you have um I just want to say one other thing\nMcDonald is a you're talking about Jamy Ian MacDonald who was running a D.C Wyeth and then she left her she's a consultant now for ... and the lord of the company that gave us all ...\nStates playing they have these people that work for the state and then they become a consultant you know she gets gets them jobs that's consultant\nI don't know who got the job but I I Do know that that's how that that ended up ... thank you very much I appreciate it the office of inspector general yes we need it yes we need it yes we need it I'm not so sure\nI'm not convinced that's how it went at the debate Monday Night we'll let you hear it again and then also representative Atlanta has called and ah regarding the office of inspector general give him a few minutes as well for three eight nine seven seven six\nDollars going up\nNinety nine seven of them and I am six or W.

get\nHe felt he wants you know\nUh to uh be in a way he'd be a disagrees with you with regard to what she said that she is now open to it and I agree I agree that uh\nHe is just a hypocrite and he's in a way of why does it get out of the way it's been around long give us a break\nAll right Maureen thank you oh we're going to revisit the conversation that I had with Joe because it's getting a a ton of feedback on social media and Twitter so we'll play back I wanted to look at a couple of things are in recent interviews\nMayor lower so I'm of the city of prominence has talked about and so has governor Romano I Believe because now that is being asked him for a campaign folks\nHow they would handle ice capital I see\nThose are folks at work within ice come into different states and cities and towns and they find people that are here illegally and Mary Lewis has said recently again that he would support abolishing that department and not allowing them to come into his city a pretty\nFeisty words if you will a couple of weeks before the election and I want it to get the opinion of the former mayor Joe paleo and a couple of other things that are happening in Providence like pre Shia your time I know you're very busy Joe paleontology morning\nWho is you know Japan Leno alright\nWell he's called into the show will effect will fix the phones here I'm In I Believe it was in one of the instances ah do you and your clothes on from three to six here on WPRI has his television show as well to channel twelve and I believe you set it on that program Daniel state of mind\nAnd a governor Amano has questioned how how she would work and how she does work she said it's not a state is a it's not a a local issue it's a federal issue regarding ice\nAh good morning Japan Leno I did your interview I mean I didn't hear anything in your intro and then ah we wanted to fix your phone so good morning again Hi good morning to you\nI mentioned I don't know if you can hear me just because of the phone situation but I did mention that uh the current mayor\nJorge Lourdes amongst you know all the questions that are coming out and there have been debates at city hall here and there and you know questions issues what are you going to you know what would you do next time around and his dealings with ice the immigration folks\nAre he said he he would have bought he would work to abolish\nAny kind of a relationship with them what's your take on that\nWhy would you do I mean if that's it if it's a federal agency and the ice is there to protect the people in a city in the\nCountry or was it was rational for a man ask\nYou what what has he said I haven't followed okay statements Ahmed except that he's against it but I'd never heard why and I just don't I just don't get it\nSo he said um he he would support dismantling ice which is the U.S immigration and Customs Enforcement\nStemming from the Trump administration's controversial so family separation policy which has sent and obviously stop to an executive order from the president these are his words we can't have a federal agency\nThat ... role is separating children lying about it and keeping those kids away from their parents it's not who we are we're so much better than that and that's what did it for me\nWell I I think we're all sympathetic to the state but that we do want to see children separated from their parents and and and what the Trump Administration has done is wrong on that but\nTo get rid of ice all together when this all the good things that they have done and protecting\nThis country um we just can't throw that away so I can understand the sentiment about separation families from of the kids from their parents we don't want to see that that's the other thing that the Trump is put him\nUm but that doesn't mean the entire agency is bad and not to have a relationship with them it's just going to\nMake the city quite frankly more dangerous um I mean I guess he's in favor of private as being the sanctuary city I personally am not I don't think that's where we need to go um but he seems to want this or this or disagree with a with a with a bummer\nWell in that same interview with Daniel arcade I'm reading from a gentle twelve peace now it said he does consider Providence sanctuary city\nThat never it never was before he became mayor and I don't think that people are proud of this really know what that means\nWell that's what I was going to ask you I when you frame yourself as a sanctuary city it sounds like a ... everybody can come here you know it doesn't matter what the processes and we're going to welcome everyone which sounds nice in loving and ... and all of that good stuff at the same time\nI eat prominent has seen its its people that are here paying taxes working have a piece of property and are here legally\n[noise] yes\nAnd at the same time if somebody here is illegal we want them to go through the process to be legal they want to be legal themselves\nThe the people don't want to be here Neal is a legal basis and so we want to try to help the but just to say to everybody come on and to ... this becomes um a show called um\nAre are dumping ground for everybody just to come in and and and now we have to raise taxes because everybody's going to our schools\nWhen there's a process in place I mean we have this is America we have laws on the books that we need to follow we can challenge them sometimes I'm such a separating kids from their parents that's something that should be challenged but just to let it become a big sanctuary city\nI don't know if that's good for Providence I don't think it's good for the ...\nI don't think it's good for the prominence police department because what a position that you've done this job you've worked with the police department obviously you run them\nHe saying well we're not going to make them a federal immigration force our police department and they're not a federal income tax policing the not federal gaming agents there not federal park agents what does that do to the province police department when they have to pull someone over\nAnd and and and quite frankly it's a it's a reason world out\nThere against police where you can't pull me over you can ask me where I'm from all that and you you see it constantly on a you know people taking videos\nIt's it's so disrespectful in one sense but it puts them in a very troubling position doesn't it\nI think so especially when they're understaffed to me right now you have a table of organization that she was supposed to be about four hundred and Ninety five five hundred police officers probably about close to eighty vacancies by the time this do police school for the latest forty could show that grudge which\nI'm about forty will be taken probably they won and they'll with retirements\nTaking place by the time that happened were going to be back to where we were again with with eighty two hundred vacancies and with the city should be doing 'em and who am I look I was a myth Thirty years ago she will be really curious what my opinion is but I've done the job but I think I understand it\nTo a point where there should be three police schools in place right now no one and that the tables organization should be fully felt\nThen you take the Dutch they graduate the police school and you use them to buddy up with a police and they can help them patrol they was into a position becomes available for them I've met with police in the past when we've talked about some of the problems in
