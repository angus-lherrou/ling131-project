obviously postage stamps on some of the pictures that we are now coming out of it that are coming out I did or they actually been mailed through the U.S postal service I Know I Believe I asked him about yesterday but I I we couldn't see them into more recently\nThere was a sense of the road it looks like on the left side they bark on it but it it it's purposefully obscure partially because that would be part of the investigation that we see a police\nAh yeah yeah I Would want to put out there but yet they're searching a very uh above it searching or what all this what about public we're a

to do some some people that are not following this too closely or they're catching bits and pieces is the fact that none of these have harmed any one of these devices none of them have been detonated and so of course that leads people to believe that it could be some kind of\nA stunt an attention get grabbing thing people want to talk about all you know this is happening right before the midterm

that some people think eight maybe nine um different devices none have a detonated or harm to anyone\nAnd listen you have your own thoughts on this I Am sure for three eight nine seven seven second only to to to a tussle with conspiracy theories too much but there's a huge\nAmount of discussion on social media\nA and even bringing up a tweet of you know from prominent Democrats saying you've got to do something there's only two weeks before the election I Know some people out there want to weigh in and say listen this is a obviously a stunt they're trying to turn the tables on President Trump\nThey're trying to say that he's going to tone down their rhetoric I Love your thoughts this is now we're in a couple of days in here actually it started last week with the George Soros\nSituation he was mailed a device and then you had a President Obama than you had President Clinton their residences John Brennan at the CNN offices Maxine Waters\nOf the Debbie Wasserman Schultz situation Robert De Niro now if you're waking up and joining us the actor who has been more than vocal if not a borderline\nUh you know his his rhetoric has been violent\nRobert De Niro and I don't know if that's half of his because he's an actor a and he's and he's ... he's loving the attention but he got involved in saying you know I'd like to punch them in the face talking about the president the United states\nSo he his restaurant now has been targeted if you will and Joe Biden's home uh in Delaware now a lot of you were saying I don't think they've been male through the U.S postal service it looks like the post marks have not gone through\nThis is everything that's going to be sorted out every little detail has to be sorted out and the New York police department obviously the FBI I mean they're they're absolutely loaded in the streets dogs\nUh weapons drawn looking around um as as I said I Know people that live there full time and then there's you know worry

then went to the rally at night and again you get like you're at a rock concert and he starts on the media\nFor three eight nine seven seven six marks enrichment on WPRI mark\n... been a little while to listen to last or well I'm Glad you're back\n[laughter] you know was a I like to comment on track reads a book or a C K ... ... ... it didn't have a comment Hillary Clinton such Debbie shovel\nAnd it could be what she said that incited this not anything that President Trump is it\nA listen she put out of somebody's ah sending me the tweet where I uh and I I Want to make sure that it's it's legit but I Do believe she tweeted out and if I'm doing this off the top of my head whenever you choose to do something only two weeks before the election we don't have a moment to lose now that means what gets your friends and neighbors to get out and vote\nRight yeah are are that going to be twisted in the sense of you know she's telling people to go out and do something nutty I don't I\n... in their interpretation\nShe she is the only one that should anything civil\nFor for for President Trump and the group stretch it a lock her up I mean ... if you catch it some of the issues though which

I received the call for him last friday eleven thirty where he read me an executive order he prepared at you as an issue at one o'clock on friday\nAnd I said it was ... I Would agree to work with him should be elected governor and then I uh yesterday endorsed Allen pong\nGovernor because I Believe that he has the skills of lawyer prosecutor yeah\nWhat's going on here he gets that but I think he will uh he will follow\nThrough ... told me he will follow through so can I Will work with anyone who wants to the investigation done I've already found conflicts that the truth hidden than accepting the potential wrongdoing\nA criminal and civil after pension there's a lot of red flag or lots of good reasons to investigate including the fact that half a billion dollars that law gambling it has been but I Will work with anybody who wants to see an investigation the\nTents ideal you tried working with Seth magazine or the current general treasury you tried working with Governor Gina Raimondo former General Trainor you try and do you didn't you try and also to work with the attorney General Peter kill Martin or not yeah\nYes I did and in fact the Rhode Island retired teachers wrote to Peter kill more requesting an investigation and he told them he had no staff capable of doing an investigation and they should talk to the state police\nOkay so uh so really dead end dead end dead end total data yeah\nNow we're going to have a new attorney general and it does appear that it would be Peter owner who's a former U.S attorney\nDo you have any communications with him potentially\nWeek to Munich the Rhode Island retired teachers and I are communicated with to several years ago when he was still with those department of justice okay or that he was sympathetic but again did nothing he has not to my knowledge that anything about\nWhat is in my opinion the largest by the crime in the history of the state that has not been part of his platform um so I don't know where they have on this\nUm I haven't heard anything indicating he's willing to uh ruffled feathers by doing an investigation but I Hope I Hope you\nSo I think a lot of people listening would say okay I've I've heard of pets I now he has been on the radio he showed up yesterday with\nCandidate Allen phone or he's going to try to get some money back to the engineers or try to figure out you know investigative Lee or maybe what went wrong or if there was you know something more than just as you said gambling you know or a bad call or write too much of a risk taking\nBut what did you have any ties to Rhode Island do you have any ties to you know I'm ... we did you spend time here people might say why is he coming into little old Rhode Island\n[noise] well I five years six years ago thought either loved those picture on the cover of institutional investors magazine where she was being hailed as having say having all the nations pension crisis\nAnd I knew that was to just not true and uh so that caused me to get involved I did start my first business in Providence Rhode Island in Nineteen Ninety\nOn Westminster street was that but it was a financial firm called into the securities it was a joint venture with a large insurance company I'm so that is my only title Rhode Island but\nI the issues are what brought me hope for to get involved in Rhode Island because it was obvious to me that people here were were being scale\nYou had the chief do share of the pension\nBuying the the the recommendations of lowering the recommendation Warren Buffett and other investment luminaries who said public pensions should not gamble on hedge ...\nThey were saying that before Gina invested a dollar ... the warning signs were there she ignored\nWarnings of the most credible experts in the country and proceeded to gamble well okay maybe she's written maybe salute but she lost she lost five hundred billion dollars the gamble didn't work out and when you ignore the warnings of expert proceeds to lose half a billion dollars you should be held accountable\n... how are you going to get that half a billion dollars back into the pit it's easy to lose ... billion dollars a lot harder to earn\nSo what would you do tend to like yeah ... what would what would you do so said by chance or or whatever by votes [laughter]\nAh Allan Fung becomes the governor or someone other than Gina Raimondo ... you know pulling wise or the idea I'll tell you right now\nShe is staying out of the fray she is running off the clock if you will\nShe's the we've had some crazy stories going back in Nineteen Seventy five someone ... over the head he happened to be the speaker now I mean we have had the most crazy election season and we were realizing today she hasn't commented on it she goes she goes about the gubernatorial business you know the events things like that open houses\nOr what have you got a tremendous amount of labor support\nOr it looks as if she could you know have another term here\nWe just had so I don't go away if it's coming to remind don't and if anyone other than a governor Romano where do you begin so that's a twofold question\nWell if there's anyone other the governor of Illinois I think it's clear that an investigation will be a an investigation needs to be done and it needs to be a ordered by\nAn elected politicians either governor or an attorney general because\nWe need access to the document that's what we have a pet up till now we also need to work shoulder to shoulder with the SEC we need to invite the asked me to join us in this investigation to figure out where what half of the\nWall Street donated to her political campaign\nContracts were given the wall street the pension for last big time Gina\nDid very well for her political ambitions for campaign coffers patches on that terribly so if Gina doesn't when it looks as if there will be an investigation\nOr if she does with the the question is will there be put the ... the crowd yesterday at the Rhode Island retired Teachers Association\nWant you to commit to a new investigation and the guy that she with ... so that seems likely but hopefully we won't have to crowds bummed another investigation hopefully we will have one does\nState [noise] so I I'm I'm ...

Twitter account wrote just what I just read to you another child dies in DC why of care but not being released until after the election in other words the report they think it's a complete and they're saying that it's being withheld and then they write one has to wonder why\nNow I wrote to the governor's people I don't want to reiterate this info if it's wrong or incomplete I'm only talking about a tweet so I'm Wondering if the date has been released for this investigation and how would they know if it's going to be after the election I ... I Would really like to clarify especially if that's not the case and I'm asking for you\nUm my granted replied to me I don't know anything about a report but I Will ask if anyone on the official side has heard of anything that child advocate acts independently\nSo I'm going to try to get to the bottom of this I don't think this is a kind of story to be used for political purposes but if in fact the report is complete and it is being withheld\nI Can't understand that either um so I'm going to a\nI'm an dig into what I have a couple of people at the state house that you know listen how long do these usually take and if in fact that is the case you know if it how can we how can we talk about it\nI I think it's sad to say and it's it's horrific that you know sure you're going to get the details but the little boy has gone so I Would hate to see a family being exploited\nMore than they've already suffered does that if that makes sense I Hope uh the state child welfare officials are investigating this little boy was Eighteen days old put in foster care and uh he died early yesterday morning and a spokesperson for the D. C. Y. F. confirmed the death to the Providence Journal\nBut said quote we cannot comment further at this time because of confidentiality laws now the boy's mother went on the record she's thirty seven from Puckett Marisol Hernandez and she told the journal yesterday afternoon\nThat D.C why of social workers came to her home around twelve thirty to tell her\nThat her boy angel had died in his sleep hours after his last feeding Hernandez is the mother of two children two other children ten years old an eight years old said social workers at women infants hospital had taken the boy from our after his birth on October sex as a precaution\nCiting her postpartum depression ten years ago now this mother says there was no reason for that I have shared custody with my older children with their father\nThere are no court restrictions whatsoever they said they just want it to keep the baby safe and look what happened to him this is a ... I Believe ... horrible story\nA document obtained by the journal indicates that Rhode Island hospitals had been alerted to Hernandez is pregnancy because she'd been living in three homeless shelters prior to her delivering her son in such cases social workers often review the health of the expected mother and decide whether the baby should go home with his mother\nIn this case social workers decided it's best that the baby go into foster care until further review by the family court and the little baby died in foster care yesterday Hernandez was also known to New York social workers because of children she had their the documents that while I Do not know what you do\nIn this situation because I I wouldn't you think this is just me and I'm trying I'm trying\nTo uh with all delicate and if I can I can uh say to the Raimondo administration certainly um if in fact\nHere's the story here the facts if the report or the investigation is complete you certainly I don't think I don't think they're holding it back until after the election uh Maryland ... either people or himself for his office or his campaign seems to think they have more information on that\nAnd they are they put it out there this morning another child dies in DC why of care we're hearing that the child advocates most recent report is complete but not being released until after the election one has to wonder why\nThat would be even more tragic than this story is standing on its own these are these are human beings this is an a tiny little baby Eighteen days old\nIf something went wrong and there and there's a problem more than we already know within that department it has got to be\nHas got to be shown and they would have to talk about it I I Can't imagine now I get privacy issues but however
