to\nThe last caller said I think she has to actually move up to be mediocre or that the fact of the matter is is that the Democrats are always this I Can't even take to Vegas because they wanted to give me a ... because I'm almost ... percent right\nEverything Democrats accuse Republicans or conservatives out there always are themselves whether it be sexism racism or anti democracy or fascism that's where they are that's what they want to do it I I'm I'm\nAlmost a hundred percent right or probably Ninety nine point nine percent of the card and that's what that's what this tweet was about as sort of like the in the sexism\nOf a of a lot of people in the Democratic party except that it's reversed up however\nIf you did have a woman up on on their last I must say running for governor was a woman like let's say Kansas so it\nI Love her yeah so I don't know if a lot of people know who she is but she's a boy making a real name for herself your show Maltese or somebody like that yeah\nThen there wouldn't be a woman anymore [laughter]\nRoche by a woman is only a woman in a a a to a Democrat if she's a progressive woman ... that's the whole point because if you're a

you have to have you have to be a progressive that you have a progressive isn't in your genes or you're denying your heritage\nHow it seems to me and I think that's I think basically\nWhat it shows is
