cumulatively\nRevolution self centered this is the double the news at ten o'clock\nIn the morning this is just in the Providence Journal is just identified the driver of this landscaping shrug those involved with a deadly collision in the city or early Monday morning as soon as twenty five year old Brian Torres used do before a judge this afternoon among the charges DUI\nDeaths resulting driver that landscaping vehicle achievable into card valley an ad wells is killed a twenty eight year old city man critically injured another passenger in that car and he is due again this is the suspect in the case you didn't abide by the papers Dr Torres\nIs due in court this afternoon W ... one speaking of the court spread Kavanaugh said that lead into his new seats on the Supreme Court confirmation and swearing in now completely\nThe end of this kind of thing we have to start working together with both sides and stop the kind of a\nA brick bats and character assassination that uh uh play Washington and this is a cabinet spectacle was was the cop the oceans above all a type of politics that I'd like to get away from\nWell judge miners it's interesting though because you've got two sides to the same point here right you're saying it was an embarrassment and got to get away from the you know the party politics and and really the kind of violent rhetoric that's been going around but at the same time you've\nBenefited from this you've got a people tweeting about gas bag your ad calling him a gas bag because it the the the yearbook references and then you know it takes off on social media something can be so obscure and so strange or what have you even James Woods the actor\nJumped on board and and not and grabbed your ad and said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse as an embarrassment to Rhode Island it's off the charts now I mean you're getting a huge books from there it is that I'm sure I'm sure you're happy about it but at the same time it's a it's a weird way to get a boost\nRight up close ironic but it is symptomatic go what's wrong with Washington and the particular\nUh how Senator Whitehouse as let us down his his career is\nBasically been a bottom don't bomb best are the two hundred and twelve climate change speeches and then there's this gas bag performance at the cabinet earrings or this is really crystallized what's what's wrong with the\nNot only Washington but his brand of politics and people are sick of it they they want change and so yes I benefited from it but I should because this is not what people want this is people do not one of the kind of demonstration that Senator Whitehouse put on a it's one of the whole nation\nAnd so I'm hoping that the sentiments that I'm hearing not just from around this bill from people all over the country are going to carry the day of come the election because clearly we need a change in Washington and I caught a climate change because\nWe really do need a sea change in terms of the way businesses conductors down there and I'm hoping that this will galvanize up Rhode islanders to realize that uh\nUh it's time that we moved out these hyper partisan people like Senator Whitehouse and get somebody down there I could work with both sides and get things done over the country and for Rhode islanders\nSpeaking with a judge Robert Plant or the Republican challenger to senator White House in the Senate race or how close is it how much money have you garnered from the whole Kavanaugh ... you know gas bag thing and and how much does it help to you\nWell I don't I don't uh I haven't tallied the money that's come it's mostly small donations from people I Can't begin to match the money that some of the White House has put away after\nTaking in three million a corporate tax contributions and other contributions from the special interests uh but\nUh I'm raising enough money to be able to put some ads on TV and and to show the contrast between the way he's conducted themselves in the way I Hope to to do business in Washington and no power we've got so many issues that need\nA both sides to come to some uh solutions on infrastructure healthcare\nUm [noise] uh immigration the opioid crisis just to name a few this is where we need to work together with the Democrats and Republicans and with President Trump and his administration to try and make progress and\nLook you you can't do it without without having both sides get behind some of these things because you've got to sixty votes role in the Senate\nAnd with the split his narrows it is\nIt's important that we have elected officials down there that can work with one another and wants to work with someone like Senator Whitehouse who keeps throwing rotten tomatoes that the the president and the anybody who's not part of the of the ... center Warren a democratic team that wants to\nEnact socialized medicine and and raise our taxes and put more regulations in place these are the things I'm fighting against and so I think this is a really crystallized the whole issue for Rhode Island that America is well\nAll right so we um we're looking at four weeks tilted you know from today going to the polls I Know you've been doing a lot of different events trying to get out and meet people you've got some outside support you in any big Republican names that are going to come out in the next couple of weeks to try to push you closer to\nSenator Whitehouse as far as endorsements are just seeing something on your behalf\nWell I don't I don't have anybody specifically lined up to do that I\nOf course uh admired a senator Collins from Maine for the work that she did on this matter and or a speech um explaining or vote\nIn favor of confirming judge Kavanaugh thought it was outstanding and ah so you know I I Would love to have her a among others or be helpful to me but\nA look this is this is just all crystallizing now I'm hoping to line up as much support as possible but the most important supporters of the people of Rhode Island that particularly independent and women voters who I Hope ah saw a in this process of a situation where\nAre they to think that that we need a different approach and so uh it's more about ah getting getting the people out to vote that are going to want to see a change in Washington and I'm all about doing that these next four weeks\nAnd also a transplant is I think there is simple numbers coming out today I don't know how big of a polar how extensive it is a mini channel six the Providence Journal and a run out of public radio I think together they get some kind of a poll you aware of that and argue included in that\nI'm not aware of it and I do not know whether I'm included or not I hope I would be but um I really have not followed what has been happening in terms of that particular poll\nAll right are you there is a breaking news out there I'm looking at CNN Nikki Haley resigns as UN ambassador I think this is some kind of a surprise I thought she was coming down right now\nWhat she did an excellent job that would be a loss I don't know what the reasons would be for it but uh she was certainly a forceful advocate\nA ... in the UN and a very articulate spokesperson so uh I Would be disappointed if if she has in fact step down in a a like to look into what the reasons were but I Would certainly impressed with her performance there\nYeah that's a report that's coming out now Nikki Haley resigned as UN ambassador so we'll have to break down and she gets a reason for it that's a yet another resignation within the Trump Administration\n[noise] yeah that's that's one of the most difficult things or the president has to do is that is to both the tractor and maintain a good people and it's\nIt's hard because the pressures intense the publicity and the public scrutiny is a um the president so uh that's the challenge that any president faces and so I'm hopeful that or if she is in fact stepping down at the we can get other good another good person to fill that spot\nYeah All right well thank you I listen I appreciate your time judge Robert Flanders four weeks ago I feel I feel like you're on a roll so we'll see what happens with the fallout from the capital case\nYeah no I I feel I Am as well and let them swimming in my direction so uh it's all all hands on on board for the final push\nAll right judge Robert Flanders we will continue this conversation yes up some breaking news Nikki Haley former governor of South Carolina\nUh uh is being reported that she has resigned as

so I Know you're going to say but\nI think it's a mutual thing I think\nShould put a made a lot of shots were forced to be in the position that she said and God only knows how much ... away from her family and\nShe's a young woman so it's a big sacrifice no question about it and I think it's it's it's the middle of resignation like the Trump respected her as most people this is the you know he
