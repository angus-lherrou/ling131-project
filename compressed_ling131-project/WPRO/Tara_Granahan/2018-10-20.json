investing sense with Bob Richards a nationally recognized certified financial planner professional Andy Smith [noise]\nWe had been talking about the changing nature of retirement and focusing on the two main sources of retirement income your savings and investments and of\nCourse Social Security so these are the two aspects of today's limited time offer and investing sense dot com and they had to eat one of the reasons why we're running this free offer is because of the risky strategy that some Americans are applying when it comes to Social Security\nYeah so there's a there's kind of a good and bad to this nine you're bull market I obviously it's great to see the market do what it's doing but unfortunately this nine year bull market has encouraged some Americans to claim Social Security early and then they turn around and invest the money but\nThe thing is this could be a huge mistake because you know claiming Social Security before your full retirement age actually reduces the amount of money that you could be receiving a you could be missing out on what is yeah it's like basically a guaranteed increase over a couple of years which is what happens when you wait\nAnd you know if you're still working while you claim benefits before full retirement age Social Security is actually going to reduce your benefits even more\nSo I mean think about it you can't get an increase like this than any other investment period and this is from a guy who you know makes a living helping you invest in the markets\nAnd why would you want the Social Security administration to take more money away from you with these reductions in benefits simply because you're still working\nAnd I mean really all of us a financial engines are worried\nThat Americans are taking risks that they don't fully understand and that's why for this limited time as part of our offer for free portfolio review will also run a Social Security analysis to personalize you're claiming strategy please get to

M. D. amount what you're going to do is if you're going to add up\nAll of your pre tax accounts your traditional i._r._a. your role over IRA your four O. one K. if you're not working are you still working right now are you actively contributing to an employer plan\nA I Am not working part time but I'm not contributing to impose on\nOkay so if you were working you would be able to exclude that current four one K.\nBut you're going to add up all your pre tax accounts traditional i._r._a. roll over four one K. you are not going to add the Roth IRA a value in your calculation\nUm and so what you basically have the pre tax you're going to exclude the Ross ah and then this is actually when we're building um when we're building income plans for people we look at different and distinct\nUh categories of investments the pre tax the raw or the brokerage account any savings and so as we're trying to figure out how to you know get people that paycheck that retirement pay check the the money will come from different places\nNow have you ever thought about so you've got this Ross and you've got to pre tax accounts have you ever gone through any sort of Ross conversion calculation have you ever considered anything along those lines\nWere not on a heck of a considered it out and done on okay about three or four years ago and I'm I'm going to be doing another one\nBecause this is my last here that's I'll be seven and a half here I Am going to a second raw conversion from a traditional our right\nThat the issue that kind of um the sidelines a lot of people is that so what what happens with these Ross conversions is you have these pre tax\nAmounts you effectively take a distribution I. E. earned income for whatever you want to move from the pre tax Ira over to the Ross\nSo a lot of different factors um you know ... kind of old way on the viability of this move but your taxes are now what they're going to be leader your overall financial situation but the thing that trips up a lot of people as their ability or inability to pay taxes\nOn the distribution with outside of the IRA money\nSo as long as you have the ability to pay that tax burden with outside the IRA money and as long as you've gone through the calculations you should be fine\nOkay great great awesome\nThanks for calling the show and a really have a great week thank you very much\nNow it's time for this week's portfolio review and this is where Andy died deeply into a portfolio that's been sent to us\nAnd this week and he's review has his Social Security twist to it and that's perfect because we're trying to help Americans today with a limited free offer for a portfolio review that includes the Social Security analysis\nNow a reminder make sure you consult with an advisor before acting on anything that we discuss and you can find a local advisor by going to investing sense dot com so now this week's review Larry says his portfolio and he writes\n... if you plan to take Social Security and you have a sizable four one K. does the draw from the four one K. impact Social Security payments suppose I make Fifteen thousand dollars part-time draw Social Security and pull sixty thousand dollars how will that sixty thousand dollars impact Social Security\nHey great question Larry let me tell ya Larry's got a pretty cool story we went back and forth over email the first thing that I asked Larry was when is all of this going to come together you've got his reply\nTo yeah he said I plan to retire and the next eight to Nineteen months I'm sixty one I'll be sixty two in January and I want to work part time next year I have about one point four million in a four one K. and three hundred thousand in cash\nI Know if I go over a certain cat while on Social Security I'm I'm not going to get the full benefit\nRight so the rule that Larry is referencing only applies when you reach full retirement age and that's when your earnings no longer reduce your benefits no matter how much you earn\nNow if you're younger than full retirement age and you make more than the annual earnings limit your earnings may actually reduce your benefits so it's based on this for retirement age right for Americans born between Nineteen forty three and Nineteen fifty for your full retirement age is sixty six\nA beginning with you guys born in Nineteen fifty five two months are added for every ... year until the full retirement age reaches sixty seven for Americans born in Nineteen sixty year later\nSo what are the ... to the benefits in case you reach the earnings limit\nIf you're under full retirement age for the whole year Social Security deduct a dollar from your benefits for every two dollars that you earn above the annual limit and for twenty Eighteen that limit is Seventeen thousand forty dollars\nNow if you can imagine it gets a little bit more complex in the year you reach full retirement age Social Security deduct a dollar and benefits for every three dollars that you earn above the limit for twenty Eighteen that limit is forty five thousand three hundred sixty dollars but\nThey only count earnings before the month that you reach full retirement age\nShe's got all that no yeah no my head spinning I was trying to keep track I was oh they have the right it don't even know it does the first sentence I was okay and then tried to keep track of limits an age is just it's unbelievable\nYeah Social Security is just ridiculously complex the worst part is all these rules they\nAnd that's when more baby boomers will start claiming benefits but please do not freak out that this is you know just a couple of years away and it's because the Social Security administration says that interest income a loan from the trust fund should bridge the gap until twenty thirty for\nOne of the big reasons were running a limited time offer on investing cents dot com right now is because that some Americans are using a risky Social Security claiming strategy for full retirement age and investing in the stock market\nRight and listen I Will never bust your chops for investing in the stock market because we invested in the market but not like this man what these guys are doing is they're for going these guaranteed increases because you know you just couldn't wait a little bit longer for your Social Security\nSo then you're basically faced with this double risk last potential\nFor that guaranteed increase and you're investing on your own you've got the risk inherent in those investments we manage clients risk all week long knowing this happens is so worrisome\nTo me so when it comes to solving this problem how do you do that for your clients and how does this free portfolio review help\nBecause we've had this amazing nine you're bull market you've got four one K. balances you got irate balances their way up and a lot of you see this and you think that you're a hundred percent ready for retirement that's great but you have to realize your goal now becomes to try to protect and to try to preserve what she got\nAnd that takes a completely different mindset it takes a different approach to what you used to do with your long term money\nThat volatility alone should've exposed why their Social Security claiming strategy is just crazy\nBut at the more individual level it really depends on your unique situation every body is a little bit different\nSo we solve for those differences for those of you know specific issues by getting to know ya and by and by providing you with three very important items as a part of this portfolio review\nWe sit down with you it's an in person review of your current investments by our local financial engines team

what are some ways that you help people get more\nLook if you can wait to claim until age Seventy you will increase your annual benefits by about eight percent of full retirement benefits per

[laughter] they they took\nAway your satellite going back that far away well what we're talking about yeah the night\nOr yesterday that way but when you go a long time ago when you get the H outta Worcester campaign\nYeah I I I I've been around a long time let me tell you you remember the get out of the campaign yeah about eight Ninety yeah there you go [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nAnyway you gotta you gotta wonder about this uh uh regarding a a ... a a\n... however you want to call it\nOkay uh you got a pen and paper\nI Do and a typewriter and uh now I Want them ... is a great okay I\nWatch I write down a couple of other name right All right and you can investigate on you're wrong amount of ... ... what's the other two are Michael Savage show last night\nTo see a\nMike ... yeah I'm not familiar I go out on a listener that radio station\nWell a way is a nationally syndicated and a radio talk show\nHe's down your ... and that's what ... fish right never yeah go ahead so once you boil anyway\nAnyway it was thought okay so anyway I got a ... you have this does not want to pay me ...\nI asked regarding the timing of piece of paper and a ... day or the or a U.S border air he also pointed out that there are\nTwo of the world who are part of the thought of rope George Soros George Soros fun at the for world\nBut for a walk in a show or on the ground in on doors in Guatemala and then I thought what are the first group in the open society ...\n... that's not what the second group as people Without Borders that second and third rope Catholic charity not about race that allow\nSo why is that the three main books that are still ...\n... these people to be a coach that bad to America and a A R walk guiding a refugee now that that's why they have all the kids with them because they can't\nPay the schools you know that if they bring it with that that they have a ... right so the snake\n... and a ... spontaneous combustion people have been on the ground for months and they'd been planning for months and that was the October surprise that's about all I got to say\nOh well thank you very much in ah go ahead and look that up the at the age of wants to campaign it's from a long time ago for three eight nine seven seven six one\nTwo three two one WPRI ... toll free number I mean I don't know if that's accurate I never heard of that guys talking about on the radio but because I listen to them ...\nBut um you know maybe you maybe that's why would ... get it but the other thing too is he he'd mark did bring up an interesting point um you know it's so now you're this infantry company commander and your standard in Laredo, Texas or you're on the border wherever you are no Dallas Arizona\nOr in they put kids up front\nAnd you've got M. sixteens level that I'm saying stop and they're not stopping and they're pushing the kids to your little kids four year olds three year old stored you what do you do\nWhat do you do the execute Doug deadly force you open up you can't you ... how can you do that\nUm it's just that it's an interesting interesting concept and I'm not really sure how\nThe military can be used to close the border unless you're willing to use the military in the role in which was designed to be used as a military ... primary function and you've heard me if you listen to the show for more than ten minutes you've heard me say that the militaries primary function is to hurt people and break things that's what we do and we do a better than anybody else in the world were really good at it\nAnd and so you're going to have to hurt people and break things to stop these people from coming across the border and the question is do you use deadly force an end to what level of his that escalate and then what's the backlash the backlash will be severe in an overwhelming\nA but do we have a right to defend our border do we have a right to use deadly force to defend the sovereign border of the United states I ask you for three eight\nNine seven seven six eight hundred three two one W bureau that is the toll free number you can also email six thirty WPRI dot com John ill at six thirty WPRI dot com we'll be back with more under these vitally important messages stick around\nTalk six or Ninety nine seven have him W.
