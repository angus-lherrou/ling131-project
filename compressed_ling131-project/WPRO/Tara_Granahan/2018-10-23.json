have you actually met and sat with ... and he said twice and in a similar answer to what you said that um he's just unclear on the design but nothing specific\nSo duty Whitman was there she's the independent the real challenge or to a ... and did she get up and speak\nYes he was actually the first person who offered public testimony and she I think falls into that third ... that I mentioned ... where she said\nI don't like the current design I think it's too tall for the area and we could be turned about that but we also shouldn't be earning ... someone who wants to invest in Providence and bring a potentially exciting new development to the city\nSo she sort of in that middle ground up hey we've got a great opportunity here in her opinion but not the current proposal she's not a fan of the current proposal though I Will say I am that folks that are paying the get last night hey is there any wiggle room on the height of this power right you said we're not at this point\nWe bought the forty six stories and last night an architect actually got up and spoke at part of this hour long presentation that kicked off the meeting at the same ... put together a video or we heard from some architects\nAct we heard from a land use attorney and a doctor at the un a business professor who put together its economic impact study on all of them of course saying how great this would be up for the city of Providence um but they also said that forty six stories is what they believe\nIs the right height they said it's about critical mass right too tall and you have and the residential unit\nBut too short and the projects not financially viable and so they said that\nFive hundred thirty eight forty six story tower is exactly the we thought for what they're trying to\nConclude he was on the line from channel twelve she covered the meeting last night the whole point tower project ... so it's not just housing it would be a combination of different businesses just explain what they want to put in there and where it actually is\nYet so it's on up particle forty two of the one Ninety five land um you know right across where the ... bridge would be out in the river a use me\nThey say it's going to offer like great panoramic views of the city a lot like the architect who got up there and gave that again one hour presentation it got the meeting\nThat you know every unit is going to have a view and they said that there's going to be different tiers of [noise] excuse me a residential unit for people to uh you know potentially buy into a whole range of super high end to what they say will be more affordable because\nPeople had expressed concern that this would be all luxury housing they say that's not true\nAnd the ground floor with the retail and then there would be several levels\nOf parking and that parking garage is a another concern for some of the local residents they say\nYou know the parking garage it's going to be what you see when you're on the ground ... bridge\nIn the park that proposed for next door to the unit they say it's going to be an eye for and it just doesn't fit and it's just going to loom over the city and the this really intimidating structure but ah the developer say no no no that's not true you're when shop to unify the area\nThe parking garage we'll be back in a way that you won't be able to Alex parking and then of course we've all seen the rendering of how that at our will continue from that base\nThat sort of modern a design of I don't know\nI I Can't even describe the shape of that is very fluid and the developers yeah than is\nOften referred to as being sent us so\nThat they are well that's that's interesting no it is it's very different but my goodness ... don't we need something different but I I you know I can talk to the listeners about that I'm not gonna put you on the spot I I find it interesting it has to go through the the um city council correct\nCorrect so you might remember that sort of think about that this project has been on the table and twenty ... he's been saying this New York city developer came in and said I Want to build three towers I remember there was the ghetto of power that he wanted the bell read different heights\nAnd that was quickly you know put off the table we don't want that uh and then he changed his proposal to this one forty six story power but that was back in twenty six when he first came to the table with his idea so it's been a long drawn out process\nAnd it went before the city's ordinance committee because they do need that height burying the car at a height Catholic one hundred and thirty feet they're looking for a six hundred foot height cap so quite a difference there yeah but then before the ordinance committee went before the whole city council than the full ... said that that city ordinance many\nThey hurt a lot of public testimony last night no vote was taken at it will go back before the ordinance many again for a vote then back before the city council and this is just one step at a profit that before they can pull building permit that actually break ground if it gets to that point\nAnd let's hope he hangs in there with the city of ... [laughter] doesn't take his idea somewhere else\nBecause that's the fear the money involved Kim just quickly al ... is on the line from WPRI this is such an important it could be such an important piece of development for the city of Providence I Can't for the life of me understand why it's being dragged out however what's the money involved here\nYet so this is a great question ... and I have to say my colleague Dan like Allen has been really covering this closely since the beginning\nUm but they have said that developers have that the project is estimated to cost more than three hundred million dollars and Spain has admitted that dropping quite a bit of his own money into that um how the exact a cost to the parents in the city and how the one Ninety five land will work out is\nA you know not something that I've real deeply into so I Would suggest heading WPRI dot com and reading like getting the gallons coverage because you know every little bit of ... um but we we've\nHeard over and over again that three hundred million dollar figure I'm insane is missing a lot of his own money towards that\nI Can't imagine why you wouldn't want him to come to your new best friend [laughter] your three hundred million dollar new best friend or ... thanks so much I Know that there's a lot of um [noise]\nA ... in debt ... writings at on this as you said within a gallon but you guys do agree to you know team coverage is what I was trying to say team coverage over WPRI so appreciate your time and your voice It's MORNING\nI'll think they're I think for having me\nThank you Kim ...

Ninety nine seven AM six thirty some of the\nLush and central and orders\nFrom the revolution soft Washington centered this is the double the news at ten o'clock in the morning this was just in from law enforcement in Westchester County New York they confirmed that it was indeed a bomber\nThat was shot and said George Soros his mailbox is has discovered at his home in ... that is a village in\nBedford New York there's no one heard in the incidence right now they're trying to determine whether the package was sent through the males or otherwise delivered there among the unanswered questions as well as it is just specifically to George Soros here at home in New York developer Jason faces he is confident that the city council here ultimately\nGoing to see it as well have been pushing for this zone change which would allow him to build the tallest building in state history and the old one Ninety five land just off dire straits where\nWell I think yes and you I think your friend I'm speaking the commissioner\nSteven Perry public safety commissioner and prominence uh that's the challenger to mayor lords of the main challenger she's an independent duty Whitman she said she take the cameras out now it would have to get something going to get people on board it's tough to get people to follow the rules and then if for some reason in a couple of weeks someone else gets into the mayor's office\nWhere does that leave you commissioner Perry and the speeding cameras and you know a situation that's still is being tweaked right it's still being developed it feels like\nWell it is so we started in January so we have six months of data and it was different back then the U.S we're going\nPretty much sun sun up to sundown and uh it's been refined as a result of the general assembly passed a law\nSo it's ... it's a seven let me get this correct is it a seven AM six PM yeah only during school or when schools are open so a hundred and eighty days\nAnd so we don't have good data yeah\nHe goes oh warning period and a wind we know it gets the attention of people were always going to have people be dangerously\nThroughout school zones will always have ... issue with like those\nFines and those violations continued to diminish and that's our goal I'm so it it it's new it's the first in this state and we're looking at\nYou know the data and but I can tell you that it certainly changed Dr ... you're in April and may and June without a Dell\nAnd how and how do you track that by the number of tickets that went out or by yeah they did it lessen yeah\nSo the number of cars that go through those zones and the number of cars that were over eleven miles an hour or higher that got ticketed and then from week to week to week we've we've got number ... continuously decline and so looking at I think it was a week seven\nAnd versus week fourteen the violation declined by Seventy five percent\nWow so we have for instance a hundred violations out on you know to be camera in week seven and then perhaps forward several weeks week fourteen we'd had twenty five\nSame number vehicle but the the driver behavior and the speed reduced then that's what we're trying to do\nYou know so people said oh this is one of those you know spots where there's a speed camera so I thought to slow down so that makes so Pavlov yeah I mean\nWhether it's still the the whole purpose is whether this is the camera not low down in our school films\nThat's the message we got forty two schools in this in the city so whether it's a private school or a public school people ought to be slowing down and we see some pretty high speeds during the school day now which is we're trying to\nCorrect that drive and that's our goal it's always been our goals do that and we're trying to get it right balancing getting attention getting their attention when they drive too fast\nThis is a fifty dollar fine it doesn't go against your terms or your good driving record we're trying to change behavior\nAnd you know inevitably a commissioner Perry an over the months that we've been talking about this on and off people will say just put the speed bump in and stop with the you know the big brother watching you and the speed bump will slow everyone down or put in a you know a uniformed officer there you don't I don't think you have the staffing really to put the officers out he said give forty two schools\nAnd that's that's a chunk of you know manpower right\nIt's impossible to ... for ... the problem is pleased to stuff the school zones and do continuous enforcement like our technology and it's ... it's not a good it's a not a good uh assignment for are scarce resources so we could like red light\nAnd for some of it's a prime example that's changed driving behavior and when the intersection is it is at a point where we don't get many violations then we change it to another intersection that we've had a problem with that's the whole purpose oh no it's too expensive\nHaving police officers and be there like a technology can\n[noise] and the purpose is to write as many tickets as we can or generate revenue it's the change that Dr ... people drive too fast\nOr all over the place and we need to slow them down because unfortunately one was driving to fast several years ago and he didn't kill one about teachers\nYeah in a terrible situation or it was yeah it was horrible I you know I I I Know the flashing science I'm thinking of um east Greenwich right you get down to a division road and you see it's right in front of the you know public safety the police department there and there's a school across the street right the middle ... I think it is\nAnd you see on flashing light with it you know\nYou're going thirty seven and this you're supposed to be going twenty five and then you panic you know because you arriving right by the police station and it sure does slow you down any talk about that\nBut here's the thing the cameras already in there so the city has already paid you've got to contract and you've got you know I Know that candidates want to come in and say I'm going to reverse that and it's a money grab it's really difficult to do that isn't it\n[noise] well listen the the city entered into a contract or three years ago or so two years ago and yeah we we\nWe have a written contract that the city of Providence committed to this program and it's it'll be difficult to unwind that was out of severe ... penalty but there's a clause in which if we independently\nA stop the program than would be exposed to several hundred thousand dollars in paying the company that that's not the purpose is the purpose was to get this right\nAnd to to change driving behavior and our school zone I mean that's the purpose and I'd like to collect with zero\nIt if we ever get to that point we won't need to be cans but I Know we'll never get to it as we've seen examples across the country we've seen examples here in the city of prominence in a red light or Smith we still have people with signs\nAn effort to get in violation running a red light they still run that red light so\nThey'll never go away but our our goal is to make it safer in schools on\nA commissioner Steven ... I Know you do you want it to kind of let things calm down in the Washington park situation where Richard Gardner moved into a the neighborhood I Know you want it to not say anything I don't know is there any update or you just kind of keeping things quiet so low uptick\nKnow update alright commissioner Perry pre she ate it now you see how much are a good day thank you for your time\nAll right so things are ah that things are ... hopefully gonna come down in Washington park but also speed camps they are back on it was a grace period when the kids get back to school and it's up your time is up they are turned back on you'll now get a fifty dollar ticket and I'd like to hear from people who are maybe got the warning\nFor the grace period what'd you say thirty days I Believe\nAnd the camera takes your picture and says and send you a little message and you know you get it in the mail and it says listen we have your car\nOr in a photo going over the speed limit going over thirty one miles
