was a very good ranking for a debut on the list financial\nEngines is incredibly proud to be named to barons list of top independent investment advisors\nOr you know this is our first time on the list we debuted at number twelve that was out of forty firms that that barons ranked this year I interestingly enough barons expanded the list from thirty to forty spots this year and a lot of that was due to this just kind of incredible growth that we're seeing in the industry\nThere is another piece to the parents article that that has even more positive and optimistic news and that's because as parents put a private equity firm Helmand and Friedman bought financial engines for three billion dollars and moved to combine it with Edelman financial services\nAnd so that that's great news about

[noise] [laughter]\n\nOver nine million retirement accounts learn why we've earned this trust at investing sense dot com and now that's a financial engines investing shifts with Bob Richards a nationally recognized certified financial planner professional\nAndy Smith for just a couple of minutes away from this week's portfolio review first we have a question from family who's calling from Massachusetts\nAlso on my question is forty eight years old [noise] um my husband\nAnd I made their Seventeen thousand dollars a year I only have about eight thousand tonight thousand dollar when they brought IRA and that would like to know how much I Need to put away if they can't retire maybe when I looked at it like question\nOkay great question um so you know kind of the easy answer is I usually tell people save as much as you can for as long as you can\nAnd so we kind of on top of that then you said All right so if you're forty eight you want to work until you're Seventy you've got about twenty two years and so that's a good amount of time\nTo get a fair amount of money or you know socked away or inside the Ross IRA here's what you can keep in mind so with your Ross IRA\nUm and then you know the same could go for your husband as well so with your author raise each of you can contribute up to fifty five hundred dollars a year\nBefore your age fifth book maybe before you turn fifty so you're forty eight how old is your husband\nMatt ... thirty six\nOkay so each of you can contribute fifty five hundred dollars a year now once you turn fifty you can actually save you can save an additional thousand so you can save sixty five hundred dollars a year\nWhen we know when you're fifty so here in a couple of years you can start saving sixty five hundred so what I Would do is just kind of have in your mind you know for these next however many years however long you're working you plan on saving fifty five hundred dollars a year before age fifty\nAnd then sixty five hundred dollars a year for that twenty year period of time between age fifty in Seventy now when you when you retire so you want to work until you're Seventy the other thing I Want\nTo do that but at this point a choice because I thought\nOkay you know and I would say that you know I'm you've you've got the savings you're going to be working one of the things that we've found that that is most helpful for people's um you know to to find help them find success with their retirement is just working longer\nSo the fact that you want to work until I Seventy yeah might not be the thing that you thought was going to be the best thing in the whole world but it really is going to help you because the longer you work\nThe the less you have to pull from your investments uh you don't have to claim Social Security or you know for a you know for anything for that so when you retire at Seventy you're going to have Social Security and then you're going to have your investments to live off of\nUm do you have any debt right now I\nKnow I pay off all my that\nPerfect alright so no debt um any other short term cash need that you see here in the next twelve to twenty four months\nUm okay I I I don't want to buy a house because I'm going to face fits the fucking run it a try now okay so I feel like I used to own a house before my luggage which go find it out a lot of fucking run it out as a mortgage okay\nI'm I'm putting money away for about a month for\nOur perfect perfect and if you're paying you know fourteen Fifteen hundred dollars a month in rent now the mortgage earlier was less than that you you can that's just budgeting um when that when that comes into play and so really what I Would have you do right now is you know for twenty two years\nOr however long it is you know that you're going to be a working you know plan on saving that fifty five hundred bucks we're sixty five hundred bucks into that Ross IRA now or do you have access to email\nI go okay um when you are in a position to send me some more information about the Ross I can put some more ideas into an email for you just send me an email to ask\nAndy at investing sense dot com but the the things that take away

com\nAnd this week's portfolio which sent to us from Henry and Henry writes I all of my retirement money at the bank in an IRA CD I'm sixty eight and a half\nAnd still working and I don't have any plans to retire I've been collecting Social Security for a few years and I just put the money in savings even if I wasn't working I could be about the same financially what if any other suggestions would you have for me\nWell I'm first of all I'm really glad that you reached out here a Henry we talk a lot about risk on investing sense and a lotta times it's from the perspective of a the potential of losing my time\nBut you might actually be exposing your heart and savings to some overlooked risks are namely longevity and inflation K but set set those aside here for for a moment I think what this comes down to is that you might not be taking enough risk with these with the savings\nWill Henry wrote that he's sixty eight and still working and then said I don't have any plans to retire that's a lot different than the other sixty eight year old and it sounds like that those are a couple of signs that he may be in good health and and could live for a good while longer\nRight so and he sounds like a hardworking guy right or you know so Henry I might actually have you think about getting your money to work a little bit harder for you\nA you've got these dual income sources sounds like you're in a pretty good financial position um you know I might have you consider a portfolio that's a little bit more balanced right fifty percent stock fifty percent bond because\nYou know you're you're not taking any risk with your ear you think that you're not taking any risk with your savings which are forgetting about inflation and how those could eat into your CD returns so then all of a sudden there's this solid risk that your CD returns\nSeems that with the economy is strong or weak with the president was popular or unpopular with tends to happen\nIs whatever party does not control the White House makes begins in the house and Senate okay and that appears to be a pattern that is just part of the American soul and or maybe it's part of the human soul except the American system so unique but the\nSo we see it here but for most people politics is like the Olympics were were you get interested in sports once every four years right or at least you get interested in things like gymnastics lots of [noise]\nSo the uh the people who will get interested in it just two years later yeah or the people who are really angry about the way it turned out to ... years ago okay and this time around that Democrats for years ago it was a Republican\nWon one more question before we leave you know one of the ... most interesting things that you wrote about the China us negotiation is something that I mean is is completely unique I haven't seen it anywhere else but it makes total sense\nYou said one of the biggest concerns is what happens from a social construct with China if they continue to push or if they pushing the wrong ways as ... as negotiations continue um you know especially as it relates to any sort of pressure\nThat China would bring to bear on foreign businesses doing business in China ... remind listeners what you were talking about because this is so important and when I share it with people you see the light bulb go on and it's just like of course the I mean they do not want to risk is what is the social risk\nThat China faces that the U.S does not as we continue to move through these trade negotiations\nThe problem a couple of different dimensions all working together against China one is that the modern China or the tried and out of subsistence farms in rural poverty but of glittering cities are full of\nWorking class people it's never experienced a recession so it's ... we do not know how the Chinese population will react under\nAnything but full employment of the highest unemployment rate to try and experience the last twenty five years for quake three percent in this country we consider for three percent a boom you know they they call that\nThings are going to walk but what would happen if they got six Seventy seven percent you know now you would have and this is across the very very large population so he's percentage point ... represents many more millions of people that it does here\nUh if China is a police state you know where a you've got to you know disarmed sheep like public being monitored at every street corner by cameras artificial fucking recognition software [noise] so the problem with all policed states\nIs a problem of leverage and suffered actual originally or rather its its political leverage by which I mean in any prison police environment you've got hundreds and hundreds of people\nThat wanna guard yeah that one guard has one got that one has poker just and one of the ... and that's it and so if something goes terribly terribly wrong\nOr you got what happened to the Soviet Union to any of that where a couple of people for the Berlin Wall for some reason the atmosphere was such that\nThey made the decision about the machine gunned them and then the next twenty five people ran across the wall and then six weeks later the evil empire of the Soviet Union had broken up into that two separate countries right six weeks later and nobody\nThat all the great the good the wives of Henry Kissinger is of the world have predicted\nThings like that and it just happened to six weeks and so\nWhat could happen in a nation of one point four billion people where you've got you know half of them on minimum wage living in cities have I'm Still in subsistence farmers are there enough right believes\nThat is president Xi Jinping's but that's where the pressure\nThat was

now\nIs bailing dupont and bailing a welcome to the broadcast good to have you\nOn a ... you were you where do you go to school\nI got caught dumber and stuff\nSo you're at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee what are you taking up a newspaper article and how how far into the program Ari this point I must stop more a sophomore so you finish your first year political science how do you like it so far\nI really really well and and what do you want to do after you graduate from Belmont\nI Want to go to law school oh every night for the kind that made me think of it\nExcellent well let's say that's a high calling and it's a good to have you on the show now I've got to ask you some qualifying questions are you have you have you heard of a state\nCalled Rhode Island [noise] yeah okay good All right now the next question is have you ever been to Rhode Island I have never had I have not been to Rhode Island okay um are you related to anybody from Rhode Island yeah\nOkay good All right so I'm going to give you a fact pattern or and using your political science hat I just want you to go ahead and make a prediction based on the fact pattern the negative view\nOf a who you think would win this governors' races ... three way race okay so here's the first one candidate hey we'll call her Gina\nA she's a Democrat she's an income and finishing her first term now she's had some missteps but in public polls is never pull lower than forty percent nor higher than forty three percent\nShe's often touted the national press as a rising star in the Democratic party she's an incredibly prolific fundraiser has raised more than six million dollars for the race and has about two million dollars on hand for the final stretch a she wanted her party's primary with fifty seven point two percent of the vote that candidate a\nCandidate B. we'll call him Allen\nAllen is a Republican mayor of Rhode Island's second largest city Cranston Rhode Island his polling numbers in public schools have been relatively stagnant polling in about thirty eight percent\nHe tells the success as mayor of Cranston his grandson was voted one of the best places in America to live in national surveys he has about one million on hand for the final push Allen won his primary was fifty six point four percent of a much much smaller Rhode\nIsland electric and now we'll bringing candidates the\nKennedys people call him a I don't know Joe\nJoe is a Republican turned independent\nJoe was a state representative Republican state representative having served eight terms in Rhode Island house as a Republican from Rhode Island's third largest city ... he's also he's also a former army and see National Committee men in published polls he was Eighteen percent in the spring recent polls have him anywhere from seven to Seventeen percent\nEach cell funding has spent approximately forty thousand dollars so far\nUh recently he announced endorsements from Kennedy the that's the guy on the other Republican primary opponent or who garnered forty percent in the Republican primary now just to give you some context\nRhode Island's an overwhelmingly blue democratic state house has about Seventy five members roughly ten Republicans the Senate the Rhode Island Senate has thirty eight members roughly six Republicans\nAnd it's a one media markets day which means one million dollars is basically all you need to be wall to wall on radio and television so based on that fact pattern\nWho do you think has the edge candidate a the Democrat incumbent Gina Kennedy be the Republican mayor of Cranston or Kennedy's seat Joe the um the Republican turned independent\nI Would say that I got back and I\nI I Would think you are right and and your base that on what\nUm I mean\nI think that it over all the running against them\nAnd they get at your at work all may find that a big factor race it so I I mean that many of your on how low approval rating on active at stake\nLA it actually has a pretty good chance of winning\nWill bail and I want to thank you very much I think you've got a great future ahead of you in a police say Hi to everyone at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee and I want to thank you for being on the John ...\nFor having me\nAble to do pot ladies and gentlemen she was ... a political science sophomore and she was able to do pretty quickly call this race you didn't agonize over it\nShe pretty quickly called figured out who's gonna win and and it's not hard to do as I've said before I'm coming up a little bit later in the broadcast I Want to share with you I did a little homework and one of the nice things about having a weekend shows you get all week the homework there were two polls that recently came out and I want to get you up to speed on one of them was conducted by the University of New Hampshire survey center and it was done for\nA pro Joe Providence Journal NPR in a little known fact there's actually three television stations in Rhode Island everyone knows and as well but there's a third one called channel six they were involved\nIn the polls well er and also the folks over Doug local proud that poll headed della Volpe people\nA ... a big way to get a Harvard University I think one of the the big Ivy League schools up there in Boston so um I've got the poll results from that\nAnd when I was able to do was I tried to normalize the to poll results are so basically what I did was I took the sample size from each poll\nI'm In the ... local poll it was five hundred and two are likely voters and the pro Joe poll it was five hundred sixty one local voters so I normalize those two and then I note to basically backed out how many\nResponses each candidate got and then re did the math\nAnd I'll share with you the results of that and I think it's pretty accurate because now you're looking at a much larger sample size you're looking at over a thousand or and even for some sampling bias from the uh the UNH poll um I don't think that's going to be a big factor as I pull it together for you so we'll talk about that as well uh but you know I just I just had to illustrate the point\nThat someone who's never been to Rhode Island\nWho's a sophomore political science student can accurately predict what's going to do this election it's not hard it really is not hard it is what I've been saying all along or but I wanted to share with you those poll results because I think you'll find them fascinating\nUm and I think it gives a much more accurate snapshot of exactly where we are in terms of of this election um and and it's it's interesting there is still a path to victory or for Alan fun although that path is not great right at this point\nI'm and I'm well let me just give you the numbers and you can kind of digest and before we go to break 'em I what I did again I normalized the ... so I basically didn't you know way I factored in the the sample size a and read it the math and I came out with Gina Raimondo at forty four point one\nWhich is roughly consistent with what I've been saying all along that she's kind of kept it that forty one to forty four percent I'm Alan fungus thirty two point nine ... at ten point seven but this is big undecided or other Thirteen point one so undecided or others actually polling better\nThan Joe ... when you normalize the polls\nI'm In that Thirteen point one percent\nThat's a significant amount of votes are and if those those votes break for the governor um she could be about fifty percent of those votes break for Alan fun he's still loses [laughter] because they're ... or so it's really not hard to see more three eight nine seven seven six eight hundred three two one WPRI oh you\nAre listening to the gym often radio broadcast right here I knew
