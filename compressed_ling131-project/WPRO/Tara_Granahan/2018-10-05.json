C. Y. F. look bad don't make you know\nThe fact is an inspector general has to be totally independent and have the right to look into a house state money is used or abused\nAnd cannot have political interference\nWell that leads me to uh and and I didn't I understand what you're saying you're going to have the conversations if in fact that that that it's warranted but yesterday jokes are low and represented Morgan were saying that Alan song is flawed he's corrupt\nAnd he's saying that they are the insiders until we get into all this name calling you did mention that you would have a concern about the ... and the police report with the police were called in do you think that Allen Fung is corrupt that's the word they're using\nI Would need to examine that with him on my own I and I would most certainly cause I'm the really obviously with that report I read it when it first came out\nAs well as obviously as being a reference now but I Would want to go over with a chapter and verse to say this is what the conclusions are and I still have excellent relationships with X date policemen by the way and then and I would certainly get a their insights as well as to what did it didn't\nTo that conclusion I as you know a form of a a head of the state police or Mr ... not miss a diary a O'Donnell yes sort of a downplayed that a little bit saying that might have been the writers conclusion he wouldn't go that far\nYou know is to say uh uh that uh it was run by the mafia that was the statement that he uh always mafia like in the way you know ... the office\nOf chief and the department was being run so I I obviously we'd want that kind of input but it is a warning sign tower I mean you know when when for example government is not trees parent and\nThe media has to jump through hoops to get records that they're entitled to have all of that of warning signs and uh as opposed to with a Morgan ... from my perspective they've always been forthcoming\nAnd transparent and their dealings in politics\nIf you had to make a prediction and you were with me or my goodness during the whole Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump we were here on election night now all hours of the night with the blaming as well and you called it you were going state by state saying if this turns for ... and you were going down the map and I thought oh my goodness\nIf I could only follows her around you know be five minutes on a five minute delay [laughter]\nWe could be calling the shots here how do you see this governor's race she was going to have an awful lot to be governor ...\nWell I as you know when you're a ... or an incumbent and you have tons of money you're really hot to tip over so the starting point it becomes a herculean task for any of the opponents to a unseat the present incumbent who has lots of money so that's the issue number one but\nAnything can happen is you know there's a headline today about DC YIF\nAnd a bad report that the feds gave it yeah of course the context of all of that is\nEvery stage D.C why you have to have problems or that has been some progress at least made in the last couple of years it usually takes five to seven years according to most experts but people don't see that you know the detail they just go by what the headlines are so and the race like this absolutely anything can happen but\nHaving said all of that it's hard to unseat a well financed incumbent\nEileen violent is on the line Arlene I Love to pick your brain if I could if you could hold on to the break I have one question and I wonder if you wanted to weigh in

you\nHey good morning or how are you doing\nI'm doing quite well you heard and I'm sure you heard of you had your own event yesterday talking about that and just a moment and want to get some details on that I'm Joe ... pulled you corrupt and has yet to come out and say ah how is he going to back that up what is your take on that\nShows a blowhard we heard him you know at the debate are making similar allegations that are uncorroborated or the one thing that we all know is that\nAll your listeners ah know that he can't win you know the real question that people have to ask what yesterday's announcement which by the way was off from any game changer because you know we've been through this all along and endorsements don't\nMatter what really matters is making sure that we get our message out about the corruption that is really happening up at that state house and we don't need any more state house insiders uh like Joe trail oh like Patricia Morgan cutting deals\nWith our governor no one really has to question you know what is Joe what is Patricia really getting out of it you know what the hell did he end she caught with Governor Mondo because we've seen historically because those to walk the state also for over two decades now them even supporting the governor on her\nPass budgets with a millions in corporate welfare and expanding our sales tax\nAnd you use ... a marathon here's the thing\nOr if it's your turn will continue to say he's corrupt without backing it up then I think the theory is if I keep saying it over and over again maybe people will start to believe me if you keep saying there's a deal with Governor Romano you're kind of doing the same thing right off I keep saying it over and over but we really don't know if there was a deal people may start to believe me do you see why people are getting frustrated\nPeople are getting frustrated because of what's going on on Smith pill for years and that's what Joe trail and Patricia Morgan represents\nYou know and like I said endorsements don't matter what really matters is the people that have been hurt by governor Raimondo a them\nYou know kids that are still waiting for the benefits families still waiting for 'em you know their food stamps and the like uh what people you know seniors waiting for nursing home benefits or because of you hit disaster\nYou know we've seen the um\nAnd and again

out there I think you're going to say it than a why hold back from the voters right my it makes you feel like it it's just a it's a it's a big pile of mud being thrown but if you can't back it up you

get into it a little bit if we if we can thanks and I appreciate it moves in and hung up at the same time we are so good by um I also don't appreciate the coy weird kind of odd back and forth that happened\nUm with Patricia Morgan when Jim was asking her I Will tell us about the phone call and the endorsement I think most of us know that after a primary or after an election the person that I'm\nLoses tends to I think it's expected that they call the winner and say a congratulations and whether or not they're going to endorse them and there's this whole back and forth of who did what phone call it who texted whom and it was it was a disingenuous let me just say that\nIf you're not going to tell us what happened ... what's the game here what game are we planning a represented Patricia Morgan was saying well you know it's a private conversation will ... since when\nAn al ... and he said no I I called her\nAnd I left a message and I had people in the room and I said I'd appreciate you support I texted her she didn't get back to me she's saying they had some conversation and it didn't go well so you know well let's not stretch the facts to make it sound like this
