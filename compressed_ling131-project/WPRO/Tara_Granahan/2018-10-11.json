FBI says it's a rage mince its agents that he was arrested gray at his home there's no word when he'll be four led before judge where exactly that'll happen back in September of twenty Seventeen Herald News\nSchool age children ... but I remember very well even when the bus was late it screwed you up to the whole day right and then everything kind of is a domino effect but this is much more serious so if the two sides don't reach an agreement by friday mayor ... says we'll look at other options do we know what they are well\nThat's the challenge so in in the ... knowledge this yesterday in his press conference um they can look at other options they have looked at other options in the past there was a reason why they continue to pick the same company over and over and over for now well over a decade\nUh in fact could be much longer than that\nUm this company is sort of a I Believe a mayor used in a debate the other night he used the term monopoly I'm not in a negative contacts in the sense that this is the company that owns ... buses that has a bus yard in Providence which is a key factor for the city\nUm and as the relationship or the the the national relationship with the Teamsters um and so while they're currently\nIn a position of a you know in a in a labor dispute um it it seems uh it would seem surprising that the Teamsters might go elsewhere in fact I think the one of the\nUh had guys at the union said that they'd prefer to remain in a relationship with first student ah assuming a deal done so\nThat the challenge here is the city wants to apply pressure\nUm but everyone on all sides kind of knows that it's going to be very difficult to actually find a new provider\nYeah well in and that is a monopoly\nSo there's no other company that can actually service the district um then then they're at a total impact correct\nThat that's right now again the thing is is that there's always some way to find a new a new way to do this I mean in theory you could maybe hire multiple companies to service the district but you think about it there are nine thousand kids they're taking school you know school buses to school every day uh\nIt's very difficult to to manage multiple companies to do it I mean the city doesn't always do a great job managing one company with it so um there are a lot of logistical issues now\nI Do think and you set off the top the mayor is is attempting to ah to hold the to the fire uh he's right when he says there's not a lot he can do when it comes to the dispute specifically between the union and the company and so this is one way of again applying pressure\nBut I'm I'm a bit skeptical that\nAnything I'm Serious will will happen is certainly not in the in the short term [noise]\nSo you've got the mayor saying okay we need we need to fix this ASAP he's a little bit late to the party but that's OK well taken Nick ... who I had on gosh I think almost two weeks ago he is um the board chair the chairman of the board but I tried to ...\nOn he was one of the ones I thought who was pretty vocal about it and it was at least making noise and stepping up and saying something and then you've also got the city council president David Salvatore up\nWho he's been around as well he's he's not shy to speak up as well so so really are they pulling together or they all kind of a you know listen everybody likes their position in life where they are they're if they're actually a an elected official are they doing it for show or can they actually do something no because it's a private company\nRight I think it's very difficult I Will say again I mean there is one of the things that when people talk about uh you know\nThe mayor or the city council the school board need to show leadership\nThis would be an example applying pressure suggesting you will find somebody else in and I'm ... and going in that direction taking steps to at least try to find some you know another company but behind the scenes everybody's crossing their fingers that district gets resolved in it all goes away\nAll right so deadline tomorrow for the best of your knowledge than because we're hearing now from parents they are just so frustrated obviously they can't afford to do some kind of a private transportation they need the staff it's not just the physical bus\nThe people that are running these buses that deal with the children with special needs are equipped to handle children with their equipment absolutely if they have a wheelchair and I have a crunch is if they have it's not just oh we'll put them on the ripped a boss right doesn't work that way the ripped a bus drivers I'm sure they're wonderful people but they're not\nTrained to handle these particular children that are\nThat's right and and there are I mean the dozen people may not necessarily believe this or or maybe a little bit surprising but it makes sense if you think about it the bus drivers go through you\nKnow pretty serious background checks they go through training 'cause it's not like just oh let's hire anybody and and have them take our kids to school there are pretty strenuous kind of restrictions that have to happen\nThat are making this move forward or make you know a person can actually bring a student to school so there's a lot of again I think logistical problems um that that come from this and obviously it it really really puts a huge strain on families all across the city\nAnd as we have been saying um private company union drivers you know they they can't seem to make it work I was a little taken aback by the governors\nAh you know nope can't can't interfere and we've heard that before I don't want to put you are really on the spot here but is there a role of potential role for the governor except to just try to put a little pressure I mean she can't get in she couldn't get in there and negotiate but it would be the same as mayor lawyers are trying to yeah right\nI mean I think the one thing she could do as the governor of the state is is similar to ... but maybe with a little more to say\nYou know what will help the city find another option and even if even if the threat is maybe partially empty\nOr or difficult if the if the governor of Rhode Island said that that would be on the front page of the newspaper that would be leading your show and then people would hear that and that pressure would would come so there is that ability um I I Do think she I I'm sure she was being you know\nA updated on the situation or release her staff is and I'm sure they're kind of encouraging the city to to to also show little old\nUm but yeah I mean that's something she could do but no she there's nothing she can do no law that she can pass that says that ah you know that that everyone has to come to the table on this\nExactly right and if you can hold on just a couple of more minutes I Want to talk about you moderated that debate the other night between the Providence mayoral candidates stand McGahn was the moderator and it got a little feisty at times and I don't I don't think you get enough attention so I Want to talk to damage down about that right uh when we come back

look around the thousand cities or Rhode Island\nAnd uh I just got back from literally they got the same problems there the same problems we have here the evidently\nWell I I I'm not too familiar Joe

being harmed because we're a student\nOr it refuses to contribute\nTo the punch a button they use the fact that the pension fund is is a a function of dwindling because things like this has been going on since the eighties when President Reagan broke the traffic control which companies are are a lot of the pension fund to give their employees\nA four O. one case because it cost them less\nAnd because they have this uh this desire to proactively break unions because we've been hearing nothing about ... what ... years that unions as somehow being a society that is a difference between the white the union at a public you write a queen unions are not\nAlways end up ... percent of people but as far as ... goes this is an organization that shows purpose is to break this union because otherwise they would have gladly just said to end a strike and the best interest of the ...\nOne we will contribute to the dollar that we were going to give you a pay raise the pension fund because from there when it really short of that with the way they spend the money doesn't of I mean or did it it doesn't matter\nOn to the bottom line for them to try to just pick this moral I ... that they're protecting their workers\nThat protecting the current work but I'm of the mind that they're there and actually arm and members of the GMC going in that have already retired or on the roads are we've gotten a bite questioning the contributions to the heart so they're opening themselves up the lawsuits from former ...\nWell well I'm not being represented in this ah\nGo ... at all and that's wrong that's similar to what happened with the with the credit union crisis when when when someone close to credit unions and those are the opposite as well but without representation but still we decided to do something about it a shot you know this is not going to end with first student just said\nBush and we're not going to give you any of that money for the pension fund because it's not that you're in trouble good story or the fact that the federal government sucked in nose in and the image that pension fund Baltimore the eighties and nineties you know nobody's talking about that much money they added up a local to be one morning when a bunch of them\nUnderstood ah it's I Know this is ... there's a lot of volunteer and again it is a private company they have to they have to

plan and I know a big part of it is the UPS company but also uh the company wants to say no that's that's in the past you you're going into a four O. one K. and they didn't want that to a meeting the union so I I Know it's um\n[noise] my my take on this today though because we don't know what's going on with the inside negotiations is um I think there was a call for the governor to say something and say anything at this point you know it's just going to have and that song they'll say anything and she didn't and and you're going to interfere intervene nope not no way and that was a a\nQuick response from the governor nope not doing it three weeks to the to the election not doing it you're not going to see me plus one with the unions are getting involved just let me get to that let me get you to the polls because ah I think she's fairly confident she's going to win this thing\nAnd um there's no no problem no troubles for those handicapped children well their parents are standing
