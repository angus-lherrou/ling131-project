conservative I Am in a data that well maybe we shouldn't call them independent Bob anymore but he still proclaims all the time that he's an independent right\nAnd when he called me be called me yesterday and and just said you could just he was so intense he said how could I ever vote for democratic get so how can I both for\nAny party that tells me women are always right at the white men are always wrong ... right he said white men aren't always right\nAnd the women are not are going to be white men are always wrong white men are always right oh women aren't always wrong women aren't only write your aren't always right you've\nTo take it on a case\nCase basis you said I Know that he said everybody knows it and he's but he told me he said but I couldn't change anybody's mind on this because he was involved in a ton of social media debates and he\nIt was you know talking about his friends on the left that would stick to some of the new ... point that it wouldn't even matter and I told him I said well look\nThe point I'm looking at is not trying to convince them 'cause you're never going to convince them what you're trying to do is convince the the middle trying to convince people like you and I told him I said I remember you twelve Thirteen Years ago\nYour look right now is completely completely different\nOr another family member of mine who was who was always more conservative but always said well it's good to have the Democrats are it's good to have the Democrats are it's good to have the Democrats there or was in a conversation with them over the weekend\nAnd I explained I said well you know what the Democrats did here as soon as I said that they just started going off and just said I Can't believe that I Can't believe they've gone to this to this point and it's the mainstream\nOf the Democrats it's not summer Iran and and he told me he said you know I always I always like it that you know I agree mostly with the Republicans but it's always good to have an opposition party there but he said what good is that opposition party\nIs it 'cause you know the Republicans don't always do the right thing it's sudden sometimes they need to be kept in check he sort of who keeps them and check\nThe Democrats ...\n... the mainstream of the Democrats have gone crazy and I think that is the key here so when I looked at a\nCouple of weeks from now for weeks from now and and the election uh\nI look at history and history shows the vast majority of times when you get to this point and you've got a Republican president you've got a Republican House you've got to Republican Senate in all likelihood the Republicans should Lucy yeah uh that's\nWhat history shows it's almost the same as when people call this up and and the one gentleman limber forget you remember the call to about a month before the election of ... said you guys going to be surprised when Trump wins and said no we're not because history shows he should win based on the economy\nBecause the economy actually has been so bad and people have felt it and they view that there's a need for change so\nYou look at history and you think yeah now the Democrats should take now should they take enough seats to actually take over the house I don't know but then you see the big huge on oh and that is the Kavanaugh nomination I have\nI I still can't come up in my mind when the Republicans have been so United\nThe only thing that comes to my mind is Nineteen Ninety four\nUh I'd only been and talk radio for five years\nAnd I remember Ninety four caught everybody off guard except for ... members oddly had death threats as a result we became a poster yeah he ... he he came closest to to catching what was actually happening now that was a United GOP at that point [laughter] just nobody knew that they were United [laughter]\nRight off to all go out go out and vote and were motivated at that point\nI had not seen\nA Republican Party that was as fractured as this Republican Party has bent\nAnd with in a period of two weeks is a completely United party not because they love the leader or necessarily of the the party who would be the president not because they all of them a majority do\nBut\nIt it it's because they had seen what the other party is\nAnd they look at the guy that they hated just a little while ago and said you know something he's really not that bad I I I Wish you wouldn't say this I Wish you wouldn't tweak this but these people when you see what they actually want you know they called Trump a fascist and\nAt times I didn't like it because I times I I'm speaking for me I'm speaking for never Trump hers you know ... ... per se but you know he he talks authoritarian but even if he isn't and sometimes he sounds intolerant even if even if he isn't well then you see what the Democrats do when you say well actually this is what they mean\nRight there is no nuance nuanced opinions here to what they mean they don't believe in due process they don't believe in a presumption of innocence they stereotype they say what you know and they stereotype to fit their particular narrative at the moment and we'll change a day later\nYeah it it's ... if you look at the I I think um where the Republicans have come together over two weeks over the last couple of weeks it's not even just the Kavanaugh nomination ended up itself or\nProtecting the process\nDuring the Supreme Court nomination even\nIt's not just Lindsey Graham and no and and and the things he said I mean part of it a ... it's it's all of those and more it is but the bigger picture is including by the way ... you know and and her speech which got a lot of praise on on friday\nBut it really is you know the fact that I it it seems as if the party are saying yeah it's time to build a wall\nTo wall\nAround the party and what it really ... and four and a wall around the constitution to protect it each time that the party joined hands here and not that everybody has to agree on everything\nBut there there has to be a greater respect and I think campaigning to go out and show what the and demonstrate clearly over and over again what the what the other side is doing\nAnd saying look we can all have our discussions on those issues within our house\nBut on the outside you need to know where the danger lies to you every single day and it is from this kind of behavior\nYou know the interesting thing is for all the accusations of being a fascist an authoritarian that have been leveled at Trump\nThen maybe some never Trump ... bought into ... a majority of Republicans ridiculous because he wasn't if you see if you see what he's about if you see the things that he loves if you see the legislation that he's put into effect if you see his executive orders\nAnd what comes out of the White House about separation of powers in what they believe you know that's not true but I think that what and I think you're right on here this wasn't just about the nomination it was the belief\nThat the Democrats\nTruly are and it really hit when he realized it was the main stream it was those in the Senate Judiciary committee it is what is viewed as the leadership of the Democratic party that the mindset of authoritarianism and fascism that mindset that they were throwing a Trump\nActually belongs to their party and they've had I only get shredded officially here and I and I I think it is I think it has scared\nSome Republicans who didn't want to be a part of you know the uh of supporting the Republican Party I think it scared them straight right I really do I really I I actually I went whoa we well never thought they'd do this\nAnd and you know the last motivator that we could even come close the ... I guess in ... during the the uh the Trump presidency or to to pair allowing this was when Roy Moore last\nThey realize they need to get tax has done yeah you know they ... they weren't getting it done they weren't getting it done and it was well known where the ... and then all of a sudden right after Roy Moore's last they got it done\nWhat happened over the last couple of weeks should be a greater motivator on all legislative and procedural issues that and it should be for the foreseeable future\nBut that tax policy did not unite the actual party you know that their nose and it didn't it and I'm like what was\nEach year millions of Americans get sick from vaccine preventable diseases such as influenza causing them to miss work when you get sick\nHere children grandchildren and parents are also at risk the Centers for Disease Control and prevention recommends vaccinations from birth through adulthood to provide a lifetime of protection\nTo learn more visit women in government dot org\n... ...

take that you can say they want to paint judges they need to win the White House\nOr you have it I I mean that's the process but I think he spells out in that and and also on that day a week ago last

those purple states are over the next few weeks to remind people\nThat kind of campaigning has to be done not just leading up to the mid term but after the midterm and beyond the Republicans as we've
