evidence\nAnybody else who has been sexually abused we have tremendous compassion and sympathy for them but they have no credit no more credibility speaking on this particular issue on this particular case than anybody else\nIn our justice system the only thing that matters is evidence and in our justice system which is the criminal justice system it's also the civil justice system it's also one of the political justice system\nThe presumption of innocence and the presentation of evidence to back up an allegation\n\nIs required and there's a responsibility I Believe of every American to ensure that that is the way that the process is held up whether it's in the arena of political ideas that may not be the criminal justice system\nBut at the same responsibility that people have not been defame other people's character for their own immediate political one and the the some of the arguments that\nYou've heard what one of the younger and so I thought was the beauty\nWell are they um they they started with the Merrick Garland or because they they they they would nominate him so Republicans got what they deserved yeah excuse me this is something that has been talked about for a long time Chuck Schumer brought it up back when in two thousand nine ...\nWhen he said in an election year no and and and Bush or should they was a Bush no was\nIt was before two thousand I ah because it was it had to be during Bush is it'd be during Bush before two thousand nine but Schumer brought it up a during the Bush administration went and just just a ... in case one of the Supreme Court justices died said we should not be the the policy of the Senate\nTo nominate a a Supreme Court justice during the presidential election year right by the way the stink wasn't as big it was for a little bit and then people realize oh Hillary is going to kill Trump so we don't have to worry about it we'll just get it afterwards but delaying a nomination\nThat has been an idea that both Democrats and Republicans have been promoted for a couple of months to allow the next president who all the polls and all the Democrats thought would be Hillary Clinton\nIs not the same as deep fame mean a person's character\nBy calling them calling that\nPercentage a gang rapist a sexual assault tour without any evidence besides an allegation\nWhich the witnesses\nThat the people that brought those allegations about their witnesses could not cooperated and in the case of Dr Ford who claim she has the evidence that would cooperate if she refuses to give it\nTo the body that would make that decision which is the Senate Judiciary committee\nSo to make that case I mean that's probably the strongest argument which is a weak argument that I heard was well since\nThey held the Garland murder girl is will they deserved it when you mean that was done through the majority leader said you know we've got the majority\nMhm but ah we'll hold it even if we have the majority after the next president is a lot right irrespective of whether it's a Democrat or Republican that's the same as defame ing and destroying somebody's life right\nWith allegations that are not provable\nI didn't see any attacks on Merrick Garland\nNone and so\nEverything that you know every allegation that has been\nBrought up is suspect mhm\nUh because the witnesses that they brought forward could not cooperate it right the things that they said they changed the ... the the alleged victims claim changed as we went along\nAnd that's what we go by and our system whether it's the political whether it's political justice whether it's civil justice or whether it's criminal justice the presumption vivid evidence and the fact that an allegation and stop and think about it the protesters right now that you saw yesterday and you're going to see all day again today\nThat may get arrested again today and there may be you know the thousands more who knows\nThey're saying believe the survivors which means you always believe the accuser will do they believe that no we all know they don't know we all know that sort of August argument you believe the accuser if they're on our political side\nThis is a social media or approach now to ah to activists or activism it's exactly what you see on social media\nYou know we talked about the fact that real people don't live their lives like you know people are act on social media we talk about that a lot\nWell the people who are activists far left trolls and celebrities do they live in a virtual world will celebrities live in a virtual world that's what they do for\nA living anyway there immersed in it I mean if it is not for them that's nothing different you just live the fantasy and the family fantasies whatever it is whatever whatever you say it is because you have a blank canvass\nThat's exactly how they think that's how they act what you're seeing here is social social media type activism taken to the street that doesn't have to be backed up by anything I posted it therefore it's real I say it therefore it's true doesn't work\nThat way you know in the real world fright so overall when we look at the last two weeks and who knows what the vote will be this weekend I I I don't know I mean I haven't seen any a count yet um\nAnd I guess we we will see right and we will know when we come back in Sunday night Monday morning all I Know it was for the last two weeks of covering this uh there's not been an issue where there has been more passion\nSince the election but I have not seen this type of unity in the Republican Party and think about it think about what it would take I mean I I didn't think that you would see the unity in the Republican Party this soon\nAnd it's solid right now because I think they now see that\nWhatever their differences are with Donald Trump would ever ear or whatever irritate them about the the the president whatever they find unacceptable about the president and I'm Talking about

[noise]\n\nBono show [noise]\nThese are coming I'm Jerry magnum or eight six six Ninety or a red eye or we're just played a little bit of the Cory Booker thing and and ... calling him\nA senator Spartacus but the interesting thing is he is the one that came out the other day and said that it doesn't matter whether he's innocent or guilty that doesn't matter any more of the fact that there's so many questions which came from the allegations\nItself means that they should move on to an you know another right on another candidate a Alan Dershowitz responded to what Cory Booker said now Alan Dershowitz is a liberal\nBut he's an old school liberal\nYou don't you think about it we talked about the old school liberal Camille\nPaleo for example an old school or a ... you know liberal ... one of those who ... as as we did a few years ago said oh excuse me the whole transgender thing uh he left to better understand that if you do this\nYou're gonna have feminist soon you're going to be fighting feminist and the transgender activists\nBecause you can't have you can't have feminism if a man can be a woman right if a man can be a woman if anybody can be a woman just by saying man can be a woman by saying so feminism is doomed and you know she was one of the ones that first came out you know after after because we'd set of years ago but she also came out\nAnd and and stated that and so I really think that you know you look at the old school liberal she's one of them ... which is another one of the we may disagree on the role of a light like a John Adams and and Thomas Jefferson the role of the centralized federal government the debate that's been going on for over two hundred and forty years\nShould it be big should it be more encompassing or should it be smaller\nStill though that debate encompasses all the\nRight in the bill of rights and the constitution it doesn't rejecting say freedom of speech is gone ... Second Amendment rights\nAre are gone due process rights don't matter anymore a presumption of innocence doesn't matter because of our politics know the old school liberal didn't believe in a bigger centralized government\nBut they wanted they ... they even with the big central government they still want it especially the bill of rights was sacred to them and\nAnd it no longer is but here's church which talking about Cory Booker standing doesn't matter whether is innocent or whether he's guilty it's just so many allegations that he needs to step down here's a response\nTo you'd think professor that that's a fine sand it doesn't matter whether it's in a certain guilty he shouldn't just some\nWell it sounds very familiar when I was in college that's what they said about people who are accused of being communist yes as a matter of there and and the guilty if somebody is accused me of being a communist [laughter]\nAnd you angrily responded and said you're not then hey you don't have the temperament to have the job\nAnd it's just a job interview if you're getting fired for being a professor after forty years and what's the difference if you're innocent or guilty somebody said you're a communist this goes all the way back to the inquisition when they would call you in first and make you testify and then they present\nThe evidence look once you're accused the most heinous crime imaginable it turns into a trial where you have due process here where the burden of proof is on the other side where the evidence has to be clear and convincing in America we don't allow people to destroy other people's reputations in careers\nBased on it for instance guilt the way the ACLU now says he's he'll use as we should presumed guilt not presume\nMinutes after a hundred years to defending process us exactly what they're saying so you're a liberal you have lived her life in a liberal world [laughter] you go to Martha's Vineyard Tina liberals to them ever say look I don't agree with Kavanaugh hate prompts [noise] but I agree with you that to process is worth preserving other liberals who feel that way\nI found very very few of them for example today seven hundred law professors signed a letter to ask me to sign that I refuse I wrote a dissent saying he now no longer has the judicial temperament well can you imagine if this were a liberal who had been appointed by liberal president who's been accused and it would act and similarly\nI don't think a single one of those professors would have signed that letter they will fail the shoe on the other foot test\nSenator Booker why I like it no it's just dead wrong this is all about partisanship is the opposite was happening and if it was the Democrats who are putting up Kennedy everybody would behaving the opposite way and so it is partisanship and I think the framers of our constitution\nNever intended the confirmation process to look anything like hey great yeah\nI ... and ... and that's it I mean we we talk about the process you know if it's telling that\nWe're at this point and still at this point in fact heightened your you'll likely see the chaos heightened today and tomorrow up until the main vote on so late Saturday or early Sunday Morning whenever it happens\nBut we're at this point but it is all of this chaos before\nThe actual vote and what is it that that matters it's only about the vote I mean this is further proof that this was only about the delay delay it as long as you can in hopes an outside hope I guess that Kavanaugh would pull his own confirmation and\nWithdraw his own confirmation and or the president would do it um that wasn't going to happen or the once once the left got loud that wasn't going to happen but this president and and now we know very clearly it certainly isn't going to happen by the nominee himself but", "show_name": "America in the Morning with John Trout", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "07"}
