with the um the issues with them and they become black ... oh I actually do and in fact no black conservatives\nAre over twenty three percent which well the only girl\nSo the fact that that's not when they say that black conservatives don't quote me for the black community where I Believe that uh I can sit down with Kamala or Cory Booker and have a decent conversation about that\nYeah I I don't know if they'd be open to it by the way I don't think it's twenty three percent because it was the Democrats it'd be finished because they they pull in like Ninety Ninety One Ninety five percent depending on who it is so I don't think he's twenty three percent well was actually\nThere were actually there was a poll out just recently and said that it was over twenty\nOh really oh yeah yeah so

that different new will get on the different issues in the policy\nThat I Believe or for me it has nothing to do with any color and so I Believe\nSo you can have a conversation with them based on that\nYeah I think you'd be good enough to have a civil conversation but I don't think ... story Booker would be open to it and I don't think Kamala Harris be open to you have more faith in them that I Do but you know we'll leave we want it uh\nYeah well you're you know you want us to pick somebody yeah we thought that's running for president and both of them said Kamala Harris and\nCory Booker
