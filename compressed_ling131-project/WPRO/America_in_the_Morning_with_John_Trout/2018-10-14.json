I mean seriously that it was it wasn't one of those old my beer moment but if\nIf if you look at this entire week and you know just looking back at at this week before we had off on vacation that ... you know we started the beginning of the week and really it was the fact that the the the message from the whole Kavanaugh hearings if you believe in due process\nYou are a rapist enabler right if you believe that sue the mindset of due process that if you don't believe the allegation\nHow crazy doesn't unite talked about that over the last thirty forty fifty sixty years the number lawyer shows on TV starting with Perry Mason you know you go through ... like I'm probably missing a ton of them most one with William Shatner Boston Legal\nJust wrong you know the right and you know and then law and order for almost the last Thirty years and law and order everybody understands with people may not know the three branches of government they may not know the constitution they may not be able to\nTell you you know the freedoms you have in the first amendment all things that we are brought up\nThe last couple of months but it's part of our culture it's part you know ... ... innocent until proven or get guilty that\nEvidence decides that something that's even beyond what we're taught about the infrastructure of how the constitution works that's part of our popular culture it's in so many TV shows out\nThere over the last forty or fifty years and and I think they just that it was a huge mistake in calculation by the Democrats to believe that they couldn't sell that to the American people 'cause I guarantee you if you're a Democrat out here right now you know ... that that was a stupid move by that\nRight that if they want to go post cabinet posts cabin off but coming out with those statements that a woman is always to be believed\nEveryone knows is pure trash yes nobody is to always be believed just because of\nTheir demographic their gender or race whatever everybody knows it's the evidence but they actually tried to sell that to the American uh uh the people and you think about is just it's just it's nuts and then by the time we got to the middle of the week it was the Democrats promoting instability including the mainstream\nOf the the Democratic Party or like a Hillary Clinton or we saw Eric Holder come up and backtrack or everybody knows that's not what I meant [laughter] somebody wrote that don't use the word kick [laughter] and you know to you know where we are uh you know right now looking at the polls and seeing how they're all going to react\nAnd yeah and it is it and\nIt is also the wagging the finger toward people simply for believing in the process there they're being a indirectly condemned for doing so yes saying that you're essentially on a person's side and that you support what we allege he did\nYour it which goes against it and think about it\nI I think the perfect example the perfect imagery is the ACLU what they used to be a seal use as to what they had become today yes but the presumption of innocence means nothing nothing to the American civil liberties union anymore it shows used as something of course what Americans understand\nCalled now at one eight hundred eight eight five forty six forty six\nThat's one eight hundred eighty five forty six forty six or get started at ... dot com one eight hundred eight eight five forty six forty six so like quote\nWe shop you save\nGet full details on the example policy is liquid to accomplish commercials replace can vary depending on your health issue in company other factors not available and all states\nLed Jay kale engineering design and saw the carrier infinity system for your home or business today these scarier systems have the highest rebates in the market they are quite an energy efficient you could save over fifty percent on your energy bills just by having\nJay kale replace that old clunker Jay kale engineering also specializes in complete commercial rooftop systems from design\nTo the doctor worked insulation and service replacement so these units can be done in a matter of hours as well as a duckling split system called J.K out today for a free estimate there a factory\nAuthorized carrier and daddy and dealer for insulation in service license in Rhode Island and mass fans and approved national grid BP I installer plus financing is available Jay kale engineering your cooling heating and water purification experts\nI'm Tony Sanders from Jake am engineering give us a call today at Fort hole one tree five one\nSeventy six ... thank you finding it harder to talk to your friends between work and home as your stress level making new uncomfortable do you feel like your life is out of control has hurting yourself cross your mind\nDepression affects twelve million adult women each year that's worn out of every eight of us suicide is preventable and save dot org can help let's get you back where you want to be to learn more about suicide prevention visit S.
