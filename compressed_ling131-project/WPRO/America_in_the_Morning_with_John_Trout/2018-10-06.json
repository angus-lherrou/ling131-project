of lined up to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court with the key vote to Republicans Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Democrat Joe Manchin all deciding to approve the drug\nSusan Collins Republican from Maine widely viewed as a critical out in the cabinet nominations came to the Senate floor and said allegations of sexual assault against him fail to meet what she called the more likely than not stand it\nI Do not believe that the charges can scare the PR bad judge cabin\nOr friend surfing on the core Republicans now appear to have at least the razor thin majority they will need to confirm judge Kavanaugh when the first Santa caster final vote Lindy can young washing\nCat a federal judge blocked the Trump Administration replacing conditions on public safety grants to further which crack down on illegal immigration the judge also winner of the grant money be released the California sanctuary cities\nWaited until after the other background checks well we're\n... its own over the last couple of days that we have found out how the whole background check works with the Senate because of course it's something that we've never focused on before I\nWhat I've been surprised that the Republicans you know they came out and said that you know they didn't follow the protocol but they didn't fully explain it because when you fully explain it as you just did Eric when you when people understand that look there was a process\nThat ... they that Dianne Feinstein could have followed yes that would have always kept because the claim\nFrom Dr Ford is well she just wanted to get a known and then you can do an investigation to find out if you find anything on it but I wanted to remain anonymous right well she could have actually got what she claimed she won it is very important for I\nThink everybody to understand that there was a process to keep her name private and have the FBI do a background check to see if any of this was true without her name\nEver be known\nAnd Dianne Feinstein really said excuse my language to hell with that we're going to use is a politically\nAnd knowing that linking it would make it public\nShe's still quaint today she didn't want to come forward right she's still claims that ... that today so if that was the case and I don't know whether that was the case I'm just looking at the different scenarios mhm but if that was the case it was the Democrats\nThat be trade who they thought was a victim\nOf sexual abuse they train her which is why we said they didn't care about her claim they never cared about her claim because if they truly cared about her claim and her wanting to keep it secret to keep her anonymity\nIt could have followed the process that existed that they helped create with the Democrat majority in two thousand nine left to have a process yet for somebody to come forward keep their you know keep it quiet\nStill have a part of the confirmation process and and a part of the judgment of\nWhy you would or would not want to confirm or the particular nominee\nBut Feinstein and the Democrats know that the only way to change those you know they were getting down to four or five votes that's what this is all about to change any of those votes as the political pressure and the political pressure is built in the media\nAnd so you can't do it officially finance or Dianne Feinstein knew there was no way of doing this officially because it would never get to the media because Senate rules prohibited from getting to the media now we know why Lindsey Graham was so living\nLast Thursday a week ago today\nThis is what he was talking about\nViolating the process and the rule circumventing those rules and processes along the way this is what he was getting too because that now the puzzle comes together\nFeinstein new by submitting this to the FBI early on as soon as she got it\nIt being part of the background check it wouldn't have seen the light of day Dr Ford named would not be known to anyone butter friends colleagues and family because that claim\nWould not have still would not be substantiated because they even with all of this they haven't substantiated anything except for the fact that she's making the claim\nAnd that means it wouldn't have left the Senate ah\nAt all because it would have been apart as the rural states of that three oh to report and they cannot divulge any of the details from that report again keep in mind if there's a criminal case against a nominee well that's public\nThe people versus whoever that's public that would be no\nBut there\nBut that's it's not the case when it's just a client when someone's making a claim and there was no report or authorities involved in that claim at the time so it's very clear why the Democrats chose this route\nNow and didn't didn't want to go forward on the thirtieth you wait until after the vetting process the background checks are complete\nAnd then you linked to the media and let the media help you hopefully\nBuild that public pressure that political pressure to drive\nThat those four or five votes in the Senate that were on the fence\nAnd now uh like I said today is going to be an interesting day I I wanted to leave earlier I said are just just do two hours the shown repeated the rest of the day so I go home and go to sleep and wake up at seven o'clock because I won't just because I I I Am\nAbsolutely are as interested as you could possibly be in wondering how the Democrats are going to try to solve this\nAnother week ... what are they thinking does you know they are you know there are ... are they are we got to be able to solve this in some way and so we know that we're going to hear the typical\nThings like well we didn't have enough time to actually look at this report a twenty four hours a isn't a is isn't a enough enough time well okay we believe that there's cause some cooperation here we disagree with the Republicans and we don't we believe further investigation is needed knowing that the Republicans\nAt\nThis moment are not going to break the protocol and the rules that the Democrats created in two thousand nine up all the irony or and and so I you know I don't know where that will do but I'm sure the Republicans have already said\nThey've had to look at and say okay what different scenarios are out there when once released system I mean they know now the Democrats are going to the Democrats and Republicans\nBoth no you know what's in it and if the Republicans say look there's nothing here it's the same as it was last week we're going ahead with the vote I think that no matter what the Democrats say they should go on with the vote\nAnd even if he isn't confirmed then you make it an election issue delaying this another week is not going to change anything and we all know right now you you you did it once you go forward with it you have the votes Saturday if you don't have the votes than you make it an election issue\nInternally no doubt the pressure is going to be on those uh four or five people including mansion or you know flake or who was shown you know clearly a weakness and uh what they were ... ... what what what they'll tell you on the left the ability to be thoughtful or consider it\nBut [laughter] uh\nI'm Sorry that was fun I Know I'm the but the but that's what will happen internally externally it will be about building the political pressure still in that and this is the narrative this will be the narrative\nFrom here until we did not have enough time there was not enough time the FBI did an interview enough people there's no way that could possibly know because they didn't even\nInterview Kavanaugh or Ford well they have both of them on record as a matter of public record as to their claims each of them so\nAll of that is a you know is is the political part of it um but you're right Gary I think in terms of now going forward are you the the the motion to invoke cloture was made yesterday\nOr the cloture vote will happen friday a\nThan they will er and if if they've got the headcount then they're going to move forward with a vote which can happen as early as Saturday I suspect they will not want to waste one minute ah in in terms of getting in Saturday and getting that done if they believe they've got those votes\nEven at fifty because the veep can be fifty one the tie breaker then they're going to move on it\nThe the the majority leader will not waste any time and going forward and say what you will about Mitch McConnell and we've said plenty about 'em over the years but he has done since Trump has been president I think\nA a very decent job I don't know what grade I would give him a but certainly I think he's done a decent job across the board and bringing the party together on a number of things to get them done legislative\nThis this rises above legislation because as we know those decisions made at the highest court Thirty years yeah this is this is going this this is a big effect this huge affects the direction\nOf the country and ... right now that the majority leader or along with corn and\nUh and and the number of others right now oh well maybe not right now but last night and and just an hour or two we'll be whipping those votes together and and and saying exactly what we just said this is too important to wait any longer\nEight six six Ninety

a as a today\nYou are liberal you have lived her life in a liberal world you go to Martha's Vineyard liberals to them ever say look I don't agree with Kavanaugh hate Trump but I agree with you that due process is worth preserving other with also feel that way\nI found very very few of them for example today seven hundred law professors signed a letter they asked me to sign that I refuse I wrote a dissent\nSaying he now no longer has the judicial temperament well can you imagine if this were a liberal who had been appointed by liberal president who had been accused of what acted similarly I don't think a single one of those professors would have signed that letter they will fail the shoe on the other foot test\nSenator Booker why I like it no it's just dead wrong this is all about partisanship iffy opposite\nWhat's happening and if it was the Democrats who are putting up candidate everybody would behaving the opposite way and so it is partisanship and I think the premise of our

us politics but I think he got\nChef the sandwiches and then to yes he deserves me to find that you wrote a or you were quoted in a recent piece saying that and Julie sweating ethics lawyer may have a legal obligation to withdraw her previous statement for me I've\nDone some research now on it and there are ethical and moral rules that say that when you should have been an affidavit even to Congress\nAnd you need to learn that there are things in the affidavit that falls you have a continuing obligation to withdraw the affidavit you cannot allow an affidavit to remain on the record right if you have information suggesting is false and any reasonable lawyer hearing her on TV\nSays you can't any longer accept what's in that affidavit she has to be investigated\nIndependently of the background check criminal investigators\nTo see if she deliberately and willfully with or without the aid of anybody else\nMade a decision just to frame somebody for something that he had nothing to do with the evidence seems to suggest they never knew each other they will years apart they were operating a different circles it wouldn't surprise me if an FBI investigation prove they never met each other and if that turns out to be the fact\nShe belongs in a court of law\nProsecuted with the presumption of innocence center but at the evidence shows that she committed perjury prison [noise] you know a\nPretty important there because the story changed I mean she changed the story herself and you have ... her attorney representing her that presented and filed officially sworn state well after

yet and that's like you pointed out to was the the the prosecutor Mitchell right ah who said who actually use the term any reasonable prosecutor out to write and I do I go right back to ... right yeah
