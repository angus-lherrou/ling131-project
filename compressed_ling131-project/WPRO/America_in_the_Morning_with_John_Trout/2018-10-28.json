we'll talking Democrats\nSaying not to do something they're doing it immediately afterwards and I said you don't think they know what they're doing you didn't think they were aware that they were doing that and I disagree I think they know what they're doing always and they just know that people listen to whatever the last summer\nYou know but no I honestly don't think at times and I get this by the way from not my opinion it actually was when I read Bernard Goldberg book buyers and he said they were in the media they really don't know\nThey really don't think that they're biased they really don't and and he was in the end he worked there right he'd worked for Denver he just thinks that they're right on everything but they never even miss the obvious things like the obvious irony that as they're calling for the end the divisiveness they're putting out the most divisive statement\nThat they themselves are not conscious that they're doing it\nThat they don't even believe that they just think they're they are so\nJust driven by tunnel vision that they don't even know that they're doing it and I so that really that that really didn't come from you that came from Bernard Goldberg who worked for Dan Rather and wrote the book buyers and talked about the media at large and the mindset that they actually have they don't walk around thinking\nThat were Democrats and Republicans are thinking there's Democrats or Republicans on as a way that we think and we're always right and they never questioned the way that they think they actually don't analyze what they're saying at the time that they're doing it and I just believe in again we don't know because you know ... whether it's soccer or whatever I Can't read his mind ... but it's such an obvious\nIt's such an\nObvious divisive statement that once you explain that people go oh yeah they claimed or\nDivisiveness but they're actually obviously for divisiveness well especially if you're in a news organization where's the fear of being wrong where is that it's not there anymore no you saw the New York times when the New York times to the editor of the editorial staff\nThe you know the the the the what's her job on Sarah Palin\nRight where's the fear of being wrong there isn't one because they believe they're right\nThere is no fear of being wrong I Can't be wrong I write yeah you're you're you're making the point there that they were analyzing that statement and knew the hypocrisy was there and but nobody will notice it no I don't think they knew the hypocrisy was there they just they are so tunnel vision this is our statement we're right right [noise]\n[noise] I mean why don't we know who the targets were of these devices that were sent what if they learn from our or\nIn the next

Jews\n... besides the Associated Press reference we don't know whatever other reference they were using but clearly the Associated Press\nA story does not say that I Will give them the benefit of the doubt because they are a very reputable in my opinion they they they want to make sure they get the facts right and I will tell you that the first time during our pre show meeting when I read that sentence that's how I took it until I rented a second time right\nThat I said oh so the bomb was harmless too and I ... well wait a minute that's not what it says the quotas law enforcement official said tests have determined that they powder found inside an envelope delivered to CNN along with the pipe bomb was harmless right\nNot in the pipe bomb right and there's a there's a difference there so we just wanted to make note of that now we don't know and but there is a question that this is a a three days is what the FBI you said\nThe FBI knows whether these relied bonds or not they know but they have not yet all we have gotten is potentially ... potential\nPotentially explosive device and ...\nAnd and so you you ask yourself the question not in not in we're not in conspiracy theory mode\nWhere simply why in the investigation would they not want that released well it'd be you\nKnow because there are a number of theories here are possibilities as to what this could be over the what's the motive could be behind the individuals but ah that were responsible but the the concern here is is that um or I guess the question here is whether or not\nThey at at at any point ... whether these days\nISIS were meant to send just a message or whether they were intended to kill or maim individuals that's a very different motives and and mission by the person responsible ...\nThose are the questions you to be asking as an investigator mhm and so you would want to know the answer to those questions my point is if it's leaking out from law enforcement\nThe ISIS parity flag and everything else and or the selective leaks why don't we have a leak yet if its sources are telling these news organizations\nDifferent things the powder isn't there why isn't anybody asking the question we're the bombs live where they have gone off with a on a timer is there an investigative reason why they would not do that but they would be leaking out other information\nYeah right I don't know the answer and I I there's there's no sense of suspicion there's no conspiracy theory here these are just questions that I had because it ...\nIt gets to the heart of wanting to uh uh I think everybody wanting to know what the motivation of the person or persons who did this what the motivation is and you don't know until you know you you can't even start to to come to a a a path\nOf possibly a path to go down to figure out why this happened unless you know whether the bombs were actually bombs or they were fake bombs mhm\n\nBecause the motivation then it'd be completely different right\nWhile you're looking to send a message to the people uh the the the would be recipients you're also looking to send a message to the country in the world knowing full well that this would make the news\nOr the interesting thing is when you actually go through it and you look we were when you look at Fox News and others are and I didn't mention the wall Street Journal ... called the pipe bombs and I said but nowhere in their did I see a quote in the wall Street Journal\nThat said pipe bombs that were for her to the FBI or investigators talking about it and so I've seen that in many different articles and you will now I've gone through a ton of different uh uh uh you know news reports overnight to try to find out\nYou know of anybody it it it you know throughout the night if anybody is leaking whether these were actually working live bombs that had explosive material and the detonator and a timer or whatever you would use in what they claim were crude devices right\nBecause we were been told they were\nYou know type type like bombs crude devices potentially explosive devices I don't know what potentially means\n[noise] well that's the the my question if you use the word potentially does that mean it wasn't armed wasn't triggered wasn't ready to be triggered\n\nThat potentially had it been\nArmed it would have been explosive\nI don't know\nBut the phrasing the phrasing is is is a is key by the media because we don't\nWe haven't heard and this is why we're looking for quotes from people actually doing the investigation well within fighting the FBI I I I'm I may be taking the liberty here\nBut within\nThirty seconds mhm of looking at those bombs ... an FBI bomb expert would be able to tell you whether it was legitimately a bomb or not mhm\n\nAnd whether it was a working or lied bar so if it's three days old why don't we know\nRight\nAnd I'm asking from an investigative point of view is a reason that they wouldn't tell you because it would tip off something to the possible suspects I don't know I I but it's very strange for three days have gone by and other things have leaked\nLike the the image of the the parity image will be ISIS flag the other picture to get her done that stuff's leaking we still don't know whether it was a lie bomber lie bomb or not or lie bombs live bomb in that case for CNN or whatever we don't know why don't we know\n\nSo because they know mhm you know the FBI knows right yes and certainly the person responsible knows now that the FBI knows right\nIf you want to get in we do have a line open

is one of US Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri Democrat incumbent one of her final ads\nFor the twenty Eighteen campaign\nAnd what it is meant to do is just set the well known Democrat apart from\nThose crazy Democrats in her party quote crazy Democrats in her party or you should know that this is her ad yeah this is the editor of her campaign approved by her so even though it is to men\nTalking about Claire McCaskill is her message\nTo the people of Missouri that she is not one of those crazy Democrats I'm going to play the ad or from the the beginning because I Want you to hear that you know she says she approves of the best ... so you know it's a campaign at it and not of a pack had\nA you know or just a a general ed from an outside group in Rio\nThen Oklahoma Capitol candidate from the left and right and I approved this now what do you know about this jobs highly guy well no holiday yeah lawyer who worked in any support those terms what does he do now well I think we just ...\nThey tend to attorney general manager and see them through a criminal and it never even tried to ... have in Hollywood crowd hollering at the gym and alpine wind during work our [laughter]\nDollar is aging around the one thing how he did do is use our tax dollars to follow that lawsuit and protections for preexisting medical conditions yeah\nTotally helping the insurance

not one of those crazy Democrat she works right in the middle of the time [noise]\nYeah a whole\nWorks right in the middle and finds compromise\nDid she do that on Kavanaugh now what what ... what's interesting is is the ... the fact that it because if I'm a political consultant I'm looking at this and again I I could not if I'm a political consultant I might be able to tell you a nationally what to do I would still have problems\nFiguring out Missouri 'cause I don't know what Missouri's problems are when you're inside Missouri ... when you're inside of a time limit of town you know more of what their their er or state you know more what their challenges some problems are especially if you've been there a long time\nBut it was interesting too so I understand uh the the the fact of of using the pre existing conditions because all Democrats are using that Schumer said we've got to go and we got to hit that so you knew that was going to be the messaging\nOr not you're not surprised or shocked but very interested in the fact that the biggest issue it was mentioned twice was the terrorists now I don't know why you take valuable time\nBecause if if you believe as a Democrat\nThat the tariffs that are on products that are hurting farmers in the mid west\nAnd you believe in and you you you mentioned it\nYou know white okay because you believe it's important you also know or you believe is we had we inside this way back when in springtime\nOr you know we'd set this when when the weight before that we had this one the Republicans passed the health care bill we said don't be surprised if it comes back and it's a negative against you not a positive anymore but as used against you in in the mid term elections and it has been mhm\nSo you've got that and you've got the terrorists that you believe you mentioned it to white in there because you believe that there's a significant number of people who might be attracted to that anti terror of message\nThat Trump has been so louder mhm\nWhy are you throwing in and wasting any valuable time in a commercial about when he's on the job he went apparently the claim is he went and bought wine and went to the gym anybody
