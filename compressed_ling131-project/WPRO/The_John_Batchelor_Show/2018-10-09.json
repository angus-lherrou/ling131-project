S. practices WTO but causing trouble over Taiwan that's a new one to me Gordon has there been something new they've been complaining for years is their twist in that story\nBut I think the twist is that a first of all when president firing when of Taiwan um went to South America she made to very high profile transit stopped in the United states the\nChinese were happy about that they're not happy about legislation that worked its way through Congress and Taiwan\nAnd they're concerned about another set of arms sales so you know this is one nother level of disagreements between the United states and China and it's good that we're defending Taiwan because at some point we've got to make it clear to Beijing that they cannot fall through the status quo\nAcross the street by the use of force and seizure paying has been effectively threatening the use of force for quite some time now we've been ignored him now we are starting to take the position that yes his threats do matter and they need to be countered\nUnjustifiably criticizing China's domestic an external policies garden I think that means that we're suspicious when the head of inner Paul returns to China and disappears and resigns I think that me and that is what China's sensitive about what's happened to the head of Interpol garden\nUm before I answer that John I think that the Chinese were specifically referring to America and criticisms of the detention of about a million acres since John\nI'm In camps which resemble those um that we've seen in a\nPrior a totalitarian states I mean these are concentration camps John these are crimes against humanity um essentially what they're trying to do is to liquidate an ethnic group and they're doing it in ways that have resulted in the torture and death of rigors\nThis is something that the international community cannot ignore but going to the head of Interpol which is absolutely fascinating\nYou know we've learned that among home way um who was the head of Interpol since two thousand sixteen um went back to China in September he was disappeared I'm now Interpol has received a message that he's resigned there's been a notice from China that he is being investigated for a serious preaches\nHis wife is complaining she's not in China and she's complaining that she's not heard from him so clearly this was an ambush it wasn't planned\nAbsolutely wasn't plan and it shows that number of things John one of them is that um the disagreements at the top of the Communist Party have become so severe that they basically broken out into open warfare\nOf the reason why I get to that is that China really wanted to have the head of Interpol to be a Chinese national Communist Party official and they were successful in that and for them to do this to take a among\nAnd disappear indicates that they don't care about China's international standing anymore that what's really important for them is solving internal political disputes\nWe've seen this and the Maoist era you know see Jim paying this one mile Arab powers he's\nEnded up with Mao era instability you can't have um what a siege and paying wants this really I think is an indication that we are going to go back to the intense political struggles in the Nineteen fifties and Nineteen sixties this is really bad news because China right now looks to be unstable\n... said in this meeting that he regret that there will not be an annual meeting between Chinese and us diplomats and military officials do in mid October\n\nI'm John ...

all a phrase or a garden I've been discussing the missing in action press the Chinese Communist party member president Interpol discussing the fact that the Chinese authorities have turned out a long time and successful Financial Times editor from Hong Kong discussing\nThe freedom of navigation chicken a game of chicken with us as Decatur last week and also puzzling about Wang is speaking in temp work late to Mike pump pale\nIn the capital these last hours has something happened that you can see from Singapore that we can see here has ... has as Xi Jinping ceded control of the\nFace of China conquering the world because they're acting right now a unpredictably good evening good morning to you\nThat ... are you going to a gentleman and I don't know I in some ways that I think very ... ... ...\n... if you understand the nature of the Communist Party and if you understand China but of course from the site it really is quite shocking and the case of an old cheap you simply could not make that up if you if you had a fictional story but the head of Interpol was abducted affects disappeared by the government or corruption\nThat his government push to put in there just two years ago no one would have believed you\nUm the the visa case and Hong Kong and of course is Betty wedding in terms of Hong Kong said um we know that aggressive positions are you trying to see there's China is under a lot of pressure at the moment and many of these things have come at the same time clearly pressure from the Trump Administration has caused part of that\nYou have economic problems on shore that some degree of political infighting I don't think she did things going to be any time soon but\nThe Chinese are clearly straight and they've added the airwaves but a long time\nAnd they're not getting it that way anymore and the fact that why you're shading Mike Pompeo is basically telling you the Chinese are just really upset and ... and they don't know really hate that it's fun and changed our mother Gordon\nFraser um the the Chinese ... seems to have lost the cue cards um\nYou you talked about many things just now I'm One of them was the economy where is the economy at this particular time you had the big reserve rate reduction ratio reduction pumping a lot of money into the Chinese economy more than a hundred billion US dollars\nUm is that a sign that the economy is slowing or is this just a precaution\nOh I think again why isn't anyone think they're called them you know floating economy has been on for quite a period of time you can clearly see a lot of stress um it's not always be although the stock market are very bad day yesterday NATO was being shown in the left the company and our bond default or whatever and a lot of private companies that are real distress\nYou see signs of distress and the property market it does not mean that we're going to fall off a cliff ... there's going to be leaving moment per se\nBut there's clearly a lot of stress and the economy we have had a huge buildup of credit\nThey try to tighten diner not realizing that problem but they've become so addicted to credit over the past decade or so that it it gives them very little room to maneuver and this is another one of those pressures in that caught me\nAnd of course you saw the the ... last week about the big act going right to the heart of that stuff that take their tiny tiny factory and you know\nEverything basically that it's simply know bit of good news coming out of China\nThat is a phrase or do we anticipate this unpredictability ceasing anytime soon or is this just something kind of open ended\nUm I live there's going to a bit like the stock market that feeds of all at ... am I mean again I think what the Chinese are struggling to find is a model itself I knew model and it's not even clear to me that even trying to look for one they have been so use of\nHow to engage with the way we can get your US President understanding this of low and gauge meant policy is trying to run rings right into others\nUm and ... claim they're faced with problems you know they're fighting back and and and the way they do in the case of Hong Kong but on the ether\nYou know this Hong Kong independence against Hong Kong independence either the vast majority of Hong Kong or there's only a small number of people talking but I think it's highly unrealistic but the very ...\nYet the Beijing rattled Juanita by separatists or to the truck and talk like that and so you have this completely in temperate behavior your complete over reaction as you solve with recent be the case\nUm but this is remember when it comes to the Communist Party loyalty and belief that belief in the party is all that matters so almost regardless if I read it till it brings up here as long as the people are supporting the fence are supporting Xi Jinping's supporting the party a lot of what seemingly the rational behavior tank and and your\nFriends your garden tells me that they're putting more money into the economy or some hundred billion or more that's the way they responded to recessions once upon a time is there a recession\nI it's always difficult to really know if it is that the technical definition of protections in place in China but that is as I say that it's straight they know that the way they are under stress a fallback but at that method the pumping money into the economy\nBut it's interesting as well as earlier this year with didn't talk about um rushed infrastructure project that to to boost growth and tax cuts to help boost growth ... um and so they're going I Love the stalks and there was no longer talk of\nThe language and the economy even though the fix that it's a tremendous amount of credit that basically bargaining dichotomy but

Kavanaugh's victory they have\nThe rule of law they have a the Supreme Court ah they have the behavior of the Democrats to run against\nAnd I think even though district by district it may not affect Republicans' chances I think in general it is given the Republicans issues that will fire up their base that weren't there before before they have to talk about tax cuts and all the stuff that oh well you've done for us already what are you done for us lately\nSo I think the Republicans are revved up and we have a real campaign on our hands\nThat is you have questions for this gentleman of the media learned any lessons from the Kavanaugh confirmation battle David you are no [laughter]\nLook I mean I'm I I think there was a good reporting during the cabin a fair and I think there was a bad reporting it I don't think the media is going to be any different than it's ever been uh some of us know what we're doing some of us don't readers and viewers will make up their minds I I mean look I think the focus on the media is\nA little bit overblown I understand what frustrates a lot of people but you know believe it or not\nFrustrates a lot of people on the left to just for different reasons so they're going to hate us and that's that's just the way it goes meaning left and right I I just try and do my job is to find\nI think the Kavanaugh controversy represented the clearest possible indication that removing to a British style of journalism where journalists take sides\nWere some outlets are clearly leaning in one direction and others are leaving and the other direction\nAnd I think that was made explicit you read reporters who even though they may have had a semblance of objectivity and they're reporting were declaring their partisan feelings on Twitter and even more blatantly so because it was such a fast moving story\nSo I figured it was a clarifying moment for many viewers and readers in this country that all of the things they have suspected\nAnd almost half the country and the latest killed his paper poll says the coverage was tilted against Kavanaugh was unfair up it just accelerated all the trends about media skepticism received these lo these many years\nDavid you're reporting from Tennessee included day I have a tendency\nA resident who is working for the Democratic candidate for Senate and his unhappy with President Trump was and I wanted you to comment on that because it seemed a Americans are individuals he can't generalize what did you learn from her death\nWas fascinating um she's a volunteer for the brightest in campaign and that's how I met her she is a\nRegistered Republican and that always voted Republican until twenty sixteen and she is somebody that\nHas not a given up her views um even though she had given up supporting a Republican president\nShe still fiscally conservative socially libertarian a one out of a way to tell me she leaves and the second amendment even though she be okay with it you know what I Would label it too many style at least a compromise legislation on guns they they um and this even though in the district she is in in suburban Memphis\nShe will not make a difference because Tennessee is just one of those red state that you're not going to see the blue wave blow through even if there is a blue wave she is a quintessential married suburban Republican woman who doesn't like Trump\nOr because she doesn't like Trump is voting for Democrats to send a message and when I asked her about her views that I wanted to establish\nA Republican bona fee but also to get to the heart of what her she was and she told me it\nComes down to the president's behavior or his ... and the way she believes he treats the ball and she said you can't the ... be a decent person and lead in that fashion\nThat ... that's enough for me to excommunicated and she told me she probably would have voted for Bob Corker for reelection she doesn't see why not but just simply because Marsha Blackburn\nIs a Trump supporter and because of all the way she feels about Trump's she is voting rather than it's there are women like this all over the country in districts that matter and if Democrats win control of the house on November sick it's going to be the cause of women like her\nA job in the puzzle for me about the Democratic approach to Capitol was that it change the subject for Trump did they do that on purpose did they think that Kavanaugh could be Trump how do they how did they get to a place where they stopped talking about what was helping them which was the president's tweets\nBecause the Supreme Court was so important to them and they are such pressure from their base they had to act and do everything they could stop Kavanaugh so they thought and they threw everything into it [noise] uh I agree that many voters are in the position that David found this woman or the other hand the last few days I've talked to voters who say\nWell you know I still don't like Trump but at least he stood up to the bullies\nAre no other president whether it's the name was Romney or Bush would have stood up to the ... bullies they would have pulled Kavanaugh and there'll be a vacancy the Supreme Court today so well Trump is disliked by these people there's also a sticking admiration that by his methods and values stubbornness and by his\nStern is he got something done that they want it done which is a seat of the Supreme Court and they're not going to vote whereas before they were going to sit home\nSaturday is here in a blue state with a dominant by Democrats in this cycle was there any change in the attitude towards the Trump during the Kavanaugh hearing that you could discern\nWhen you could see a certainly with the Republicans they may were very very engaged in this very upset\nAnd I think one of the things you're also see amongst the electorate especially in ... as you get towards the center\nIs a lot of the tactics that were employed by the Democrat democratic base or their rabid partisans are we're not perceived well\nThey were perceived as forces of Robert Kennedy recalled disorder and lawlessness and those do not play well for the Democrats here with the vast majority of the center here in the state now whether we'll hold off the blue wave I dunno Michigan I think it'd be purple at best\nThis election but people are very concerned about the way to collect\nTheir grass roots quote unquote have gone about trying to express their quote unquote rage and resistance\nI'm speaking with my professional Thaddeus McCotter David

zone in what has always been described as complete harmony get equal pay there is um\n[noise] uh generally harmony between the the rest of the people working there\nIt's very successful in

were looking at him as a form as of this afternoon I don't know if there was any later updates to saving tonight\nBut as of this afternoon I mean it really caught people or the tragedy of it\nWas a shocking for people and especially because the brutality where he tied them up and then executed them\nAnd the ... this is an unusual conduct yes Malcolm I mean I remember reporting something like this before\nRight and this isn't some area and it's um ... compounds\nTo tragedy because this dusty ozone um uh where there were factories and other things the day or worked in the same factory\nUm ... you know was simple it's more of of several such places in fact more than people realize you know this is an unsung place people do newspapers don't write about the harmony and initiatives that have been taken where people living together and working together\nSaturdays Malcolm is Beppe precisely why it could have been targeted because there was comedy they're there because it was successful and because it was breaking down such barriers and stereotypes us that way I could have been targeted\nThat it could well we're not ... it's not clear whether this is work related or what the motivation for this guy but it's the incitement it's the ongoing incitement uh that that is fed into to the Palestine community that leads to these kinds of actions we can't say yet defended typically what\nIf but certainly um you know something that the compounds that tragedy\nAnd a regretful in this but should be a message and yet we see a bus continuing the today again\nAre all sorts of a

deliver it for the next ... threatening to people who were going to work on it\nAnd at the same time we see them continuing to incite the rioting and the and know condemnation of it no combination when innocent are are killed Israelis were killed including um just fold recently\nUh so it it it creates an atmosphere where these kind of ... even if this particular one may have had some additional motivation\nIs outrage the foreign minister of Iran meaningless lover off the foreign minister Russia the EU is working to in some fashion defeat or work around the sanctions his Russia working with the EU Malcolm or they separate enterprises\nIt's separate enterprises but you're right on both counts on the first one lap Robbins every for meeting about\nUh oil and you know that Iran has accused Russia and ... good and collaborating with Saudi Arabia to lower the price of oil and uh yet there there's no evidence been proven given for any of these accusations and yet that refund\nAre are meeting to to talk about a a energy and at the same time not only report last week to remember the Volvo and the German banks and build major publication called for\nUm them to to pull out to for for they're not to be a\nWays to avoid the sanctions we see the oil industry really mobilizing to towel which was amongst the first to pull out or the first if the French oil company said they wouldn't join un efforts to bypass the sanctions\nThey said they can't afford to be banned from the U.S financial system any the the Italy's major and a conglomerate oil conglomerates that we have no presence anymore in Iran and were whatever contracts expire in November\nAh steps at the same that refinery in Spain said they're getting one shipment and that's it in in a I think in November and then and we see the overall numbers dropping to Europe from eight hundred and forty three to four hundred and twenty two thousand barrels\nAnd I think it's um and and the top executives said\nThat they didn't see anybody willing to trade Iranian crude\nSo the efforts to bypass it we see that the Iranians are lashing out in many ways they're going today the case against the United states sanctions and seizing property or was open that the international court of justice the Hague by\nIran against us us I think is\nNot at all I'm a concerned about it but the counter message ... measures and the\nUs finding again today that Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism and counterterrorism strategy puts the focus on Iran and its proxies a Hamas and says the law or John Bolton spoke about it today and very strong a direct turns in and said that the\nUh the radical Islamist terrorists groups are the preeminent transnational terrorist threat to the U.S\nAnd so the new threat at a new strategy to us includes pursuing extremist too there's still some cutting off the source of support I e some would say Iran\nFatty we also sees me you was also in many ways trying to incite Israel isn't it\nThe ... you ... is is simply outrageous and given their failure to condemn you know we have this this situation in in the south it first of all failure to press the ... to go after the new nuclear sites that the prime minister cited\nIn his speech and the un we see a whole home reaction know virtually no action is certainly no pressure on the ... which seems to be ignoring the new evidence and and still trying to live by the myth that Iran is abandoned the nuclear program which is simply just not true\nAnd the ... use actions on on numerous fronts right now that we see their um unwillingness on the on on one hand to support the U.S on the sanctions to stand up against Iran\nOn as a British on those stories about the how as a ... is really a model of moderation\nAnd of tolerance and especially given the neighborhood which you visited\nAnd I'm ... knowing the contribution that as for John makes to stability in the region and while people criticize it and there's always a legitimate criticism against anybody the fact is its record is remarkable it has reached out to Israel they are working together and economic and security in other areas\nAnd other Arab countries are now turning to them to say how do you do that how do you how can you balance it because many of them want to follow the model\nAnd I think when we talk about models king Mohammed the sixth Morocco has once again demonstrated again a moderate leader showing Islam and its best days\nUm has announced\nAnd ordered that he had ordered the education minister side I'm a I'm Suzie to incorporate Holocaust studies into the country's high school curriculum and\nThis is reported in the press it's ... we've talked about this uh we've seen the curriculum and he said education has the power to fight against discrimination is racism\nAs well as the ugly phenomena of anti Semitism this is the king of Morocco and Arab country was repeatedly set this high standard one that is reflected in Azerbaijan as well where in twenty six hundred years of Jewish existence in the country that was never anti Semitism in the last example\nIs not your more route who just won the Nobel Prize for uh she was a captive taken by Islamic state and sold and slavery in this horrific story we hosted are here in New York she was held on\nAnnouncing ... remember in the region of northwest Iraq and terrible things happen to so many so many disappeared and we're so\nBut she visited Israel in ... twenty Seventeen and she said like the Jews the cities have an ancient history\nAt thousands of years old and despite recurring persecution both people have survived she said my time in Israel shown me that in the wake of oppression and genocide of community can emerge stronger and she is really a model what Nobel Peace prize unlike some others who have received including us there are a fat\nAs it by John Morocco and they use ETs of Iraq who are now the CDs or many countries after the crimes of the Islamic state now we turn now Malcolm puts down his uh very proper clothes and puts on his hat puts the bowl with down and he reaches into his pouch Thaddeus\nYeah when you talk about winning a Nobel Prize you'd like to do with something can you tell us can you tell us about the world's oldest breweries in that way [laughter]\nUh well this is the site of and I'm going to be reviewing and the next couple of weeks when God when we'll be back on a regular schedule some really exciting things that have been found but this is in the ... north of ...\nWhich uh I'm John visited in which is northern Israel it's served as a burial site for them to to the people and they found there the world's oldest brewery\nAnd it seems that they were able to ferment\nA a different kinds of grain and perhaps used in a burial ceremony it seems that this I'm a site was a one way where the burials took place they found a platform of flowering plants\nAnd they produce a soup like liquid an alcoholic drink\nAnd different than what we know is today's beer but brewing beer was thought only to go back five thousand years but this may turn the history on his head so in a lot of bars now you can have a dispute about how old they um\n[noise] the preventing of beer or was they found these three small pits are mortars to use the storage one for pounding the Bering grains and before the fermentation and the the site I'm sure will become a great a visiting site parents a great\nWhere is it again Malcolm review\nThe geography it's it's it was in the Cape ... south of ... which is in Israel's north it's the largest city tribe but a lot Israel's\nOr a north\nSo maybe a\nWhat their city they're Malcolm if\nIt was the the two feet settlement it\nWas I'm a ... that they believe the people there that new competed buried the some of their dead in these in these caves and that the um the discovery indicates report raises questions about uh about them they they ... between the pale lipstick and deal with the periods\nAnd um give that gives us insight into what they were eating and discovery of traces of wheat barley based alcohol in this case so it's really very interesting I think it's still a lot more to be found there but I'm a lot of people can be hosting it\nAll right a preview Indiana of the upcoming weeks\nWell tomorrow there's going to be a very special announcement and it's a one by the Israel Museum in Israel antiquities authority of\nOf an inscription I have not yet seen it's been kept under real wraps\n'em and they're going to announce it tomorrow so next week's report we will have an update on it and also a review of some of the amazing discoveries including um the bullet the seals with the names of both ... and the profit a show I ...\nAnd the letters while some of them are not clear by piecing it together they believe that this could have been ... amazing a connection\nAnd uh the reason we're previewing Indiana's because the overpass try so we just have a couple of minutes here can you go over your tribes India\nWell one of them of course if we remembered this the the last theater which is I went back to to visit um which was discovered under the western wall underneath Wilson ...\nI remember I remember yes\nVisible structure remaining from the Temple Mount compound of the second temple period and they uncovered this three hundred two hundred seat amphitheater from the Roman period and a eight large or ancient stone courses built up enormous stones\nAnd this is as I said the last of such charges that was constructed a big bridge that led to the amount that they would cross over to go into the temple itself and it stands above the foundation of the western wall\nA and this these discoveries are open up a whole new era underneath that we don't know yet what else\nUh um we were going to find but they considered that one of the remarkable discoveries um ... you know it's small compared to the big Roman theaters that that have been found but ... meeting here it could well have been a place where Rome and leaders got together with they held discussions the city council or something of that kind\nThat he's got thirty seconds you have a question for India now I have no question other than you know how quickly you changed during the segment from your street clothes into your Indiana close I didn't want any more than ... Carter has nothing you\nThere's a telephone booths here but they they do you remember the story about the toads John and that is so I didn't even get to remind everybody about the four thousand year old to enjoy\nSome where they found the ... the uh as part of some sort of a burial ritual\nUh in the uh that was um a found in the tumor itself along with the other uh items that that uh\nWhat what did they find ... Indiana where they find toads remembered that I have yet to be added frogs they hadn't frogs yes we have and it was ... deeply with you right we had to solve the va headed frogs is true is that unusual mentality I was the highlight of the ad a whole lot of the world's else's brewery and the ... decapitated frogs\nThat is McCotter W.

Marshall used bitter ... of the indigenous people so that that wouldn't happen\nA but it hasn't been that at all but it is truly been that of a war to its guardian and the relationship has been that a meaning that\nNow the indigenous people by and large are considered to be not competing in the same way that we might say but teenagers incompetent and therefore might have a guardian for a teenager\nOr a person with some mental disability so it might have a guardian to ... to taking advantage of that person\nNow the federal government acts as the guardian to these wards and we literally and the legislation passed much later Eighteen Seventy seven legislation\nOr called them a incompetent until we deemed them competing imagined today if I said African Americans are wards of the state because they're incompetent I mean that would just be that would be the last ... she couldn't imagine saying those words and yet that's the way we to\nThis day a treat American Indians\nSo we're stuck with early Eighteen century land a language which of course was inherited from the early ... or early Nineteen century language ... when he heard it from the early Eighteen century language when the quake or the hikers now I'm not talking about gunman we're talking about Quakers\nWhen the quake her colony saw that there was profit in the ground in the in in the soil and didn't take advantage so much as they used survey ers and law and the courts and the assembly too slowly encroach upon Indian hunting ground now we've come to\nWhat happened to the Indians the west or the Native Americans in the west the indigenous peoples\nIf I recall correctly Terry there were a series of steps late Nineteen century early twentieth century where large pieces of territory we're seated to the Native American reservations and then they kept chipping away so that it got smaller and smaller do I remember correctly\nYou ever\nThat you have a perfectly correct I'll go back to the black sea rows of ... of the black sea reservation was a lot of ... and that was easily three times what it is today\nA until somebody said hey there's a\nSmooth beautiful country up there why don't we call it Glacier National park and the people who really wants to do that or\nA namely the a finance ears of the great northern real low which rammed through there they wanted the place to take tourists and so the federal government said that the black sea you know that reservation we gave you well we didn't really mean to give you the west half of that reservation\nWe're going to protect it as a national parks and here I ... I Can't remember the number precisely but it was around the million three hundred thousand that they paid them so there's this chunk of land\nOr so they did in some sense get paid but again that was the guardian who is negotiating a contract with the guardian so the ward really didn't have much say\nSo these loans were were taken away and it through this process of the coral reservation in Montana last significant coal reserves because of the northern Pacific real world road wanted them so they're no different than the store you told about of Pennsylvania or they were left them with\nParcels so are are seated land was far smaller than the original territory that was a to B Indian reservations and of course then there's the trail of tears that the Enron moved to the American Indians moved to the Indian Territory in Oklahoma which is even worse\nTerry symposium most recently in Washington is renewing indigenous economies we've\nWe've put down and outline of the crisis which is going now more than ... we're we're looking at three hundred years here so we there what is to be done when we come back ... percent of the Hoover Institution I'm John bachelor this is the John ...

Ford yeah I think that would be tremendous problems for for um professor Ford\nBecause I don't think and this is another reason why I think that this doesn't have the chance of actually going anyplace I'm One of the astonishing things I think that he is that that happened during the hearing and I refer to it in a column\nIran from from the hill by explaining that I you know I come from the federal court rooms in New York or not from the Sigmund Freud theater on Capitol Hill a but they actually have two people who have told diametrically irreconcilable\nStories of the the two versions of events are completely diametrically opposed and be figuring out which one is true\nIs vital to how people should think about this controversy and in where I come from which is the world of of of prosecution in courtrooms what you would say looking at something like this very simply somebody's lying here and we've got to figure out who it is\nA sun house for three weeks at Washington they decided to tiptoe around that issue which is the main issue so we got a bunch of psychobabble regarding professor Ford that you know perhaps a\nShe was right about everything she certainly went through a terrible traumatic event she certainly was the victim of sexual abuse of some kind but she simply wrong\nThe identity of the perpetrator even though it's somebody she testified that she knew beforehand so this is not mistaken identity situation\nA and she was a hundred percent sure according to her testimony that it was eight or and then on the\nOn the Kavanaugh side of things he was such a compelling witness that nobody\nDared during the hearing call him a liar to his face\nSo the myths about him is that uh he had occasionally a few too many beers when he was in high school\nAnd that maybe he committed a sexual assault while he was in a drunken stupor and forgot about it for thirty six years which seems to be to be equally preposterous um but the unfortunate ... result of all this is we never really\nHad a\n... a real fact finding proceeding about who was telling\nThe truth and well Kavanaugh has the better of the argument because a Ford story is completely uncorroborated he gets to the Supreme Court with a cloud over him\nBecause too many people on Capitol Hill including Republicans conceded the credibility and sincerity\nOf professor Ford's account or even though they they say that you know it must be mistaken identification which is exactly what she says it was it\nAbout lessons learned ah quite separate from the particulars of the forward remarks and Kevin remarks is it your measure Andy that this is now the new now to be the new standard in advise and consent\nThat you search for a revelation that you keep to yourself until the proper moment and then you spring it on the opposing party and turn the hearings into a display is that ... is that where we are and is that where we will stay your measure\nNo I don't I don't think so John I think that this is\nNot so much about advice and consent as it is about the the new radical left and coming to grips with what its tactics are and how it'll proceed going forward it is my view for what it's worth\nInterference by the Russians and the twenty sixteen election\nAndy when this news came last week it received no attention whatsoever even on our a Republican channels because Kavanaugh overwhelmed the news cycle it struck me at the time with my mouth open this this is a fact that we've needed for a long time did it strike you that way and\nIt sure did it was a and it's interesting that it came out the as you say overwhelmed by the Kavanaugh story because um what this fact is is something that you would not knowing the Kavanaugh story which is called cooperation ah this is actually what we've been\nDiscussing and talking about all along it goes to what the FBI and Justice Department knew\nAt the time that they went to the size of court and importantly John what they withheld from the ... the court\nA we have to underscore here the Perkins coal week is basically the law firm cut out for the Clinton campaign it's the nexus between ah the FBI\nAnd the which ... and the Clinton campaign which produced it so this is a very important development and probably even in in a time when um when we didn't have an overwhelming story like Kavanaugh or it would have been ignored\nIn the mainstream media is not the conservative media that is [noise]\nAnd they wouldn't let us have come out sooner if it weren't for the ... the FBI and the Deirdre interviews regarding some of the documents are barely ... believe it was a footnote forty three something like that\nYeah ... ... foot no forty three is something that we've we've discussed a particularly at the time when the house\nA report came out the house intelligence committee's ... new noses committees a report or that footnote\nWas very important ah at the time because it was indicative of a lot of the information that the FBI had that was being held back and the the moral of the story back then is that while they were\nYou know ranting and raving about how they couldn't disclose this information because national security was at stake and methods and sources of intelligence would be compromised what we find it again and again and again is that when they're withholding information it's because it's politically embarrassing\nAnd I don't want to say that you know I've I've worked\nIn this ticket I don't want to suggest\nThat there is not national defense information that's important that message and sources of intelligence not important uh to to protect but at the same time it has long been known that the government's ability to classify things and to have this under this whole ... of secrecy\nIs a very convenient way\nTo hide or misconduct and war\nRod Rosenstein the deputy attorney general received a ... a ride on air force one within these last hours and the president of the United states speaking glowing Lee of his work and\nThat his work will continue no hint whatsoever of retribution because of trash talk perhaps a mischaracterization of trash talk by Rod Rosenstein and the president and may have twenty Seventeen so we set that aside and I asked is puzzling question about this Aspen revelation\nUh the deputy attorney general had reason to have the five ... in front of him in may have twenty Seventeen when he joined the Trump Administration after all there\nBeen free of them already and he was looking to sign the fourth in that fight the war and he had he had Michael assessments name\nI'm puzzled Andy when you have evidence that the public and the Congress has not been told the full truth over the acquiring of the ... and the allegation by the by many that device a warrant process was abused when you have it in front of you are you not\nCharged responsible compelled to reveal that fact as opposed to say keeping a concealed which is what Mr Rosen's dean and his allies have done for Eighteen months\nThey should be the most transparent\nPeople of all John and yet are there is opaque as a as anyone who came before them\nAnd I will say this for attorney general and deputy attorney general Rosenstein I think he tried very hard in his last house testimony not to answer the question of whether he read what he signed off on\nAnd I would I Would caution that the attorney general's signature that should give Rosenstein is do which is not much of the attorney general's signature on a ... an application\nIs a a basically a certification that all of the legal requirements\nUm have been all those boxes and the statute had been checked whereas the when the FBI signs off on it they are verifying or purporting to verify the information in the Warren nevertheless I think in a situation like this\nIf he didn't read every word that warrant and ask hard questions before it went to the court or that is really a serious dereliction of duty\nAnd I would also point out or as we've discussed a number of times every single warrant\nIncluding the warrant that Rosenstein signed said that the FBI believes that the the that not only Carter Page who was the subject of the war but perhaps other people in the Trump campaign participated and coordinated in the Russian government's\nInterference in the\nTwenty sixteen election specifically the cyber espionage that representation was made in the war and as an assertion that representation was made in the war that Rosenstein sign\nStatus and today that we've seen any evidence yet I keep waiting\nYeah you would think that um we not only have seen the evidence but that ... that Rosenstein would have seen and been aware of the evidence when he signed that warrant in June of\nTwenty Seventeen because that was the fourth warrant they had been at it for you know I mean they were essentially editor for the better part of a year but they had been at it for about nine months\nAnd Michael assessment is not it's not in consequential that Michael assessment at ... call I represented\nThe cyber wing of the department and he was connected to crowd strike crowd strike you will recall from your distant memories of Russia gaping for Kavanaugh crowd strike is the organization that told us it was the Russians who hacked the DNC server\nAnd pass that information on to bad parties one of whom my or the allegation was was the Trump campaign so soft and Andy fit it's if we've been building a jigsaw puzzle these last years\nSuffering piece fits right into a missing whole right there right there are we going to get back to the Sandy can you promised us we've got thirty seconds\n[laughter] I mean John like you I Can't promise anything but I Do think that this story\nOr

they are seeing these other small businesses and they have the means to patronize them\nThere's this notion that the big harmless but know think about it word of the world's poorest regular ... risk their lives to get to they risk their lives getting the United states I arguably one of the most unequal countries on earth\nThe same where to the small businesses open up shop they invariably open up around the big because where the big is where the buyers are that's the driver of their success the conventional wisdom about inequality whether it's in in terms of individuals or businesses is entirely backwards\nAnd this is from Pew Research center at the butt moaning of inequality among Asian Americans what does that mean John inequality\n[laughter] I'm In a call the ... of the economic variety as and it used to be that Asian Americans across the board were fairly equal from an economic perspective as and they're generally poor but over the in modern times we've seen\nAsians search in terms of their economic a succession as a result the gap between rich and poor Asians is grown this oddly is a is a bad sign the Pew Research and they say that in fact it's going to be the driver of a lack of mobility for poor Asians which\nIs never properly explained\nSo I understand now that Asian Americans who are extremely good at 'em so taking care of their children very very good at taking the other children are getting richer\nAnd that's good that's a good thing because that allows them to send their children to ... to private schools and to private colleges and therefore the number of Asian Americans on campuses in America have grown and I'm to regard this is a bad thing John ... this is a negative\nThat's what that's what the Pew Research center so they they said that this ... rising inequality is going to make it difficult for those at the bottom to rise up but as they are very study makes clear\nThe Asians are rising and the rising very fast and the United states all an economy as individuals and they're doing very very well so it's never explained why\nThose rising to the top would make it difficult for those at the bottom to basically emulate what they do\nUm in fact this is a great story it's a sign that race doesn't factor into one's ability to uh increase one's economic output in the United states that were basically colorblind if the Asians can thrive that's a sign that we don't have a race has a problem\nBut there's just no explanation why would a implicit in this idea that um and increasing gap between rich and poor among Asians is bad for the poor Asians is that a\nSomeone or a black person who's very successful should stop doing that because he would be holding down other black people or the Jewish people over a very successful should avoid six should avoid financial achievements these their achievements would hold down Jewish people why is it that Asian achievement\nIs going to be a barrier to the achievement of other rations there's no explanation\nIs it's the puzzling here John might be where I just recognized this talk about inequality\nIsn't inequality an expression of six fast when a when a when a country has an economy that's working very well it increases inequality but of course the rich are the people were the jobs come from so its upside down just say inequality should be eliminated it should be encouraged\nOh look let's be very clear yes John ... absolutely in fact\nThe the the ideas that you and I believe in and that many of us believe in our the ideas of rising inequality the free or the people the more there is inequality\nThe more that and the economy is taxed much less the more there's capital the natural talent on the way to talent realizing its full potential our ideas are all about inequality and that's a wonderful thing because and economy is just a collection of individuals is in the countries where where people are equal\nOr there's lots of misery in a country like the U.S we see people constantly rising up this a sign of economic freedom\nAnd for Asian Americans you see there's a an unhappy unhappy study showing that Asian American applicants to major universities such as Harvard I think that's the one example in front of his right now are being discriminated against with some strange formula\nSo Harvard in it's odd way\nA seventeenth century America represented here in the twenty first century is trying to stem the results of a successful economy that Harvard has contributed to for the last four hundred years wow John that's a paradox\n[noise] it it it it's an endless paradox and and that's the one thing I'd say the Pew report adds that it's educational inequality that's helped drive this well even that's not really true look at China it's one of the least educated countries on earth and it's getting richer richer shameless South Korea free people\nThrive that's the big driver of inequality and people are free or in the United states and they do much better and so the the ... education just ineffective all this rich people want to educate their kids and increasingly fancy schools the Asians as long as they're free will do well they don't need Harvard lift them up they just need freedom\nTo John ... he is the editor real clear markets he's also the author of the new the end of work when we come back the Federal Reserve a favorite
