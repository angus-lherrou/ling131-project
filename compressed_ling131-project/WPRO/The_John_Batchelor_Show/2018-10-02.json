about\nThe ... relationship with a guy to and the economy as a sort of key role in connecting all these characters together\nCharlie Wilson Charlie Wilson has a movie played by Tom Hanks so that certainly makes him a significant member of Congress\nHowever Charlie Wilson's part with a ... network is is right in front of us were looking at it all the time and you notice so quickly how does Charlie Wilson how does the CIA how does the way we fought the Soviets uh continue today right in front of us\nWell you know of course if you go back to Charlie Wilson's war of the movie or the book the book is is very good at laying out the relationship between Charlie Wilson and do all of the county\nI'm Charlie Wilson this congressman from Texas who pull all the levers to make this sort of a job in Afghanistan work he was very much I'm Fonda jaw and in the county to the point where he actually called the county goodness personified is the way he referred to him\nNow of course the title of my piece is bad news personified because it turns out that economy was the exact opposite of what Charlie Wilson thought he was\nUm in a county so cutting out a very close relationship with will so we'll see even visited um Afghanistan Pakistan under the protection of the counties and at one point there's a very um in his book by Milt Bearden bearded and James rising called the main enemy which recounts sort of the CIA\nWar against the Soviets ... one of the anecdotes in that book um is about how ... and his men took old tires and chains and they were raking in across the dirt road trying to pick up dust clouds\nThey were trying to attract the attention of a Soviet fighter or helicopter why they because they Charlie Wilson wanted a shoe one down himself with a stinger missile and so the shows you how closely um economy was working with walls and how close relationship between those two\nThat basically this US Congressman was in bed with this ... legendary and now notorious mujahedeen commander who incubate it all ... and it shows you sort of the unintended consequences of what came out of the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan\nAnd occurs to me a bill listening to your story I've just done a new history one volume history of Vietnam how the U.S created the same monster in Vietnam that we've created in Pakistan\nOr the intentions that first year to fight the Soviets or to fight the Cold War but what what becomes of our\nOf our clients is the enemy itself and we failed to solve this and so we go through the same cycle again and again what we did with ah the the um brothers in the Nineteen fifties the Nineteen sixties until John Kennedy approved the assassin um the removal of the GM brothers\nYou can see with a ... network we we ... we ... we ... we we we advertised it so that the Pakistani ISI was not wrong headed in thinking that it was it had our blessing\nYeah you know I basically I look at the story of John economy they stay in the piece\nAs a warning I think it should be it's one of those lessons that still people have not really learned um from all this in fact we sort of went through a replay of this where you've had especially post Arab Spring he procedure uprisings you've had a number of calls in Washington elsewhere to get behind Sunni extremist or ...\nSome of which are either linked to al ... or ... groups um because they want to work with them in Syria or they want to work with them in different countries you know some of some people have actually meet outright claims\nThat we should work with these types of groups around the world and I think that is sort of sorely mistaken for a lot of reasons I don't think it makes sense for the United states ever to get in bed with extremists of any sort to be honest with you people try and make these ... billion calculations to say well we'll work with this one extremist group now and then we'll sort of\nSome of them down the river later but that's not Machiavellian you know nickel and ... he wasn't a moron you know he wouldn't work with you know people who basically wanted to kill him and think that that was going to be right at the end of the day and essentially that's what a lot of the foreign policy establishment I'm In Washington has has called for in Syria and elsewhere\nIs the get behind sort of the modern age law and and the counties and it doesn't really make any sense when you look at the story of what how this unfolded in Afghanistan pacts and the fact that we're still living with the consequences of the day we're still living with the consequences of what a county and his men have done here to this day it really is I think a cautionary tale\nBill a very good evening to you we'd go immediately to Somalia which is another twentieth century story where the U.S invested treasure and blood and these many decades later Somalia is a failed state\nYou've reported on the U.S taking action against the al Shabaab in Somalia it's a vast landscape and most of the action seems to be in the south or why are we launching airstrikes what is our mission in Somalia given that it it it's a completely failed state\nGood evening John yes so the U.S is trying to counter Shabaab which is al ... branch needs East Africa it's official branch\nAnd you know you are correct and most of\nThe airstrikes in an operation that are in southern and central Somalia but we've said that the strikes span almost the entire length\nOf the country there's been also been a couple of attacks last year against the Islamic State's nothing branch in Somalia as well so last year there was a total of uh thirty four strikes thirty one of them against Shabaab\nAnd another free against the Islamic state this year there's twenty three strikes hitting Shabaab window smiley forces or when U.S forces are partnering with Somali forces are African Union forces and operations particularly in the south of most of these operations are and stuff out of Mogadishu area where it's south of it [noise]\nUm so show in the state department issued a country it's country report on terrorism and it said that Somalia remains quote terrorists safe haven and quote\nThe year before they similar language was used about ... about the strikes against Shabaab have increased but obviously it's not enough because\nYou know a total of sixty plus strikes over the last two years or just about sixty strikes in the last two years has not done enough to roll back the Shabaab partnering with yeah with the Somali forces with African African Union forces which are slowly withdrawing the size of the African Union contingent there continues to increase\nAnd Shabaab ... terrorists they have and and\nThat is you know the the the problem here trying to go with you know partnering with the smiling national army partnering with African Union forces\nThey just don't have the staying power they don't have the spread of course that's a possesses and that's why ... maintain a persistent\nInsurgency in the country now people will say well it's just a local insurgency it's not something the U.S should care about except there have been plots that ... there's been

M. C. A. U.S Mexico Canada announced today in the rose garden the new NAFTA\nA involves agribusiness pharmaceuticals automobiles that does not involve steel and aluminum those terrorists are to be negotiated separately certainly dairy in other words and there's and updating two of the old NAFTA including a it's a financial services and cyber\nAllen this deal wasn't happening friday night and there was rationalization and then it's announced are you surprised and what more do you want\nThis is really pretty typical for for trade deals John having them come to a to some conclusion that the eleventh hour and\nEven afterwards it say it's it's it's really like a high stakes poker game\nAnd at some point one side or the other side that it can't afford to do with no deal at all and in this case Canada clearly blinked and diplomatically speaking that's clearly a triumph for President Trump but I worry that when it comes to the manufacturing heart\nOf this new NAFTA it's going to be just as effective as the oath after at providing incentives for bringing manufacturing production in jobs back to the United states and that was supposed to be job one for President Trump when it comes to when it when it comes to overhaul and trade policy garden\nOh Alan always have the darkness and the situation\nI'm trying to hold him the high standards okay let me show you the light regardless of what one thing about NAFTA two point oh or one point five or whatever you call it what's important here is that disagreement really undercuts the momentum for a candidate China\nFree trade agreement and that I think would have been really bad for the United states in the long term because this is not of course just the trade deal this is also an issue of American security because by the way we do have a fairly long border with the Canadians\nUm so it seems to me that really there were bigger stakes here and also as the United states gets these deals with Mexico Canada the EU we're now starting to present what looks like a United front to Beijing and of all of these countries that and I know a lot of them are not good traders\nBut of all these countries the Chinese are the worst and they're the ones that pose the bigger challenge the U.S so\nI think that what the Trump Administration did here was perfect um because what if it was it put us in front of a big coalition facing China ... what do you think\nThink we're a long way from that big coalition because I really don't see anything in this new version of NAFTA that would prevent if not a formal new Canadian Chinese trade agreement to further a deepening of Chinese of Chinese Canadian trade ties and I couldn't help but\nOh it is in a lot of the press coverage that we got this morning and it could very well binge of sour grapes but but it but maybe not that many Canadians observers were saying that they felt that they got such rough treatment at the hands of\nPresident Trump that they learned their lesson and they would never again or they would do their very best to make sure that the country and never again rely so heavily on foreign trade partner to absorb so much of their exports\nOh I think the British taking over a French Quebec made that necessary come\nOut Allen well no it's ...\nWe have to remember Kennedy exports a lot of agricultural products with a lot of raw materials\nAlright alright likely with ... with us kind of I just never again that is never again never again\nIs the longest peaceful border in the world yeah I can actually see Canada right now from yeah you can literally again right and it literally can and I I'm not seeing him holding pitchforks and torches yet over this agreement [laughter]\nBut I only can you can you tell us what some of the some of the changes with Mexico where do we know about Canada and you've explained a lot about what about with Mexico sure\nOf the most important changes have to do with the automotive trade and of course automotive trade has been at the heart of North American traded diplomacy a certainly since the previous NAFTA began to be negotiated seriously by\nGeorge W Bush and the big problem I see is that it's going to be just as easy\nUnder this new version of NAFTA for non North American automobile producers to supply North America by exporting to it rather than rather than by investing in it\nAs as it was under the old NAFTA and the result of that old NAFTA with exactly what President Trump complained about the United states lost\nMillions of highways manufacturing jobs many of them automotive and clearly last global competitive and clearly last global competitiveness in the critical industry\nTo a garden how to Beijing say this deal\nI I think that Beijing is still as a real issue because they hope to use Canada is wage um and and actually to pry Canada away from the United states\nIt's a little bit more difficult now than it was a twenty four hours ago and that's a very good thing for us because it really means that we are going to keep a strong trade union or a customs area you know Mexico Canada the United states\nYou know I can understand ours um points but nonetheless when you

I'm going to all the turmoil and Brexit UK wants to deal with Canada right away and they look upon this has good news the U.S deal with Canada\nRight it's it's it's rather striking though that that although President Trump clearly sympathize with the more nationalistic impulses that war were behind breaks and the the more sovereignty\nFifteen seconds our fifteenth every he's\nNever told the Brits\nOnce you're out of that that the European Union will take care of your trade was never said\nNo he hasn't although\nAllentown Adelson Gordon Chang that his McCotter I'm\nLet's face it disease sports country with all our local professional sports teams Rhode islanders are always looking for a great way to catch the story of\nHave a few rows and enjoy some grain food some natural stance lazy is all about what the best pizza every class of late juicy burgers incredible delicious sauce and fish and chips perfect place to bring the kids in a family friendly environment\nDance piece of place one oh to victory highway west Greenwich perfect place for a friend to gather adopting a new test\nMoriarty spends can help their pep safety solutions work year round and so today was offices in Portsmouth Warwick in northeast only eight hundred two to five ... ... that evaluation and estimates for schedule on line of Moriarty spends dot com\nDiscover one more medals resent that professionals Jews Moriarty spent your invisible sprint pen solutions experts Moriarty spent eight hundred and two to five ... keeping us safe since Nineteen eighty six young\nVoice of some of the New England fast talking points in time for the latest news traffic from the revolution solved washing news on the\nList of\nWere kind of a primer are geared to recall backer man they got into an argument\nWhich had to go to the hospital because he'd been bleeding from the right here it appears that for Kavanaugh didn't cause that and then I fell but he apparently at one point did throw ice on that man and\nI was part of the larger kind of swarm that they were in and there was an eye witness that identified the other people who are involved in the Internet and they all seem to be part of Mr Kavanaugh's group of friends from\nThe FBI is also talked a long time Kavanaugh friend mark judge but his attorney says the interview has not been completed the U.S has reached a trade pact with Mexico and Canada the agreement\nCould jam up Republican enthusiasm and could help Republicans running against democratic incumbents\nOr we'll have to see where the dust settles sometimes there's a major event where member of the um Access Hollywood tape and twenty sixteen and then the president you there's no way he could win the dust settles things kind of get back to normal in the race is on the other thing so we'll see how the dust settles but for now\nLooks like it you know it is helping Republicans in the Senate races so that's where things stand\nThaddeus you lived through ... H um before a U turn to David can you comment on the possibility that this is oh six or NATO say\nWell certainly felt like a six for quite a bit but remembering oh six we started to close the gap and then the Foley issue happened right at the end\nAnd that kind of finish this off at that point in time you also have the economy was not doing well and many of the places with targeted seats and such as mind at the time in the Detroit area you could start to feel the effects of the economy is slowing down\nAnd people were very upset about that you had Iraq as well so you had war and peace we're not playing well and a lot of the suburban slashed targeted districts\nSo I think David's right we need to see where the dust is going to settle in terms of the house races or it's not going to be a great years we're always disgusted some mid term for first term president but if\nIt's just a question of whether or not it's going to be horrible or whether or not to cut their losses and actually do and respectable job\nThat last month to remind everybody Foley was represented to Florida I Believe and he had concealed his bad acting towards house pages that was revealed and he resigned Disney right before the election something like that\nHe was gone but at the end it was covering up the bad behavior by the speaker's office and others are saying and so when that became a scandal and rightly so many of us were outraged and we also news so darn voters\nAnd we knew that it was going to be here it's indefensible what's the leadership did in that instance and so you just went in there knowing that it was going to be far worse than you had originally probably Saudi even more so than men with them when that came out good you have a question for David size\nDavid in terms of the Senate we you talked about how this can kind of build the enthusiasm and one of those red states with a democratic incumbents are we seeing any type of enthusiasm gap change in the house races\nWell look the initial read on the past few days is that the Republican enthusiasm is up across the board but the issue is that the partisanship and\nThe atmosphere and house races versus Senate races in most of these house races are already in trouble because the voters there are the gun it especially female voters\nOf the gun to make a decision that they want to put a check on Trump and you're not dealing with the same kind of\nA heart is in conservative reporters and Republican as you may be dealing with an Indiana or a West Virginia or or North Dakota and so it's just a different in in what kind of voter you're dealing with an in one thing that if I wanted to add on to that one of the things that reminds me\nOf oh six it that in a lot of these districts I think you're not necessarily find the unhappiness with the Republican incumbent\nBut just the desire that you have no other choice if you want to put a check on Trump bought the vote for the Democrat and that some of the things that I've been seen and it's what we saw into sex where people were I Would say and the verbatim to the polling and would say out loud\nAnd now you know Congress and so and so he does a great job he's doing a great job for years but I just had enough of Bush and then there's nothing else I can do and it's too bad he's got to suffer for it but that's just the way it goes\nWe're joined by John Fund at the national Review Online as fun we have been commenting ... lived through oh sex when the Republicans lost the majority in the house of representatives and Nancy Pelosi became speaker and two thousand and seven comparing it to the conditions today with a month to go how do you measure cha the problem is\nMany in many areas where the district or actually competitive the problem is Republican low voter turnout and\nThat's why the Kavanaugh situation is so critical it could end up boosting democratic turnout dramatically could also end up losing Republican turnout dramatically\nWhat we do see though is of course Democrats are revved up about this election but are they were abducted the places word count because if you if you're in a democratic district and you have Donald Trump and your vote democratic it doesn't change anything\nSo that's why the cabin our race is I Love become part of a campaign we're going to be we're going to be voting in large part of the emotions and the issue stirred up by Kavanaugh which is a completely unexpected develop\nI decided to have a question for John\nMuch the same time he kind of touched on ask David earlier John about are we seeing the Republican enthusiasm applied both in the Senate which team talked about are we seeing it as well in the house districts with the house has to win because as David pointed out their different constellations ...\nSuburban or urban and the districts were for Mrs Clinton and yet have a Republican nominee I Believe they're fifty or fifty five of them John and those are well educated and well money of voters\nWould I Do know is a lot of stabs Republicans view Brett Kavanaugh as one of their own kind of ... married to a crowded Republican\nAnd a lot of them view the Democratic tactics is just appalling and if that can be combined with the Trump wrote them and some of the house just strict you might be able to drag a few of the house Republican incumbents along over the line and when a debt Republic of they're still going to have a bad election year but\nI think Kavanaugh because if the Democrats are ... seemed to have overstep the boundaries of decency and politics this they could mitigate some of those losses of these suburban seats\nGave a juicy overconfidence with the Democrats the Republicans have that as a as a constant tell when they're approaching election overconfidence how about the Democrats\nWell I think that for the liberal groups on activists that are focused on feeding Kavanaugh any way they can yeah\nI think that there may be a bit of over confident that there's no way this can cut against them I mean they they believe in this as a matter of policy\nAnd philosophy so that I don't know that they're that concerned about the politics of it but I I don't think they imagined that it could cut against them I Know that democratic strategists\nThat are in charge of healthy to win campaigns are worried about it I talk to them about it and you know they're not worried yet that it's gone or off the rails but they're worried that it could go off the rails I think and I and I know from talking to them many of them\nAnd hold them and I've talked to a few of them can extrapolate here that many of them would have preferred a quiet Kavanaugh confirmation if they had been up to them so that they could just move on to what is it working for them which is the focus on Trump and everything Trump talked about uh every single dude\nYou've mentioned to me David just quickly here that some very smart democratic up fears an empty seat on election day\nYeah yeah some of them here and have you seen a lecture maybe all of a sudden they can be a repeat of ... of twenty sixteen potentially and you're like you need to show up so that Republicans are in charge of of confirming this seat because the Democrats at this point have been pretty open with the fact that they will walk\nThat they will keep the seat open the same way Republicans kept open the turned out to be the Gorsuch seeking twenty sixteen and they they don't want that to be something that they have to fight over that they want to be about Trump\nDavid ...

joys to comment on what we know so far of a ... of the the new deal that replaces after NAFTA\nVery ... very good evening to you first my thinking here when I heard it late last night is this is brinksmanship you have been very cautious\nAbout the negotiations for some time you've been extremely unhappy with the tariff threats by the Trump Administration from what we know now about the new pack the U.S MCA\nJustice satisfy your concerns about terrorists than the U.S economy and jobs good evening to\nIn John I'm yes and no I'm so glad we have a deal I mean I'm so glad it's lifting the uncertainty\nThat investors um had weighing over them that was holding back on their investment in the U.S\n[noise] and so it's it's a really good thing we have a deal and it's a very good thing we have a Mexico us Canadian deal that was important so this this is a big relief I mean on the terrorist side I mean let's\nFace it I mean we haven't made that much progress because it was already pretty great deal that we had a with the exception really a Canadian dairy and all us exports we're going to connect Canada and um\n[noise] and Mexico duty free which is pretty remarkable um so we said a little progress on the Canadian under leftover Canadian I get\nA imports but unfortunately the metal terrorists are still up and retaliate tore tart tear it from Canada and Mexico\nAre still up let's say yes and and no and then they'll just say the auto part which is from the center of this deal is you know not a great but it's nothing like it could have been in terms of things that I'm\nAll right I Want to speak to those two aspects first medals or the I'm following the wall Street Journal reporting here us negotiators have insisted than any changed us duties on steel and aluminum that took effect in June to be addressed separately from a broader trader deal among the country's commerce secretary Wilbur Ross\nSaid recently an agreement to revise the north American trade pact with allowed negotiators turn their focus to resolving the steel aluminum standoff so therefore steel and aluminum is the obstacle ahead of us does this give them momentum to resolve that or have\nHave objections raised in these last week's may mean that steel and aluminum is impossible\n[noise] I don't know I Know\nI mean I've seen headlines suggest that the Canadians we're going to tackle the metal terrorists\nAfter the closing bell\nSo maybe there'll be more on this front to say tomorrow morning I think and an agreement between the U.S Canada and Mexico is honestly opening the door slightly ... a bigger to um to allow\nOr resolution on TV I'm On the medal terrorists it's also worth noting that um the deal this deal I you know as imperfect as it is um some improvement and that let's be honest about this um has I'm\nAlso a providing a protection for Canada and Mexico again the upcoming threat of\nTerrorists which would be quite devastating to to the trade between Canada and Mexico and the U.S [noise] so\nI think I think we're making progress we're not there yet but we'll see\nLet's go to the cars are the manufactured um vehicles part of this as I understand it and and the details were not rich but that there's an agreement here to manufacture large parts of the automobiles in Canada and the EU\nThat's where the wages are high and not in Mexico where the wages are not hot you that well and also\nYeah that's and also by the way for like try to block or create that this is not that she used part from um countries where wages are lower than in Mexico um that's not a good thing that increases the cost\nOf ... understand I understand so is this something that did not exist and now after this a portion of a you know say you have your standard Toyota did we divvy it up in this fashion in the old NAFTA or did the old enough to let you make your car where it was cheapest\nWell so um they was a requirement a source requirement for your part and it was sixty percent I'd have to be sourced and the three region and now it is moving to Seventy five percent\nSo um it's not as if there was in terms of source thing that was non there was nothing however there was no a neighbor requirement that I Know of especially that are so high and putting Mexico such a disadvantage [noise] um\nSo but as far as I Know there was none of that we were really exporting or bad\nOr bad labor laws and and it's even more shocking to the ... that\nIf the Democrats were trying to force these type of labor laws are minimum wage increases on American businesses the Republicans will be serious and rightfully so because they would understand how much distortion that create in the labor market\nThe expectation is that this has to go through Congress next year and the the reasonable assumption is that at least part of the Congress will be democratic\nAnd so the labor part of the negotiation looks to be a compromise with ... which is that that they can use in Congress so let's move to another part which is the dairy dairy farmers reports the wall Street Journal got what they asked for it in a new version\nSo the ice cream and milk tariffs that we're holding everything up turned out to not be profound I guess that's not a big number but it does make a comeback happy\nYes but um it's also let's face it right well it will benefit this moving towards closer to zero I'm On a on dairy terrorists um it's um it's really good for 'em for\nCanadian consumers I mean these are the true beneficiary of these changes and and that is great and they were so there are you there are few farmers who uh who benefits from it um in in the U.S but the true true true beneficiary are are in the Canadian consumers\nAnd drugs I'm told that I'm following the reporting the deal extends to ten years the minimum data protection period for biologic drugs\nAnd that means that Mexico and Canada will wait longer for lower costs copies of brand name medicine so that's a concession on their part and that supports our big farm\nPresident Obama marked the end dismissed his proposal saying it it it's it's all gone to the wedding now globalism is here to stay that says the new normal you cannot bring manufacturing jobs back\nTo the u._s. what do you have a magic wand well it turns out that President Trump does not have a magic wand but he does have a superb negotiating skills and first he struck a deal with the Mexican government and then they put the screws to the Canadian government Justin Trudeau the prime minister young\nDashing a hip\nAnd cool but his poll numbers are not very good and he realized that candidate was going to be left out in the cold unless they got to the table and negotiated with the president ministry and they came to the table\nThey hammered out this deal and the president ought to be extremely proud of actually getting a replacement in place for NAFTA which put American workers and American taxpayers at\nA ferry a significant disadvantage for the last what thirty or so years he was able to turn that ship around when\nEverybody else that it couldn't be done\nWe are finished the third quarter we'll get the first estimate of the third quarter growth right before the election the expectation is for it to be four point to which was the second quarter or better\nI spoke with Europe in these last hours Monica we're the envy of the world the European Union is growing it like points for while we're growing at ... four point plot\nSo the NAFTA deal only the new NAFTA which has us MCA will only enrich some more I'm not waiting for the president get credit because this is Supreme Court week\nI have an announcement will get credit after the Supreme Court week will have an announcement from Mitch McConnell on the floor of the Senate today I read\nThe majority leader's remarks that he believes that this is a smear on the good name and family\nOf Brett Kavanaugh he says his good name and his family have been dragged through the mud with a campaign of character assassination based on an allegation that lack any corroboration McConnell goes on to say the time for enlisted ally an obstruction has come to a close\nWill be voting this week it look like the Republicans have although slow to this Monica have got themselves organized is the party paying attention\nFinally John yes and in fact I have a column coming tomorrow morning up the hill which has also post on my Facebook and my Twitter account that talks about not only the Democratic cat a assassination a machine gun tactics\nThat they've used on Kavanaugh\nWhich they also used on Clarence Thomas which they also used on Robert Bork\nEt cetera but they're they're\nA real voting hypocrisy and they're trying to think tank in Modi which they have used out this process to try to take\nA Kavanaugh out at the Supreme Court nominee\nAnd I you know it comes to mind when when you hear them\nA speak from their their ivory tower purchases on the Senate Judiciary committee about school drinking on the part of Kavanaugh or college drinking on the part of having all the cars these gusting John\nAnd I actually yeah recount the scene from Nineteen eighty five of a certain US Senator from Massachusetts who sixteen years earlier got drunk and actually killed a woman\nSixteen years later he I'm One of his fellow democratic Senator Chris Dodd a waitress on a table and sexually assaulted her I'm speaking of course have cats\nKennedy the lake Kennedy who was lying by the left as a progressive icon and granted it's state funeral when he died but the focus are sitting in judgment of Brett Kavanaugh for having a couple of years in high school and college you know these people really take the cake John\nThe American people eat through it that's why the polling it's starting to move against them particularly those very vulnerable red state Democrats\nYes I Want to know if the ... of the Republicans are waking up Monica because I Would wake up for the news we lead with which was the U.S MCA than new NAFTA deal and the four percent plus economy that means people are working that means families are stable that means the growth of the United states is restored that's what I wakes me up\nBut apparently that is enough for the Republican Party\nA so the question is is the cabinet character assassination enough for the party to get to the polls or not\n[noise] yes now from what I'm saying you know Democrats had it and if he hasn't been the energy gap heading into this whole process right we kept hearing about the right way to come out and vent their frustrations about\nTrump and the whole truck era but now we're seeing polling comfort coming from Ross my son and some other places that now the CIO he had to close that gap that Republican voters and the independents are in just by what they're seeing here and that is transparent political job of very good that\nThey're outraged by it and now that the one problem that Republicans had was a sense of complacency well now I think the Democrats themselves into it because that complacency problem seems to be gone\nDianne Feinstein this is this is a challenge Monica because she's acting extremely aggressively without explanation making claims making allegations\nAnd also ... feeling or let's put it this way maintaining silence and the questions about how she handled the original allegations from Ford how the letter was handled\nDianne Feinstein I chose to my surprise Monica is now the the the person most in charge of this character assassination in the Democratic party Chuck Schumer seems to have faded into the woodwork business Feinstein's work are you surprised\n[noise] no well look her evolution has been happening over a number of years she used to be she came out of San Francisco of course\nBut she used to be a relatively moderate Senate intelligence committee he used to be somewhat of a voice of freezing at a party that was getting increasingly more radical uh\nBecause the party has gotten more radical she had\nA primary challenge the state a Democratic Party in California did not die Kerr until the move against Kavanaugh makes total sense if you put Dianne Feinstein at the age of what is she eighty five\nShe's this she's just the eighties right she asked me if\nI if you take her and put her in the new context of her party at this little environment it actually does make sense but what a way for Dianne Feinstein complete her political ten year\nBut should our thing a special edition of Monica Crowley we'll speak with Monica later in the week right now the news is that McConnell centered and call in charge of the Senate has said there will be a vote this week lots of time for the Democrats to smear the mole\nI'm

information what they'll have to read it in a private room that information cannot be released publically will have very limited number of staffers will have access to that information\nSo that raises a key question that I've been told me a lot of senators and top aides about\nHow is the public or how are the center is going to be able to talk about what they find or what the FBI sends back\nIn New York Times is reporting that Kavanaugh was questioned by police after a bar fight in Nineteen eighty five but he was not arrested the U.S has reached a trade pact with Canada and Mexico correspondent Natasha ...\nI Believe that the my favorite anecdote is the armed robber who continued to work at the VA because there were no rules against it so\nYou do like to come back to that one at the at at no

want anyone to do anything underhanded or to benefit them personally or any of that it's just that they're not accountable to anybody on the house or Senate Veterans' Affairs committee anyone else in Congress or anyone\nPublicly that anybody can tie any particular policy to one of those people and ask him questions about it so I didn't want people thinking that there's some that there are some ... bits conspiring against veterans or anything like that that doesn't appear to be a case it's just there's no transparency and accountability to your question\nI'm ah about what happens um ... what is happening with secretary Wilkie is he's leading the depart right morale morale I'm keen on morale\nTwo of these wonderful reporters to cover the VA our own government matters on the program tonight Nikki went link from stars and stripes and Leo Shane from the military times and we joked as we started to record the segment that this would be their last appearance on the program because\nThere's not going to be any more news coming out to be a sin secretary Wilkie told the committee that things are calming down a morale is improving and VA is now a nonpartisan organization and we joke that\nThere are services would no longer be needed on my program since apparently everything's fine obviously everything's not find that the department of Veterans Affairs given the problems that you and I talked about in the past but that that the thrust the message that the secretary wanted to get across to the committee was\nThat he was cleaning up all the things that they have been worried about it in the past and that they especially\nSaid to him at his confirmation hearing these are things that we expect you to clean up he wanted to very clearly deliver the message that he was getting on that case it was doing so\nA detail here Frances I 'cause I remember the bill for the Denver hospitals it took many years and was long long a controversy that she's got two hundred billion dollars in the new budget or have they learned their lesson about overspending I about extravagance what's your sense we have about a minute\nWelding the acquisition folks that I talked to inside the department of Veterans Affairs\nTell me that they are going to work a lot more extensively with private sector\nOr contractors who build hospitals for a living and they're going to rely on a wisdom from other government organizations like the general services administration and the Army Corps of engineers who built big buildings on a regular basis instead of trying to think it all up on their own that's what really got them into trouble in Denver\nSo that is a partial answer for will be more careful in future we won't run over budget we won't freelance on our own will uh will follow

[noise]\nI'm John ... the John ... show Sammy constable my Brexit watch her reports for barons and\nThe wall Street Journal and other and farms and other distinguish publications watching now the news from London as the short time presses all parties to have a Brexit deal in place before the end of the European Union as we know it so I'm In a very good morning good evening to you in Scotland\nAre right now there's lots of gossip coming out of London about the\nConservatives the Tories having there once a year meeting and their thrashing about whether they will or will not ... the polling says that's the majority are nearly sixty percent of the Tories in parliament one Brexit but there is a an adamant\nMinority that's against all resolution now you are a net and borrow than I care a great deal about Scotland you know I went to school there for a few years so\nUh what is the end this for Scotland and how is Scotland watching uh the ... the turmoil in other conservatives good evening to you\nYou didn't hear John thanks I'm On the show the ... the fantastic thing about breakfast if nothing else it's very entertaining for everybody to watch because they never a dull moment you have for us Johnson you I'm Michael\nGr view have Theresa May and the cast of other very colorful characters [noise]\nWhat is what is the key sticking point on a lot of what's going on with breakfast for the European Union is the Irish border that if the the border between Northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland\nIt's a it's a very touchy Massa and it dates back to the circle troubles um that were you know it started in the late sixties and went on through the early nineties and it was horrible period and no one wants to repeat of it [noise]\nSo what scolding just doing now and particularly a Nicholas sturgeon who's the minister of Scotland she will be looking at Michigan famous she will be looking to see if there's a special deal for Northern Ireland\nSo that it may be sort of neither in the u._k. and went out to the u._k. some sort of something special because if that happens may be scalding can say well if that getting a special deal that has absurd off in a house maybe we can have a special off in ... deal because Scotland is very pro you're paying\nA much more pro European than say London or the south east of the u._k.\nAnd you're not especially tore in Scotland and from some for many years it was labor dominating the Scottish\nUh districts and then I think the Scottish uh the Scottish national party did very well in the election before last and now you're watching from a distance that's why I'm watching Brexit at Simon I read the headlines from breakfast and they're totally confusing I'm not going to step into that it's hard enough for me to solve NAFTA\nAnd the dealing that were going on here so I'm going to move to a way of watching Brecht said which is to watch the euro uh currencies are uh I I pour but adequate substitute for the the news headlines\nThe euro's been beat up badly and you have a piece of Barron's saying that to be that at the polling is so bad it might be time or two to bet on the euro why Simon and how do you bet on the euro\n[noise] well it's an interesting story actually one of the things we know and this is all out that is that the U.S is growing really really really well it's booming growth is high unemployment is really where the law\nThe European Union the euro area which doesn't include the u._k. but doesn't include Ireland and the other big economies on the confidence like Germany and France\nThat that the economy's going quite slowly it's been limping limping along with low inflation and you know a lot of the Mediterranean Countries not doing very well like Italy and Spain\nSo everybody knows this and so they all sort of bats on on on the dollar I'm taking that money from Europe and I have a flood into the U.S where factories\nBell to money invested in the stock market\nAnd here's the thing when every body is bullish on one thing that it's likely to be at a very tall point that it's going to be even temporarily and so right now everybody's bullish on the dollar and everybody who's got money that is it bearish on the euro so you could expect things to kind of ... us\nAnd and I think it will reverse bats that's how you you look at it and how you bet on it if you look at the uh the euro futures markets and ah you can also look at the ATF for the euro and you can best match\nI mean you can also look at again options so are you willing to be I'm going to be so called long the euro so that I Would buy euros so maybe the euro U. T. F. or actually experience credit farmed and you can make some money on it you know\nIt is a brutally tricky market to get right because you're up against central banks like the bank of England the Federal Reserve and all the rest of it but there is some money to be like\nUm the euro's now down I Believe it's well under one twenty which is shocking to me given that I've travelled in Europe when it's in the one fifty one forty one fifties and the pound has been in the sixties that's been a retreat to\nSo for some time now the European currencies you have in the u._k. both the euro and the pound have been in retreat is that related to Brexit for you I mean it's just a Brexit story Simon is that why the ... the euro and the pound or so we\n... the the pound just wait for primarily because of Brexit the u._k. economy has been vibrant for a long time or it has tremendously low unemployment it also has box numbers of immigrants who've come from elsewhere in the European Union because they want to be here now you don't you don't come to Scotland for the whether\nYou're ... you're gone it's lovely here I like it but there's a bit of rain like every half hour\nOr so when people are coming here it's because the economy's great so I'll be the plunge in the pound which was like you say about one Seventy not that long ago it primarily due to breakfast\nThe the weakness of the euro is really nothing to do with breakfast it's to do with the fact that the the whole European eurozone economy is just fairly slow growing\nWhen you stop wasting it or you know things like you know France and Germany being off the entire eurozone right so those two countries are growing fairly slowly and that's that's what's really going on\nNow NAFTA we have an announcement that NAFTA has been changed to something called the U.S MCA doesn't sing way NAFTA does but\nIt's the United states and Mexico and Canada and that that negotiation which was fraught with twelve sour uh twelfth our moments\nHas now concluded at least in the first phase yes the treaty has to go to Congress and yes the Congress is likely to be very very very suspect especially if part of the Congress has in the house and the hands of the Democrats\nHowever it does suggest that the U.S is ready to make new deals here in the twenty first century that includes such things as financial services\nAnd digital which didn't exist back to the Nineteen nineties is there talk in Scotland our talk in the u._k. about the U.S doing a bilateral deal with the u._k. would that be welcome in parliament\nThat would certainly be welcome in parliament so I'm One of the things that you can say we know or you don't want Trump is the dealmaker in chief and he's you know been cutting coming as many deals as he can and renegotiating a life in Britain would absolutely love that we we share a very similar legal system\nI'm so I'm looking at in in a way I think that all of your listeners we can all sympathize with somebody wants to do well by an important American institution like an apartment of justice like the Federal Bureau of investigation however the various\nThings that the OJ and the FBI did during the two thousand sixteen presidential campaign both she uh irregularities and abuses regarding the Clinton server investigation\nAnd the irregularities and likely crimes that were committed in the Trump Russia pro I think I I think we'd all be more comfortable if he were helping clean up\nThe mess rather than to obscure the different problems that we are going on there so I suspect that he's a that there are a lot of anxious times over there in the jeopardy journey attorney general's office\nThe hiring of Bob Mueller or that has thrown the whole country and this wait and see mode or the president has spoken poorly of Muller he spoke and partly of Rosenstein is for the spoken poorly of Russia gate\nAt this point you measure you mentioned those documents you measure that Rosenstein is looking to protect the institution surely he knows that the documents that would be the face of a warrant number four in June twenty Seventeen that Rod Rosenstein signed\nThat would be a sculptor tore information about Carter Page and that would be the three of his for Bruce or in addition to the president and ordered\nThe revelation of all text messaging by the principles that the FBI and the D. O. J. and the twenty sixteen\nYou measure that rather than seeing his keeping those back not because he's interested in protecting some version of Russia gate but because he's an institutional as well so how does that how does that interpret why why is he denying us information Y Z denying us information\nNo no not just because he didn't and not just because he's an institutional is he wants to protect the institution but\nI Believe he's also protecting an operation here against a candidate Trump president elect Trump and then later the presidency itself we would like to know we would like to know what the uh you know the the the scope memo that he wrote for Robert\nMother saying the outline of the investigation\nMost investors redacted we'd like to know what this says ah the fact that the fact that the OJ has pushed back so hard on congressional oversight committees wanting to see what that says I I think it's I think it's fairly significant\nUm this is what we do know is is that the Mueller investigation and this is very important for people to understand I Believe\nBut the mother investigation is a continuation\nOf the FBI's investigation that again in ... in July to thousands sixteen\nWhich was opened on the Papadopoulos story which looks more and more bogus by the day as it falls apart as figures like Alexander down or the Australian diplomat walk this back\nAnd this was also the investigation in which the FBI use the Clinton funded opposition research to secure a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign official\nSo the fact that this same investigation is continuing\nUnder the control of Robert Mueller who is being managed by Rod Rosenstein yes this is a serious concern\nAnd look there's another there's another document I'd I'd point to and there are other important\nFact I went to in their when rose in sting appointed the special counsel to move that investigation from the FBI to the D O D J right he\nCould've just let the deputy director of the FBI and Jim McKay because you know has problems of his own right now facing a grand jury here in Washington D. C.\nBut he moved away from him and put it under his own control this also should tell us something about the a bureaucratic gamesmanship of the deputy attorney general\nThe deputy attorney general was not involved in the original Russia gay scandal of Tony sixteen he did get involved however\nFor that for five so war it is that a a his that vulnerability for ... does he believe it's a vulnerability that he saw a sign that document the documents that we want to see twenty additional not redacted pages from\nRight right yes I think it is a loner ability I mean among other things it was spying\nThen on Trump associates or as I point out of the peace and would have allowed him it would have allowed the yeah I Do listen to intercept amount of their communications a very high level officials in the administration at the time\nPerhaps or even likely the president himself that's a very bad thing or the other\nThing that I point out that when we're asking what is the redacted information what are the things that then the new as another a congressional leaders ask to see what are they telling us that's worse\nOr at least as bad as\nThe fact that the Steele dossier was the premise of this or that is the premise\nOf the ... what else is bad in there well Rod Rosenstein signed it whatever it is I Would imagine he doesn't want the president and doesn't want a lot of other people seeing it\nRod Rosenstein his name is on that and the question I asked him the article is\nRosenstein is the best that maybe he didn't read the application for the war and so that's one possibility he didn't read it while that would be negligence that would be professional professional negligence the other possibility is he did read it\nAnd he doesn't want people knowing that he signed off on something very bad that the FBI was doing\nA regarding President Trump at that point\nRosenstein right now uh the facing the question being fired or not is he in line to stay on for the rest of the first term or the rest of the term depending on how the election goes in twenty twenty or is he in line to step aside the way many people rotate after the first two years how do you read it\nYeah I I mean the way I see it as right now uh especially with the cabinet nomination I mean there's a lot when this White House and there's a lot through the ... J to uh be focused on right now and so I Believe a\nAnd sources and told me that the president does not want to stir the pot anymore but it needs the third and that would likely happen if the deputy attorney general either a if he was fired or if he resigns so I think right now certainly up\nTo the election up to November I Believe in a way that\nThe White House will try to keep the department of justice as stable as it possibly can while attempting other equally important business again like securing the non uh like securing Trump's nomination but Kavanaugh\nI Believe that after the election I'm there will be I don't know you you can describe it as people rotating out and other people were rotate again that's happened with this administration which by the way I think is a is generally a good thing to get people to do certain\nJobs and then you bring someone else in the weather's a or we can just say that yes it it looks like a Mr Rosen's dean is likely to be on his way out after a after the elections regardless of whether or not um Democrats take back the house or the Republicans hold him\nLeave Smith running it real clear investigations on the fate of Rod Rosenstein the deputy attorney general for the next weeks I'm John bachelor this is John ...

control are those two surfaces working together given the scale of the challenge in the Pacific ad in the north Atlantic\nNo no they're not working together and that's part of the purpose of this paper is that even after the Goldwater Nichols act of Nineteen eighty six of the navy in the air force of not gotten together to come up with a joint concept of operations in for that matter both of them have been proceeding of based upon assumption of easy access to the theater so\nOne of the areas where the air forces\nAnd uh where they are very out of balance as they've over emphasized short range fighter aircraft that can also serve and then it you know air to ground attack role um despite the fact that these anti access technology is coming along so whereas in the beginning of the air force the bomber community really dominated\nToday it's the light attack fighter community that dominates and even if the air force makes investment just finding by for instance Seventeen hundred and sixty three thirty five alpha is but they're only playing to buy one hundred new be Twenty one when\nBe Twenty one would actually be the platform uh that uh that has the most emphasis of the most utility and I point out because I switched from being at at CNN yes\nOver to being at telling us right now uh one of the one of the clients that I Do advise ... is a is an aircraft manufacturer Northrop Grumman uh that that\nThe manufacturers be Twenty one but I wrote this paper prior to coming into this environment\nWe lack a sea bass long range penetrating precision strike that means that something off of the carrier is that a debate at the navy that we ... that this component is not there for the year twenty fifth day when Xi Jinping's says they will dominate\nSo it it is a debate but unfortunately it's not a strong debate the navy or specifically if we look at what it is done in deciding on the new ... twenty five ... aircraft which they recently down selected to one variant they made a decision to go with a mission tanker\nFor an unmanned aircraft on board the carrier deck\nRather than making an investment in an unmanned long green strike bomber which is something that they could have done had they made some decisions differently a couple of years ago\nSo the navy has not come to grips with its strategic shortsighted in us on leaving the long range mission and has not come up with a useful or adaptation or concept of operation\nThat will allow its air wing to bridge that span of distance for allow navy aircraft to be able to strike targets of shore\nUh right now as I understand that the Trump Administration has recommended a force for class carrier\nAnd a ... in addition to the carriers that are now either by at sea or in in rotation a but building a carrier that doesn't have this strike seems uh a few child doesn't it\nDoesn't it it does it does and this is one of the things and and I have been supportive of the idea\nOf building up our carrier force back up to twelve but it's all been based upon the presumption that the navy would seriously engage on the relevance\nOf the carrier by investing in its carrier air wing to again get long range strike back on the platform or we need a twelve carrier right now there's new stories out there that the USS Eisenhower\nAh which has been one of our most used aircraft carriers or is it going to have to extend her stay in the yard for an additional Eighteen months he was supposed to be in six months\nShe is a so in in such bad material condition sharp to be in for two years\nWe need to get some additional carriers out there to take the strain off of the current fleet but the carriers will not be relevant in the future war if their air wings are not properly equipped to be able to expand the distance and so you need new unmanned platforms you also need a new generation of missiles\nThat have longer range faster speeds and lower radar cross sections in order to penetrate these new anti

Thomas Bogart and starting with the U.S government the user here is so has\nCreated the circumstances dramatically that brought America into the first World War in Nineteen Seventeen and they hinge upon a fantastic opera called the Zimmerman Telegram\nZimmerman Telegram intercepted by the British because they routinely read the mail of the gentleman called Americans that's what they did it in the decoded they laughed at American codes they regarded them as simple as the German codes were a little better the Germans have changed their codes a few times but they were good at that too there are a couple of guys name\nNigel ... gray and others in the room forty that find reading a code easy a unimportant deep distinction Thomas you make in your book\nWhat is the difference between a code an aside for\nA a a that's a good question and it took me some some time to understand that aside for its essentially take one letter and replace it with another\nDay to be for instance if you change if you change one letter to another or one simple to another it's a it's a ... for a cold is if you if you use a word um I'm In place off another word of another symbol so that's that's the whole difference there um and uh the\nDemo and telegram was it cold it was not a cipher\nIt was in a code and there were several code set the Germans were using Thirteen oh four oh five nine five o seven five hundred was another way of talking about their code summer summer good summer dad you have a code book you conquer words and once you conquer word and you see it's repetition\nYou when you come to it again you know that's what they're using for example Zimmerman's name itself had a code and when you recognize that you saw that Zimmerman had scientists telegram\nCompared to what we do today was signals intelligence is a simple ... remember where before digital communication we're ...\nAnd also were before the first and second war the taught everybody that gentleman do read each other's mail all the time in fact\nThey read it so much they say gentlemen's mail and that's why history is a mystery always when you re discover how people came to decisions All right the telegram is intercepted hole gets it and he goes through what I have to say Thomas is\nA the work of a great novelist he created world within world so that there's always doubt about how the cameraman telegram came into the hands of\nThe foreign secretary bow forward to hand to page on February twenty third and it creates such a world of mirrors that you spend a deal of your book\nOr a a a translating those who have written about the ... over the last hundred years including all who either middle representative or misunderstood it your book itself is a work of crept analysis Thomas congratulations\nThank you thank you very much thank you very much housework\nIs genius\nAnd he has to be one of the icons of signals intelligence is he given credit for that hearing the twenty first century\nOh I think absolutely I think he absolutely is he is credited as one of the fathers of of a crypt analysis\nNow the interesting thing is of course hall himself had a very weak grass of crypt analysis he himself was not was not a natural code breaker I'm On a ... you can see it as ... sometimes confuse us these different codes and\nYou know you have to read his memoirs with care because sometimes it's deliberate disinformation and sometimes I think he just doesn't understand you know the uh the fine points of ... but he didn't have to be he was a fantastic manager\nAnd he was a political animal and I think this is what what what made him into a grant from the British perspective\nI'm a such a success story it wasn't that whole\nWhole you how to hire the right people and he knew how to manage these people well they all admired him these these these these amazing quote breakers um but he himself wasn't really a concern with this um with this new show um if I may I Would just like to elaborate a little bit on what happened of\nCourse and by the by what I Would say is that hall is jobs and crypt analysis is a ... that's the difference between jobs is the ... the empire with what you'd have to say are create a creative ideas can like Todd is yes\nI like that no that's that's that's a good analogy um what happened and and I think\nThis this kind of you know it goes a long way to explain\nWhy hall was so successful at what he did when the British intercepted gentlemen telegram hum hum as it goes through London\nAt the time you know again they were routinely intercepting American telegrams and and then also the Germans that were embedded and then um he he understands as you as you said that he has a bombshell in his hand see understand if you give this to the Americans\nThis this will have an impact on because here we have in Germany basically offering American territory to to Mexico and and by implication also to Japan and he also understands that he needs to be really really careful in my interpretation of holds actions at the time is that his main concern was not that the Germans would find out\nHow hall had gotten hold up the\nTelegram but that the American sport as you said you know they were ... intercepting American um there were cheating intercepting American communications I'm In London and uh if the Americans\nUm had at that point asked hole\nWhere was this telegram actually coming from he wouldn't have a good answer and would not have a good\nAnd he would have to give up a his access to jewels and he was very shrewd because he was thinking beyond the war and\nSlow down and also it would play play into those into the hands of those Americans\nThat were saying hey you know the British they're just trying to pull us into the war to get the chest knocked out of the fire for them when does elemental iguana bench Lee is published in the u._s. press and we'll get to that at this point there were people were asking hey how how how this telegram how was this intercepted ... how did we get this and the first place\nAnd if it was if it had been reviewed by the time that this was a British Intelligence propaganda operation it could have played out very differently so so all the schools to save a whole Lawrence if a telegram the first place he is so concerned that this doesn't get out that he doesn't even tell the foreign office which\nYou know by by law he should have um a because of his concern he he he was he was concerned that the Americans would learn 'em that he was\nIntercepting American messages and to his dying day I'm In in the late Nineteen thirties or early forties he never admitted um how he had originally intercept the telegraph\nIn fact it created several legends one of which was that it was
