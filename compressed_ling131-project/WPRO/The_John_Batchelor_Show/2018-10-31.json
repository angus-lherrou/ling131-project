have the advantage of lower tax rate comparisons will be tougher but so far you're still looking at a pretty good earnings games for the fourth quarter and I think beyond why because we're still growing and the best news I think that came out today is that consumer confidence\nWas off the charts I don't mean\nUp a modest amount it was at an Eighteen year high consumer confidence what does that tell me that tells me we're going to have a gang busters fourth quarter because that is driven very heavily by holiday sales and I think a consumer is going into that quarter feeling flush\nUh and ready to spend a lot of money and I mentioned that particularly because when Amazon reported their ranks which was viewed as the earnings themselves were excellent but the guy was going forward including for the fourth quarter was rather tempered a people sort of interpreted that immediately\nAs having to do with a slow down on consumer spending I Do not and I don't think Amazon ever really presented it that way or it had to do with other businesses that they're trying to launch 'em and various other factors but I did not meet that I'm as a negative about the fourth quarter I think we've got a very good fourth quarter\nLoose staying with us talk of the wall street for just a moment I was taught over these last decades always listening that rotation in the ... and the growth stocks

twenty Nineteen does anybody think that's accurate\nWell I think they only I Know I I don't see a recession and all that data\nThat goes into forecasting the recession like knitting indicators and by the way stock prices and things like that really don't look that way to me at all\nThey're also struggling a lot of them with\nA getting into businesses that are more competitive I I don't hear much talk about this but they're all talking about cloud services for example as a big area of growth well guess what they are a lot of big companies a cloud atlas I was the biggest uh but they're not the only company in that industry and\nMicrosoft an IBM or both competitor amateur recall\nI mean there's a whole bunch of companies so you know I think a little bit when you're talking about searched Google it apparently Google controlled something on believable like eighty five percent right of all search they do not control\nEighty five percent of anything else so I think that's an issue and finally Facebook a report it today and they beat estimates as as a lot of companies have this quarter\nUm but in the stock was taken down at one point six percent because again there I was in very good well what's ... what's their problem partly again trying to gin up\nA business as like messaging where they have some increased competition but also um ... ... they are having to add a lot of people to monitor their site as you know a lot of ah there's been a lot of\nPolitical unrest about hate speech showing up on\n'em ... news on these platforms like ... a Facebook also a fake news showing up interference with the elections all this kind of stuff well how does Facebook really\nMonitor two billion users a day answer is they do but they're adding lots and lots of people to look like they're trying uh whether or not that successful we'll see I don't particularly think is going to be um but the cost and create so that was pretty significant in the quarter and that hurt them\nBefore we go to politics straight up and talk about the polling and the weaknesses and strength of the parties is is the market reflecting in some way anxiety about the mid term you know are they over interpreting events as they do because they're selling stock they're not buying stocks\nIt's a good question and uh I don't know the answer to that I think most people have felt for several times that there was going to be a a takeover by Democrats at\nThe right or is that it is right up political science yes Democratic House yes\nExactly and that the Republicans control the Senate since that is still the prevailing wisdom I don't think the market would be trading or radically on that\nBasis but you know you don't know um\nAnd and I got to tell you we will get into this but if in fact the Nancy Pelosi Adam Schiff Maxine Waters group\nTakeover significant committees in the house it is it a question of nothing getting done it's a question of endless investigations into the White House and to President Trump it's going to be extremely unpleasant and uncomfortable and I think\nPeople who are sort of thinking about as light view that as a negative for the stock market but let me up at at one thing\nBecause of the ups and downs of the market because the latest waiting in that third quarter report of inflation was well below or well with that I should say that as a desire court

author most recently with art Laffer our other dear colleague of Trump ... inside the American first plan to revive our economy said\nIs it accurate to say that Larry would get the blame so Larry gets all the credit for this to a roaring economy good evening state\n[laughter] Hi Larry yeah you've got a lot of enemies that Larry Summers no south and you're right I mean now it's like there's a\nLot of the economy right now it it's almost impossible to find anything that is an avid Norris drums or jobs or whether it's advancement or whether it's a ... wages that no one thing I Would add to what Larry said that I find that's interesting you know we get see or you know a burst of consumer spending at the last uh GDP report\nAnd and this I think concert ex yeah that somehow the middle classes not benefit from these policies you don't get at blockbuster consumer spending a number like that if if the middle class does you know like there are financially that are up are flush with cash that their paychecks are a little bigger\nAnd you know what what Americans you know like they've got a little one my pocket you know they go out and that was that and they you know ... well that's a lot of shopping at this this lie that's being that's that's the last cycle\nThat only the rich that instead of this tax cuts it's is it sell exposed as alive as consumers I think what other quick point you know I've been traveling a lot around the country in the last ...\nOr I go John whether it's you know Portland Maine or to Portland, Oregon all you see is construction spending it's it's the most ... opened this must be just construction boom in American history with with with these cranes everywhere in the sky whether it's\nYou know whether it's Nashville, Tennessee or Memphis or Los Angeles or San Francisco or Denver, Colorado even Detroit and Cleveland so it's it's a ... I think Larry's right this is this is ... ... as a boom that's hit every area there pal\nLarry and that's that's a no go ahead I'm Sorry go ahead\nJust one quick point um I mentioned a moment ago that um blue collar employment was rising at a fast pace since the mid eighties um blue collar wages\nAre rising faster than white collar wages now don't get me wrong I'm more than happy for\nWhite collar workers to succeed in fact I Want all workers to succeed in fact uh I think there's no crime and more people working successfully but it is interesting\nThat for the first time in decades the blue collar folks are gaining wages faster than the white collar folks and I think again that has a lot to do with the supply side nature of this expansion where the corporate tax rate\nAre dropping to Twenty one percent the small business rates dropping too about Nineteen percent um that is paying off\nSo that blue collars people who own and operate their own companies and businesses and they are hiring and that's why the blue collars are doing the best they've done\nIn many decades I think that's something that again many of my good friends on the other side of the trial or they don't want to talk about it but you know it Henry Kissinger used to say\nAn argument is always better John when it has benefited by the facts and at some point are critics will have to acknowledge the fact\nI wanted to add to that about blue collar Larry because I Do small business reporting all the\nTime and what I'm told repeatedly these last weeks is a small business confidence has never been higher these were the first people to endorse or embrace wrong a Donald Trump early in the campaign cycle and I've puzzled about it what did they know that everybody all the smart guys don't know\nThey're still very confident about the economy and they're the ones who do the majority of hiring and all the jobs in America and the job creation\nWell I think you know going back to the campaign\nA candidate Trump argued again and again that the war against businesses over and the war against success is over and if you keep more of what you earn or risk or invest\nA you will be rewarded rather then penalize that's the beauty of the lower marginal tax rates and you know two years later that's what we are seeing\nThe fund is legally controlled by the fund provider and you have a advisory privileges on your account\nAnd you can use money in that account immediately or it can be invested and grow tax free\n... can be open to by individuals families corporations ... foundations or even nonprofit groups I'm so any down to revise fund can do all those things are and they are very useful simple tax friendly and more importantly if it matters to you private way of\nGiving us a tax fund let's concentrate on that because to heritage that's all the news right now we've got a mid term coming up\nTax friendly if especially in blue let's start with the blue states uh which I'm happy to participate in I'm surrounded by blue states New Jersey Connecticut and of course New York what is the advantage particularly for blue staters this year\nSure from a purely tax standpoint I'm oftentimes it comes down to uh do you want to have a private foundation or do you want to open a death\nOr and the reality is it private foundations have significantly lower the tax deduction limit than to than their donor revise fun\nSo for example don't advise fun I'm can read the tax deduction of sixty percent of aid GI for all cash gifts compared to thirty percent for a private foundation a which is a pretty significant difference especially if you're in this blue states\nUm and have that that need predictability\nYes the duct ability is everything because you advise get the deductions you do have a line them up and move into a donor advised trust I see that this doesn't require you to be super wealthy or even the high high net worth\nAnd because the average ... account if I read this correctly and an article that you passed on to me is two hundred and Ninety nine thousand dollars [noise]\nUm I Would say it's actually even less than two hundred Ninety nine thousand dollars yet if the minimum contribution for adapt account ranges from five thousand dollars up to twenty five thousand dollars\nAnd um which is ... and you did not need to maintain that amount\nTo sort of is able to to be able to benefit from that you could open up at five thousand dollars and spend it all down you can spend it down over the course of several years so I think it's really important to notice that note that the anybody can open a daughter of eyes fun there's a perception sometimes that oh if you are\nA philanthropist that means you have a Carnegie type wealth they have a private foundation and the reality is that the deaths are beautiful way of for democratize a philanthropist across the country\nYes let's press the costs here if I read correctly to open your own charitable foundation can cause Fifteen thousand dollars initially plus you need lawyers but ... to ... to open a dive we can call up last invader and say how do I do this and you make a contribution right away and you're and you and your ...\nThat's exactly right I mean once you find you can find the count with cash security property and as soon as that account is funded you are ready to go and most to in our case you could open up an account as a matter of minutes not an account not a matter of days and months and no legal fees at all and then the minimum grant distribution is relatively low\nYes it's five percent for charitable foundation what is it for DAS\nRight five percent of the ... foundation with first who you are legally obligated to to contribute five percent of your core a in an annual here or there is no such limit on a daughter of Iceland so you ah can decide to grab all of the money and your account out in a given year you can opt to grant and none of it out in a given year\nWhat a donor advise fun allow us is for the donor that would be the boomer to direct how that money to be used in perpetuity how does that how does that part work loss\nYeah we're getting to the idea of donor intent um and donor intent I think an extraordinarily important concept um because the truth of the matter is a wealth does not act\nPass on very well to the next generation and and speaking with those in your audience who are in this sort of boomer and even pre boomer um that they may be interested to know that takes the average inherited Nineteen days to buy a new car\nUm and uh a lot of wealth has gone by the end of the second generation so from Europe standpoint\nIf you've got a legacy you're interested in um a donor advise fun is particularly important and I would argue for those who are of conservative minds that this is extremely important because unfortunately in our history\nThe bulk of those private foundations that came\nFrom the Carnegie and the Rockefeller's and the four out of a great capital is a tradition now actively fund organization that undermined those and so a place like donors trust\nSays to those individuals we care about your legacy we will ensure that your grants or our grants that your recommendation will only go to organizations that essentially promote ideas of free enterprise per se responsibility limited government\nAnd that's a very very important idea when thinking about the next generation\nDon't advise funds didn't much exist in the ... century and you've been in business since the late twentieth century now into the twenty first what's changed as the ... is Congress more friendly is the administration have people change their opinions why don't advise funds are attractive\n[noise] I think the ... the the simplest with a reason is exactly the word I just use simple I'm desperate created originally by community foundations and many Jewish foundations actually a long time ago who are particularly concerned\nAbout keeping funds in and among the Jewish community and Jewish causes\nAnd so they actually came up with a philanthropic idea of a death we have seen the growth for the last Twenty years twenty five years of death because there are simple and they are cheap and they're inexpensive and they protect intent and they're very effective at promoting and protecting privacy\nI think in the last Fifteen Twenty years as we watched the politics of civility decline a bit\nThe idea of donor privacy has been at the end but this but the growth of a lot of death\nThe commercial donor buys sense of grown for the simple reason that people had all of their stocks and finances in one place and they saw this as an opportunity to make some money and take advantage of it and truth be told the largest charity in the United states is now ... which the daughter of Iceland\nAnd finally don't advise funds are a small piece of philanthropy\nOr the large piece I Believe the number is over eight hundred billion dollars is in private foundations but uh what I see is the growth for death is exceeding that for private foundations is this a story that spreading or is it just me\nNo this is a story that starting to spread particularly as you say data come in the last couple of years where the growth has been exponential and I think in many ways a Congress has probably made it that focus so much on foundations\nAnd made it so complicated and put a new regulations that what happens capital find other ways of being ... and generous and guess what out of that come death they are growing significantly I see no reason why they will continue to grow\nOr they are very effective and more importantly they're actually putting more money out into the nonprofit world than foundations are I think at the end of the day that so that's reflects that society which we live\nMoney goes where it's treated best loss in ... president and CEO of donors trust that donors trust dot org [noise]\nI'm

time in the Nineteen eighties and became the critical source for information of eh my six they didn't share it with the CIA his name was ... he is now forever living ... anonymously in Great Britain under a sentence of death from the old could you be now FSB but the reason I mentioned him\nIs that in Nineteen eighty three Margaret Thatcher was facing a critical\nReelection she was working a hand in glove with Ronald Reagan fighting the old Cold War and her opposite number in parliament was a very prominent labor politician named Michael ...\nWho was leading labor to a challenge a Margaret Thatcher what I learned from the new book by Ben mcentire is that Michael Foot was an agent of the cage you beat they paid him for information for many years he was a KGB accept\nAs a labor leader\nHowever the twist here is they didn't tell Margaret Thatcher that's right she went to the people and she won that race a dominant lay Thirteen million votes to eight million for a foot labor party and seven million for the liberals\nShe won that without making that allegation they started best that they not trouble her because it would complicate the situation with ... it would complicate the old Cold War now\nSteve I presented as as an example of\nInterference [laughter] democracy but the interference is by our side we decide we're going to interfere by not telling the leader of the British Parliament and a close ally of Ronald Reagan that she's being challenged by the KGB we didn't tell her\nAnd here we are in twenty I mean there's forest here are we what we need is a what we need is a Broadway burlesque to ... to show this\nWhat we have in twenty sixteen is an allegation were all they do is tell Donald Trump all they do is tell Mrs Clinton she tells Donald Trump details Hillary Clinton\nAnd there's no evidence adds up right tonight there's no evidence that anything's regal it's completely made up there's the irony of the old Cold War versus the new Cold War when it really mattered they kept mum when it doesn't matter they chatter away\nWhat struck me I didn't know the story about Michael for it but I remember him very well as the leader of the Labour Party at that time what strikes me is is that they\nThey knew about sport as a fact\nYeah and they kept they kept it from the political leadership yes\nIn the case of Trump it was all whispers in shadow was no evidence has ever been produced two and a half years later that the Kremlin at any old compromise or or anything on Trump and yet whoever started this story I think we know what started in the\nCIA I Believe it did what Brennan so it was the intelligence agencies\nYou're right the first thing they did was Bob it as much as they could because I thought it would damage Trump's campaign and you're also right that Mrs Clinton actually said in the debate I think it was August the third debate\nIn two thousand sixteen she actually several debate the Trump was a puppet of the Kremlin's which is essentially an agent and there were such articles in the New York times by so called retired CIA agents literally accusing Trump\nOf being recruited agent of equipment so the reaction was completely different\nUh ... was a factor I guess in that case it was kept a secret what was something made up I think about Trump was Blair it everywhere they could get a TV camera on them or a newspaper to print it so I don't know if this is a sign of different times or of different kinds of it\nWhen people it was what I learned from this is in a democracy people believe the conspiracy of the moment if they want to there are still people in the United kingdom Ben mcentire told me this when we talked about his book\nAnd because he revealed the fact again it was not unknown but he ... he emphasized it again there are still members of labor party who denied this who say it's not true which made opposite if some tore plot\nSo more than Thirty years later so thirty five years from now ... will turn to what damage this is doing to us than speculate a little bit\nUh next I'm speaking with professor call and we're having too much fun of course because history is filled with ironies you can't do

America and all my life I hear the Russians create it just seems preposterous to me and yet it's with great seriousness I expect very so\nYou mean like this seems started ... skeptical and cynical\nBut some of the argument that somehow created you know racial injustice in the United states that maybe he was like two American slave or something\nBecause it has gotten completely out of control well the way that I was like let me give you an example I don't mean to interrupt you know no way I can actually learn the language that this would be like wow I forget his\nName the the allegation against the Florida resident yeah\nLet's find or like Canada Russia now there's an article in the Washington Post and um\nI cite the articles and I don't want your your listeners to think I make this stuff up Obama likes to say he just made stuff up\nBut I didn't make this stuff up in the Washington Post on October twenty eight western aid thirtieth two days ago the headline reads pipe bomb suspect posted about Russians and what I read the article it turns out that he was posting Russia propaganda\nLet me just tell you what the propaganda is because it's important that they cite the guy posted something which is the Washington Post thinks he got from Russia saying that Russia and the Syrian Government or fighting terrorists than sure I got so let me repeat that that\nThe pipe bomber posted something nobody knows where he died I was under Russian source he posted on his website or on social media an article that said that the Russian Army in Syria and the Syrian Government headed by President Assad are fighting terrorists\nAnd the post goes on to say that this isn't true because it says Washington for years has said that these people and I quote we're not terrorists but a legitimate uprising against the authoritarian government of a shot well\nThere's two different versions of the war in Syria\nPersonally I Am here to the version that the pipe bomb proposed that but I didn't get it from Russia so\nSteve what does it matter\nHow could it ... matter that up that a character who works at the evening struck again just how can I say I matter that he has anything to say about Russia my goodness Steve that I call that an stretches an understatement\nYou know why it matters because for better or worse\nApart from the ... bachelor show I I Would say that Ninety to

per ...\nHas been president almost completely since that\nHe is a man who is up to ... and non transparent but the allegation is that Russia has been interfering in the Ukraine elections well gee what a surprise and in the United kingdom perhaps a pro Brecht said\nThese Russian Steve are very busy there's nowhere to hide from them I'm I'm impressed now that the French fought them also a blade but again in France and Russia have always been very close\nLike Washington Washington in Russia so a Ukraine now blames the Russians for any possible outcome of their elections rada abortion co UK is all tangled up and breakfast I guess they're blaming the Russians for having weaken the Tories are strengthened labor I'm not sure what the interpretation is\nAnybody losing an election on the planet earth these days can blame Russia\nCoat and did it so live Ukraine aside for a moment because they're one understands what's going on I mean this really is a very adamant Ukrainian Russian affair and they are gone abysmally\nSocial media each other but what's gone or the way this issue's arisen the Russian role alleged and British elections is because prime minister may has a catastrophic problem with the exit from the European Union with a referendum right right or romaine or that are winning\nShe either gets in the ... an agreement that's acceptable both to the European Union and to her own party the Tory party or she's gone\nThat's just the bottom line now and the party elders do I think and win an election with her at the head of the tech so her fate\nHas to do with solving this Brexit problem so what's a risen is is the idea that there should be a second\nThe rent you probably heard about yes the problem with this this is this is the most undemocratic thing in the world I mean it would be like saying we have election for president United States where we don't like\nThe outcome let's have a redo I mean it can't have a democracy if elections and referendum is our\nPure form of election it's a one issue democratic float some people think they are bad but nobody denies that for\nMaybe centuries but certainly decades and many countries\nThey have been defy seem legitimate ways of resolving profound problems you would agree with that yeah we don't we don't do it very often states do it on bond issues and things like California loves to do it\nKind of like one but I don't know how many national referendum we've ever had if any salt and some democratic there is like there by some think they're good but they are where they are they're they're they're pure democracy\nMinutes have we have two minutes go ahead\nSo that people are Great Britain voted to leave the European Union now people are calling for another referendum that is the people against breakfast and what are they arguing there now arguing that the Kremlin intervene in the first referendum\nAnd therefore it should be done to get there is not a shred of evidence for this not a shroud but it's become as you say John who did it become a political talking point for those stories in England who won a second referendum they they're not going to get it even that they were proposed\nIs on democratic but it's the default position the election doesn't count because ... and now we can't go on his democracies that's my point\nIf we can't trust our electoral process we can't trust our board\nTherefore ... camp and all they trust the leadership ...\nOr the elites and we can't trust therefore the representatives institutions that they present that the the the the presidency and the Congress so where's is headed John\nUh I I I Want to I Want to uh west solid answer here where it's headed is that democracy itself is being damage democracy itself is being damaged by the doubters\nAnd yeah this is the ironic point on which I Would like to end the accusation against the Kremlin is they are trying to damage our democracy and my answer is no we're doing it ourselves\nAs the one more detail here about democracy and the midterm they're very difficult to interpret I mean Nancy Pelosi becoming speaker of the house is what political science says happens after a close election in which the party out of power then challenges the party in power so\nThat will not prove anything the only way for the Kremlin to show strength next week\nIs for the Republicans to hold the house I guess I guess that's it\nIt's one of those things where you throw though you were you further which in the water and if if the which drown it wasn't a which if it floats it was a which is that it\nWill we do one thing that's interesting is that\nTo the extent that Gallup polling and other polling tells us what people think we know that fifty seven percent of people want a better relationship with Russia that's pretty good right at times\nAnd we also know that when asked what are the local issues the most concern for next Tuesday's voting Russia hardly appears at all as an

they successfully um got the backup a gyroscope operating so that Hubble now works on three tries scopes which means you can continue to\nIs that three dimensional control which means they can point very precisely and accurately and take the typically great images it always does everyone has to understand that this ... situation is now very temporary how long has any backup driver scopes\nAs three gyroscope no backups if another failed what's gonna happen then they're going to go to one gyroscope mode which will allow them to do some science but at the limited nature kind of like capital is doing it slated days and they'll hold the second working jars go back a as a backup not so much\nStand the life of the telescope as much as making sure that telescope can be controlled and pointed and placed in a in a correct orientation because at some point um\nThey're gonna have to either the orbit or raise its orbit because this is big enough to hit the ground and so at some point late in the next decade Hubble's going to all that's going to start to decay and at that point they have to be able to attach a robot\nOr or engine to it to de orbited or to raise it saw that in order to do that they've got to have it under some kind of control and that means I going to need at least one gyroscope functioning and so\nWhere in the limited life Hubble right now the next gyroscope that goes it's going to be on its way out this is a tragic thing and we do not have a replacement for Hubble unfortunately none at all I had a lot of interesting comments on my website that suggestion a robot mission even a manned mission to\nFix the driver sculpture of replacing the Hubble and actually one of those ideas as possible we have the technology to rub a robot mission to do this now they were looking at it a decade ago it's too soon now the technology and software exist to do a robot mission to replace those gyros you could also do a possibly a manned mission using our dragon capsule\nAnd a sickness I'm a cargo Marshall together or to bring up equipment and a docking part and then maybe even a quickly made a robot arm to grapple Hubble and maybe do this by mad\nThat would be more ambitious I think but either way this is something that NASA should look into there's no reason why we called the Bob\nCould could we moved to a place where ... ... to a private enterprise that can fix it and then monetize it\n[noise] that's an interesting idea that would be that that's another option that would require a the Trump Administration uh taking a very different approach they haven't yet that that would understand the concepts of private enterprise more than I think the Trump Administration and NASA\n... there for perpetuity we can't remove the possibility that a future government would understand that monetize ... which is a miracle machine is good for the federal government and good for Hubble\nYeah absolutely right I personally think that a private company maybe ... maybe ... mosque should say hey\nI'll save this telescope for the public relations purposes and they could ... something right Heather and make it happen and I really think that would be a good thing I said this since I wrote University in the mirror this is a telescope that will not die every decade\nSomeone's come along to try to kill it and every decade the want to try to kill it ends up to become becoming a boost the for the telescope and where to situation now where are we going to start facing\nThe orbiting telescope and I think when that happens they're going to say well why do you why do we just said the robot up to fix it right that's where we'll come\nAs a curiosity again we had we had moments of anxiety about curiosity because he had a main computer and his backup computer were behaving unusually by Bob says things are restored Bob back better than ever\nThat you know I wouldn't say better than ever ... this is breaking news that no one else has covered yet because NASA sent out a press release and most modern journalists today wait for the press release but I track\nThe actual images and the stuff coming from the science community and the science team has made it clear that blog\nThat they're in the process this week of resuming soulful science operations and if you look at the roar images I have links to both by the way on behind the black you can see that in the last week they've started to send out\nLots of images from multiple cameras every day that's something they haven't done in six weeks so it's very clear that they've got the computers um\nIn a in a working in a manner that they're satisfied in that proceeding to download data again um they have not yet released they detailed description outlying why it took so long to get the second computer up and running\nAnd what what they're doing if anything to repay the computer that produce the problems themselves in the last month it would be really good if they could get the the secondary computer I'm working again so that they have a backup because\nBoth of these computers had problems of the life of the mission now and\nThen the on the computers of to the rovers got so we'd love to have both of them in good shape so we'll have to wait for that press release it hasn't come out\nAnd they're going back to drilling Bob is that what what have\nWe I'm not sure what they're going to do next I mean the regional plan was not to drill at this location but to stop moving out off of air Ruben origin up the mountain but one of the things they discovered on getting new images\nAre at the psych they've been sitting there for so long which was a drill side by the way is that all the dust that had been scaring the ground in the interim blew away\nI'm not sure why this was this all occurred after the ... the storm it occurred so it wasn't wasn't specifically the dust on that but it was wins and so the ground is clear\nAll the all the dust from the drill hole also blow away so they're looking at the ground again and say listen this so we don't know what they're going to do next to long term plan is clearly up up the mountain and that's not too far in the future\nI'm looking at the front have cam and what you see is recognizable um earth\nPlot a landscape here Bob it looks like there's sand in very small grains of rock in between larger boulders or larger rocks that are peaking through so that the dust that you say blow away to reveal these these these folders\nYeah Avi Rubin rejects you'll remember John and it's shown it and many images got up to the top is kind of like um [noise]\nIt's a plateau that uh has like these flat boulders everywhere cracked with space Dustin between so you're driving over almost like a a an uneven rock pavement flat rock pavement\nAnd so the bus blows away and you could see those rocks better and those rocks have been very hard they have not been able to stuff to drill through any of them very well and they really would like to get a drill off from the top of the rich but they haven't found one that can do it yet so we'll just have to see how it goes next\nYear boy does that look like the bottom of something that had water on it
