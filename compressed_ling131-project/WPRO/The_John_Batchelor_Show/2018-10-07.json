I'm going to sit here and LBJ eyes for\nYour hip and say the checks declaring will tell you that\nAh Worcester spent too much on the bus socks and uh if\nYou don't elect me you're gonna lose all these jobs and then I'll just let these guys kick the living crap out of each other which is exactly what happened\nOh my goodness if you have comments about the um\nThe Senate the development I'm not going to exclude them from the shower although I Would like to I'd like to move the conversation to last night's channel twelve debate\nA bulletin this debate was viewed by more the ... by about double the normal television debate audience it had an average six household rating and I'm told\nIn the last half had a seven and a half\nHousehold worrying that is a ratings point and I must tell you exactly what that means in this market it's a round figure about sixty five hundred households parading point\nSo you do the math on that at the end there were nearly fifty thousand homes that were glued to this thing and you know over the course of of of the evening and then that that doesn't mean fifty thousand people there's a lot of people watch TV in pairs in threes and fours a there could have been\nNear a hundred thousand people watching that the that debate last night\nWhich is again I that's my interpretation that's not any representation of channel twelve or whatever um but I Do believe the six household rating in the seven point five reading are accurate there overnight um [noise] you know I work during sometimes and get the simple\nA that's a big big number they were in the debate was the number one show in its time slot last night\nFrom seven eight which again is pretty phenomenal based on a lot of the people just like to watch entertainment television sports television and there was this little thing called the Kavanaugh hearings that was wreaking havoc in America last night so\nKudos to channel twelve for its image marketing and execution ... she did the usual terrific job\nUm and Joe ... no doubt in my mind one man's opinion\nI don't know why I feel like I have to qualify that big you guys you get you you guys are getting chip here in ... out there these days so I figure [laughter] so I figure I just say this you know let me go let me state the obvious there's just one man's opinion behind the microphone on a radio show take it for what it's worth I bet you your true love grab three four five points last night\nI bet you grab three or four or five points last night now you could say grassy four or five points from seven you can see grand through four or five points from sixteen you're just doesn't have to call them Johnson ... joke a\nI think ... true low is only going to get tougher in the channel ten debate maybe channel six debate and I'm sure as hell hoping that we're having one here I'm a stay tuned\nUh\nBut I think his effort there last night is going to carry some weight now if you put some money into this race raises or puts his own dough into this race I think he has a chance to be formidable and change the dynamics of the whole thing\nBut if he's going to hope that his performances and debates in some uh some other wacky types of terrestrial I I should say I'm guerilla marketing I I think he's pulling himself and has two or as to reevaluate this whole thing\nUm but let me tell you that I'm looking at the debate last night and I'm thinking that one's fun just can't he just can't get it done\n\nCliches thirty eight studios reliance I mean ... is the weakest thing I've ever seen is that all you got brother and at the end um I don't want to show my wife out 'cause she's she's not very political\n[noise]\nShe'll my wife uh she's driving home right now for more than ... leave me out of this thank you very much you idiot\nBut I'm going to sell her out even she sheds a I didn't ask you to grab this one did I ask you read this one at the end the insider remark do you have that with all this stuff at the end Alex I mean you've got a lot of great audio worked\nHard to match up shipping and find it at the end\nYou know this is what we don't need a couple of insight as\nTo think you're kidding Alan Cranston for two terms you play the insider game like no wonder\nSame operators that you watch that you would like to walk for your campaign or working for others or you're drilling over them are complaining\nYou swim in the same circles and nobody buys it\nNobody\nAround here is plainly oh insider ... there's no constituent in Rhode Island that has a consciousness over insider outsider the same old tired cliches it is just it's like would you stop\nStop but he's got nothing that he's got nothing to deliver no\nOther agreements ... on a handful of things but it I mean he just read the authentic you may say bombastic no doubt a little over the top a little ah excited about getting some more action yeah\nFor the most part he sounds like a guy that's like a you know what let me ... all my sleeves up and\nFix things oh just fix things and she is her she is she she stuck\nAnd as long as these guys swim underneath her she's happy as a pagan\nMud right you find it the inside of the thing we don't be so good\nYou know we don't need more state house insiders like miss the ... and especially not the governor in this election for governor isn't about what's going on in Washington DC has people want to frame it [laughter] it's about what's going on in Washington park in West Philly when socket\nAnd we're all in the context of the ... the insiders ...\nCome up with that is it really does is the this is like oh the little cliches for sending All right let's job sold out and I'm probably going to be in trouble and I go\nBut it was just one person's gut reaction by the way she doesn't have she doesn't have any pre disposition about the candidate she's just going really\nWell this isn't science thing\nRight in silver mine do kind of ... about a couple of things but she said well\nYou know true low didn't have all the answers\nOn the ... thing they all fail to load and falling have ... ... they're they're full of crap neither one of them had any idea how to solve\nThe situation and remind do booted it so that's not a gubernatorial issue\nFor three eight zero is the number of building Johnston you're on WNPR oh hello [noise] [noise]\n[noise] oh and yes bill you All right everything okay yeah I'm not saying All right let's step\nIn and say hey I have a uh the uh we've had a hand and I have missed it in all the new stuff but if this message found a a\nUm\nYou know I like the fact that they get right into it although true was kind of like a wallflower for the first three or four minutes\nMaybe five I could tell he was going to bust [noise]\nBut it wasn't hurting them because there was nothing really going on between the two\nUh\nWhen I see nothing going on I Want to come away listen I Want to come away from gubernatorial reading president to the beach\nWith a with a feeling of purposeful miss an identity\n\nOf feeling a purpose holding us an identity\nWe're are you taking me where are you taking me\n\nAnd what is your stretch I left when I see what is your strategy because I have told you this before I have a friend old great friend of mine who were used to uh work for a Japanese company\nAnd he's a sales guy and he used to complain all the time that he would have meetings and and he would be called into these meetings for the boss and and the ...\nWhat's your what is your strategy what is your strategy\nAnd and he would [laughter]\nIt's like well I'm trying to sell it to this guy who's got yes but what is your strategy is like I look at the I look at these the base and I and I want to know what ... what is your strategy I mean I Know Gina Raimondo strategy I Know it she's gonna she's picking winners and losers economically\nRight\nShe's she's gonna she's going to ride this sucker out she's going to be the change Asian but you know what after four years you are now the status quo so you've got to give us something more and she's got nothing more to give she's just holding onto this thing she'll be done in\nTwo years especially if they flip it down there should be you'll find some things in Washington or hook up with uh the former mayor of New York and they'll start their two year\nUm you know presidential bid in twenty twenty two yeah the twenty twenty\nWhich was which is twenty Twenty one you know should we go in her mind should be done in her mind should be done to Carolyn should've gone to Washington she can't wait to get the hell out of here and I I just see it all over his feeling you know an Alan just like I Want to\nBe like oh my God\nI Want to be like are they going to want to be the governor\nOkay I Know you want to be\nYou know you should shut\nUp what we're there to come up\nBy the way the corruption thought stuffer Cranston is a non starter I mean he had big police troubles over there he's over there was the last election so Gina trying to put\nCorruption on an ... is a is a complete non starter I blame I mean he\nFixed it he fixed he's got a good chief leaving for that leave him alone but so you were saying nothing and\nTrue as well as the other good guy I'm a smart guy I Know how the you shut the government works I'm going to go in there and I'm going to take no prisoners and I'll be you know but nobody\nAnd so what the hell that is what his hope that just things will get all three of them I say\nWell you know what what do I want\nRight now vote patrol\nThe change I mean if it actually brings something am I going okay you know whatever they want to\nGo I Want to be my guy I Want to be the that's it\nChris you're on your oh man what kind of soliloquy was\nThat's how I see it\nIn a while and other underwhelming\nAnd you're shooting adolescence a ... there there was nothing inspirational there was no and the innovation present that there was you know nothing of value to the voter ... what we could anticipate would either operational style government\nHowever I Will tell you a steady ... it was interesting because truly was bringing it and the number the rating number one from ... seven and a half which means that people didn't get bored which means ... got their attention which means ... had to move up\nBut well ... are up to the course will suffer so yes I like watching a traffic accident but self to fiction as Rhode Island handy man and his unbridled love for Trump I don't think really helps them in regard to Mr fun he's consistently been Allen's lightning\nAnd I've always had the impression of Alan Kurdi the double a pitcher attempting to play a major league ball and he doesn't have the stuff\nSo if you got like an adult and a sports editor for\nYeah yeah sure he's just he's just he's just bringing a eighty mile an hour straight fastball that's it\nExactly yeah but it got no change up not uh and I you know\nWhat you mean she's which means she's going to win this thing in a walk absolutely ...

I'm a property\nBut we're also I'm weighing that um\nIt's kind of hard if you're going to put it back I'm missing idle wire fence so I'm all for a on this high phones that I'm able to use to set it up a regular federal ... so any a wall automobiles\nWild animals so we usually it's a wire fence to like a ... not a real sturdy won\nA yes no they're they're the war\nAnd you know All right well I mean look you got some options um you can either solid sense like ... or you could use a a chain link fence or you could use a metal fence that when you say a wildlife how big are we talking about there that that\nYou're going to lead a pretty strong fence so I think your only option is going to be chained Lincoln's gonna have to be a pretty high chain link fencing is going to have to be professional install that's a really big contract\nAll right great right so I Wish you luck for you but you want to ... keep those bears out you know [laughter] they can be a thousand pounds you need some British dirty\nAnd uh I don't want to come over\nI don't blame blame them you would want to either yeah\nWell that's that's when you get for a living so close to the nature but you've got a beautiful backyard nonetheless so Ron ... is the money that good luck with the project\nOr much\nWell are you in the market for a new floor if you are you worried about choosing foreign that eco friendly well we've got some good news for you there has never been more options for foreign materials that are also good for the planet\nThat's right and well no more products has zero impact some materials are definitely better than others Kevin O'Connor's the host of TV's this old house and he joined us now with some green options for your floors welcome Kevin I guess so what makes a flooring product very green such as the color we're talking about here not\nJust the color [laughter] um well several things I think we'll classified as green is it sustainable or is it renewable or does it have any toxic chemicals involved in the manufacturing process you know these are all things to think about when you're looking for a green floor sorry\nAbout the first point being renewable I mean something like bamboo is incredibly renewable grows fast and also makes a super tough floor\nGets ... all over the place right now and you know a lot of people scratching head why is it well it does it grows super fast so that means that when you harvest it um it actually comes back very quickly so the yield is very high in terms of how much\nTrue you can get out of an acre of land um it's often times harder than oak it's a good look and so definitely goes into the renewable category\nPreviously with bamboo flooring and had a very modern stark look at you definitely saw you know that that ends and the ... the bamboo themselves now bamboo flowing really just looks like a beautiful hardwood so there's a lot of great options out there I think\nWe're getting used to it there are different ways to cut it but mostly it's just because we were accepted and more and we like looking at is this sharp\nLook and you know another one that's a really nice renewable source is cork in cork floors super durable grade for moist conditions and really looked fantastic\nFeels pretty good on the ... to ... or if the kids are older and you know of course it comes from a tree 'em and they actually cut it off around the tree they don't kill the trees so it grows back so that is a sustainable material as well and it's a very distinctive\nLook it is and in fact this past summer we're on vacation good chance to look at one of the most outstanding examples of American architectural falling water house built by Frank Lloyd Wright\nUh back in the early Nineteen hundreds he was using cork on the floors in court on the walls of the bathroom he was a visionary wasn't she certainly was and you know what the original cork still in good shape today it's amazing\nNo Kevin here is one that's surprising ... only am I wouldn't necessarily think of that and the green flooring choice nor something that's modern\nWell I mean it's been around for a long time um they make it the same way they've been making it for the last century but it's all made from natural materials so\nWe're talking about Lindsey oil cork dust would flower tree residents crown limestone and they're all press onto a Jew backing to the materials are natural but just because it's been around for a long time doesn't mean you can't get a real sharp modern look\nOut of ... there are tons of style tons of colors out there and it fits into that green category\nGood point now recycled foreign is also very popular rubber flooring for example made from old tires and that sort of thing\nYeah I mean made from old tires rubber here's my favorite recycled flooring would do I mean think about this we just on a project a couple of years ago we took the beams of an old ... building um they were shipping offered disposal we stopped and we had um actually ... in to foreign and so\nThe what is already being cut down as being used as being for hundreds of years and now we're using it for flooring so we can reclaim a lot of these materials and put them down on our floors\nAnd you know what's nice about choosing the green for there really are very few trade offs I mean they're all durable floors most of them are reasonably green but what about carpeting when it comes to that are they're green choices incorporating as well\nWell I mean generally you want to look for natural fibers in your carpet because that's going to be a little bit more green um things like wool or shoot\n'em but you know carpet she's had a really bad name um the synthetic ones because they were made with lots of residents and glues and they clean up their act considerably so just because it's not natural fibers doesn't mean you just can't get one with recycled synthetic fibers\nAnd also the ones that don't have any toxins are off gas\nGreat topic Kevin

big public the back of the right and you're not alone are full of being close to the national park so beautiful little glass right now there is a wire fence that um we're on the back of the property\nBut we're also I'm Wayne that um\nIt's kinda hard if we're going to put it back um the wire fence so I'm all for a on this high friends that I'm\nAble to use to set it up a regular Ed Ed I'm I'm so an automotive\nWild animals so we usually it's a wire fence to like a thin wire fencing are real sturdy won\nA yes there that the war\nYou know All right well I mean look you've got some

going to lead a pretty\nStrong fence so I think your only option is going to be chained Lincoln's going out to be a pretty high chain link fencing is going to have to be professional install that's a really big project\nAll right All right so I Wish I better look for you but uh you want a fence to keep those bears out no [laughter] they can be a thousand pounds you need some British dirty\nAnd are either one of them come over\nHere I don't blame you wouldn't want to either yeah well that's that's what you get for a living so close to nature but you've got a beautiful backyard nonetheless so Ron thanks much for calling us with the money that good luck with a project\nLike much\nWell are you in the market for a new floor if are are you worried about choosing for that eco friendly well we've got some good news for you there has never been more options for foreign materials that are also good for the planet\nThat's right and well no more products has zero impact some materials are definitely better than others Kevin O'Connor's dose of TV's this old house and he joins us now with some green options for\nYour floors welcome Kevin I guess so what makes a flooring product very green such as to color we're talking about here not just the color [laughter]\nUm well several things I think were classified as green is it sustainable or is it renewable or does it have any toxic chemicals involved in the manufacturing process you know these are all things to think about when you're looking for a green floor sorry\nAbout the first point being renewable I mean something like bamboo is incredibly renewable grows fast and also makes a super tough floor\nGets funny you see bamboo all over the place right now and you know a lot of people scratching of heads why is it well it does it grows a super fast so that means that when you harvest it\nUm it actually comes back very quickly so the yield is very high in terms of how much material you can get out of an acre of land um it's often times harder than oak it's a good look so definitely goes into the renewable category\nPreviously with bamboo flooring and had a very modern stark look trait you definitely saw you know that that and and the ... the bamboo themselves now bamboo flying really just looks like a beautiful hardwood so there's a lot of great options out\nThere I think we're getting used to it there are different ways to cut it but mostly it's just because we're accepting and more and we like looking at is this sharp look\nAnd you know another one that's a really nice renewable source is cork in cork force super door\nGreat for moist conditions and really looked fantastic\nFeels pretty good underneath your feet to die or if the kids are older and you know of course it comes from a tree 'em and they actually cut it off around the tree and they don't kill the tree grows back so that is a sustainable material as well and it's a very distinctive\nLook it is and in fact this past summer we're on vacation good chance to look at one of the most outstanding examples of American architecture the falling water house built by Frank Lloyd Wright\nUh back in the early Nineteen hundreds he was using cork on the floors in court on the walls or the bathroom he was a visionary well she certainly was and you know what the original cork still in good shape today it's amazing\nNo Kevin here is one that's surprising ... only am I wouldn't necessarily think of that and the green flooring choice nor something that's modern\nWell I mean it's been around for a long time um they make it the same way they've been making it for the last century but it's all made from natural materials so\nWe're talking about Lindsey oil cork dust would flower tree residents crown limestone\nAnd they're all press onto a Jew backing to the materials are natural but just because it's been around for a long time doesn't mean you can't get a real sharp modern look out of ... there are tons of style tons of colors out there and it fits into that green category\nGood point now recycled foreign is also very popular rubber flooring for example made from old tires and that sort of thing\nYeah I mean made from old tires rubber here's my favorite recycle flooring would do I mean think about this we just on a project a couple of years ago we took the beams of an old ... building um they were shipping offer disposal we stopped and we had um actually ... in to foreign and so\nThe what is already being cut down is being used as being for hundreds of years and now we're using it for Florian so we can reclaim a lot of these materials and put them down on our floors\nAnd you know what's nice about choosing the green for there really are very few trade offs I mean they're all durable floors most of them are reasonably green but what about carpeting when it comes to that are they're green choices and carpeting as well\nWell I mean generally you want to look for natural fibers them in your carpet because that's going to be a little bit more green or things like wool or shoot 'em but you know carpet you have a really bad name the synthetic ones because they were made with lots of residence and glues and they clean up their act considerably so just because it's not natural fibers\nDoesn't mean you just can't get one with recycled synthetic fibers and also the ones that don't have any toxins are off gas\nGreat topic Kevin O'Connor the host of TV's this old house thanks so much for stopping by the money pit", "show_name": "The John Batchelor Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence",
