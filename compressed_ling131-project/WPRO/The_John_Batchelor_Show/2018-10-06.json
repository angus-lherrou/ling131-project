we're on the eve of the Senate final vote the outcome is not certain but there was a glide path to landing in the Republican saver out I'm a very good evening to you the inquiry you raise in your Weekly Standard piece several days past still useful\nWas the judiciary process of these last sixty Seventy days was that a job interview as has been asserted or was that a search for the truth in a criminal allegation good evening to\nWell good evening John it's it's always good to be back well I Will say if this was a job interview than it looks increasingly likely to be out of the interview is you're hired justice Kavanaugh\nThings seem to be very promising for the judge right now although of course things are always subject to change until the last moment well the reason why I wrote that article though for the Weekly Standard was\nA judge Kavanaugh's critics kept saying the Senate to process is not a criminal trial he doesn't get a presumption of innocence there was no burden of proof on his accuser it's just a job interview in which the interviewer\nI guess the Senate or can can decide however they want and the point in my article was that really was looking to narrowly at this the Senate is it's not just a job interview the Senate isn't some corporate HR department of the United States Senate as part of our government off and it's wielding sovereign power\nIn a ... attempt to do justice and so I think that the Senate needed to take very careful steps\nThrough the process it constructed a to do justice to everybody involved but also\nTo keep in mind that this won't be the last Supreme Court nomination that the Senate considers\nAnd the Senate needed to go about its work in this case taking care to set precedence that will allow the Senate to do what's best possible job in the future so it's not\nOf course it's not a criminal trial it's not a court this isn't a judge a it's not a trial but it's not a job interview it's the Senate's process for advice and consent\nAnd the Senate needed to take that much more seriously than judge Kavanaugh's opponents would have had it do\nYou participated in the judiciary inquiring about judge Kavanaugh to being a member of the Supreme Court you testified\nOr with other scholars and therefore you said in that room and you look at the senators and their ... aides and you saw the process which is a ceremony advice and consent that process before the Feinstein\nIntroduction of the allegations the first allegation the Blasey Ford allegation and then there were substantive allegations that process is is that damaged and how long is that if it is how long will that damage last because I think you saw it before the damage and now we're on the other side of it\nWell John I testified on the last day of the original hearing last paddle the last day at that point even the protesters were getting bored and a lot of the senators were there are a lot of the staff weren't there I was there to testify on judge Kavanaugh's record in administrative\nLaw which you and I discussed shortly yes on the air shortly before the testimony and\nI think his record as exemplary\nBut it is it seems like a thousand years ago that we were talking about the original hearings and even at that time the process was already coming apart you and I discussed on the air the things that senator Booker and others had done to try to detonate the hearing a and it's very opening moments that flurry of interruptions objections and demands\nAnd on my panel last panel of the day of the last ... the hearings it was largely dominated by the parents of John Dean the former Nixon White House counsel the Watergate figure\nWith a Democratic senators asking him with questions trying to compare Trump to Nixon and Watergate and so on and so the process was already degraded by the time we got to that last panel I think that a a Senator Grassley\nDeserves immense credit for holding it together as well as he could and then when they're came demands for further investigation further hearings I wrote that we'd be standard article to say yes it's it's good\nTo it's good that we have these extra hearings but opening up more FBI investigations to chase allegations that senators had even before the original Senate hearing and that's the key to the doctor for brought these allegations to the Senate well before the hearing\nAnd the senator's Senator Feinstein others were now\nReopen the entire process after the fact I thought that was very dangerous because I think if we allow too much of that to happen then in the next Supreme Court nomination the confirmation hearing we're all going to sit and sort of wait for the real for the original hearings to and so we can find out what the real goods are\nWhat the real allegations will be which will come out tactically after hearing and so I think that a Senator Grassley Senator Flake and the others I think they did a good job\nOf reopening the hearing it allowing a very limited investigation but without allowing the entire process to devolve into a never ending fishing expedition\nIt has confused and disheartening to public Adam you know that your professional you look at it inside your you teach in a law school you have young lawyers of the future but those of us who don't go to law school didn't aren't going to go to law school a this was easy to understand as a continuation of the twenty sixth campaign\nThis isn't this was about the presidency or who won the presidency and twenty sixteen not about the judiciary branch of the government and not about the Supreme Court it's a puzzle this this politicized the Supreme Court\nNow I understand the Supreme Court has a political flavor to it they read the headlines I get that but has something changed doors will we will we see this and this and the scheme of things as just more of a arguing point in the larger scale builds up to twenty twenty\n[noise] a lot of people are a lot of judge Kavanaugh's critics have said that what we've just experienced will affect the courts legitimacy I just reject that I think that\nNothing that happens in the Senate process can affect the courts legitimacy after all our constitution provides for a political process for appointing\nJudges and justices or what does affect the courts legitimacy is how the judges go about their work\nAs judges so the real test of the court's legitimacy now comes a as as\nJudge Kavanaugh or whoever fill the seat a takes the bench and the court continues its work the court has always wielded immense power in our country and it's often been seen as political and and criticized as political\nI think the key then is for the court to continue to work to continue to carry out its work as judges and not focus on the political stuff on a happening around\nThe court or a hundred and fifty memorial at almost\nTwo hundred years ago Alexis de Tocqueville in his famous study of democracy in America he reflected on the political power the judges wheeled into feel wrote that the key is that the judges not\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd see oh\nThese steps are with the Brazilian government

every other element in American Life all the railroads all of the manufacturing all of the financial instruments banks\nEverything housing real estate the money that existed in human flesh\nWas greater than the sum of all the wealth that was not\nInvested in slavery and I think this was the basis for the south deciding that it had to rebel and what you have today\nIs an American elite that

prosperous nation looking to develop into the twenty first century with small business just as the United states is developing which is why the business of the planet is small business gene marks\nIs the small business columnist for the guardian newspaper and other distinguish publications in junior new column in the guardian looks very attractive so immediately want to go to the question of minimum wage\nYou have written about it in the guardian most recently we've talked about minimum wage for the last year but it's been a debate in the United states especially around\nFast food franchises and\nExtending from the Pacific to the Atlantic city's you're debating whether minimum wage is can be imposed on small business owners and what that does for\nEmployment statistics however we now have the breaking news that Amazon is raising its minimum wage and all of its of hundreds of thousands of employees to Fifteen dollars\nWhat was your first impression when Jeff Bezos made this announcement how did you how how did you think this would affect small businesses good evening to Eugene good evening\nJohn up my first impression when Amazon or decided to raise their waste or Fifteen dollars I think they're sending a clear shot across the bow at all small businesses and merchants that they'd better step up their game\nThat's what I thought now first of all there are a lot of reasons behind the scenes right Amazon raised their wages\nSo what they are and people can debate that this political reasons some people you know they're they're actually cutting some benefit some ... plans and their bonus plans for some people are saying workers might be making a little bit less or Amazon disputes that claim a your Amazon themselves or their their automated near warehouses sort of got even be an issue\nGoing forward as they continue to cut down on employees but the bottom line is from a PR standpoint they're paying their people Fifteen bucks an hour which is more than other their competitors like Wal Mart or doing as well they're gonna have to respond\nAnd if you're a small merchant uh this is what you're up against when you're when you're trying to attract\nPeople I the reason why I like this is the lesser of two evils John is that I I don't like the government\nTelling businesses what they should be paying their people I've always been non supportive of minimum wage I think that the federal minimum wage right now it's seven dollars and twenty five cents is unrealistic anyway and I don't really know any any of my clients are paying a you know an hourly wage that low\nUm I think it should be left up to you know the private sector and the private sector's doing that right Amazon right now saying it's we think Fifteen bucks an hour should be what it is so I prefer to have that then the government requiring it but now small merchant small businesses are hourly are paying hourly\nThey've got to respond to something like that and I wrote in the uh in the guardian recently how um you know my my clients that complain the most John about I'm not being able to find good people um I look at that and see their numbers they tend to pay their people less\nYou know they they're you know I just can't find a good person to work in a warehouse for ten dollars an hour and the reason why is because down the street somebody's paying twelve bucks an hour to do it\nSo I you know I think we as business owners have to realize that you get what you pay for\nAnd we do have to pay a little bit more and maybe it doesn't have to be in the form of wages maybe it's more paid time off or more fringe benefits or better health insurance but the tight labor market and we're either going to have to suck it up if we can or increased prices if we have to do that but\nYou know this is what's going on now and I think Amazon is that they are telling all small businesses by this move we better do something as well and that but\nHave a column and the guardian recovering the twenty Seventeen study by the University of Washington\nThat mitigate this rushed towards Fifteen dollars an hour if the ambition is more jobs now we're in a very tight job market right now actually the we're tight as an adequate there are there not enough workers one of the one of the\nOne of the practical reasons for Amazon to raise the wages that they need a hundred thousand a hundred and twenty thousand for the holidays and they might not be there so but in any event gene ... things have not changed right on the economics of minimum wage it decreases the number of employees\nAnd it limits the possibilities for a small business owners and franchises [noise] yeah I mean it's it's it's definitely a challenge\nFor business owners to react now again there was a study from the University of Washington that said that it had an impact on employment in Seattle where their minimum wage went up to Thirteen dollars an hour back in two thousand and six team but then another study just came out at at Berkeley which I Know you take it with a grain of salt John it's from Berkeley\nUp and they increase they they looked at a few cities that increased their minimum wages above ten dollars an hour Washington Chicago Seattle San Francisco and they they said no this didn't have any impact on jobs over the years there's been plenty of studies that that you contradict each other on the impact of whether a minimum wage\nHurts job growth or not the bottom line is though is that you know it it's a competitive market and right now employees um I could have their say they didn't have to say ten years ago when the unemployment rate is so high\nBusinesses have to respond to that and we have to pay more if you want good people you gotta you gotta pay for them or you're going to lose out to companies like Amazon and you have to adjust in some way\nOn line with us or increase your price unless unless the employee is a robot okay let's examine the trend here too you know these are the you have a guardian column about ... ... retail store what does that and what does the controversy well\nThere are um first of all there there's Amazon itself\nUh is is been introducing cash flow stores around the country they just opened a third casually store in Chicago just recently where you go into the store and\nUh you know you can pay you know you're by yourself you take it off the shelf you pay with the app and there's no cash that's involved is an automated store which is cutting down on employees technology is one way that you get around having to\nHave those employees and so a lot of companies um when they're looking at you know how to save on cost a lot of them are being forced\nTo take a step up and make some investments and self service types of kiosks in point of sale systems and uh maybe selling more on line and doing things that require less people around\nAnd Amazon itself it's funny John this is one company that\nYou know they're paying now because they need those holiday workers\nI Know what ever Amazon says they don't want to have all this holiday workers if it was up to them they would have it all automated and they're working toward that they have more than fifty thousand robots right now that are in their warehouses and twenty different locations around the country and it's growing\nThat's doing a lot of the tests that warehouse workers did\nSo I think Amazon is being forced to do this kind of stuff but\nYou know they're they're actually opening of stores that that are casual is an employee list are virtually employee list\nOr because they see where it's going that automation will save\nA lot of people's time yeah I I wrote it another piece also in the guardian about a company named atrium ... San Francisco what it was a process yeah sixty five million bucks this company because they've come up with a and a ice software in artificial intelligence soft or application that does the work of lawyers\nOr um [noise]\nI'm John Bass or this is the John ... is a columnist for the guardian and this is a small business for more business of America is small business the business of the planet is small businesses has\nBrought to you by the republic of Azerbaijan which in my visit I saw is an excellent capital estate with lots of small businesses in all directions looking for more that the middle of Eurasia and the middle of North America together for small businesses didn't Jean\nThe economy is extremely strong can I say that again extremely strong we have deals in place now that are solving the terror of disputes with our allies that would be Canada and Mexico are allies the European Union Japan is in conversation\nHowever what I learned is to pay attention to the small business because that is the metrics that leads us you told me in the winter of sixteen\nUh watch out for Donald Trump small businesses love him they think they're going to get a big boost from me then I went what now I pay attention again when small businesses are looking at this fabulous climate just fat the markets are up the ... the chairman of the Federal Reserve says things can get better\nSo what does small businesses make of this excitement\nUm ... [laughter]\nWell okay maybe a little bit better than many people are happy that's good news um by clients I talked to a ... they're happy they're there they're looking for employees that they are busy there certainly um you know you're pleased with the way the economy is going but\nInterestingly enough particularly with small businesses and I keep an eye on these guys the question is John if the if they're doing well should they be spending more shouldn't they be hiring more now hiring it small businesses ease up but it hasn't\nBeen at the same level as big corporations\nAnd now a new survey a new report that just came out\nFrom Pepperdine University um is is actually saying that\nUh the financing among small businesses is is is lagging a little bit this you know this report found out that I'm a third of the small businesses that they they surveyed with under five million in revenue only a third of them so that they plan to raise financing and the next six months forty\nThree percent don't plan to raise any financing at all and twenty three percent aren't sure what they'll do which\nTranslates into the fact that small business owners themselves as strong as the economy is they're just still cautious we are a very cautious breed we still have the great recession and it's hard to believe it's like almost ten years ago but it's still\nSticking in our minds let's not forget that the average age of the small business owner in America is about fifty three years old\nSo we're old enough to really remember that recession and before we extend ourselves too much or expand chew much um we're really not yoga gonna think very hard about doing that\nYes we're happy with the way things are going yes we're happy as the economy is growing but are we really getting the financing that we need every really spending on expansion um it's it's not happening at the pace that you would think it would be happening\nIs it how it cost is it health costs gene you have a color as the guardian that looks at the expected rise and health costs and twenty Nineteen right so people\nAre or are concerned not only about employee cost and finding employees and meeting that demand but one of the biggest cost that we're all facing happens to be health costs yeah we've been looking at double digit healthcare insurance increases over the past few years now the good news\nIs that they're actually to report that just came out very recently one from a consulting firm called out of their health that found out that health care costs are really on the expected to rise about four point one percent next year for employers in addition to that\nHealth care costs as well um based on the Kaiser foundation study that just came out this week also predicts about a fight\nIt's an increase in five percent is like for health care that's pretty good I mean you're right I mean we're used to a lot more than that\nBut even so the cost of a typical employee for health care is developed around twenty thousand dollars a year it's still significant and the demands for healthcare insurance are higher than ever and they need to provide that kind of benefit is the priority if we want to attract good people\nSo it's certain costs for that and keep an eye on retirement costs as well John which are also creeping up\nThese types of cost or people were a business owners were spending more on our people um and the costs to maintain them and keep them loyal unhappy than getting financing to go out and you know build new you build new buildings or expand our businesses so I Do think yes that is one big fact that when he gets back\nTo things change first California is looking at a changing small business lending practices you regard this to the good\n[noise] I I I regarded as I Can't believe it it it does now all of a bill in California to legislate legislative built it it's it's pending to be signed into law will likely be signed into law\nWhich is requiring lenders to provide full disclosure now here's what the bill requires lenders it's led in part particularly on line lenders they have to tell you the total amount that you're that you're borrowing that that the cost of the financing that term how often you have to pay what the pre payment policies are\nThese are kind of like standard things right I mean if you were going to get you know alone\nUh these things you'd be asking for well apparently there are a lot of small businesses in this country that get loans from online lenders that aren't getting that kind of information unfortunately and so the state legislature in California stepped in and said listen if you're going to be an online lender and land in California\nWere requiring you to make sure that your your your clients your customers know this information that you are disclosing it all to them so I think it's a great thing for small businesses are but I Will tell you one thing if you're a business owner and you're not even asking these questions\nYou better hire an accountant or an attorney to represent you if you're getting any kind of financing even from an online vendor because those people will be asking these questions regardless of whether the law requires them or not\nAnd Michigan a form association health plans under federal rules is just to work around that is viable we've seen others rejected yeah we're\nTalking about health care before so I I'm a big proponent of association health plans these is a ruling a that was issued by the department of labor it's under the Trump Administration is one of the many things that the Trump Administration is doing so to circumvent the Affordable CARE Act and in Michigan there's now stories of companies that are forming associations\nSo you don't have to join your industry group although maybe your industry group offers them but you could form your own association and if you have more than a hundred employees that are part of his association you're like minded businesses or whatnot\nYou can negotiate better rates because the rules are under Obamacare are not as onerous if you have more than a hundred employees which means that\nYou can cut out some essential health benefits and and and get lower premiums for yourself and your employees now some people might not be crazy about that but\nYou can't exclude people with preexisting conditions and you can't charge people more\nBased on their health history association plans are great option to offer to your employees along with whatever else you're\nYou're currently offering just be where it's a Trump Administration thing John and you know as we've learned by executive order that can be overturned by a quick this is not law today and tomorrow that get reelected these things go right out the door\nJean Marc she's the small business columnist for the guardian another distinguish publication this is the small business report brought to you by the republic of Azerbaijan which is

that all that combat power will be locked that island they can't leave until late in mind that that are that area so we're talking not just delete your ability you know better by it all the idea of what my warfare is and that is definitely going to have a right to my eyebrows at Beijing\nAnd this is for the B. fifty two because the B. fifty two has such\nA lift capability that's why they're designing all these new weapons for it you can put on a library of your arsenal and and lunch\nYes let's put it this way right now of what we know of the ... fifty two if I remember correctly has five hyper sonic weapons systems being developed for it five\n... that's what we know about 'em so it it it is the air horses bomber truck of weapons to talk of the future it's caring big out quite weapons\nLong distances and delivering them set up ranges and do this one of the other great that I could not that Ted is they want to make that outer pile on capable as being a weapon up when the thousand pound class so that's a big big weapons okay\nUm and that's something that would be like a like a hyper ... like your call 'em\nBut even these quick strike by its can get his biggest two thousand pounds so instead of sending a fighter that can carry two of them\nYou can set of Bob Carey twenty four of them and laying acquire might have killed in one shot\nThe beat fifty to the weapon to fear in the twenty first century who knew and the twenty of now we go to the air force has plans to expand their operations with new squadrons you will recall that the air force and all the military services\nHave been a guaranteed these last years because of Congress's inability to reach a budget that is no longer the case and what the air force one is striking\nA tie your reporting that they want to go from three hundred and twelve squadrons to three hundred and eighty six that's a lot of new aircraft of why what is it that they need what capability did they gain with that growth\nSo basically that plan has capability growth in every combat\nKind of it in a category that they do so air force wants to grow the squad or number space in fighter and bomber and refusing ... a lot and refueling um so it's pretty much everybody needs to get that wants to boost it out of a quiet which is totally that's what\nI mean and how there is no I yeah how it's going to happen but the take away the horse really try I'm trying to get Congress to come up\nWith the reality that there's not enough aircraft or combat hour period\nTo eat and addicts by the man that their day yet alone if we gave it until really protracted even a low intensity conflict or whatever so\nThe chickens have come home to roost sweat coverage to the airport audience be hot bath for that or the Cold War and he has to oust three we could not now Asian of Iraq with air power to use today like we did back then ...\n... we don't have it so this is a remedy that a big question is how are they got to work\nWell they'll pay for it out of necessity the same way they paid for the fleet after Nineteen thirty nine in Nineteen forty one so let's go to what else the air force is either upgrading or needs to ...\nHas has need for attention the beach to what is that ... what is the beach it it it really looks really cool what's it for\nThe beat you up with the beat she was an ... you know it was built in Nineteen eighty nine is on his first bail and it's amazing to think of it at all it's a Thirty Years' old or soap operas been around for awhile racial for about Twenty years\nOr Twenty one years and it's ... we already have horizon but they will America's silver bullet course it is the most capable air combat vehicle and the world are they can penetrate deep into enemy airspace route\nTo show us or ask and want to ask that are ... eighty is hurting or munitions you get to pick out and hire or building building with one of the authors\nAnd the beach too is operating now in the middle east or I remember reading about that have they rotated them out of the middle east out of out of the cuts are field I think is where I read about it once upon a time where I still there so\nNo they're not out ... to ... that generally a an air for main basis um that they have operational support that there are some in Hawaii right now that are trying to you on that uh that are actually in the wake island worth feeling really caught on which is all do but in the middle East that would be\nA nice ride the better one be the older the older strike aircraft by yes\nSo it's there there's the the one which they operate now have been using against ISIS as I recall that back to that is based largely in the U.S and is now part of this ... geo strategic\nA maneuvering in the Pacific out of Hawaii the B. fifty two we've mentioned the grandfather of grandfathers and then there's a new strike bomb or they're they're developing for the for the future how soon as the future for the new strike bummer\nWell amazingly so uh I think that it's aircraft is going to enter operational capability and twenty twenty five which is really hard to believe 'em but\nThey move very fast on it it uses a lot of existing technologies are so they're not developing all the avionics and all the time it gets really expensive they're trying to use off the show\nTechnologies floor and packaging I mean I'm very still a cutting edge here so the idea that would always say cost they want to spend\nWhat six hundred million or coffee which sounds like a lot of money but it's not it talked about stealth bombers right adding to buy a lot of them instead of like the beach too which is a death spiral but it's only after the Cold War only only on were built I'm only twenty exist today\nThe beach but what they're talking at least one hundred but based on like this new book a bomber um oh this is water and gold if they have it we just discuss\nWe could very well see that a Twenty one go to like a hundred and fifty or even a hundred and Seventy you that because it's not just the longer it goes a hundred different things it's optional in bands as well it can be censored out it can be very upset about initiatives\nIt can work as a quarterback ... air vehicles potentially\nBut it's not just the traditional bomber at target fly home this thing could support a fleet in ways that really um there are still I'm ...\nI'm speaking with Tyler Rockaway he keeps a war zone at the drive with his colleagues and we're talking about the air force in its capabilities when we come back what is the weapon uh

supposed to do it we stood up and two thousand Fifteen by former defense secretary Ash Carter and it was meant to be the Pentagon's liaison to Silicon Valley so it was up to bridge\nBoth the culture and the practical gap that exists between a Washington DC and Silicon Valley to help the defense department really grab and harness all of the great innovation that was coming out of the American

Pentagon the risks inherent in\nUh the increasing amount of Chinese investment in key sensitive technology areas or that also occupy the started seeing a for instance artificial intelligence\nSo it's a a difficult process of trying to get a handle on on on this because it's not one that has a single easy solution on the one hand you don't want to restrict a venture capital money that\nThese startups desperately need but that's something that the government is paying more attention to and figuring out how to do it are the most recently passed natural defense authorization act includes a provision to help the government change or how\nIt uh determines what sort of a investments foreign companies and foreign countries like China and Chinese companies can make us start ups a\nBut it's also an effort to you is to help again or the defense department's secure\nInnovative technology solutions from a non traditional players so or not big uh a defense contractors and it's a real a pill bottle so it if you if you haven't looked at the paper which uh\nFor the first to actually publish the final version of it on defense one uh it\nIt highlights uh some of the dangers that uh uh at very least many a growing number of people in the defense department or and also think tanks are are highlighting in terms of a supply chain compromise and other issues from the growing amount of of Chinese investment there are but\nIt's it's not an again to a problem that has an easy solution because it's free flow of capital\nIs also kind of a thing that we're all about it's it's really a big part of America's branch to the rest of the world and so a navigating this new space where a we're watching technology transfer to a\nPotential future adversary what we today describe as they can pay a competing nation a competitor nation uh it's not something that's easily fixed but that's something that ah the Pentagon's outreach arm to Silicon Valley is going to be spending more time\nDoing three free points that you develop in your piece at defense won won the vc industry in this country is throwing all this money on software meaning everybody's innovating out there to the Chinese are no longer according to his round there no longer copycats\nTheir creative and three there are several Manhattan projects or authored by China\nA command economy a which right now we do or not matching AI is one I Know about but there are several others that could be listed here so what does brown recommend what it what is the need to get to use it to to make his job possible\nWell it it's a good point I he does highlight the contrast between the way the Chinese government takes a whole of government and kind of whole economy\nResponse to ambitious technological goals and ... them with big investments and things like a quantum computing and and artificial intelligence and those big investments also come with big vision statements that they're able to tie different aspects of\nThe country together into meet the commercial sector that the government to beg you know has a primary influence over there's also a the military et cetera so uh one of the things that he's\nSuggesting brown and suggesting is that uh maybe it's time for the United states to begin to match from a government funding perspective some\nOf this research and development that we see coming out of China and also maybe to develop some of its own big vision statements its own Manhattan projects\nA toward some of these areas hyper sonics and we are investing more in hyper sonics but it's a it's been an effort in fits and starts and and the Chinese are\nSurging very quickly to a head in some key areas artificial intelligence and we are standing up by the Pentagon is standing up a a new\nCenter for artificial intelligence research but that's military specific and we can bring in a commercial entities that also have their uses out of that and when you signed up to meet those needs you're going to have more success and in a few other areas and he also it was it was actually sort of interesting uh even though\nYou know uh it's it's now the Trump there he actually a structure very on Trump Ian chord are talking about how uh the most recent round of tax cuts is probably not going to be in line with a stepping up to meet\nA static adversary but I'm One of the things that\nThe air force right now is recognizing a in what they want from uh the new bomber that they're developing and I think you might even see the the same sort of thing come into future language about uh ICBMs and and with the navy begins to talk about it were when they replace a nuclear submarines um\nIs this sense that new defenses against us bombers\nThey're going to be more difficult and also change more rapidly\nThan a perhaps the U.S is prepared for at least in terms of the way we used to design stuff and it's because of information technology right that's because ah\nCan shooter or software based uh a radio radar um\nSoftware based threat detection software based uh you know methods\nFor attacking information systems that are part of aircraft those things evolve at the speed of information technology which is much faster than hardware balls or and so what they want from this next strategic bomber is that it be\nA not only rapidly a credible but rapidly credible in several key areas including defensive systems and so that speaks to the need for a\nA probably new forms of cognitive a electronic warfare capabilities and also a cognitive defensive capabilities which means\nThe ability a innate in terms of the software that's on the plane to detect new forms of radar detection that are being thrown at it and also to uh to execute new forms of offensive or electronic warfare\nWeapons delivery and that's on top of caring whatever payload it needs to carry a but one of the things that they also are looking at is how this thing is going to operate alongside a bunch of other aircraft to create a sense of\nUncertainty in in a potential adversary and that's that's also a big change from the way we used to think about nuclear deterrents right because that's the go back to your doctor Strangelove those ah bombers are flying to sort of you know send a message a but you're the fighter jets send a completely different message and now\nThe the emphasis on creating a sense that hey you know with a I'm\nA long range strategic cruise missile\nA that is nuclear tipped it's possible to have a fighter jet that also serves in the function of of a bomber um and that's something that they're talking about and and for a couple of years now they've been talking in an abstract way not in a formal way but in an abstract way about bringing some of that capability onto the thirty five\nPatrick ... they're they're treating air frames like the way Tesla treats its automobiles they don't actually touched the machine they upgrade with software is that what they're thinking of here that is that the the air frame remains the same but its capabilities will change as they write new software\n[noise] um yeah basically that that that's not necessarily that this the capability will improve with as soon as you press a button or you might have to install something new but it can improve pretty quickly and do your point though\nWhen David goldfish in general they would go and who's the chief of staff Airforce talks about what he once and future air fringe actually does bring up exactly what you just described he actually brings up Tesla in remote updating\nOf a core functioning of the ... of the systems on board by\nVirtue of just you give them a new payload and all of a sudden you've got an entirely new way of\nThat aircraft interface with the pilots of communicating with a command and and really of accessing the world so that is something that they want to move towards this is remote updating of a lot of different aspects of the way these planes function in terms of uh they're sort of the court brains on board\nWe turn and naturally to space act because space X right now is popular because it's building cheaper boosters first stage repeatable boosters that you can buy secondhand in third hand\nHowever now a debate emerges that I did not know about about space X taking orders for weaponized space\nAs I understand that Patrick what's happened is that we're no longer debating should the space be weaponized it is and it's going to be so the question is how are we going to respond is this a contract or in other words would add the Airforce be outsourcing its weaponized of space to go to space ex\nWell this was as an interesting\nAnd I think sort of revealing moment that also occurred at the uh air forces recent confidence when when ... well who are basically runs\nSpace acts on terms of the day to day operations there uh she's the president and and the c._e._o. or was asked if that space X would consider delivering weapons payloads into space and she said sure why not\nUm so again it's a it's a it's nothing that's become a contract yet but it does speak to a what\nIs the next stage of the U.S putting things into space and there's a lot of push a particularly from Michael Griffin who's the under secretary of defense for research and engineering to put a lot more sensors in space and also potentially deport direct energy which is blazers or a neutral particle beams or weapons\nIn space to attack missiles as they're launching during the boost that this is something that he's talked about\nUh in terms of a\nPotentially of great interest in an advantage to the United states so it's no longer is so much of an abstract discussion at something that's becoming\nA a real discussion do not yet connected to a big change in policy where a lot of people are waiting for the new missile defense review to come out to explain that but space exploration example of one of these new commercial private space players that's kind of seeing\nThe writing on the wall in terms of the way one of the world's\nUp probably world's largest space single space customer\nA is talking about what they want to do and and signaling that that's something that they're comfortable with but I you know even though you can say and I think that that certainly Defense Department folks do say that the weaponization of space as it is a\nThing that is actively occurring that a Chinese anti satellite test which go back now more than ... years are very real and the the facts of them are known to the entire world Russian a placement of\nA robotic entities in space that may serve an anti satellite functioned that's something that a more and more people are talking about and uh it's a matter of known intelligence at this point so even though you can say that the weaponization of space and something that's already happened the differences that China and Russia aren't yet acknowledging that that's something that they're doing\nWhereas the U.S policy seems to be a we're going to at some point announced the possibility of intentional\nPlacement of objects in space a which means that I don't know in many ways it sort of the worst of both worlds there kind of late to the game but they're the first one to take all the heat for it because there is a lot of concern internationally about whether or not that something that the international space treaty would support\nPatrick Tucker the technology editor of defense ... specially recommend the defense innovation unit paper that Patrick has made possible through defense

galaxies into their residents\nShall we say and the void expand as a result and so you can look at what's going on as galaxy clusters in full then pulling in an additional ... sued the gravity you could also look at it\nAs the void victims there galaxies as the filling that attract\nThose avoid galaxies toward it so probably the reason that the local she is so very fit it's simply because of

artist the Milky Way we're going through the University of six hundred and thirty kilometers per second which is fast okay one point for a million miles per hour is that because of the local boy does it make us go that fast\n[noise] yes it is part of the reason that we're going very fast and let me first put that number in prospect six hundred and thirty ... kilometers per second which as you correctly say it's one point four million miles per hour that's really fast\nBut okay if you compare that much faster than like going around the stuff I mean there goes around the stuff that only thirty kilometers for second and the sun goes around the center of the Milky Way galaxy only two hundred and fifty\nKilometers per second so here we are the entire local group of galaxies that the Milky Way and they ... they were\nAt all the other galaxies in the local good or all moving through the interest at six hundred and thirty kilometers per second much faster than we go around the sun will go around the galaxy and the question is why well it must be because there are huge cosmic structures out there\nThat are trying to pull of their way or perhaps push us away of a local boy does what are these things but first let me talk about two other\nObjects that are a very important to our motion one of them as the Virgo Cluster of galaxies it's located fifty four million light years from earth it's the nearest galaxy cluster to us and it's trying to pull us its way through its gravity also at a greater distance there's something called the great a tractor\nWhich is an even more massive clusters of galaxies and it too is trying to pull off its way in a different direction\nAnd then you've got the local boy which is what you asked about now Lloyd's don't try to push ... they'll try to pull us\nThat way because there's very little matter in a void instead you can think of the local boy is trying to push us allies felt the polls from the vertical cluster\nAnd the greatest tractor and a big push from the local boy explain our motion to the University of very high speed of six hundred and thirty kilometers per second so yes we do need to include the influence\nOf the local avoid as we try to understand that very high speed\nThat we have through the universe or as I say in the article in the sky telescope nothing really matters\nThe illustrations accompanying your sky telescope peace are revelations to me 'cause they're they're working on this scale and when we come to the local group of galaxies or how we move through space but surrounding us our super clusters of the coma cluster the Hercules Cluster\nThe shape bleak concentration the lettuce cluster are those also exerting a poll upon us are we are we being bandied about by all of that the local the local void moving because of all those clusters\nWell yes all of these structures are influencing our motion to the universe\nAnd so the clusters try every cluster tries to pull us it's way okay 'cause every clusters got galaxies at every galaxy as math than anything and it has massive gotta gravitational pull so every cluster is trying to polish pope pull off its way but the vertical cluster the the greatest tractor the ...\nThey're all trying to pull their way and and the boys are trying to push us away because they've got less\nMattered than the average and still the local boy this is pushing us away and so our motion to the universe is very high speed is hundred and thirty clobbered I second\nIs is a result of all of those great cause that cities\nAnd then at the end the dish into that at a very large distance to a a new boy has been just discovered called the dipole we tell her Lloyd and it also tells us and it's it's trying to push us away and about the same direction that the\nGreatest tractors trying to pull off\nOkay so when you take into account these very large scale things and we're talking out to a different set of about a billion light years this

computer they using on curiosity it's actually the backup computer because shortly after it landed on Mars the primary computer started have problems\nHardware and software issues and so they switched to the backup they have a ... over the over time they have diagnose the primary computer\nThey're not using it but they've ... they've diagnosed it figured out with a bad memory was so that they think they can use it again and that's now crucial here because the backup computer that they're using [noise]\nUm they're always sending limited engineering data right now from a short term memory it tells

function they can't even get 'em uh\nThe adventure records what's been going on to try to diagnose what the problem is so what the engineers decided to do is to switch back to the first computer the

carries a little bit of risk because the old computer did have problems they say they've diagnosed it and they know exact they have\nIsolated the bad um sections on the memory that they don't want to use\nBut you know the scary some risk\nIn the meantime curiosity is not giving any better it's not ... it's not doing anything it's been sitting now for more than two weeks without being able to give us any information even though they can communicate with it and meanwhile opportunity remain silent or they have been check you know they're checking on it multiple times a day [noise]\nUm but they've got no response from it now since mid June um they're hoping they think what's happened is that the it's a it's full of panels have been covered with dust so we can't get enough energy even though there's no much stalled and they're hoping that dust devils go by and blow the dust off that has happened to the past\nBut they're not getting the response yet so we don't know and what this means is

have communications with the rover and it's working so I think that their optimism my curiosity is ... is is realistic\nBut there's a risk with opportunity they basically stated where we are uh if if those solar panels are covered and they're not getting any energy that I can hear ... pillows pals get cleared\nAnd it could very well be months another month or two because November's the dust up all

thousand light years away and seeing data that they think indicates a moon orbiting an exoplanet\nI the scientists were very careful to say that this is not come from a candidate it's going to take
