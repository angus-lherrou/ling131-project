the lord staffers than if an applicant did not having Social Security number\nThe system would quote auto populate end quote a number for them\nSo funk says for both of these workers it looked like a

address is not their state once\nFunded not named the women and he said he understood that concept to the inspector general's office of the federal department of health and Human Services and asked

smart guy and a law professor good to speak with you thanks for joining me\nGood to speak to you as well so you're you're cited in the journals report on this rather than reading your stuff tell me what your gut check is on this dilemma\nWell I I continue to really be mystified at how absolutely wrong\nWe get this stuff as a society in every possible way um we take a person who's been released at the conclusion of their sentence we treat them like a pariah we make it\nAlmost impossible for them to find stable housing we make it\nAlmost impossible for them to find stable employment those are the things that the data quite clearly show us a assist people and re entering society becoming productive members of society and significantly reduce recidivism\nBut with sex offenders we decide to do everything exactly backwards and increase the danger to society at the same time we treated human being as though he is not a human being\nYou know I expected you to say that and I think it has a lot of merit I did say yesterday that I'm not sure exactly what the\nThis this consensus think is all about what the endgame isn't or we are we thinking about that and you know at least a Scorpio when the community activists to me she said we're just gonna keep shoving till he leaves a you know he can go to another neighborhood were sick and tired of the stuff in Providence\nOkay um I get that how do you think that there's ever been\nA study or is there any documentation that shows that when a sex offender by the way I got too much allusions though the key way this is a sentencing issue as far as I'm concerned but you know now that the ... the ... and ... this guy's problem\nOr was this kind of situation is so screwed up uh originally he had two hundred years I mean there was just so much that was late in his deal and then there was there was some human error when it came to both of Rhode Island in Massachusetts handling of his case and so he's been out for a couple of years because of some slip ups and\nAnd some some some bad formed due process stuff so I read anyway\nIs there ... ... is there any\nData out there that shows that when someone is charged with this has a stable employer will life host incarceration that they actually straighten out\nThat the risk of recidivism is lower yeah they're absolutely categorically is data out there that shows\nExplain a little bit\nIt's it's not actually that complicated I mean what what we do with sex offenders here in Rhode Island as we pass laws that draws circles around every institution you can imagine and say ... a person with a sex offense on the record can't live in that circle\nA and the consequences those circles is that is virtually no place that a sex offender who has to register and live legally in the state of Rhode Island ah and certainly no place where there might be affordable housing so an overwhelming percentage of our registered sex offenders are home\nOr not surprisingly that drove a number of registered sex offenders to Harrington hall our state's largest almost shelter right and then in its wisdom the legislature passed a bill that said no more than ten percent of the residents of Harrington hall may be registered sex offenders are there by taking somebody\nIt was already homeless but living in a shelter system\nAnd throwing them out onto the streets which common sense should tell you is not where you want a sex offender to be a hanging out right uh and then uh it's very difficult for somebody without a stable addressed to access successfully services and to remain a receiving social services and treatment\nOf because the more transient you are or the ... you know you don't own a car you're lucky if you can access public transportation good luck accessing social services so we're we're reckoning barriers to all of the logical things that we ought to be doing\nA in order to try and reduce recidivism things that are\nProof that were due to you know I I got I got a stable employment of course is the last piece the puzzle sure right if you have something to do that's productive every day or you're much less likely to wander\nA professor anymore which is with me I got to tell you man I have this vision of you saying\nThis and I'm sure you have in many many forms and many many places saying this in front of that group in Washington Washington park Wednesday night and being booted out of the place\nOh I'm sure it would be because nobody there is interested in listening to rational reasonable talk\nBut here's the thing we got we got a mayor\nWho you know for a municipal judge who looking at an election day two and a half weeks from now walked in there and I'm told spur of the moment lead on his police department of promise of twenty four seven surveillance\nThat didn't help\nWhat what really didn't help was the statement that Mr gardener doesn't belong in Providence and has no business living in the city a new I ... I have never been more disappointed in a public official in my life I don't think than reading those comments or I consider mayoral or as a a friend he's the former colleague of mine at the law school at\nThe very smart and capable person I Can't imagine for the life of me what he was thinking or why he would say it's election day and well\nOr whatever uh I Can't you know a fueling the fires of vigilante isn't a mob is\nA is not an appropriate thing for a mayor or any public officials to do the twenty four seven watch at this stage I actually think is required for one purpose which is to protect master gardener\nA there's an angry mob outside of its house and they continue to say that there'll be there every day I I don't think the police department at this point as any choice but to do its duty and protect Mr gardeners safety\n[noise] what do we do with this thing I don't know we do with this thing that I like I I honestly I don't know kind of stamina the neighborhood will have for this and I don't know at what point it\nBecomes blatantly obvious to anybody looking at this thing in common sense way that this guy is being unduly harassed them the constitution and I don't know what kind of resources the police department have to continue to spend the money to fulfill the promise that was made knee jerks for the moment\nI don't know any of those things I don't know what the endgame is here for anybody\nI I Wish I had something intelligent [laughter] in response to that other than that I agree with you I don't I don't CNN game either I suppose perhaps with the passage of time\nPeople's emotions calm down to the point where they can actually think and use reason and listen but I'm not optimistic about that\nYou haven't thought about what I said at the beginning which is that for these particular convictions uh the only thing I've ever thought is that it's got to be a throat key way type of crime I mean we we are so incapable of of processing this\nThis Michigan's

why they're right over to ours by calling us at one end any money to present the my whole advisor\nWinter is coming is your roof ready if it's time to replace the heating system or the roof whatever's on that project plan home advisor can instantly match you with the right pro for the job for free\nHome seems to rely on their heating and cooling system can maintain comfort all throughout the year but what do you do in one room to one room to cold do you start doing science experiments and adjusting Benson thermostat\nThat's right and in order to compensate for those uneven temperatures many homeowners often open enclosed dance they wear layers of they set up with a thermostat throughout the entire day which of course does nothing to solve the problem and definitely drives your energy costs up there are better solutions\nFor advice on how to do just that we turn now to Richard ... he's the heating and plenty expert for TV's this old house welcome Richard and guys that wasn't all that bouncing of the thermostat up and down all day that's got to add to a lot of waste energy right\nRight I mean hot and cold spots throughout the home are not only annoying they're also inefficient it usually comes down to poor duct work ... you know we'd love to make the assumption that the first person that did the engineering to do the heating system in this building\nCalculated exactly how many ... calculated exactly what size the ducks should be calculate exactly the right amount of air coming out and then put everything in correctly was not always the\nCase just doesn't happen in so we end up with areas in our house that are too hot to cold I mean I've got a an addition I have an old house Eighteen eighty six\nThe kitchen is an addition that was sort of bolted on after the initial construction so now you have an addition that has more sides that are exposed to the weather that room or was always hotter in the summer\nWas always cold in the winter and we had to add to it we had that air conditioning\nCompensate because basically it was calling for more be to use and we were delivering his right\nAnd that's the condition that that is really a faced by many people across the country and in problem areas like for example rooms above garage to distract rooms or at the end of the building as far away from the HVAC system so if the guy that put it in initially got it wrong or if there were just changed the building over the years\nWhat are some of the ways that you can attack that\nWell I think zoning is underutilized in this country there are mechanical zoning dampers that can be added to hotter system\nThat can like in the case of your kitchen ... ... that's probably the farthest room away from the furnace okay well air or water wants to take the path of least resistance who doesn't want to find his way through a long dark it'll say I'm just going to go right here and I'm going to go right up through this duck to the upstairs second floor and overheat the second floor\nWas only we can say no let's shut off the air that would have or might have gone to the second floor and drive it to the farthest are hardest to place and that would be your kitchen\nSo a separate zone is literally a separate set of ducks separate supplies shame\nDocks all we're doing is putting in a motorized dampers invest strategic places in ... okay the dock system and that really is that technology is out there that technology is not perfected\nSo many of the heating industry just says oh I don't want to do that I'm not sure I Know how to do that and so they're down and what they're not up on but zoning is a very important sort of thing to be able to deliver comfort and to save energy\nMany times you have a furnace that is heating up a very big part of the building but we really don't need the kitchen or the the den to be heated\nSo unlike hot water zone and we're really do have separate sets of pipes with zoning and hot air we really use just one set of ducks but we just control and balance the flow detrimental to where we need it when we need\nThat's right and what we need to do is to be able to match the furnaces size or power if you've only got one register open you don't want their full size\nResponse so some of these modern for instance can now talk in concert with the zoning system\nWe're talking to Richard ... he's the heating and plenty expert for TV's this old house now a sudden the duck system thermostat location can sometimes be problematic if it's not the right position you could get false readings and false communications to the heating and cooling\nSystems and everything we've seen thermostats behind the television and the TV's given out of big flat screen is given us so much that he's right we've seen people that put a woodstove and right next to the farmers to satisfy their thermostats for the rest of the house doesn't have any we're setting and everything it really needs to be in a representative location or to be able\nTo sample what the buildings looking for now aside from laying out the ducks and proper way of putting the thermostat in the wrong place sometimes the initial counter to discuss the duck size incorrect or the size of the ACC system incorrect cry over\nSeizing mechanical equipment is the number one energy waste or in the home heating system everybody if they were does if the HBO she industry was designing a car they put ... into the equivalent of folks whether they want to be safe they won't have plenty of power but it actually leads you weren't completely against you\nBecause if you've got too big of a furnace or boiling\nIt comes on his shuts off comes on and shuts off it gives you too much heat and then it doesn't give you enough and so it cycles not tried doing that to any device do it to an automobile turn it on and off every minute\nYou wouldn't be efficient it wouldn't it wouldn't last and that's what we're doing so we're sort of and the consumers the uninvited co
