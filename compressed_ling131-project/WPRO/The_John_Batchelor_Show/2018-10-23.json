H. A. R. P. sharp better as we're all in on before this game was the over crash so you know what not a good week necessarily for the sharp better as you mentioned earlier and we know the old off air show\nI I Can't remember in all honesty and again I'm a nerd junkie I track these things for a a decent living um [laughter]\nI Can't remember Russia game where more sharp betters were on a team\nFor a reason that I could not fathom then the better that we're all over the Chicago Bears leading up to that bears patriots game we chronicle last week how the line and opened at three\nThree and a half and a lot of places and I got back Monday and got it at two and a half much to his surprise but then before kickoff gotten all the way down to minus one and a half\nAnd the sharks were basically taken a victory lap at Seventeen to seven on Twitter as well so\nI have no hard feelings for them they got what they deserved\nBut yeah I mean it just an incredible amount of action was flooding in Chicago before the game good news though crash\nIs that it was a great week for public better is usually I end up until this week ... the casinos had been cleaning up for the most part but last week or this weekend rather teams that received better than sixty percent of the bats and money\nWent six and one which means a lot of ... a lot of public players out we're able to make out what their money and even more to the point of the casinos having a bad week at the book\nWas that when the Kansas City chiefs covered and one on Sunday Night Football that basically meant every parlay and teaser that people at play throughout the day came in because taking Casey just to win straight up while in itself not necessarily a great profitable bad I think there were like minus five hundred cars or a decent size favorite or something to that effect\nBut if they were part of a two three five ten team parlay and that came in for you that was bad news for the books and enough of those came in that it was bad news for the books are very bad week seven days\nOr weeks what we can get seven yeah we've got seven yet week seven for these sports books but you know what ... I'm pretty sure they'll rebound quite nicely\nYeah I don't think that ah they're going to be a caving in by any stretch of the imagination and a a run from Las Vegas follows me on Twitter really a a

someone who I Would consider a sharp\nAnd he was one of those guys were it was oh boy ... you're right I couldn't figure out why the ... the supposed smarts and sharp well all over Chicago\nI got it when it was three and a half and three because those are the number I Would agree yeah ... like ... and and for those who aren't familiar to there is a huge difference a lot of short better as well like a game at three and a half and they won't like it at three it's just the the minutia that goes into this but when they were still buying up all the action of two and a half\nAnd that water to have like what is going on here I don't grow out but\nThe Brady get ruled out do is already out I'm going to be running the show there are behind center because even that I would've I would've liked to his mom is one and a half ago to ... well uh let's also hit the trade of the day and that is that hey\nI'm Jerry Jones or Dallas Cowboys name in fact you named my man we need to get something I'm going to give up what we need to get\nThat something because I think we need that something and uh now Jerry Jones has straight at age ... thousand Nineteen first round pick to the Oakland Raiders for

disappeared\nWe're up here to give us a better understanding of why exactly the Saudis were sort of raise and leave a headline that live for the first several days it's not the first week that democracy has left the conflict on harm\nWould have been surprised by the fact they wanted to kill them desperately for years so this is it was surprising about this is the fact that they were successful in getting somebody into his inner coterie they're sort of in the security situation for this meeting to it and have this attack be successful\nThese attacks starting with the attack in Kandahar and now the most recent the attacking Iraq leading to the death of a check soldier these are taking place inside the larger story of the Afghanistan parliamentary elections underway\nWe've talked about that on and off over these last Eighteen years the democracy comes to Afghanistan or Tom you report that the Taliban has declared these elections I guess the work of the devil certainly the work of the u._s. and are they killing people who vote Tom what do we know\nWell John I think it's very important here to walk through with the Taliban is set about these elections for this purpose\nI'm the U.S policy to state policy is to try and get the Afghan tall blond to reconcile with the government\nAnd lay down its arms assertion of power in some sort of political ... power sharing system now for those of watch the have watched the tall blond for years and track everything they say\nWe realized that that sort of absurd goal on the face of it that basically the tall but it said over and over again we're resurrecting or Islamic EMR of Afghanistan were the only legitimate party in town well these were elections approach the Taliban ratcheted up its rhetoric of that statement after statement after steaming\nSaying that basically don't participate in these elections if you ... them or if you if you open up your homes or your facility as voting places you can become under attack and in fact the Taliban has um attacked claims\nHundreds attacks as elections were underway it seems like it had some effect on the elections it's very difficult to say how much\nBut it the bottom line is that the Taliban rule that this was a religious imperative to go and disrupt these elections\nThat's not the rhetoric or this this this um sort of a statement that you would expect from a group that was looking to politically reconcile and when you track through the statements job but we noticed was that they were actually being issued by different commissions within the Islamic EMR of Afghanistan and others are being attributed to different\nShadow government bodies within the tall blond and why that's significant is that there's there telegraphing that these are the conditions that are going to rule Afghanistan once the Americans get out and we have our way once again\nIt strikes me because I've been reading a Churchill biography a brand new one from Andrew Roberts it strikes me that the Taliban is beginning to look organized and the way that the IRA looked organized to the British authorities right after World War one as they took on the\nBlack in town where the British authorities and as they took on the IRA it was part of terrorist organization but also part a shadow government that was in place for the settlement with the with the Brits that produce modern Ireland\nYeah and the ... the difference here is that this there's I don't see any prospect for real settlement um if you go through the sort of Islamic jurisprudence that this ... organization relies\nUpon they're saying that it's the only an Islamic system the way we define it can rule over Afghanistan so even though sharia and different Islamic sort of um\nLanguages pepper throughout the Afghan constitution and of course they call themselves\nIslamic entity with the Taliban is that right or all along is that only our version of Islam and our job he weighs can rule over Afghanistan and they're they've been very clear they reject the the Afghan government as illegitimate they reject of course the U.S presidents as illegitimate\nAnd they reject the ... elections and they say that it violates their version of Islam They said these elections and the whole parliamentary process\nIs on Islamic is what they've its way of describing this whole election process is on Islamic that is not an organization that's looking to settle and come to terms and sort of sort of give us the sort of face saving deal on our way out\nDoes is connected in any fashion to the report we had a Taliban and U.S officials meeting in Doha, Qatar earlier in the month\nWell you know John this is why I brought up the American reaction to this attack and the fact that there are so reticent to say that it was a tall binding plant the obvious and say the Taliban killed our number one ally in southern Afghanistan and wounded Americans of this attack\nMy point is is that basically the Americans are so desperate to reach a deal with the Taliban they'd even when the Taliban has this major infiltrate or attack they\nCreate them a a a sniffing a power vacuum force in Kandahar and the top American military command and all that Afghanistan is present when this attack takes place and we don't come out and mealy condemned the Taliban and point the finger at them that tells you were not committed to identify me enemy let alone to feeding them\nAnd therefore the negotiations are of false false ... of a false signal were not sincere and our negotiations they are not sincere and there's and subsequent headlines can be ignored is that is that a conclusion we can draw your ...\nOh I I think were sincere in our negotiations were sincerely week the point is that we're just desperate to get any sort of face saving deal we can get they know that and they're looking to do what they've done in the past which has extract concessions string us out and basically humiliate our Afghan allies that's what they've done in the past ... years ago ... and that's certainly the game bland that they're using this\nTime does the Taliban in any way indicate that they that the Taliban believes in all of its rations believes that ice F is leaving in the new year do they indicate that did they tell their people that does does al ... tell the Taliban\nWell Titus predicted a since the election of President Trump\nThat this is what kind of said directly they said that the America First policy meant that America was going to retreat from Afghanistan and this is the beginning of the end for their superpower status just as it was for the Soviets that's what they've said all along and the Taliban has somewhat more mixed rhetoric on that they want to highlight for example with these past elections\nThey tried to say that this just trying to justify prolong the ... the presence of the foreigners here in Afghanistan which is sort of the rhetoric they're using but I think there are other indications they know that we are certainly looking to head for the doors\nTom Johnson of the foundation for the defense of democracy reporting on the news the fresh news\nOf

J. are the great for the great lakes my colleague in cost and\nWe're joined by Gordon Chang our colleague to comment on incident in the Taiwan Strait within these last days US Navy sail to guided missile warships through the Strait of Taiwan Taipei ministry of defense describe this as a routine passage to international waters\nNothing routine when you have the U.S navy warships in presents us has Curtis Wilbur D D G fifty four and USS\nAnd teach them CGI fifty four conducted according to the U.S military website military times a routine Taiwan Strait transit October twenty second in accordance with international law that yesterday their time 'cause it's tomorrow now is twenty third\nShift trends it's where the Taiwan straits demonstrates the U.S commitment to a free and open Indo Pacific\nUS Navy will continue to fly sale and operate anywhere in international law allows this is us Pacific Fleet commenting Gordon this follows a report last week that B. fifty twos I Believe to be fifty twos flew over the south China Sea which is open water\nAnd this follows repeated reports of the Chinese a PR the People's Republic of China China flying a nuclear capable bombers clockwise and counterclockwise around Taiwan\nHow do you measure is there a change in tempo your Gordon we moved from the Decatur in the south China Sea to the Curtis Wilbur and the ... and the ... the Taiwan Strait is there an escalation cycle going on between the U.S navy and the the L A navy good evening to garden\nOr good evening on it that is and yes I Do think that there's been an increase in the temple\nAnd of course this comes at a time where they're all sorts of questions about the U.S China relationship in general\nWe're seeing a deterioration in a number of different areas which is a good thing John because the United states now is not socialist at a survey Chang says like telling them we're not afraid of them any more that we're just going to do what we want to do\nAnd we're not going to take into account their concerns are that is a change for decades of policy which unfortunately but for decades hasn't worked\nThe Decatur incident that was the near collisions the challenge by the Chinese commander which you have described as directed by Xi Jinping himself\nIn this incident with the Curtis Wilbur and the anti them we're told the Chinese shadow them and the Taiwan Strait does that mean that the Chinese backed off or is the Taiwan Strait significantly different in their minds from the ...\nWell I think that it certainly and in China's mind the Taiwan Strait is different because they really do view it as close to home because they believe that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic\nThey don't really view the Taiwan Strait as international water ... they don't even think the south China Sea of international water but the south China Sea and the ... are a lot farther from home where China and Taiwan and Taiwan Strait so\nWhat is different um you know they were just shadowing the two warships um they they don't I think we're going to really I don't think that we're going to really try anything so they normally shadow freedom of navigation operations when they did so this time\nThat he's a garden what has been the response of other nations in the area to this type of escalation well\nThat if this is a really important question for us because it's not just the United states you know we're seeing Britain and France and we're seeing Australia also chip in to these uh operations in coastal waters\nAnd that's important so they're trying to understand that it is irritating not just Washington but everybody so they can understand that a coalition is forming against them but certainly they can't stand up to the coalition that's a really good story that is being given to the Chinese not just by us but by a lot of other countries as well\nPuzzle then garden a watching this escalation if we if it is or this a tit for tat was going on where's it going what what's an endgame here are clearly both navies are have lots of resources\nYou know there's a lot of resources here and and we could see more freedom of navigation operations more transit through the international straits I think the game is essentially we are going to see either a formal or a de facto agreement to protect Taiwan again\nChinese attack you know we have 'em all sorts of things we've got three communiques which are we we got six assurances\nFrom the Reagan Administration which were better at the Taiwan Relations Act of Nineteen Seventy nine um but this is actually moving to a point where there's going to essentially be an alliance between Taipei in Washington that's\nThat's important for us to do to tell the Chinese look you know you can say whatever whatever you want but you cannot cross the line because the U.S navy air force\nUm the army we're all going to be there and we are going to defend Taiwan\nThan it sends a very important message again to the other nations in the area doesn't among us resolve and our willingness to help an ally\nOf oh for sure for sure you know we've allowed the military\nBalance of power across the straight to actually a road in China's favor and that's something that we said that we wouldn't do but over the course of decades we've allowed that\nMuch more robust response that we're seeing in the Trump Administration is important because it I think it helps keep the peace\nWe have been far too ambiguous about our commitments Taiwan I'd like to see the Trump Administration make it very clear I'd like to see the president actually go to Taiwan and send that symbolic message to Beijing that we are friends and allies with Taiwan and we will never let it go\nThe Russian and Chinese and us defense ministers have all been wandering around negotiating with each other talking with each other inviting each other back and forth is that going to continue regardless of this these incidents and the Taiwan Strait or the south China Sea I'm I'm puzzling about\nHow these defense ministers and our secretary of defense\nThing called the demonstrations by the navy card\nI think that there'll be some huffing and puffing on the part of ... at first because they won't let this go\nBut uh you know within a month or two maybe several months and things will be back to normal\nThe reason is when the United states shows strain the Chinese back off um and so there's going to be a little bit less huffing and puffing than you'd think you know so far China's been quiet about this transit I'm waiting in the next several hours to see what ... says\nAnd we'll get a really good ... of where they're going because if we get a relatively mild statement that means things will settle down if they actually are belligerent um you know I trust that the Trump Administration will meet word for word and that's something that we need to do right now to show Beijing that we do have the resolve\nSaturday Gordon is ending on the wording that communication as you mentioned but we're all skim the Chinese regime attack the United states has interests you know tit for tat ... he and the streets or anywhere else\nStudies McCotter my co host W. H. A. R. court in ... by co hosts the Daily Beast and we're joined by ... riding most recently at\nThe Dallas News about the peninsula Korea cut at Twenty one months ago President Obama had it a failure to President Trump how how do you measure Twenty one months later President Trump's handling of the failure good evening to\nGood evening John Twenty one months later it is at least we're we've shifted a few of the horrendous constraints that applied or are we out of the mud out of the ... is an influx safe\nUm no we don't know where it's going but some things are being re aligned and given that it was a complete disaster Twenty one months ago or there's some chance of seeing perhaps a way to maneuver out of this garden\nQuota I think that you're right that ah we're there is a possibility of a good solution but there's also the possibility of one of the greatest tobacco's in American foreign policy because you have President Trump allowing much in the south Korean president who's very pro North Korea\nTo do a number of things which are undermining not only American efforts to to nuclear as North Korea but also issues too he's undermining democracy and actually paving the way for North Korea to take over the south I'm not saying that's going to happen but there's a real possibility of that occurred\nHow do you measure inter Korean diplomacy right now in an age of Trump\nIt's a disaster on the other hand I don't know that I chalk that up to Trump\nI'm at the problem is that Moon Jae in was democratically elected by South Korea which has raised a generation that really doesn't pay a lot of attention to the serious problems\nOr from the north to the real real threat I mean look the south Korea has set up amusement park years ago along the demilitarized zone not really a wise idea\nOkay and how you're absolutely right that inter Korean diplomacy is incredibly worrying South Korea has a president who seems to be trying to hand over the Democratic thriving south to the north\nThe problem being apart from the humanitarian disaster that that would be a it would be a very bad thing for Kim Jong tuned to get his hands on the enormous treasure trove that South Korea all that technology and the loot and\nPeople are but as far as how the U.S is able to maneuver given that we can't really they're probably limits to what we can dictate to the south Korean president um I think there's been says a lot going on that's very hard to read you know what does it mean when president can\nMeet a president can ride when President Trump meets Kim Jong un and they their bag so backslapping glad handing in Singapore and then President Trump comes out and says I you know we fell in love he wrote me beautiful letters\nI take that actually is a form of president of President Trump's humor which the presses inclined to take a little bit to literally but are there are a lot of things going on that are alarming and some of them are pretty strange but if you look at the bigger picture\nAh the things that America is able to do something about beyond the peninsula\nA there is motion and that includes a lot more pressure on China that includes pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal which means Iran is no longer swimming in the ready cash that it almost certainly was going to be spending on North Korean military where's\nUm there's greater pressure as far as stronger sanctions I'd never thought that sanctions could actually\nThe north Korean nuclear program but they at least they are cutting off some of the Kim's resources and over and over the ...\nSo and and I don't think we really have the answer about the question is what's the endgame here\nAnd that what I was writing the argument that I've been putting forward for a long time is there's no solution to the threat from North Korea that does not that unless there is an end to the regime we're not going to negotiate something so the question is\nWith all these chess pieces moving where is this going and at least we're sort of we pulled out of the the death trajectory that was going on under President Obama the strategic patience that was a blitz of North Korean missile and nuclear tests and threats\nUm and that might the question I was trying to raise is simply is there anything here that might be leading toward the end of the collapse of the north Korean regime an end to that regime without the U.S having to actually go to war\nThaddeus has recorded as you as you mentioned your piece\nMain may know the regime in Pyongyang understands what happened to your doctor you don't play that on their media to remind you sure do yeah they they know that the endgame his for them to go on the skin of history mirrors aware of that as we are correct correct\nAbsolutely and I you know Kim wants to stay in power he's part of a regime that has been remarkably adept at this North Korea has been officially in existence for Seventy years now three generations of a total of ... state than most repressive on the planet and\nUh but once again the question is where does this go and\nA decade or what do we do about it the problem is they're becoming ever more dangerous\nAnd uh did decades at this point of diplomatic deals have failed I Would put no trust at all in the idea that Kim as simply going to say Oh yes I've been offered a wonderful bright future by the Trump Administration if I just completely denuclearize\nI don't think that my puppy secretary of state ... believes that's where it's going to go I don't think that's where John Bolton believes that's going to go if you look\nThis period of Trump's sort of over the top diplomacy began just about the time that he brought in a tune into the current positions secretary of state Pompeo and secure national security adviser John Bolton to men who are specifically are on record\nSaying you're not going to get a successful deal with this regime the ... the problem is the regime you know you can't cut a deal that you can verify that the basic problem\nGarden we have less than a minute you have another question\nYour great piece you talk about the video that President Trump gave him the June twelfth from it about the greater future and I thought your comments about the video word for it and in terms of where this was all going and I agree with you regime change is the answer\nThirty seconds yeah and the question is is that the goal it's what it needs to be and what gardens referring to is in the happy video about the bright future in the middle of that came a scene of\nThe three aircraft

twenty five to thirty seats but there is now much there is now less of a chance that they will get there and so I see more of a chance of Republicans hanging on with a very narrow majority then before cattle\nAnd the forty seven percent for President Trump is that a surprise to the Democrat\nWell I look I I think we've seen these things go back and forth I I think that probably privately there there might be a little bit surprised\nI'm a little bit surprised but not necessarily because you know for about three weeks there\nYou have the Democrats making a spectacle of themselves almost the way they accuse Trump of making expect with themselves and their right he often make suspect himself Trump for several weeks had little to say on Twitter\nOnly last week that he sort of getting back to being himself which was the biggest break the Democrats have caught in a while so it'll be interesting to see where Trump's approval or falling a later this week and next week or what they that's why they themselves know favor because all of a sudden they became that\nWhich they said they were running to stop\nThaddeus a gentleman wanted to be\nMessaging messages as the Democrats are running on collectively I think is about health care especially preexisting conditions have the has the peas crop of candidates come up with any counter messaging on that if president\nJohn a milk\nOut David go first go ahead\nI'm Sorry about that look I Will just say this is really interesting to me because we thought Democrats lose a thousand seats are basically over to mid term elections because in part because of the unpopularity of Obamacare and all of a sudden with President Obama out of office and Republicans in a position to actually do something about healthcare\nThey're now on the defensive and Democrats have done a really good job of putting them on the defensive\nOn these two tenets of Obamacare which are free ... lifetime caps\nAnd some Republicans that I interviewed on the trail uh really straight about it close federal mandates to protect preexisting conditions lifetime caps they they do this through other means but they don't want the government\nTo protect it on the other is just kinda fumble over their word and finally got around telling me well yeah I I Believe that needs to parts of Obamacare So I think you you you ... your hand of the Democrats here and that they got the better part of this issue John\nI was kind of meeting today we're Nancy Pelosi was speaking and she said this election was about health care\nAnd they ... the strongest suit fill the last thing they want it to be about the economy which is doing well it was the last thing they want it to be is about a national security\nAnd the last thing they want it to be is about the tax cuts although they still will make arguments about benefiting the rich the Democrats are running a micro decentralized campaign around the country largely successful in many districts but\nIn the districts where the Republicans are most in trouble I see Republican after Republican incumbent doing what David says but just roll over and agree with the Democratic so while the Democrats have a good issue where they need to gain seats the Republicans are agreeing with them\nWe have a GDP number estimates for the third quarter coming next week David I start with you that that promises to be in the neighborhood and I'm quoting Steve more here in the ... which is that the Laffer curve Steve more in the neighborhood of ... percent is that already built in to the argument or is that going to boost things that\nI think it's built into the argument in fact I think it's really a better argument for President Trump twenty twenty than it is for Republican twenty Eighteen\n... and look by All right with the economy like this Republican should be in a much better position and the only reason they're looking slightly better than they were and it's only slightly because the Democrats formal the ball with Brett Kavanaugh I think that that the problem for Republicans with a tax overhaul\nIs that you look at the polling are on it and on balance people disapprove of it it may not make any sense but they did a horrible job selling it and you have some\nKey districts where the elimination of the state and local tax deduction solves is still a problem and so I just think that is good is this you know might have been for the economy and and I'm not arguing that in fact\nVoters have not connected the dots I think that it's the kind of ... that that they can connect in a twenty twenty

to revoke parts of the peace treaty with Israel Malcolm I don't know how to interpret this what is driving us spoken most warmly of King Abdullah the second these many years more than a decade now what is this\n[noise] this is very disturbing and a good evening to both of you it is um it's a story still in the making and it caught or people in Israel I think in Jordan as well as in the United states by surprise\nIn Nineteen Ninety five when they signed the peace treaty between Jordan and to Israel and I was privileged to go there with President Clinton at the time to the Arab up to the desert to witness the signing was very emotional very celebratory\nHim one of the clauses in this ... agreement dealt with two pieces of property one in the north called Kara or in Hebrew not Ryan and one is in the south about a hundred and thirty kilometers north of um\n[noise] a lot and you're\nA ... a that was called so far in Hebrew a hammer in a in Jordan\nA this was these were Lance uh they have somewhat of a different status or each from the other one the one of the south was um it rather than the north\nWas an area that had a had a um hydroelectric plant built in the Nineteen twenties by Jewish farmer Jewish businessman who bought much of the land\nAnd when the agreement was signed um Israel and Jordan the spirit of friendship agreed that farmers from Israel could continue to plow the land and produced on it but the sovereignty would return to\nJordan and in the middle of it is this island the peace where the hydroelectric plant than a which had been dedicated by the king\nAnd there's also a memorial nearby to seven young girls from an Israeli school who were mowed down by Jordanian soldier that six more were wounded and if you remember the lake king was saying paid a visit to the families\nIn a very moving a and a sign of humility asking them for forgiveness\nThe second place in the southern place so far\nUh is is a bit larger and there again the farmers who are dependent upon this for their income or about fifty farming families ah would lose a two hundred and fifty acres or so uh but it will be very important for them and the green but that was signed said\nThat it was to last for twenty five years but one year before and that one year anniversary is this week either side could get noticed that they want to re examine or talk about ... or the agreement\nJordan exercise that and notified Israel it seems\nOnly with the public announcement made in Jordan or that they did not intend to renew the agreement when it ends a year from now ah and the agreement says that either side making that announcement would then engage in negotiations in Jordan is saying now they won't engage in\nAny kind of negotiations it's not clear whether\nKing of the other was upset because she was left out of the ... the Jerusalem negotiations that other recent events and may have prompted it but most of all the domestic demand and this is being celebrated in Jordan and he had received a a petition on many issues but the only one affecting us\nA related to this agreement asking that it not be renewed\nSo I guess we'll learn more but the you know this is a very valuable to the terms of the the Israeli farmers and family it's been very peaceful they've cooperated a manager Danny it's work there and I think it's a very regretful that has moved in this direction\nThat is somewhat max smell come out and how does this parent breach become a healed [noise]\nThat's a very good question and I don't have a good answer because if the if you're a dancer simply saying we're not going to negotiate\nA it could be grandstanding could be you know a a chance for the king to show its constituency that's being tough\nAnd then during the course of the year they work out some sort of an understanding or right now I don't know what the shape of that could be there are a lot of possibilities because there's heavy investment by the Israeli farmers there there's a lot of money that they put into this over the last Twenty years\nAnd at the um important as the symbolic importance as well as the economic importance are not gonna sit well with the Israeli people it's certainly not going to help the atmosphere and as you know Israel is very critical to the security of Jordan and Jordan's security is critical to Israel they've said so many times and they have\nExercise it in many more ways than than it's made public so\nYou know the stakes are high but I think that the two sides can find some sort of a compromise that would enable the the agreement to

J. are the great for the great lakes and always\nHappy to be joined by our colleague Andrew McCarthy and especially on Rod Rosenstein wait there is new that Rod Rosenstein will appear under oath\nTo members of the Congress in the next days and what he will say is significant because he's in charge of Russia gate he's the boss mother's not even really a real attorney he works for a mother\nA well he works for roses Tate Miller only does what Rosa St wants him to do and so in talking to rather than saying we're actually talking to the thing itself and you have very good evening to you I Want to concentrate on this because we've been dealing with Rod Rosenstein is if he was a wallflower\nOr just without a backbone or a man who can't find your shoes in fact he's the boss and having gone through the facts of may twenty Seventeen\nWhen in a matter of nine or ten days he changed his life by panicking\nAnd spinning around in a room I figure he was like being a ... a victim of extra system\nSince ... may have twenty Seventeen he's become more and more the story so let's begin with the Rosen steam power\nRod Rosenstein gene directs Miller Miller is going to a report to Rod Rosenstein maybe we don't have to see any of this maybe only the indictments wherever whatever we'll see I learn from you but\nYou noted in your conversation with rich Lowry on your excellent podcast I recommend to everybody at National Review online\nThat there was a Bloomberg report last week\nThat ... getting to wrap it up does that mean Rosen's gene can direct Muller finished this get it done report to me what does it mean wrap it up good evening to Andy\nGood evening John well it's always been true that Rosenstein could\nExercise authority over\nMahler because he uh in the pecking order he is not only the the official who named Mueller as special counsel is the he's the deputy attorney general he's also the official in the chain of command that Mahler answers to the reason we thought of him\nJohn as a wallflower\nIs really more out of Mr Rosenstein his own mouth than anything else as soon as he appointed\nMueller that very day he had a meeting with a top Democrats on Capitol Hill in which he promised them that there would be no interference in bowlers investigation that he would be permitted\nA basically to do whatever he shows in terms of ah you know chasing facts down to wherever they lead and he was given this wide mandate to investigate without\nThe predicate of a a a normal criminal\nInvestigation so he has given mall are a very wide berth or the latest reports indicate that uh he being\nUnder pressure I Believe from uh the White House that is a Rosenstein being under pressure from the White House or because of a number of\nNot least of the fact the revelations that Rosen seen a ... ... at one point or talked about invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment against President Trump talked about secretly recording President Trump and the White House clearly as a a a ... as kind of a a\nBallast for twenty Fifth Amendment claim that the that the president might not be a mentally up to the job um\nThat obviously is not to look to plot a with great fondness by the White House so I think they have blamed on a road and so it started to get this over with and Rosenstein the reporting it Blumberg indicates a has in turn\nLeaned on Mahler meanwhile it has looked like mall are\nHas been has been at least ostensibly doing things that would be consistent with winding down an investigation ... such as staffing down or transferring some of the investigations the indictments that he's brought to other components of the Justice Department so it looks like we could be wanting\nTo an end but I'm not holding my breath quite yet\nThat is what are the possibility that may have for further shall we say X or a sugar part of the special counsel\n[noise] well I think a fatty is that while Mahler has stepped down as I have often pointed out uh I did a big terrorism case in the Nineteen nineties with a grand total of three lawyers me and a two other guys Mahler still even with the down staffing\nA has a I think fourteen Thirteen or fourteen lawyers on staff which is a very large staff and they're obviously continuing to work different investigative the angles they are still negotiating as we understand that over the terms\nOf a President Trump's\nSit down interview by the special counsel including whether that interview Wil happen at all and if it doesn't happen whether\nA Mahler would take the step of issuing a subpoena which would be very controversial and would lead to a lot of litigation we hear that there were also pursuing a some other angles involving potentially contacts between a wiki lakes\nRoger Stone who was a a a a friend and associate of the president's but not somebody who formerly had a role in the president's campaign so there were still odds and ends there that are clearly being looked at\nYour told rich Lowry that Muller is not Bob Woodward thank heaven however what I take from that remark is that we're not going to get a narrative that satisfies a TV\nWhat we're going to get is either no indictment or indictments we've had some indictments of Russians chiefly and also Manafort for actions that took place before the campaign\nYou believe it's significant however that the sentencing for Michael Flynn has to come on December Eighteen explain why that tells us that Mueller is going to be disappointing\nYeah let's let's I guess we should sort out two separate things John I think with respect to General Flynn when he pled guilty it was with the understanding that he was going to cooperate with\nThe investigation and so far as we know he has made himself available for interviews questioning and all like um [noise] generally speaking\nProsecutors when they have an ability to influence when a sentencing is scheduled do not allow cooperate or to be sentenced by the court until after their cooperation is concluded which usually means any testimony that they're going to give are expected to given the investigation\nOr because you want the full breath of the person's cooperation to be before the sentencing court so I think the fact that General Flynn is now scheduled to be sentenced and apparently the sentencing is going to go forward on December right team indicates that Mahler doesn't think he's going to require him for any in court\nTestimony that's not a sure sign of that but it's a pretty good sign\nAny when a department of justice figure comes out and talks to the press it tells me they want something what's the one with this is this is this promoting himself as a politician is is to make Hollywood interest how how does this work for it\n[noise] well I think John ... and what I'm fearful of\nIs that what we're seeing is the outlines of how this ah whole episode is going to be brought to an end and I think that what you're what you're starting to see\nOur the outlines of a a kind of accommodate a deal in which there were probably no charges or impeachable offenses sided against a President Trump in the mall or investigation and at the same time\nOr what ends up getting soft pedaled is the a Justice Department and FBI's investigative tactics in connection with the Trump campaign in the run up to the twenty sixteen election and the first months of the Trump Administration\nUh I I think that this is the way that this is teeing up and it's interesting that Rosenstein would be the guy who is going to have this conversation with a very select group as you say\nAre not the full committee but very select a group of ah of high ranking members of Congress who've been looking at this\nUh I I think that's where we're headed and Rosenstein is the guy who can you speak to both ends of the investigation both the investigation of the Trump campaign and the more investigation\nThat is [noise] well it would be unfortunate in it because we've seen evidence on the side of people using their power are investigating the Trump campaign\nAnd trying to sabotage the trucks transition but we've not seen any evidence or Russian collusion by the Trump campaign or by the president himself Rosenstein does not\nHave a rare her large stake in that outcome because of some of the things he did criticizing the eyes of war\nYeah I said I think so you know and I think what they'll end up saying that he is is that while the president's ah himself did not take any a suspicious actions and a ... you know while he hasn't done anything a criminal or actionable\nOr he did bring into his campaign these people who had significant connections to Kremlin tied\nPeople and I think that's the way veil of pictured which gave the Justice Department the FBI or a good rationale to be suspicious and to take investigative action I'm not saying I agree with this\nJust I've been I've been thinking for a long while a that this is the way that we're headed and I just think it's very very curious to me two things number one that President Trump first announced and then did a one eighty on whether he was going to\nAuthorize the public disclosure of a documents that he's congressional committees have been pressing for so he was going to give them you're going to give us we were going to be able to see what was in those documents Congress is going to be able to see it and then suddenly he changes\nI Know about that a ... ... and you combine that with by this John pointed out the sudden appearance of um of of Rosenstein publicly\nUh the justification sees a now publicly offering\nUp for the investigation and I see maybe this is just my ah being a cynic maybe this is my old prosecutor antennae the ... and paying 'em could be any number of things I suppose but I see the outlines of a potential deal here\nThe deal with Rosenstein Andy Rosenstein ... author the Mueller investigation he's written those two letters first letter in the second letter August he has a lot of explaining\nTo do if he's to stay on and the Trump Administration after the elections a lot of explaining because the party the Republican Party sees this as a politicized damage the whole thing as electioneering\nThe whole thing as a narrative to satisfy the Clintons in December of twenty sixteen and then to drive fund raising and programming for MSNBC and CNN for Eighteen months now ... responsible for all that he signed the forest fire someone\nHe has no future in the Trump Administration so with Rosie out of there do we get to ... when we get to see all those documents ... to my reading he's the only thing blocking us right now\nWe when we get to see all those documents were going to have a lot more to say than she fell as we were wrong\nI don't know John I I Wish that I thought that was necessarily true but you know I don't see Rosenstein is the only stumbling\nBlock here there's never been a moment than we observe this several times in the last couple of years are discussing this and analyzing it there's never been a moment when president and President Trump hasn't had the authority to disclose all of this information and yet he hasn't\nUm I'm not sure\nThat Rosenstein doesn't have a future in the administration you wouldn't think so but uh you know the president speaks well of him he speaks well of the president when he's a when he's speaking publicly the Republicans even if things go well on election night\nAre going to have a very thin margin at best a in the Senate so it won't be the easiest thing to replace Rosenstein or if he's fired\nAnd I just don't think I'm correct that the Republicans are unified\nIn in believing that the investigation of the Trump campaign or was politicized I think that there's a lot of feeling particularly in the Senate we heard a lot of it in the Senate intelligence committee\nOr that there were very good reasons to proceed with this investigation and there'd been a number of prominent Republicans including Marco Rubio\nI'm ... and and ah Trey Gowdy to to name to a who seem to be very sympathetic\nTo the FBI surveillance of Carter Page so I'm not sure it's a it's a unified Republican front on this\nAnd that's another reason why I think we could be just seeing the beginning of the end where it turns out that there's no charges fraud or any actionable information brought against the against President Trump that they decide that the um even if there was some excessive\nUm the tactics used in the investigation that that all in all was on the up and up and everybody um walks away a kind of reminds me if I May of the of the nine eleven commission which you know started out as a a a kind of a partisan ball and then at a certain point\nUm when everybody kind of realized that both the Clinton and the Bush administration could be harmed by this\nAre suddenly there was a a piece in our time\nThere was a report that was issued that didn't blame either the Clinton Administration or the Bush administration for nine eleven they hung the uh you know the FBI and the CIA out to dry but the you know the politicians pretty much emerged unscathed and everybody loved to fight another day\nAndrew

of the train stations because he was transporting hunting rifles at the time\nAnd at the time um you know they weren't illegal the hunting rifles but um but he was stopped and by the time he got to his home town of all of us are\nThe police said surrounded the station and um and arrested him\nAnd um and so from then it really sets the tone and right before that it happened there was a um\nJust kind of a procession to celebrate the arm the anniversary of the army awful bad had just happened and it was a big moment for the Armenians and and at church or soldier was killed during the demonstration and it's\nA long story um what happened but tensions are really um rife in this town between the maintenance and the Turks\nAnd um my grandfather was you know eventually he was he was convicted and served for about two months\nAnd he went into the central prison and he's in with a Armenians or they're Christians are there but dominant Lee Muslims the ... of the supervisor of the central prison is as say just name it brought home the bay and they're all frightened of him for torture\nBy your grandfather has a what I call a sunny disposition I'll get out of this things are well I'm with other Armenians the priest comes on Sunday I look forward to it nearly stir I'll get out of this that along comes history it happens often at all the time dawn and your story that's why your grandfather\nHe's such a time machine for me it's a journey through the twentieth century and this is a fresh take the first war\nBecause in the summer of Nineteen fourteen we know there's going to be a catastrophe called the first war\nHowever the Turks anticipating this interests that bedding everything ... grandfather and others to be in a position to be ... scripted did he want to be a Turkish soldier Nineteen fourteen\nI don't think that he necessarily looked forward to you know serve in the military but actually for Armenians to serve in the military was was a recent right for them um they weren't able to do that in the years um up until um right before the war and so\nUm he so he joined um you know the Turkish Army and he ... he ended up being in a I'm a labor battalion right and doing road construction and so he was separated from his family\nAnd um that's how much of it went as you know the war um you know more people Joe more countries joined the ward and grew larger and larger and uh my and then in Nineteen Fifteen um the Ottoman government deported a majority of the two million Armenians from their homes\nAnd um that included his family and his community and his town and so he was separated\nFrom them you have let's go to that decision because it's important we are talking about the Armenian Genocide but what generates the conditions that ... the depravity\nIs the general deterioration of civilization in Europe and in Asia Minor because you will recall that turkey at this time didn't exist it was the Ottoman Empire the German government the Kaiser's government had made inroads for the previous decades\nWith the Ottoman Empire and we're building railroads and there were lots of German engineers all over Constantinople so when the war came along it looks like the Ottoman Empire was allied with Germany nothing much what's happening until of course the Russians attack from the north\nThe Russians were in league with the French and the and the British or not we're not making this up this is genuine World War one history\nThe British would eventually attack by coming around at the ... campaign would attack Ottoman Empire\nSo in the blonde port which is the government in Constantinople they've felt attacked from both sides and age that dawn of the way I read it that that generates the conditions that I'll leave the decision makers in Istanbul\nCrazy enough to believe that by punishing the Armenian somehow there were leaving or blames ... are shifting the blame on to the real fault of the army faltering in the north and the British attacking from the south\nDid the Armenian talk about the war did they talk about the conditions that left a of the Armenians exposed do they talk about how this could not have happened without the the first world war\nI I mean I I don't I think that you know you look at different genocides over his history a lot of times it takes place during upheaval in a country rider during war you know you look at the Holocaust and what happened you know what happened\nKansas backdrop of World War two and I think the same thing with the army's there was so much happening in the world and there was so much strife like it's so many countries are involved and losing some losing so many men\nAnd um that it was easy\nFor the Armenians to disappear it was easy\nI mean of course we remember but it was\nEasy under the cover of war to deport the Armenians and and and drive them to their death\nLet's go to the moment that you know she was a is looked upon every year it's important to remember all April twenty fourth Nineteen fifty\nThat is the date that is remembered because the rest of the Armenian dignitaries the leading scholars and brains and a diplomat of Armenia in Istanbul and what followed from there was persecution waves raft the usual\nAh depravity where ... what what did your grandfather and what most importantly what it ought to Bob's are may when they heard about the arrest in his stumbled or ... ... excuse me did they know\nThat this was the beginning of an end or did they think it was just going to pass over them because those were VIPs and they were hardworking village people\nWell they were there were rumors that I'm never rumors that things were going to happen I'm\nI'm I was actually I right after that um roundup of intellectuals but the same thing happened in my grandfather's town which is what I really tried to focus on my grandfather's story and his town as just a lens into the larger story so soon after what happened in in ... with a roundup of intellectuals\nAnd politicians and and basically their leaders\nI'm the same thing happened in in their town where the wealthy and influential influential um individuals they were rounded up and deported and um\nAnd so that you you see it just throughout my grandfather story the story of his town with\nEar meaning experience in their town it's just they you know something happens but they still can't imagine\nThat it would get worse or you know just same with with the ... when the deportation order finally happened you know so many of them\nThought that they wouldn't be able to return home they thought that they would they were just leaving breathe you know just for a period of time and and would come back I'm never imagining the condition that so many of them would face or

I think that is an important point because it illustrates that the quality of even supposedly elite Jim and traits\nIs now really on the way\nRight the numbers don't tell you so we'll go into the specifics but the Seventeen second Eighteenth and ninth army German armies between a by early September had lost one hundred thousand men since since the army on offensive\nIn a in August so the fall away here it's all casualties killed wounded and a captured all casualties are piling up\nBut why there is a ... there's a moment that captures all of it the Germans are reading potatoes they're digging out of the ground but they're green potatoes what does that tell us what do you mean by that fact neck\n[noise] well obviously the gym and people have been on to a royal naval blockade since Nineteen fourteen and which means I'm sure they call an import anything I say I'm\nFood is running out food isn't stream Lee are scarce on their own front it has been has been for quite bad since at least the winter is sixteen Seventeen so cold tenet winter um unless of course producers weakness it produces a debilitating effects on\nUm the gym and population and even the army which has shielded from that and she's given the supplies that\nThat are available on\nBut this really produces a gradual weakening and what we see in the summer is that um because a lot of troops all week at a time and they don't have the nutrition calories they need and more vulnerable to disease and things like Spanish influenza time down there right which is actually in the sun that is absolutely devastating to the gym a nominee\nRight there are two versions I learn from you there's a flu you recover from and then there's the killer fluid that will come later in the fall is the recovery flew at this point is it sweeping through the ranks\nIt is it's whipping through the ranks and DWI armies um ... the British soldiers and I'm from the French selling Americans are um they they have more calories the supplies and rats and they are able to have food they they need\n'em in some ways the the ... um stocks quite ... certainly can pass in the gym and I'm so\nClearly not everyone is dying in the summer but they the flu weakens already weakened troops um and it means they take weeks if not months to really get back to full fitness if it's all\nUm and so just last sections of the gym and all you may have recovered from the flu but they are in really no position to um to continue to maintain peak physical physical effectiveness joined you'll some and then into the winter of Ninety Nineteen", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The John Batchelor Show", "city": "Providence", "day": "23"}
