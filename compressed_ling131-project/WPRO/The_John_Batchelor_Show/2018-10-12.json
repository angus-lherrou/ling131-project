Sunday Morning local time about eight thirty in the morning and early ...\nClass that the best we have destroyer in the south China Sea of freedom of navigation a mission or the Decatur was shadowed by a Chinese warship that came we're told from the U.S Navy's report within forty five yards of the bowels of the U.S has Decatur\nGotten Jerry Hendricks United States navy retired aviator\nAs a now it's a tell them a group however I call upon his knowledge and also writing regularly at the national Review Online about navy capabilities to comment on this issue generally have very good evening to you of the report from the U.S Naval Institute is that this is not business as usual\nAnd that the Chinese commander made a decision that was reckless in the extreme\nOr to take his missile cruiser and use it as a either a threatening ramming boat like the\nLike the Iranians do in the Gulf or as a man who's lost control of his of his sense of face a kind of lose the bubble you've taught me in the past is there any way that incident could have been a miscommunication on the bridge the Chinese ship or an accident good evening to you\nCould even John no there there are no accidents when you're a maneuvering\nNine thousand five hundred tons of destroyers a up alongside a eight thousand tons destroyers or I should say rather see vice versa the Chinese Lou yang destroyer a came up in an overtaking a maneuver where it was behind the USS Decatur and early ... class destroyer which was conducting a\nFree known them that we're trying to see sailing past us some of these miss claimed artificial islands or to\nDemonstrate that the United states is not recognize them as is Chinese territory and the this Lou yang a destroyer came from behind passed down the laughter porch side of the Decatur and then closed\nAs it was passing the the caters bow close to where it was within forty five yards of the bow of\nThe destroyer the American destroyer this is a very unsafe condition or this is not something that the Chinese commanding officer did by accident he has an entire crew there with him uh he also has a political commerce are on board this was an act of Chinese foreign and military policy an\nAct of intimidation against the United states and in seems to indicate that the Chinese\nAre become increasingly desperate and some of their activities in the south China Sea uh I think some of the economic tensions are from the sanctions and the tariffs are beginning to wear on them and they're they're running out of chips to use on the table and so they've escalated at sea\nIf there is a detail that the secretary of defense Mattis was scheduled to travel to China and either the schedule that the trip was been changed her called off the Chinese called it off can we connect that fact with is a threat in the south China Sea\nWell ... the the cancellations there's been a series of of a tit for tat escalation between the Chinese and the Americans the Chinese it sent a very senior or is simply equivalent of a three star admiral over to visit\nAnd he departed early as an act of protest and I believe that uh in response to that response of some other statements by the Chinese defense minister\nSecretary of defense Mattis then canceled his trip to China which have been a long planned and so you're really seeing the the slow shut down a one on one relations between the United states a defense establishment and the Chinese defense establishment\nThings are ratcheting up it's becoming much more tense and we're seeing it play out both at the geostrategic level as well as here on the ship on ship level\nUm and I think it's important to understand this is not\nLike the ... the three incident from two thousand one where a single Chinese pilot came out flew aggressive maneuvers around one of our large a multi engine a reconnaissance aircraft and then collided enforce that airplane to essentially crash land on on on a high non island this was a full ship\nSo you cannot write this office simply the action of one bad actor and the Chinese military this is a move by the Chinese military and hence the Chinese government against the United states\nIs this Cold War activity is this what we faced with the Russian Navy in the north Atlantic and the Pacific\nYes it is so it's it's as I uh I put out on Twitter last night this isn't the first time the U.S has been to this rodeo in Nineteen eighty eight a in a very famous incident\nA Chinese or Russian a Soviet Union a ship a cruiser at that time came out and actually cites wiped 'em where we made a a actual connection between the United states a destroyer the region the U.S as Karen\n... class destroyer\nAnd one of the Russian warships in the black sea uh there were other ships there that the u._s. was doing a freedom of navigation patrol there\nAll the Russians tried to actually come alongside and actually move the American ship out of the way and the American ship did not altered course in fact stood on as we like to say maintain its course um until the Russians broke off but we actually had physical damage between that\nSo the U.S navy has experienced in this that wasn't the only incident during the Cold War we had a number of those uh but it looks like the U.S and Chinese a relationship\nIs beginning to get to that area of tension and what's important to understand is that incident in Nineteen eighty eight happened very near the end of the Soviet Union\nWhen they were feeling a lot of tension from the United states and again I think that what we saw here and just the last Seventy two hours in the south China Sea may demonstrate to the Chinese\nAre feeling a lot of tension\nBoth from the military standpoint but also an economic standpoint after all the tariff war is not going in their favor right now\nYou have a piece of the national view on line right now anticipating what the army the navy and the air force need for the future I Want to shape that to\nChina and the and the western Pacific East Asia do we have the fleet to his capable of responding to these reckless incidents by the Chinese would have been better for example we've talked in the past if we'd had a ... class to run the freedom of navigation act and not put in our biggest battleships\nWealth John I wrote this this essay at National Review online which appeared yesterday in response to a series of opinion pieces that have come out recently that was arguing that we were we were doing wrong by making investments in increased capacity meaning growing the size of the Army Navy air force in the navy\nAnd in fact these uh these other voices were arguing that the money would be better spent in in investing in increased capabilities more high technology\nAnd my argument was that was strong civilian leadership we can do both and in fact we must\nSo the U.S military has a broader strategy of both attempting to preserve the peace that currently exists which requires that we have capacity to have presidents and all the areas where we have interest while also increasing capabilities are so that we have a war winning capabilities when we need them\nI learned from the people who are in your program who leave you videos or who agreed to be talked to was there ... dieting that this also allows them to go off some major league medications I mean what we're talking big time\nFarm here that they are delighted to mention I low longer take my blood pressure I no longer take my try I no longer worry about my triglycerides what is it about weight loss that is that allows them to be free of medications\nWell the thing that you just mentioned they're all one to one related to obesity unfortunately the blood pressure medication the sugar medications for diabetes cholesterol medication pain medications I mean all these things are worse than by by obesity blood pressure and stuff and so\nThere's not a doctor on the planet that won't say that losing weight for an obese people will dramatically improve their health or we're just basically getting the getting them those results very very quickly\nVery very briefly I and that's why we see people often times when the first week uh minimizing or eliminating blood pressure medications diabetes medication these other types of medications and we see that all the time and and this is what's supposed to happen you're supposed to go get healthier\nAnd get off big league ... medications when you lose a lot of weight a\nBout eighty percent of all the Seventy eighty percent of all the uh health issues in this country have something to do are made worse by obesity in weight issues\nTo charming voices on your website this is Arthur who lost thirty pounds and forty days\nHe said he's not on medication now he's off his blood pressure and I think he'd been taking met her medicine for cancer so that he had a variety of of afflictions that he's feeling better about but Heathrow remark at the end that I like you said this is especially for people who don't like diet and always failed diets do hear that a lot Dr\nWe do here that we hear that people obviously is feeding a at a at a level they've never succeeded uh before\nUh but we hear people tell us all the time how easy it is and it's easy to follow I mean you're eating regular foods you're eating regular vegetables regular fruits regular proteins we do modified mixing of certain things together because of different hormonal disruptions we do a minimize fats oils that are coming in because of the body is\nBurning it's all fat for fuel that's really the key here so minimize that but it's actually there's nothing on the food that you can't pick up an any supermarket\nAnywhere in the world anywhere in the country really\nAlso Jerry and this sounded like a family a family tragedy here Jerry's lost forty pounds and forty days he said he's going from a forty two thirty six and he he was grinning fine and then he said it was a line that I I paid attention to\nNo surgery but my brother had surgery and he's in pain every day what's he referring to the doctor\nI think what you're talking about is ah the the brother had some sort of Gary ... surgery or some sort of stomach surgery ah and ah I from what I remember I don't believe that\nWent very well um and I think that's what led him to our program in which he did not want to go down that road he wanted to do this without any search you wanted to do it naturally a which is what our program as there is no surgery there's no hormones no shots\nFor all natural there's no tolerance stimulate the caffeine nothing like that and that's what's really at all natural way to go\nThe other thing I saw repeatedly and we've talked about this before is that uh there's a there's a confidence in the voice when they talk about this it's as if they don't believe it's themselves that they are they not only feel better about themselves they think it's a miracle\n[noise] yeah well I Love to what I Love about it is a what people are coming in and at first they are so skeptical that they're going to achieve the numbers are that we tell them they're going to achieve and then by their first or second visit there not even be seeing the numbers go they don't care about that now they're talking about health like why\nI can Rob what's my grandchildren I could spend all day working to do my job where I Would get exhausted [noise] uh I I have a\nTon of energy at night my relationship with my loved one is better my sex life has improved all these things we hear that it's like they moved away from the weight they now see it and they improve their activities of daily living a and that's what gives them the confidence in the in the happiness and really\nA choice of a choice to\nLive life again you know it's very difficult when when uh when when you were very overweight it's it's terrible\nI have information now that you are popular around the world the countries I wrote down where Israel Hong Kong India Russia Ukraine do by how does it work ... from far away do they come to Jersey or can you work with them\nNo we what we do it because so many people we we put a thousands of patients on the program and the tri state area and in this country but uh because people the weird or a family member a friend\nOn a visit somewhere they come here and they see this dramatic dramatic results in weight loss of improvement of health or do they want it for themselves to have a weight issue and and uh they've contacted us we do a phone complication with them we didn't mail them a kit\nFor they had a lot of the DNA testing or they can email their blood work a choice as well uh we go over everything with them we ship the products back to them\nAnd what's great is usually in another country they'll buy a body composition scale\nThat shows we really want to monitor to make sure people are losing fat not water and the way we do that is where the body composition scale\nOr they go on Amazon or whatever other companies online they buy a um a a body composition scale uh and they ... and they write down their numbers to wait their body fat\nBody water numbers on a daily basis and they email them to me every three to four days and I monitor personally ... remotely and we find that people do just as well or even better because they're getting monitored three or four times the amount\nThat somebody let's say coming in here they're coming in every you know nine ten Fifteen days somewhere in there a way we monitor people every three to four days because your shoes and email and people do fantastic what if they just do great\nAnd it doesn't they don't have to come to New York to do this they can just contact you through your website is that how they do it\nThat's correct they'll contact us through a website I can call the eight hundred number that's on the website\nOr we bought one of my staff reaches out to them or we set up a time for a couple of patient with me usually takes maybe twenty minutes or a half an hour I'd buy in the program what they're going to be doing and so forth and then and then we go from there you know he's under their paperwork any medical a questionnaire that they fill out a\nList of medications and so forth I basically the same way up it's basically the same way we do we can even do it on Skype with a

speak again to ...\nShe's the Friedman visiting fellow at the Washington Institute's good deals program on Arab politics\nI mean a very good and you and thank you for this I characterize Lebanon to me

little kid to a and thank you so definitely my pleasure [noise] uh I'm Sorry to say that no there is nothing ... a good coming out from that but on the country what we're going to be seeing you and and that went on as the worst situation\nAh we're looking for gay people are thinking that the formation of the government is finally going to happen at the end of this week or next week\nProbably everything from the book is going to change everything for Lebanon but the problem as now that has ... actually controls the institution when they won the election that made on the ... election they made sure\nThat not only they won the elections that their own and extreme too weak to have any leverage over any decision over the country so that they have a lot when one of the fundamental that are going to\nControl the government no matter what shape the government and the other night they only have two ... and peas in one hundred twenty eight\nOr ... and the parliament which is nothing but they have a bunch of and I do I go to do whatever it takes\nUh to to to to keep them on power that's how they're going to control nothing on the other end like basic and get out of functions like a day but they are cash economy meaning that it's not going to change much so\nAs long as that and lies are not a threatened or sanctions nothing was going to change of the government could one after that the very very bad economic economical situation in Lebanon we are on the verge of an economic collapse\nWhich is not going to be good for ... for government doesn't matter what governments we have as long as corruption just keeps them for government ... has controlled the\nI'm the only the only good thing I can face day and as long as Iran economy stumbling husband like financial situation has not looking as good as the court so there's an opportunity there\nSo we need to know when permission to to known it was in the ... the United nations you know expose the the says well the building a um a missile production site in Beirut\nWhat has been the reaction in the country what is the ... an oath to say is good couple of parts you can ... together\nAnd what is your reaction of the people in Lebanon who are the ones who pay the price for this I mean I Know that there's been resistance at times to ... below was building and the ... the what do you call them the missile rooms that are that ... ... ... how does that play out no\nUh I think exposing me from a size after he's a very good uh because the title of the Lebanese people that she did this yeah community minded that in factories and that hide out\nOf the of the sides and weapons are mostly based under a population\nYeah to me the population and this is good because these guys do not want any war anymore they cannot afford to have another war whether Israel or among themselves and why they can't they they've lost too much\nUm how long does that\nAnd they know that any a war also means that they have to the to lead read a lot of refugees knowing as you said that we have a lot of effort you that the country so they can't go anywhere they have to deal with them with them and reconstruction of Lebanon like the one that happened in two thousand and six is not going to guess\nIran cannot just send money back to the way it did and to have sex\nSo they don't want to uh the people do not on a husband who exposed to to put them in danger of the way it is but the thing is they know that people know that has a lot has been assessed besides end up in heaven under under the people's house\nThe question is not whether actually the ah the arm aside the question is that they know that the messiah factories where the weapons are being converted as an injury the red line\nAnd this is let's carrying the people is that nothing you know I did not come out and say have a lot of hiding the fact that we all know that everybody knows that any kind of it with that\nBut he came out and said something much more interesting and much more scary than these people is that these facilities to convert to weapons and they know that for Israel to sit there at night that's where they are actually bombing Syria and everybody scared that\nHas been the looting the sensitive the Trump give it up and on and what are they doing\nI think more exposure and more accurate exposure and not by not only by Israel by the international community and general including the media would work would go a long way in terms of getting the people I'm actually ask them questions and ask them has a plot to remove these weapons or at least\nControl what three the under their houses has the language and not be able to um and I know from incidents after two thousand and six when people ask but not the most methods from under their houses and their land I I've seen that with my own eyes\nSo it's it's it's it they do it they don't want to upset the shocking to me the end they don't want to be with the stress\nBut how does this translate on the political level with some really you know saying no use of the few days and if he doesn't get an agreement to resign and will be appointed how does it those concerns of the people translate out in the political realities of Lebanon today\nThat problem in Lebanon on as a there's a huge gap today between the people and put it to ...\nIt's not like ... two thousand and five is either because of the ocean or after the gap today is to pick\nThat trust is gun people did not read his vote and the elections and the physicians today a corruption has has never been that way it is today that trust and the government to an end any government whatever shape it takes\nIs not going to to change so uh I don't think politically it's going to change anything because the government is weak it's almost non existent\nCome on line with men we go to our\nLines and the new Cold War ... senior vice president of the American foreign policy a policy council he found out what a flat or use so just a moment years ago about ... wrote a book about Russia collapse of Russia what I did not understand was the irony of the word collapse\nI didn't realize what we were talking about was at an enemy of the liberal order and that's what we now see\nAn enemy of transparency and of what we esteem to be the community of nations are these last week said than on display in all directions you long can you help my audience understand how it is that Russia gains by\nBeing a prankster at best and Savage tour worst against his neighbors against a transnational organizations what is in it for the for Moscow how does this advance their story good evening ...\nRight so a good evening or so it's a great question and I think are a lot of it goes to a a a sort of it stems from the understanding that uh the Russians or feel like they're in a box right so so the way a good way to think about Russian foreign policy is is that Russia is constantly testing the contours of the box\nThey feel at Latin and put and set a dozen years ago that the end of the Soviet Union with the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century and it needs to be revised in Russia's favor and so uh what Russia is doing is a constant process of probing\nOr they're looking for weaknesses in the west weaknesses in alliance solidarity weaknesses in political cohesion and where did they find in a an entry point they act both as arsonist and a fire fighter\nThey both create a problem you know political problems security problems and then they posit themselves as a solution to those problems and in that way they increase their political position\nAt the expense of western nations and in particular the United states\nTo report we discussed last week and I saw came into the press and the ways they were too about um the Iranians evacuating the tea for air force base to allow Russia to install the as three hundred missile defense system in Syria [noise]\nSo what do you think this means is is this a Russia really advance and get ready to turn over to the Syrians is this a change in policy for the for the ... and ... is Russian now looking at his future as an arm supplier two former allies of the United states\nRight now so I think it's a great question because uh the delivery of the three hundred anti missile system is not without risk for the Russians\nThe Israelis have said uh you know very forcefully that it the delivery of the three hundred is not going to interfere with Israeli military aerial operations are in southern Syria and that they can defeat the three hundred if they want to and ah if they do defeat the three hundred\nA there is a a you know there's going to be a lot of egg on Russian faith\nAnd I told my sense is that the the ... that you see a piece for the\nUh move out of the Iranians are taking over control of the Syrian that's a little bit of plausible deniability it gives the Russians political cover to say if the at three hundred malfunctions are governed function as well as it should they can always claim user air because the less confident people are now in charge\nThe Russians would permit the S. three hundred to be out of their control he learned is that is that credible\nWhy I think so and the the interesting thing is at the at three hundred is if this is being built a lot uh at the top of the line right anti missile defense but it's actually not right though that the Russians are already and happen for several years working on the U.S four hundred\nAnd not a not a technical slouch by any sense of the work\nBut it is technology that you've seen the Russians become more and more liberal in sharing with their strategic part\nThat Malcolm but if it's in the hands of the Syrian right right\nIt puts them at a disadvantage it's a it's a serious move yes men with were very broad implications for the stuff we talked about limit on before\nI think in and he has and I think the anticipated along with others uh and now you have in the buying the U.S four hundred young Turks talking but I mean that's three hundred it's it's a it's a big move from the part of Russia now and and the exporting these things is obviously a profit motive involved as well\n[noise] right and and this is why I think this is the point I was trying to make which is that at the three hundred and it becomes more and more of an export commodity at it becomes a more international life uh the integrity of the system uh is going to be tested in many different ways and from the Russian you know they used to have\nA very strict command and control over this technology increasingly as they as three hundred goes into service against potential adversaries that might feed it a there is a level of possible deniability there is a level of separation at the Russians need to create from this\nSo that if if things go uh don't go serious way uh in the case of major Israeli aerial operations\nAnd the Israelis happened to defeat the system a there is a Russian argument that says well they weren't using it properly the technology is perfectly viable uh this is really user\nYou John have been on the forefront of discussing assessing analyzing the Chinese involvement in international affairs or\nAnd and you know and you wrote it very interesting piece the which is something we've thought about a lot about ... about the Chinese targeting the Muslim population there\nUm it was so ... what is the the can you can send upside the policy and and what is being implemented obviously human rights abuses are are incorporated in that policy but is the new anti terrorism state law and it's a barrier structures are going to really make a difference in this regard\nAnd I mentioned that wind ... the foreign minister chastised ... a secretary of

great voice of the great lakes and Andrew McCarthy\nOf the national Review Online we are in pursuit of a puzzle the puzzle is no longer\nJust Russia gate the puzzle is also Rod Rosenstein the deputy attorney general of the United states these last days have created a significant number of questions that do not have answers at this moment to my understanding gentleman they're very good evening to you since last we spoke\nRod Rosenstein much in the news yes\nFor the ride on air force one and the and the generous words by the president of the United states about a conversation with Rod Rosenstein but at the same time the expectation was that this week the residency in would be testifying to Congress the Judiciary Committee\nAbout the events of may have twenty Seventeen much in the news since the revolution in New York Times weeks past that Rod Rosenstein joke to remark George mentioned in some fashion spoke of the twenty Fifth Amendment\nAnd that in itself is surprising given that it doesn't seem entirely logical that the deputy attorney general speaking of an amendment to remove or accept a for a an unfit president to step to the side and also spoke of this report in the New York times wearing a wire which I think is Justice Department\nOr a speak for a using a lifting device or in some way to end snare a person's remarks that can be used against him in future in court\nAnd the New York times reported that and it was at the time regarded as either in jest or speaking light of that is not know that is no longer the case because since then\nWe we have ... of James Baker the chief counsel of the FBI\nAre testifying the to the Judiciary Committee\nThat he believes that Mr Rosen's ... spoke of this wire and spoken the twenty Fifth Amendment more than once and to to people it goes to report in the administration\nSo I come to you Andy first if I've got the timeline correct so we get to this moment when Rod Rosenstein expected to testify be to the Judiciary Committee\nNot only will not appear so far\nBut also will not pass to the Congress note from that period of may have twenty Seventeen to justify his remarks that he was not being serious good evening to you Andy\nEvening John well I think that one of the things that are ... is unrealistic about the reporting John or at least something that's being skipped over without more ah without the thought that it deserves is why Rosenstein was suggesting\nThat the president the tape recorded in terms of trying to make a decision about whether this is jockey or whether there was something serious about it obviously Rosenstein did not want the president\nA tape recorded because he was trying to make a criminal case on the president\nWhat the ... the thought that was going through Rosenstein is mind during those eight days when he was we know distraught because of the reaction particularly of Democrats to the memorandum he wrote\nA in support of the ultimate firing of of a ... that's the director called me\nA what was going through his mind then was\nThe potential that President Trump because there was a sort of a radical performance because there were were different rationales offered to the public for why Comey was fired because Rosenstein was being bitterly criticized\nWhat Rosenstein was talking about was gathering evidence\nTo indicate that President Trump was unstable for purposes of ultimately supporting a twenty Fifth Amendment move so the idea is they tape recording of the president and the discussion of the twenty fifth ... the twenty Fifth Amendment\nAnd the separated or desegregate it they're they're two parts of the same all the idea was that Rosenstein himself or others\nWho were having meetings with Trump in the White House we're going in there to\nUh in Rosenstein is mind record the president not just so that they could have recordings of the president it was in order to try to provoke conversations that would show he was unstable in order to get some momentum behind this whole twenty Fifth Amendment pushed so the thought that this was a joke\nTo me is\nReally quite unrealistic when you think about not only those two things the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment\nBut also the fact that this whole eight day period\nBegins with Rosenstein very distraught\nOver the fact that he's being criticized for the call me ma'am I'll\nAnn Ann's on may seventeenth with Rosenstein\nNot moving forward on the twenty Fifth Amendment but appointing Robert Mueller as special counsel is nothing jockey alert about anything that happened in that eight day period and again I think it makes no sense to talk about whether Rosenstein mentioned\nTape recording the president because I don't think there's any ... if ... if Rosenstein himself is admitting it but claiming it was ... that means there's so much evidence that had happened that he doesn't feel like he could deny it so then you have to ask yourself you must ask yourself\nWhy on earth would he be talking about that and he was talking about it in the context of the twenty Fifth Amendment Saturdays Tammy all\nAll because of as you said before his reputation correct It's really about air\nI really do believe so that he is and I think again we have to go back to that timeframe it's very easy I always find in these situations when you're looking back it's hard to put yourself and to put our listeners\nIn the framework of what was going on then versus what's going on now but what was going on then if you recall is\nThe Trump Administration was trying still to get up and running it was trying to get its own appointees in place which is in large measure a still has not happened at the Justice Department but I I Want to underscore at a time when it was very difficult for Trump nominees\nTo get confirmed and get to work in the various agencies of the executive branch because there was so much resistance in opposition to Trump Rod Rosenstein was ... confirmed by a vote of Ninety four to six with overwhelming democratic support\nAnd when he wrote the call me ma'am oh he was bitterly criticized by Democrats and I believe it was the first time in his life anything like that had happened and a lot of what happened in those eight days as a reaction a distraught reaction to that criticism\nThe puzzle here and in this could all be cleared up with contemporary notes that we're told exist the memos Baker\nAnd page and McCabe are all professionals and when they have a meeting with the department of justice especially a man who's putative Lee in charge of the department of justice because the attorney general is accused himself for many of these matters\nTo test your son four two seven six or nine four to stop all calls or confidential\n[noise]\n\nI'm joined us so this is the John ... shows that is McCotter my colleague we're having a conversation with our colleague Andrew McCarthy about Rod Rosenstein and his decision not to appear before Congress not to give Congress\nContemporaneous notes of the events of may twenty Seventeen when\nFrom James from Andrew McCabe the former deputy director of the FBI and Jim uh James James Baker the former chief counsel the FBI when we're told Mr Rosen's being discussed the twenty Fifth Amendment and wearing a wire those important days but at the end of those important as\nMr Rosen's Jane after considering other candidates appointed Bob Mueller Robert Miller a longtime friend of James Comey the fired FBI Director to be to be the head of the special counsel investing investigating Russia gate but now we get news and who knows if you can confirm it because it's the leak through\nA known sources now we get news that\nRod Rosenstein argue with James McCabe in front of the now momentarily hired Robert Mueller\nAbout recusal and recusal over whether McCabe ... shorter could should not have worn a campaign T shirt and a family picture supporting his wife's bed for state Senate I Know this is all you have to go back to twenty sixteen\nBut the ... side with the Democratic party very prominent in the Virginia politics\nAnd a Rod Rosenstein apparently had this argument why we know this now and the I'm going to guess that there's\nThat there's a competitive leaking going on here from attorneys because this very much looks like Rosa things leading against McCain whereas this started one McCabe lead against wrote the stain or and or the Congress with ... ... a a permission leaked against Rosen seems so the public is\nLike a tennis match Andy the public's go ahead going back and forth from court to court\nHow do you how do you interpret this latest leak we ... we can't confirming\nThat Rosa seen as having a an argument in front of Bob Mueller\nI Believe John that it's a defensive or or maybe it's a I Would I should say is the best defense is a good often\nOn behalf of the Rosenstein camp and I do think that the Rosenstein camp is doing a lot of chirping in the last a week two weeks with respect not only about this about all the ah that that important\nMay ninth to me Seventeen period that we've been discussing we heard a lot about Rosenstein in connection with that particularly after the New York times article was concerned so I think this is of a peace with that and why now I say that this is the best defense equals a good\nOffense approach on Rosenstein is part of what I mean is\nIf I'm McCabe\nOr frankly if I'm Jeff Sessions\nI hear Rosenstein talk about conflicts of interest and I think is he kidding\nIn in terms of in pointing out my potential conflict of interest each week as opposed to is actual screaming concrete conflict of interest is almost hilarious I mean if you think about it the case may very well I've had a conflict\nAnd certainly people at the bureau thought enough that he did that he was ultimately removed from the case probably much longer\nA afterwards then he should have in in terms of the Clinton email investigation I'm like is conflict was in for rent show from the fact that he was involved in [noise] the Democratic politics just like Jeff Sessions\nPotential conflict of interest was also in suffered from the fact that he was involved in the Trump campaign and there was a little factual pieces that because he had had these meetings with Russians although it seems to me that they will those meetings where much ado about nothing Rosenstein on the other hand\nUh seems to me to have a screening concrete conflict of interest in the sense that there is number one and investigation\nOf obstruction of justice involving the president and that by the way it was reported today in the Washington Post that the FBI considered themselves involved in an investigation of a criminal investigation of obstruction of justice against the president\nThere was such an investigation\nRosenstein was an essential witness in that case because he had drafted the memo that supported the firing of called me and the firing of called me was the event that people were thinking of as potentially obstructing the Russia investigation so he has a very concrete\nConflict of interest with respect to that\nAnd then if you if you add on to that the fact that Pfizer gate becomes an issue in the sense that everybody in Congress and everybody else's now looking at these size applications well science the fourth ... application but Rod Rosenstein so in terms of both the criminal investigation involving the president\nAnd the congressional investigation involving the surveillance of the Trump campaign Rosenstein is an essential witness so he has the conflict to end all conflicts and if he was raising conflicts with other people and\nNot recognizing the clear conflicts that he had I I gotta say something's wrong here we've got about a minute at that and go ahead\nAnd what happened was an hour and they didn't want to read it [laughter] [laughter] well what happens now is I think we can get you to monitor the\nTwists and turns here but I Do think that things are are reaching a a day new mall with the with Rosenstein regime climax at any of that\nYeah ... ... you have a feel for Congress in Congress and losing patient can you tell this as it because it's now into a year or two and Rosenstein continues to be at ... ... troops\nAh I think some of them are but the vast majority of them are right now heading into reelected and that's what they're getting into a November So they're less than a month away or that's number one thing on their mind right now\nAnd Andy that's practical he can define them as long as Congress is at risk and if the Democrats come up in charge of the house is he free\nYes if he if the Democrats come up in charge of the house he spray\nOr other than how he comes up and mowers investigation that I don't really see that being much of a problem for them or it's the tongue rushing away best to go and that's problematic for him and I think you're right if the Democrats when the house he's free at least or from twenty Eighteen to twenty twenty\nAndrew McCarthy Thaddeus McCotter a vote for the Democrats vote for deputy attorney Rod Rosenstein

I Know that Bob this is not a Russian problem only as an American problem because you just ... by several administrations and Congress and Congress to depend\nOn Ross cause most and not reach in and deal with the deterioration in Russian transparency these last years especially since the Ukraine crisis\nThe breakdown in conversation between Moscow and Washington\nAnd we cannot say that the space efforts were going to continue on TALK by that a breakdown you mentioned the whole that was drilled in the capsule that reached I asked as that created a crisis on I. S. S. although it was a momentary crisis\nIt emerged that it looks like sabotage I certainly don't think the Russians will because as a nation they practice the kind of paranoid that sabotage he's always going to be a question for\n... they have at least have launched a criminal investigation into this right away they didn't waste any time and what was that partly them in the U.S we wouldn't open a criminal investigation till we got some evidence but this is Russia\nThey consider the fed like this if it keeps happening to be criminal and they've all they've raised it to\nThat well why Bob after that drilled home so yeah I I think it's reasonable yes I Do and that drove the whole was aimed at the IOC says this is aimed at I.

S. S. there's no way to get a replacement astronauts up they can leave anytime the question is how do you maintain eye as says they're not really ... their their lives are okay I I agree with you on this the way the Congress I wrote about this a decade and a half ago when I was writing the ...\nUh that Congress and George Bush proposed that we\nReplace the shuttle\nWe're tired of the shuttle without a replacement for it was was was not a feat was not above it was a feature and their proposals and they went along with it and they made us dependent on Russian nation that is not reliable in terms of quality workman ship as well as\nPower and there's ... there's a breakdown of conversation between the two states is not it's not a small matter was saying it's a span of the NASA responding with lots of tweets lots of comments and the social media but they're not addressing that profound problem the new Cold War\nI Would also add to this John let me while today there is a meeting of the safety panel for NASA and eat it saying unquote quickly\nThat well we don't think all safety issues have been whole dealt with with a\nPrivate capsules and we think they're not going to be able to watch this year and we want more delays they're not dealing with the reality here either\nThese capsules are ready to go there is no question of it all their complaints I think a bureaucratic all complaints and they should just stop get out of the way we need to have some urgency here to get back to a ability of Americans to fly out are all capsules\nA bomb and there there there's more had bought this now is a an investigation you said it's a criminal investigation but they will apply themselves the way they do a plane crash right they're going to try to reassemble the pieces\nAnd go through step by step what happened what we know is that there wasn't a clean separation there is a video of the astronauts won the emergency happens and the whole capsule vibrates as if they're on some kind of a some kind of\nA a ride at the at a\nRestaurant a rocket going up the space John we don't really know what happened was it a clean separation it's not clear even at this moment in time what happened that they're going to have a capsule that the castle is where the problem is they're going to have to see if they can pick up as many pieces of that upper stage\nAnd the strap bonds and the first stage as they can those pieces to fall down in Russia in areas are under their control that are not well populated and they know where they come down they've been doing it for decades\nAnd so they're going to try to track those pieces down to try to figure it out and yes the Russians will do a thorough investigation and they will probably pinpoint what the problem is but the bottom line is will they fix anything and I'm not so sure that they will\nThere will be more news ahead we moved the I. G. report the inspector general report about the ... now we've we Bob and I have watched just laughed and made a light of the delays the word delay with that so last this is the I. G. looking at the same question and Bob\nOh it's like deja vu you ever get filled deja vu\nA an order of the national inspector general released a yesterday slams a Boeing and NASA\nFor incompetent management at as a less cost overruns and for the delays they're saying there's no way they can meet a twenty twenty launch date for twenty Nineteen launch date for uh the first unmanned mission of as a lesser Ryan and it'll probably go into twenty Twenty one\nThey also point out how Boeing's a budget for building a Seles which was supposedly set of four billion\nIs been toppled a billion and more money will have to be poured into it they talk about how a\nA NASA or where do you call it was lax and how they supervise Boeing and its budget and meanwhile Boeing has shown sloppy innocent incompetence and I've outlined those events over the years John and this whole program\nAnd I should point out that this uh inspector general report this week\nIs not news I I've been reporting inspector general reports\nGa reports over the last half decade repeatedly saying that as a less is badly managed by NASA and by Boeing and is a disaster and the key is like Russia nothing has changed in all those years they continue to run it badly\nAnd the costs keep going up what's going on it's a cost plus contract and so Boeing you think it encourages called bowing to slow things down and increase the cost because they always get up they kept percentage of what those increased costs are\nAnd this is why costs plus contracts or disaster why government big projects are fast that these two stories demonstrate the the failure of big government project\nWhat is to be done about ... what's wrong with that what has to be done about it after last\nWell you know right now what I expect to happen is they will try to fix\nThese problems and they'll give borrowing more money that's the way the government is functioning now there's no one seems to have the nerve to say let's shut this down\nThey're going to probably spend more money it will probably now delay into twenty Twenty one the first on land mission and that means the first land mission will probably delayed into twenty twenty four or beyond which means it will take a NASA\nTwenty plus years to fly a single man met mission on a single capsule twenty plus years and the costs will probably be somewhere around six billion dollars disgraceful\nWe leave ... cosmos and not to the two big space and turn to blue origin which is Jeff Bezos is creation a quite different from space sex and there is a delay there for there to rocket building the new shepherd in the new Glenn\nWell you know it's an interesting thing this story about blue origin delaying shepherd new Glenn came out the same day as the Airforce announced contracts\nBig contracts to you all a Northrop Grumman and blue origin for their future uh not yet flour and not yet even built a orbital rockets and I found that the ... the the a\nCoincidence that the two stories most intriguing John Large it announced that they will not get any man flights of new shepherd the sub orbital space craft until next year\nAnd they're looking at maybe twenty twenty or that they'll start to do a tourism flights a that's a delay meanwhile knew Glen their orbital ship they're saying that delaying it till twenty Twenty one instead of twenty twenty what I find interesting is on the same day they announced these delays yeah for the kids and a half\nA billion dollar contracts with the ... knew Glen the new Glenn rocket and from my perspective\nGetting a half a billion dollars should allow you to speed up the development of the rocket not slow it down but guess what just like Boeing with a Seles you get more money from the government before you being built anything that's an incentive to slow things down and so suddenly they announce it use to lay\nAnd at the same thing going to you all a a Northrop Grumman to build Vulcan that fuel lays rocket and something that ... and a rocket omega a launch system that Northrop Grumman\nHi I'm Dennis ... you know some things in life are just built to last like my baseball
