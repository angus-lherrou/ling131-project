B. R. O. B. Y. featuring interview an hour and a few laughs along the way\nSo\nI heard about this story today after I heard listeners Conan\nTrying to say that ... had a had a salt that other people after this this story gets out that are that you know said he had this morning where a back in the day when Mandela was a teenager\nJoked furlough his neighbor at the time um you know I guess got involved with what's scaring him away from something are getting away from a revenue recorded what Joe said there was a girl was screaming\nAnd the girl was screaming and so therefore he came outside he told the teenagers that were that were her rang in her to get out of the way that I don't come over here anymore or inadvertently according to Joe hit a you know hit somebody was flailing his arms hit Nick Matty\nYellow ... parents evidently filed charges and according to Tim white the court record said that after trial was found not guilty going to Joe Joe so I think I played no low and he said doesn't remember exactly now\nSo I so then people started calling and say oh there's other things that George Will have done so I called the joys of what what could they possibly be talking about and the truth furlough style he says well the way it maybe it's the thing that Larry Earhart and so what happened where Earhart their air hard well you know I a poke me any I and I slapped\nThem back and Larry or heart\nCalled in with Joey told me the story on the air that called in with Joe and Joe told a story about how the two of them were in each other's face arguing about something Larry went to go tweak his nose job took it as his eyes getting poked out or we're getting poked and he uh swung is is a hands out I'm\nA and you know Latin we represent an ... or whatever\nIt was no big deal we're free will over it later on or yelling at each other smacking each other in the face hitting each other in the chest [laughter]\nAnd there you go [noise] and you know and later on in the hour I asked them about these this you know to me it was the story that came out this morning with ... yellow was to me it actually made jokes we'll look good\nBecause he stepped in and tried to stop something some you know boys are doing it in a hurry and some young woman\nAnd so that made him look good but then he goes in the wax Allen funding for the ... car accident and he said that last hour and Alan ... car accident or for all intents and purposes was an accident\nYou know you've dealt with his back to the city council days he dealt with this last time for governor he came out he had a very tearful press conference about it uh and they are lacking any sort of evidence\nTo the contrary there was the the uh the grand I guess there was a grand jury to the charge was nearly the campaign was it was a stickler for the actual charge a charge of the time was I'm driving to endanger death resulting\nNot vehicular homicide\nGrinding to endanger death for death resulting at the end of the day he was found nothing was going was it was just there was no charge was there in terms of there was no I'm\nI'm there was no litigation was done was drop\nAnd you get the kids Nineteen years old the terrible situation and I think that you know while Joe is a fighter and everything's what he says I think he went overboard with this with that one I don't think he needed to do that especially not with a with a kind of Rhode Island silly story but that's what's\nGoing on here that's why I pushed them a little bit on this idea of you know going after Allan Fung rather than Gina Raimondo and this is what I hear from people all the time\nThis is a this is a ... at least I Know what to tell you this is what Joe things Joe things now and the bad\nGuy for whatever reason\nAnd um\nYou know it's going to ensure the Gina Raimondo gets gets put into office\nIt's or it's going to be easier for her now I don't know about polls and what not to polls are are are there or not and they're they're legitimate or not who knows\nMore often than not they're they're legitimate\nSo you know this is the situation if this latest poll is legitimate and actually is a snapshot in time\nThen it doesn't matter what Joe trailer does 'cause he's got five percent of the support in that poll and or an Alan fungus is fourteen points behind governor Raimondo which I wouldn't be surprised if that's the case by the way I'd be surprised if there was a five percent but I wouldn't be surprised if that's the case because listen\nWe're in we're in a a you know Donald Trump has has the entire left wing of the world\nOr anybody who can be virtual convert you signal by joining a left wing are ready to go there motivated they're ready to rock and General Motors got more money than God she's throwing money and everything to the Democratic Governors Association so tin tin easy just just the way to I think is an extra million dollars that's being spent on her behalf\nUm so this is one of those things and I don't know what else to tell you\n\nAnd this is one of those things that to me it's a you know it is what it is you're going to make a decision and what is your decision when you hear this stuff I got to tell you man I when I hear say an email from somebody said we just got to go back to the to the beginning and reset get a whole bunch of different people that get in here and there's a lot of people that that honestly that I think\nAre are there there there there are they are in that in mind\nWhere there is\nThat mindset where they just they're done with it the back and forth\n\nAnd you know I think that the cabin or thing for people who tend to be right ... right leaning this kind of stuff was exhausting they don't want to see this crap anymore\nI don't know\nI don't know I don't know what to tell you\nSo you tell me when I don't know what to tell you you tell me my phone numbers for three eight WPRI oh the toll free number one eight hundred three two one WPRI you can email me mad at six three zero WPRI dot com I look at the progressive movement as a danger to the individual rights and liberties the individual sanity to the ability to the danger to free speech\nI see all that and I see Gina Raimondo as a foothold in this in even more for the progressive or ideology 'em and let me tell you when the progress of ideology starts to take more and more of a foothold in the politics than any place or the legislative power in any place\nYou're going to be from the New England truck solutions to the Ninety nine of them than I Am six thirty WPRI accumulate station [noise]\nBusiness and Trump react to missing journalists the lights are still out in Florida I'm having a painting\nPresident Trump does not want to halt military weapons sales to Saudi Arabia following the disappearance of Washington Post journalist ...\nI actually think we'd be punishing ourselves if we did that corresponded\nYour moniker Roger reports new claims about the vanishing of ... who entered the Saudi embassy in Istanbul and it was not seeing coming out\nThis year with the investigation his whole that ah that turkey has audio visual evidence to prove that Russia was false and tortured and killed inside the confident now Saudi Arabia has consistently denying I'd be claimed saying they're baseless allegation\nA growing number of global companies are withdrawing from an upcoming summit in Saudi Arabia over concerns about the missing journalist President Trump's son in law Jared Kushner whose net worth is around a third of a billion dollars appears to have paid almost no income taxes from two thousand nine to twenty sixteen the New York times reports\nOkay so but I'm I'm guessing although it wouldn't be front and Center for you right now because the immediate problems logistical fixing this uh this commute to school for the kids that's something that's got to be looked at it from that with ... with any entity going forward\nYeah it was discussed actually at the city council education committee as well so I think it's absolutely something that people are aware of and top of mind\nWhat was the consensus\nDon't think there is one I think they have to figure out a you know what what they're going to do when they renegotiate the contract I mean it'll be part of the R P\nWhen these are these you know you you know the school board put out three our piece last night on for the full the full boat to full service the other one just to like Lisa fleet of buses and and then I got to buy for creating the full contract with the management and drivers with the other one I think the idea is to try last time you know there was only one qualified better\nAs well I mean that's kind of the challenge I mean as I understand that\nThe you know to the city in the district or their own buses for over three decades um and ah you know if when you lose some control when you do that you have to figure out how to get qualified better is if you're going to rely on private partners to provide the transportation so from our perspective and I think the school board's perspective last night and\nThe the the direction that they gave me is way let's look at this in every way possible so that we can have a you know a number of different voters potentially on the table to provide service for our students\nHere we're talking with Chris Martin the superintendent of schools in Providence so explain to me what you think the dynamics differences between that which was hey we shopped around and couldn't find anybody to to to to step in here at the beginning of this job action to now\nYou feel like they do think there's a ... I asked\nBoy was there the the effort\nUm you know two weeks ago was interim this seems like it's interim or more in this more fertile opportunity for other companies to bid jobs you're thinking\nYeah yeah and you know and I think I think that we're looking at every possible solution I mean before this thing happened you know we talked to ride we talked to rip that we talk to every bus company we can find up and down the east coast [noise]\nYou know that we're a city that buses a significant percentage of our students then uh you know we were looking when when when this started coming down the pike we looked at every other place that had that had this issue in Seattle at a bus strike of similar nature uh earlier and in the year and I think it was February [noise]\nAnd um you know they have ah\nProbably over twice as many students as we do\nAnd uh we both about nine thousand uh Ninety five hundred and they bus eleven thousand so it it goes to show you're like well we are ... you know some people have asked us oh this could have a regional impact quite frankly this could have a\nA a national impact but what I Want to do is what we're doing like you said controlling what we can control in the school department you know we don't control the strike we control our response to it and we're just trying to do is made our families wherever we can you know last night I announced and we've been doing this already we're going to put work on line for students are going to and if the students\nCan't don't have Internet access for going to send home our pockets and if they can't and no one can get to school to pick 'em up we're going to hand deliver them we're going to do whatever we can to minimize the impact on our students because they're the ones to students and families are the ones that are suffering and um I mean there have been around forty students then that have missed every day of the strike\nUm that that have only been absent during the strike so but one student is too many and so\nIt was mostly I ... in students with disabilities and\nNow I mean I think people have this idea about the students with disabilities that all these students have physical disability most of the overwhelming majority of our students with disabilities\nTheir transportation that combination is you get a drop on the corner instead of at the bus stop you get a drop of your at your door in some cases it's not indicating physical I'm a disability it's more anyone with an ... with a learning disability is where most of the the overwhelming majority of those kids are but\nAs I said you know one student has too many one days too many and the fact that we have almost forty kids that have only missed school during the strike is you know it's twenty four thousand kids but we are going to do everything we can to meet those families wherever they are\nSo let me ask you this was was\nThe hesitancy to do this and this seems like a pretty smart comprehensive are he threefold let's see what comes in based on three different solutions I'm a insure them or or or full time was it was it wasn't a feeling you know a couple of weeks up until\nThe strike in the early started to strike that this thing had to resolve that like this is like come on man just had to resolve it so I mean let's see these three options seem to be very smart but they seem to be in some people's eyes party\n[noise] um I mean I think\nThat's possible I think that does have to risk\nThat we we did want it to resolve and everyone thought it would have thought it was resolved but we were looking at all these options beforehand as well\nYou know we have a process where you have to follow in terms of putting them in front of the school board and you know that being said we will look at emergency ... if that's what's necessary to get this done I mean what does that mean well and I don't want to get into the ... I don't want to get over my skis on ... what I Will say is as I understand that we have a significant\nThe link the permit process that involves multiple layers of government but in times of crisis in times of emergency we can a speed that up and if we have qualified providers that are available we will be using this bill that those emergency for camera procedures and I know that there's alignment I'm across the government agencies to that\nWell you guys would be nuts to put out this kind of a or if he or a series of three if you didn't feel like it would\nBe some response you must you must have found a way to match competitive or alternative um\nEntities stepping in here with the R D process I I I'm guessing you guys did that ... that there will be a response to\nThese on west yes yes but I Do think that what we did find out beforehand is that the way that the uh the the whole solution oh there were limited limited options that was one qualified\nBetter right and so the idea is to try to break it up and see what we can't we talked to other people we know that there's that there's interest um income into Providence to city where people will come the question is you know right now it's not you know how do we make it more attractive for more better to be able to enter into the conversation so that our kids\nCan get to school I mean we're we're missing you know we have kids that are not just kids that aren't going into school by the way we're not we don't have field trips we don't have a middle school athletics or are happening right now I Want to you know publicly thank many of the other districts in the state superintendents I've called to say hey\nCan we switch the schedules around so that we can how our kids can host so that they're not missing\nYou know out on games we varsity athletes you know if we don't have buses we don't have athletes at a other school districts throughout the state of really really stepped\nUp and then it's not just a huge administrative mess I'm absolutely oh uh I I Am I'm certain that everything you're saying in more is is part of your your ... best by the way what's the cash flow in this well for students not performing what is that money being returned indoor held or it never will be paid you know what the logistics are there\nUm it's as I understand it and it will never will be paid so whatever their whatever they would be paid for those runs they won't be paid\nAnd if somebody responds to the larger or if he which is you know you're in you're out uh do you does the city feel more comfortable that you're leaving rounds just you know get them to buy I'm Sorry I didn't hear that yeah you do you think you can just simply replace for students in one fell swoop you're on legal ground to be able to do that\n[noise] yeah no I mean we don't have the absolutely um you know and what our hope is still here or that they are going to come together and resolve this with the Teamsters I mean this is the daytime and I know that their\nOngoing conversations and uh you know with the number of different pressure points have been applied by number of different entities and that still going to be the best solution for us in the immediate term but but I guess the\n... question however we can get our ... our students to school safely and securely\nAs soon as possible will be our best solution\nAnd so I guess just one one business question than one student question in ... the\nThe the idea that\nIt was forced mature language in this agreement seems to protect for students from its obligation whether jumped strike how than you'd replace them with these other of these have you thought that out\nWell Daraa fees are being you know last night the school board actually voted on them happening and then what we're going to do is work with the administration to ensure that whatever language needs to be included in those to ensure the best situation for the city of moving forward is included\nAnd I just don't understand how for student gets moved aside if in fact they thought they were protected by job action is just kind of a\nA nonstarter for them that they did that that they were there seems to me if I understand what happened here is that the ... that that that waves\nNot performance ... liabilities or the job actually specifically so I'm not sure I\nSigned the protests I I'm not a lawyer so I don't want to give you an official opinion on this but my understanding of it is that it just it probably protects them from suit it doesn't it doesn't protect them from not getting paid or from us moving on\nGotcha and finally the the us federal\nUm issues of mandates that are being violated with some of these uh these these kids ... you can get a little ... emails on that I just you have complications from federal regulations\nYeah I mean the students are students with disabilities it's more more of a ... if I'm at a understand the question it's the students with disabilities for transportation as part of their plans and you know we're working what we will be working with the ACLU and others who have filed suit to come\nYou know what we were doing a number of the things they suggest and uh and the things and we're sitting down with them I rented a Steve Browne at a community event um after he sent sent a letter to us and I said hey let's sit down if you guys have ideas we haven't thought of let's let's figure out if we can do them in the best interest in ... and that's what we want to do\nWhich is why the record or you can see it yeah thank you yeah I'm I'm also one wild\nUm sensational part is one of the witnesses claim that Mr Grillo use of racial slur\nIn a threatening to get a some guys to come and beat them up now I have reached out to the ... campaign or for spots I did get an email back from his spokesperson said well we'll get back to you so we're still waiting to hear\nA from Mr Grillo about these new development\nYeah there's a it's hard to ... ...\nThe handwriting is hard to read but it's about two thirds of the way down Dan of what you're looking at yeah on the secondary statement not Nick ... is\nThe ... the one that says we were ... next door we were at ... ... lives next door neighbors man some spelling problems or we were making Illinois ... so that's that's the friend right [noise] yeah no\nThat is we were at a trove of ethnic and ... for the phone and says didn't hit me three times in the head so that would be ... the other one is presumably his buddy or an a or a witness\nThe one that says you trying to scare me but coming close to me with the car and almost it means that many ... okay ... you know\nAnd then books you're listening to two guys in the media doing some work here um and then there's the other one is a is a kid and I I I've heard what the alleged word is is it written in here\nI'm Sorry I said to her I'd met heat the racial slur yeah it is it's misspelled but it's in there is it the N. word yes it is okay\nAlright them um let's take a deep breath ... what's your uh what's your repertory all analysis hear about this\nWell one thing I'm you know it it it to everybody listening or this is you know silly and and a full Rhode Island all that\nI just I don't mean to sound like a journalism professor here damn but this is why reporting it out is so important like if we just went on the he said he said stuff I don't think we'd have the full picture and now I think we have it's coming a little bit more into focus granted it is forty years ago um and\nThe documents we should note to your listeners they did come redacted\nI'm with witnesses and victims names are removed there but to me even stories big or small this is why you know I I've joked on your show before the old saying in journalism is when your mother so she loves you check it out and this is why right because we had varying ... stories on this and it's good to get what the police account\nA of what actually happened went down the other thing is obviously as I stated at the beginning of our conversation uh this is conflict\nWith the tail that Mr Grillo had pulled all of us and uh now I'd like to get a little clarification from him as to why he provided the narrative and maybe he'll stick by it maybe he'll say the police report is wrong and the witness statements they're all they're lying or\nI mean he has found he's found Niceville not guilty we don't know why we went up the trial right in the court records or ...\nAs far as I could that's why I was in ... tuck it at the judicial record center earlier this week they're gone there was just one clerks entry about found not guilty so\nBut then again he actually said he admitted to it\nUm when it before I had found that that clerks note he said he admitted to 'em and admitted in a no contest plea which\nSo everyone understands that is you're not actually convicted since it's a misdemeanor um you admit that there is probably enough evidence to be found guilty right and it's a weird kind of middle ground up ...\nUp but that you know so that was his recollection of what had happened um\nAnd that isn't that isn't the case according to what has been jotted down here as you point out he was found not guilty\nOkay\nThis just in the in the life I guess a gubernatorial campaign I I\nI Want to be able to process this thing and and obviously we're going to hear from drew in one was I'm sure he'll call in you know then I'm guessing he'll be on the line momentarily to explain this but uh you know my my thinking is is that maybe there was another situation you know with the with the young\nGirl of the house I mean I don't know how you make up the young girl in the house in the in the house and the kids don't know I don't know how you do that\nWell it and let's just as we're kind of talking it through and again I I Hope we hear from Mr thrill of the um\nHis claim is that they these kids are at least ... yellow a young Matty yellow were problems for a while and so maybe he was thinking of it earlier\nA incident and he blew his top and you know whatever led to this altercation though you're right I mean there could have been some incident that he recalls an event conflated the two of them\nAll right Jim Lewis thank you and good work and we'll look forward to your reports on this and stay in touch with us you never know who's

it\nYou know I I have a fake remembrance of this whole issue a lot of it comes to come back a little bit as I read the report but you know\nIs this different than the story you told earlier this week\nIt might be somewhat different because I thought I had pleaded no role but that that wasn't the case may be that was offered to me you know I don't remember it was forty years ago\nI Know what I what I'm asking is that the incident with the with the girl in the house and the kids in the front than you running over\n... ... where there are multiple incidents because there's no reference in all in this drama that's now part of the police report that everybody was drawn to you Bye bye campaign operatives uh there's no reference to the little girl\nSo do you think you might have had multiple situations no\nI don't think there are multiple situations I don't think that it became part of the ... that's the problem um you know they kind of wrote it off I guess the fact that I responded to the girl next for that was screaming because they were trying to pushing her door but uh\n\nAnd I went home ... that my mother you know Rick he's probably hit me in the head\nShe's saying would you do\nThat would be her first answer [laughter] look pretty good right so I mean those were those days\nYeah those were those days you know Mr gardener hit me in the head my father would have said don't

to know if I were to three quarter inch plywood and stir it up against it to buy the glue and screw it\nIt would be to share my crawl space has been under the floor and I want them to read it doesn't need a cross ventilation it's kind of old school and I put on the ground your thoughts\nAre well first of all in terms of uh beefing up the floor Joyce says string the floor Joyce by doubling the middle of the silly to go with these plywood on them I Would doubled and what have you ... well I mean it'd be flimsy but the thing is if you want a sister a floor drawers and help support it\nNeed to go from bearing point to bury points so if it's going from a gr fear to exterior wall the sister being hosted go the same way\nYou know another thing that you could do Kurt is you could run\nAnother gerd or at the midpoint of the Fifteen feet from and and now it doesn't necessarily have to be has to be as strong as the main gr for the house 'cause you're really just taken the flex out of it so

story I didn't want to like put a man I only have like Seventy five inches night\nMy understanding so you know doubling them is a solution as well as using amid spend gr\nAppreciate the information\nYou're welcome Kurt thanks so much for calling us at ... money pit\nWell laminate countertops inexpensive and they can give you the look of natural don't of course without the price tag and they certainly can last a long time but they are quite and durable that stone\nThat's right and the good news is though that some of the most typical problems can be repaired here to talk about that Tom silver the general contractor for TV's this old house welcome Tommy thank you and I said here you know inadvertently laying down a hot pot are scratching the surface can definitely want to be one of those sort of oh no\nHoly cow other words that I Can't say on the radio moment is yeah I Know what you're saying right I mean how do you get out of those problems are those types of things fixable\nOr in some cases if the hard part is down there and it's just bubble the countertop you may be able to re heat it sounds silly the hot pot losing bit now you've got to read it to break that down but you actually go to soften the it he's them underneath the contact that Egypt and sometimes you can actually re fasten it if you have a role or take out\nYour old roller derby rolling the dough and rule that\nCountertop until it cools down and sometimes you can read fast and even without getting additional he's been there just to get it to ... right away exactly exactly this is sort of you've got to react as it's happening that well no you can eat and then he hit the Pentagon and put it\nBut some of harder and harder to get smarter than you are right away oh my God I get the road\nWhat if you have a physical damage in the countertop um is there a way to kind of do selective surgery and just replace one one chunk of it yeah you can cut it in a cutting board is probably the easiest way if it's if the cutting board is in a good location right um but uh basically you're essentially cutting out that area of limited and replacing it with a cutting board\nYeah and they have different kinds of cutting boards you can get a solid surface cutting board you can get to where they got like a ... you can get a wooden cutting board\nDo you know what the beautiful things about doing that and somebody else will come into your house and that we can go wow I didn't I couldn't afford a great idea yeah exactly I don't want to do so well I it is a hands are tied up the ruined it and then you can get one in\nIs it sort of done as like a drop in tray almost at the drop and think wouldn't be installed cutting ... sits on top\nOf the summer they have this little metal ring that goes around it and you write a metal ring in some of the ... just cutting boards fit in that little rank dropping and you can actually pop it out and flip it over so when you wear it out if you use and like I wouldn't\nWant you know one of the other common thing that I've noticed when we first bought our house we had a lovely Pepto bismol pink a laminated happen you know while we lived with it for a while until they could afford the granite\nThat edge just kept popping off and I feel like that's always one of the areas that failed first yeah what can you do to make that sort of either re attach or a place that\nLots of times you can take an edge it's usually the corner you're dead right on it's usually the corner because you're running by that kind of get check on it once you've caught it you've got to either try to heat it back on with an iron soften it gently the glue and then you push it back on with a rural or or something from\nA and if that doesn't work and you can't get it all the pieces broken out you're going to have to replace it and you're gonna have to find peace somewhere in the kitchen usually beside the stove or the refrigerator or in a dead corner you may be able to steal a peace right out of that corner\nAnd patch it right in to that piece that's that's ah been damaged\nAnd you don't use any buffer between the iron and the and the laminate itself you don't need like a towel just to prevent further burning\nYou got to make sure that you don't overheat the I in a ... you know you don't what's why\nDon't I enclosed but I mean like I Do a full steam high heat that though isn't it I got an iron I go crazy when I can always go harder you know medium or ... yeah see I so but I don't\nI don't I don't know he knows team be careful right you don't need that steam ... what have you have more minor scratch is is there such a thing as a scratch color\nOr see there is serious but you know what I find that they don't really work that great you know it's a temporary fix if you're going to bench really change it may be able to do it but you know you can even try those uh sticks or that they use and\nNobody would would feel like they're like

interior designer to help lead al choose colors choose furniture and and and make it work for you visually\nWell and I think the other good thing about bringing in the architect as they may have an interior designer that they work with you can bring in your own they'll be able to sort of work together to help you specify the right materials for the right areas so it really is a strong partnership\nI hate out do I do I talk I consult with to our taxes will get their ideas or do I guess go with whining\nAnd get that get hang\nI Would do is I Would that would bring in one or two or maybe three architects to see the property tell them what you want to accomplish to find out how the\nYou work you get a feel for them yeah they get a feel for you and then you make a decision based

how well you communicate back and forth you know sort of sit by ideas you know there during that meeting and get a really good sense of how much they're understanding you and whoever you feel the most

they'll have books that shows from their past projects you can see what kind of work they do you know it's gonna be you'll figure out through a process of elimination which one you're most comfortable with and that's the person that's going to get the job but they are well worth\nThe investment because they're going to make this process easy and they're going to be you're going to be assured that it that it comes out exactly as you as you plant you know if you ... if you go right to the contractor step there is going to squeeze us bathroom in wherever and they think it fits and it's just

Island is on the line with a nice guy like what's going on\nI have a bay window in my bedroom door skylight and for a while it started to create those brown stands on my feeling but the most part\nThe biggest problem with there was a leak in the window so my uh my father I went up there were flashing kid on the uh the skylight and seemed to help the problem but it did not limit a problem\nAnd I had a contractor friend over who took a look at it as well\nAnd he noticed that if you are on the outside the bay window but the gutter\nWhere the gutter attaches to the roof above it and the opinion that there shouldn't be perhaps some like sixty eight inch gap there between where the government the house and we're the bay window starts so to the thing that they might have been improperly installed\nSo it sounds like the bay window was up to high is that what you're saying so basically it goes right up under the gutter\nRight certainly there's certainly no separation between um the topic but there's also no separation from where the gutter meets the house either\nRight in the bay window have its own roof on it or is the roof sort of built into this off at structure no\nUnder the over ...\n... is it possible that the gutter is over filling and perhaps the water's backing up through the gutter getting the soften running into the bay\nI thought that at one point um and I have gone up in check in the gutters are going\nTo pay and we're this is on the roof assertion of a long stretch a roof that goes down before this for his the skylight\nUm yeah I guess so maybe a tear ten or Fifteen feet\nSo I'm going to give you I'm a trick of the tree and this might solve it you might be in so much water against that flash against that skylight that sort of forcing the toy him wonder

America\nHello thanks for having me on line today\nOh we're so happy to have you know I think most people plan for a painting project they're really thinking that you know moving furniture and by the drop cloth and brushes and rollers that's all the hard part but color selection is really a topic that tends to paralyze a lot of er and it's the I was ... yeah well I think that is\nIt's a big choice and there's a lot of selection and there's just a lot of different elements that really impact that color that you're going to put in in your space in your home and I we know that the number one reason that people are looking\nTo change a paint color in their room is to change the mood and the feeling the overall look and feel of of what that room as is going to be at the end imagining and visualizing how that changes is going to happen can sometimes be tougher people but we try to provide much inspiration is on the\nJob interview and kind of dark you guys tend to put different colors together you assemble LBJ with color and during their quite well especially with your way this announcement of the new color of the year it was talking about that\nThis week we actually released our new twenty Nineteen color of the year blueprint in our trend palate and we're very very excited about that we believe that this is the color that symbolizes our desire for positive energy stability represents confidence we believe it to a color that will really stand the test of time\nI mean it really is a gorgeous gorgeous color was there something specific I mean you have a blueprint and it's obviously sort of the basis of every major home project what was it that sparked it for you guys with that\nOur team of color experts we we look everywhere for inspiration for a for a color palette and we look at different industries like fashion\nHospitality colors you know that we're finding as we're traveling around the round the world and throughout this whole journey as we're looking we just saw blue everywhere\nBeside dark blues we saw light blues is a bold saturated blues but when we landed on blueprint we just felt it was a real sweet spot it's refined blue\nWith just amount the right amount of depth and brightness we feel you know it's a warm debt it's warmer than denim but it softer then maybe it's very very livable and very approachable and usable and any room in your home\nKnow the word that comes to mind when I when I look at the color or ... comfort me just feels comfortable you got huge wing or on your website a beer dot com forward slash ... trend as hunting for deferred house that you could use it with\nAnd each one is special but the all feel comfortable y'all feel it'd be could be in my house\nWell it's again it's just it's easy to use and blue we know is one of those colors that's really universally accepted it's a favorite color around the world and we just feel like it's authentic it's positive it's true it\nJust speaks to our desire to be the best version of ourself both in our it at home and out there in the world\nAnd you know what I Love it because it it's a little bit feel gray [laughter]\nI'm Still so much in a gray moment right\nNow using them to ignore the paint project and you don't know how to get started in making that the color decision which if you have to get ... votes moving\nWell I think that the first place to start as you look at your room and you decide how you want you're thinking about how you want that room to feel and color of course helps with that transformation and that re imagination and very often people are looking to coordinate a new all color with something that they already have in the room\nA piece of furniture piece of art work I'm a floor rug or something else in the room that really might help inspire the change and and they're trying to coordinate with with that so that's usually the first place that we look\nAnd again uh we have many many tools on line on their dot com that help with that journey we have colored discovery tools we have a pins to palate tools they all have paint your place and color smart that again health care aide and narrow down the colors elections for people\nYou know there any specific tips you get folks from there in the aisles looking at all of the paint colors watches out there that look for an accessory that you really like bring a pattern pick something from there what do you think is really a good starting point for the people who are just care about it [laughter]\nIt's all of those things because right to everybody kind of enters it from a different place in a different point some people start with a blank canvass and just really have a mood in mind so let's say they're trying to create a calming mood\nThey might look for a blues and greens are they just really want you know kind of a neutral background where everything coordinates with that you might look for Brown's in Gray's whites of course are easy option because they kind of create this light open expansive feel and we have a gang color collateral in the aisles that that help people do that but the number one thing\nThat we tell people remind them to do is sampled the color at home in his biggest watches you can and so there's little tester jars the eight out samples that we sell at the pain death and those are really really key in helping people visualize what that colors and it looked like on their wall\nYou know that's so important because it's not only just appointed to the wall is watching their color throughout the day as the sun ones will pass through the room and then every few hours you kind of takes on a movie there for you\nYes the color will change throughout the day absolute from morning 'til evening the color is going to be isn't it looked
