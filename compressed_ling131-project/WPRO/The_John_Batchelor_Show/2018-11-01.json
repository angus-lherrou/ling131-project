Washington Times anticipating the mid term election of twenty Eighteen the part of the election that's not controlled by the New York times and the Washington Post that is the rest of it the Trump supporters Monica a very good evening to you I Begin with the Trump promise\nOf twenty sixteen which was to grow the economy at three percent done\nThe year over year is now free percent says the wall Street Journal\nI mentioned the Trump promise of twenty sixteen that we'll have jobs in all directions we'll get tired of winning we do not have enough workers for all the jobs I mentioned the Trump promised in twenty sixteen\nThat people will go back to shopping again the consumer drives our economy we now have a consumer confidence number reported by the wall Street Journal in these last hours the highest in Eighteen years it's surged in October\nWe also have a stock market in a correction that he has been rosy ever since Donald Trump was elected I Believe he's fulfilled his promise do you believe this translates into some success on election day good evening to you Monica\nHigh get even engage on well I I'm a little reluctant to appoint a historical indicators as any kind of guide for what you might expect next Tuesday in the mid term\nBut I Do think that there's one traditional type that we can look to because Trump is such a unique personality and such a unique president and that is the presidential job approval rating\nAnd how that might affect and an off year election like this one how that might affect candidates have his party down ballot\nOver the last week or so it took it very interesting Donald Trump's chapter approval\nActually over the last two weeks his job approval rating has picked it up to the point where my son has fifty percent job purpose which is a high for his presidency others like Gallup and other pollsters have been sort of in the mid ...\nForties that is very high for Donald Trump\nUm I Know he would prefer a higher number but relatively speaking these are very good numbers for president [laughter]\nAnd I think that is going to translate into support for Republicans around the country whether it's house races or Senate races I call a column coming tomorrow John in the Washington Times about the Trump effect\nOn the terms and this is one of the interesting point that that I make about the president does the president's job performance in terms of meeting all of his accomplishments booming economy tax cuts deregulation exiting the Iran deal a southern border starting the wall and so on\nAnd his job approval numbers going into this election and it is quite quite striking and you're seeing that a rising Republican tide now led by the president is starting to lift maybe not all ships but most of\nThe president's terrific on the campaign trail those rallies are very successful I feed that he's going into Florida I think he has several events in Florida\nA he was he's going back to Montana wherever he's been he's wrong with his base\nThere's the question before we got particular about their house in the Senate Monica\nWill the Trump mode of twenty sixteen turn out in twenty Eighteen many of these were the Democrats or Republicans who voted for Barack Obama are they still engaged do they respond to the economy and the fact that the president fulfilled his promise and\nThe short answer is yes\nThe longer answer is it's a little more complicated in an off year election like this because you don't ever sexy presidential race at the top of the ticket so turnout is always critical\nFor both parties they want to make sure they get as many of their voters out as possible and that's why the efforts by both parties for her to get out the vote efforts and so on data mining all of that is really really critical um\nI think you know there's something else going on here again it's related to Trump and again you'll be able to read about this in my column tomorrow in the Washington Times does Trump is such a unique figure\nThat he is he from the very beginning from June of twenty Fifteen when he announced he was able to establish\nAn emotional bond with the American voters\nNot all of them obviously there are plenty of resistance out there\nBut enough to get reelected across party lines\nRepublicans independents disaffected Democrats to elected him president that emotional bond that these voters have with him because they look to him to deliver the country to deliver better results for them and their families which he is doing\nThey want to give him back up\nThe want to not care about their local congressman or woman they might be fed up with them or they don't like them or their their senator [noise]\nBut I think this is just my gut talking not my head\nBut my God says that these voters who elected Donald Trump are going to come out in droves for this election because they want to protect the\nPresident they don't want him exposed to impeachment or to Nancy Pelosi as speaker or to all of the nonsense investigations that the Democrats would do should they taking control of the house\nI could be wrong about that turned out I could be wrong about the numbers I could be wrong about that motivation but my gut tells me\nThere is a dynamic here that it's not being measured by these polls just like we saw on twenty six to eight\nMonths connect the numbers to nursery blows the memory blows the\nInfamous now for having said the jobs the tax cut in jobs that twenty Seventeen was problems we have breaking news this is to respond them is below sea this is Eric morass in the wall Street Journal or within hours\nAmerican paychecks rose in the past year at the fastest rate in more than a decade showing a tight labor market is paying dividends for more workers' wages and salaries paid to private sector us workers rose three point one percent from a year earlier in the third quarter Labor Department said on once he took\nThat was the strongest year over year again since the second quarter of two thousand and eight\nThe latest data add to this is a quote broader evidence that wage growth has continued trend gradually higher over recent corners\nMonica that's exactly what we've been waiting for to guarantee that the Democrats were wrong to vote against the tax code and Mrs blows is wrong to say it's crumbs it's the fastest rise in a decade\nEverybody knows is Monica the puzzle is the ... stronger the job opportunities you can leave your job and get a better job\nDoes that give them the poll you think it does so why but these political scientists are telling us it's not as a non starter because the Democrats so villain ours Donald Trump people are going to forget why their money in their pocket\n[noise] yeah I I think that analysis is incorrect that people are saying you know are so angry I mean certainly there is a segment of the population that is I agree a trumpet hate his guts and are motivated to vote for Democrats simply out of that [noise]\nI also wish that the Republicans that made the economic messaging more front and center going into next Tuesday\n\nJohn ... this is the John ... days to go\nThe house of representatives according to Nancy Pelosi the minority leader these many years the house of representatives is going democratic what does this mean bill regarding we're McGovern rights main street for the wall Street Journal is a member of the editorial board\nThis is the sequel so in the event that Nancy Pelosi's prediction is accurate what can we expect from a democratic controlled house of representatives bill a very good evening to you I had this detail\nOr listen ... appeared on the Tonight Show very popular run by a man and cold there I Believe who is a comedian but often it's grave when it comes to politics I think that he speaks very poorly of the Republicans is a rare is a fair statement in any event Mrs below the was in the celebrity chair\nSaying quite honestly and I don't quote but everybody will get the sense of it\nThat we need a leader who will bring us together not divide us and the audience applauded and I said Nancy Pelosi\nIf you are a pro if you can sit there and without smiling say that we need somebody to bring us together good evening to bill\nHi John well John you you're you're old enough to remember along with me I'm the super bowl when I'm\nName it's said are not only that the jets for going to win but that he guaranteed it right and everyone thought it was a little cocky look she asked us you know she sort of has to say that to mobilize their base um but I think unfortunately she may be right I mean all the signs point to the Democrats it's possible something develops it's possible that a lot of these\nBreak the other way for Republicans a lot of these toss ups are within the margin of error but it\nIt does look you know with the enthusiasm the Democrats have and then also with the spending\nUm that they have just incredible amounts of money that um um she's likely to be holding the speaker's gavel when when dust clears\nI had because I've been reviewing this that in the first district of Pennsylvania the challenger has has raised Thirteen million dollars and spent eleven compared to the incumbent who raised three and spent two and a half\nIt's like ... ... ... ... and on the money all across the country for the Democrats now he presuming that you can buy an election but that the Democrats will win this because of political science says the party out of power does very well rounded term what can we expect from Nancy Pelosi this take\nWhat I think she's been mostly honest\nUm she says they're going to repeal or try to repeal the tax cutting JOBS Act now I I think that in fact she's going to have a hard time and she thinks even among the Democrats because you know once people get in\nThe immediate thing they start thinking is will I be reelected and are there maybe some Democrats who don't like the tax cuts but er but will\nBlock it putting their name on something\nI'm to raise taxes I don't know\nUm but they're certainly going to try and whether that would get anywhere in the Senate you know again depends on whether Republicans prevail in the Senate um so there might be a lot of sound and fury in the house and I think it will stay me anything that a President Trump wants for example funding for a border wall but\nThere may be a stalemate there may be not much to do I I I hate to say it I actually think Donald Trump might find having\nSomeone even I'm less popular than he is or with lower ... lower approval ratings and he has a leading the party the opposition I'm not sure he he wouldn't enjoy those two years and going into an election where he could run against or below sea Democrats\nThe other likelihood as I understand it is that the Democrats are making promises now joined Adler is set to be the ... the chairman of the Judiciary Committee Adams is set to be the chairman of the house intelligence committee\nThey're making promises right now of investigate investigate investigate right and ... is that as a platform for twenty twenty are they planning on your show choose as a rallying cry\nYou know I Would have said no but look how far they've got they really don't have an agenda here since we're going to not do anything Donald Trump wants to do and if that means I'm not funding the border wall that's what it means if it means a repealing the tax cuts\nThat's what it means and they're writing that pretty far now again they have history on their side usually the party controls the White House takes a beating in the first mid term so they\nThey do have a few advantages there\nBut it's amazing how far they've got with no real message\nYou know in my mind to accept the anti Trump but I I think unfortunately we talked about this before the Republicans have let them get their their their two legacies here one is John McCain's when McCain\nUm killed the GOP effort to repeal Obamacare repeal and replace as Republicans have promised for years the result was Republicans\nOwned the existing health care system with all its flaws and Democrats have been hammering Republicans on this on preexisting conditions on drug prices because no one likes the\nHealthcare system not the conservative like us who want to reform it in market oriented wave and not the people that want singer single payer so it's very unpopular Democrats are now using that against Republicans and of course we said that the tax cuts they haven't promoted the tax cuts I saw a figure today saying that\nIn the Republican ads only about sixteen percent mentioned the tax cuts you know we kind of top vaguely about the economy\nBut no one talks about the connection between those two things and if you can't talk about your signature achievement you're at a disadvantage\nThe three percent year over year growth fact now acknowledged by the wall Street Journal that was a campaign promise the president delivered the demand for jobs the constant we don't have enough workers and that's going to continue into the future consumers are delighted consumer confidence is way up\nTo ... just ending consumer spending is way up and\nWe all know the ... so the puzzle here is that not go to the voting booth next Tuesday\nWe know what I think the ... the ... the irony is I think the problem is that Republicans thought the economy would take care of itself in other words it was so good you didn't really have to sell bad and I think they they didn't anticipate that the Democrats never backed down\nYou know they didn't vote for the tax cuts and they called it a crumbs for the rich Nancy Pelosi we thought we had a gotcha once you dismiss these bonuses pros but she stuck to her guns and she's hitting the Republicans on these\nPolicy issues and the Republicans are hoping\nYou know the caravan or Mrs pillow sees an favorability is going to lead people to keep these key Republican seats\nBuilder gun

said I just heard from some friends\nIn Beijing this morning that that they're looking at a possible stimulus measures at these import export fare next week uh but I don't expect it to be very large\nAndrew you're the author of shadow banking and the rise of capitalism in China or\nHow do the shadow banks react to these weakening numbers are they a factor\nWell that the government in Beijing about six months ago started to strip the power of the shadow bags they had grown from virtually nothing to almost half of all banking a China\nAnd the government was worried about the risk that they were taking which was actually quite a legitimate concern and so they they've traveled back ah there's still a lot of money that's bouncing around the clock controlled by the state\nUm and uh so uh everybody in the entire country is concerned about a default and the collapse of banks like we had in the United states in two thousand seven so the shuttle banks and the former banks were all worried about that so they're kind of a ah they're kind of understand the reasons why the government wants to crack down on this\nDoes that mean that there's a hard it's harder to get access to capital if they shut down the shadow banks I mean the reason they grew is because they were attractive and they were a successful\nThat's right and there was also a way for us to get money out for the stimulus um so yeah I I my ... my joke is that at some point capital will be like water and and the Sahara Desert\nOr people will be running around all trying to get their hands on it and I think that's what the government's playing with now interest rates are slowly going up and defaults are increasing because people don't have the cash that they used to have a garden\nAndy we have these peer

it as it tried to risk the entire financial system they focus much on these ... guys a lot of them are fly by cars\nI'm you know sort of like a ... put out a shingle and start pretending that there

the mainland or is this something people are ready to ride out like a bad storm\nWell I mean how much of Hong Kong's economy depends on the property market and that's much everybody's bigger concern property prices started to slow here which may be connected the mole and people aren't really sure um as far as the banking system and all the jobs here that depend on China yeah they're concerned because if the deals dry out\nUm than their business and basically but remember that if capital flight increases in China it tends to go over the border into Hong Kong even though I was part of China it's kind of a separate a financial area so there could be some benefits if China has problems ironically Gordon\nAndy I'm the renminbi the currency is testing the seven to one dollar um magic limit

I don't think it's going to go past seven at this stage a that's a huge psychological barrier or would show that there could be even more weakening and that will accelerate capital flight\nAnd plus the central bank stepped down in the past week um and spent four billion US dollars supporting the currency I think the first time they've done that since two thousand Seventeen so so far it doesn't

United States navy the United States Navy is\nThe guarantor of the freedom of the sea therefore it is critical to wonder stay on the scale of the challenge I welcome my colleague the under secretary of the United States Navy Thomas mostly you has returned within these this last month\nFrom a venture to a part of the ocean that is that did all look and blue on your mouth but it has important islands that the under secretary visited and questions to be answered\nAbout is the U.S navy to guard these islands because of the always possible encroachment or the the L A navy into the same waters with money and with warship and with ambitions to close them down or at least\nA challenge to the sea lanes is free or\nMr under Secretary Tom a very good evening to you you traveled to a vast landscape um you ended in Guam but I the list I have here from the report is popular in New guinea Vanna to Fiji and the federal state so Macron Asia I Believe you also visited a\nThe capital of the ... and I'm ... I'm sure you went to the marine Memorial Day or for the battle in the second war it collectively Tom what is the challenge what is the mission for the U.S navy in the end what is called Oceana good evening to\nHi John thanks for having me on again appreciate it and uh you accurately captured or the trip or in a couple of words that you're in a word that you mentioned twice which was the word vast and uh [noise]\nFor me that was a sort of my injuring impression of of the trip where we started out in Hawaii a man that was my actually my first time out there to see the Pacific fleet headquarters and or get a little bit of a history lesson on on what happened there\nAnd then we we went from there to to care about ... ah which in and of itself is a island chain of about Eighteen hundred\nNautical miles from tip to tip which makes you wonder how it's possible to govern something like that I'm On there is that an island in that chain that's more than two meters above sea level so you can imagine that the challenge of they have\nWith some of the climate or issues and rising sea rising seas\nUm and then from there we went to pop on your guinea\nAnd they've been a while to Fiji\nA federal judge states of micro in Asia and Guam and then home and uh the amount of\nTime we spend an airplane ... jumping from place to place really gave me a strong perspective about how vast this region is um and how important is Hawaii as you as you know from your geography\nLessons is only one third of the way across the ocean and so everything between Hawaii and that first and second island chain is just the archipelago of a variety of different island nations that I'm\nMost Americans probably don't even think about but many of these nations were critical nations that\nAre we liberated during the course of the Pacific war and so they're strategically located all across this a vast ocean where a significant track a trade\nOr travels through their the fishing or the fisheries that exist there\nHelp feed a large part of the world and so the United States Navy is obviously critical interest in ensuring that those feelings stay open and that uh we have access to those areas and that we have strong relationships and partnerships with uh the governments in those nations\nThe sack the secretary of defense there's a quote that I read about your trip described by the secretary when you look at that and you look at they added on the map they are heavily dependent this is your quote heavily dependent on access to those waters and also on controlling maintenance of these waters for fishing\nThat's the economic zones out there do they talk about feeling vulnerable Tom is that what they have when you visited with them are they saying good God the Navy's finally here\nUm I didn't get that sense uh to be honest with you ...\nWhat I did get was a a lot of questions about where is the United states than um because what we find and all these places is that the the Chinese are being very aggressive in establishing their presence and I you know you mentioned that it was the\nThe the Chinese Navy it's really not so much the Chinese Navy I think they're looking at it as a\nPotential place where the Chinese Navy could have an influence but for the most part it's it's a variety of economic influence or is that are that are occurring on these islands that\nEventually would create places for that the navy to have refueling and other areas of access in case a case a there was a conflict\nAnd if you mean they're going to build parts is that what they're planning to do or by well because that's what they're doing in the horn of Africa now they're doing\nThat yes they are contributing to all kinds of infrastructure projects there um and so some of those are port oriented others are are related to uh just basic things like agricultural centers and I'll give you an example of a and I use is one a lot but there is a\nAnd we went to my current Asia and one of the islands and Mike or an easy on the far side we had a we had a team of CBs twenty four CBs you know we're very proud of them they do great work and they're building a schoolhouse there for a high school I was going to be a vocational school and they're building a very traditional concrete and\nPlywood structured building with a with a corrugated steel roof and next\nRight next door the Chinese are building a big agricultural\nCenter with you know a lot\nOf the scale in terms of what they're doing what we're doing was very stark to me uh to see the difference there\nAnd also we've just recently in that same island pulled the Peace Corps out within the last couple of years now the Peace Corps been I'm In my car in Asia since almost the beginning of the Peace Corps so um I think the question that we were we were saying wars that are\nMost most of these nations want us there um there are accepting of uh the Chinese investment and uh the investments in there and for infrastructure but I think their preference would be to have the United states there a with a little bit more of a of a presence there and I don't think we need to\nMeet them on that scale I think there are ways that we can be helpful to them in terms of technology and other\nA smaller initiatives that or give them a sort of force multiplier is and I'll give you an example in Fiji um the Australian government help define day fusion center there for the ... navy or they're able to see and have a sort of real time understanding of the ships that are coming in and out of their\nTheir fishery zones and they're able to understand which which of those ships are actually registered and legal to fish there and which ones\nAre clearly not and which ones are questionable and that allows them to\nUse the whatever forces they have in terms of patrol boats to go to the places where there might be trouble and that's a that's a modest investment that goes a long way in terms of building goodwill\nBetween Australian ... government which are who are friends there and really also very present it in the region and uh with some of the island nations that don't have that kind of resources to\nTo invest in that type of capability\nThe Trump Administration speaks to the Indo Pacific region no longer just the Pacific and it also speaks of the Claude\nUm organized to India and Japan Australia and the United states and India and Japan Australia and the United states did you see ... did you see the the the places we visit\nLooking to hear from Japan and India and Australia can they joined in this partnership to provide security and freedom\nPossibilities of correcting this with investment policy regulation and legislation does that does that overwhelming Tom right now too many different directions is there one of those we can we can work on right away\n[noise] well I think that uh I think what happens if you only work on one than than the others overwhelm the approach or taken and one of those\nAir you need more people time you'd need any more [laughter] well\nClearly were trying to build the ... you know as you know are trying to build a much bigger navy and um and that's necessary but uh\nI think you know the I think the biggest challenge that we have um is is developing that political consensus and I think you have to have that in order to address and all these multiple fronts that's the difficulty and I think you mentioned that as well um\nThis is a sustained effort or it has to be a sustained effort and that is one of the challenges we have in government um I experienced it last time I was here in government trying to drive a lot of a transformation in the business mission of the department um and you recognize that large organizations only change over extended periods of time or even the biggest\nA corporation the U.S took when they went through their transformation journey\nTen years ago they were you know ten years of sustained effort\nSame CEO and place a catalyst teams all over the organization driving change and it is a it has to be a sustained effort and so hopefully we can get that kind of focus\nBut we have we're all we're all subject to the political ones that were most of the leadership here the senior leadership here a political appointee so we're here for a short amount of time that challenge we have is setting the departments that we're organizing on a path so that those changes can be institutionalized and carried forward\nLet's look at the common sense of this I'm following the stars and stripes reporters um the fact is we depend on foreign manufacturers for some critical components for the U.S navy rocket motors machine tools gyroscope night vision systems\nAlso at the same time we have only one from in the United states according to stars in stride supporting\nA that produces the propeller shop for your chef\nAnd is that something that can be done by just sitting at a table and saying guys we got it we we got us around here we've got to diversify\nWell it is I mean that that is not the only area where we have that kind of on her ability we have the same problem with sand wall castings which is are the critical element for rotary rotary wing gear boxes and we only have one source for that and the entire United States\nWe only have one single source that supplies all the large caliber gun castings a firm orders and texture it's and um we have to figure out a way to drive more competition into that into that system and it's not going to be easy but I think uh [noise]\nUh we I think as you mentioned uh the what what our adversaries are doing are creating a sense of focus in a sense of urgency around us and so we are going to address it\nUp first up finally the word incremental list them and the idea of transforming suddenly I is that a debate at the navy right now what what you can do within that timeframe is that how you think about it\n[noise] well as you know John allowed a lot of the the acquisitions that we make and as you look at our as a Thirty Years' ship building planned the fact that we have a Thirty Years' ship building plan tells you something about\nThe way we think about our ships ah it takes a very very long time to build them\nAnd uh and to to plan for them because the industrial base cannot say that quickly\nUh there's a lot of long lead time material that has to be brought into those and so um there are certain things I there are certain areas where we can make rapid change but others I think there is there is a sort of a combination of ah incrementalism as well as rapid change I think right now where\nWe're at the navy has gone through a variety of inflection points in its history um I I've been sort of tossing around the idea of you know where are we right now in that continue on with you start with you know\nMaybe naval force one point or being there six for it gets you know where we're under sail and cannons and getting close to each other and fighting that way and then\nWe moved to steam power which totally revolutionized the speed at which we could we could move ships and lack of dependency on whether if that's navy to point out one then maybe three point out\nUh after the end during the civil war were armor plaguing and and larger guns move this into the ballot ship air and then the battleship era than as eclipsed by what happened on December seventh Nineteen forty one and the carrier strike group\nA sort of naval force for point out I think everything since then has probably been four dot one Ford or to Ford three right or are we at the point right now where we need to be thinking about what naval force five point oh actually means\nAnd are we prepared a to make that shift away from sort of an incremental approach to a more dramatic shift to something that's going to sustain\nSustain our our maritime superiority into the future and I think those are the types of debates that we are having a maybe not frame that way that's sort of a intellectual construct that I've just\nBeen tossing around with with my staff here but something like that I think is what they're talking about it the war college and in other places about are we really at that inflection point where where we need to think about things a dramatically differently\nFinally Tom a big picture or after your trip to Oceana and I know you're doing an audit oh which we need to know what we what we need to buy for the U.S navy\nUm when when you travel ... urine Annapolis graduate and you've been navy your whole life I understand that but when you travel these days\nTo people talk about the navy as a and vital element that they must have overseas and at home do they understand that the U.S has only as strong as the navy or is that something that has to be taught again\n[noise] um I Will tell you John did I think the people that I visited on this trip and his various nations that are out there in the ocean I'm probably believe it more than people here um\nAnd I think that's because they're they're out there and they recognize the vulnerabilities that they have I think that uh I don't think it's a hard case to make I think when people see the data and understand how much of our of our\nOur economy is dependent upon foreign trade and how much of that trade traveled across the oceans um disruptions to that would be a extremely detrimental to our ... our economy and our society at large so I think there's a general understanding but probably not a specific understanding\nAnd certainly not a visceral understanding that sort of within people's emotions that say yes this is the most important thing that we need to be we need to be focusing on with respect to our national security but um as you said before you know we are facing a challenge is now\nAdversaries now who are much more sophisticated are not going to wait a year that is correct ...\nThomas mode leaves the under secretary of the United States Navy I looked more conversations is the navy goes through the challenge of building the defense industrial base by ... and at the same time dealing

it also will bring gas and and therefore you know it's it's it's a commercial project which which companies will will will benefit from\nThe part of the pipeline exist now I Believe and what they're looking to is to complete the part of the pipeline that will reach Italy does the pipeline exist under it has to cross several countries that have what you'd have to say different different kinds of government\nIt has to cross a breeze and then Albania are those in place to approving of it already are they building already\nWell actually about two thirds of the project is actually a built and and the big question of Italy would have been\nYou know if it if it doesn't reach Italy would it be like you you you you run a marathon and then you know you don't you don't ... you know cross the finish line because essentially unless you actually reach the your you know that\nA major markets in Europe it's very nice to have the pipe going thousands of ... you know a mild but but it's really ... you have to actually meet meet the big market\nAnd I know there's a variety of not only is it really a very important gas market for for Europe um but there's also in security with the uh it's other gas supplier so its main guess suppliers Russia a need we say\nMore round but also a lot of its gas comes from um north North Africa I'm and I'm I'm quite concerned with you know a lady lit Libya failed state a frequent terrorist attacks in Algeria\nUm Europe needs more gas and southern Europe but it you know to prepare for a you know potential instability in North Africa that could bring a lot of that gas that is dependent on off of flying so it's not just risk from Russia but risk from North Africa as well\nAnd grease it's OK there is no problem in Greece to Scott a government that is a vulnerable\nYou know I mean I think again it was kind of an interesting when we when we\nObserve rushed the Russian part of the ... that's the part I'm meeting vulnerable\nYes so well I you know I think I think every ... this pipeline goes start starts in ...\nJohn goes through Georgia and turkey to Greece Albanian and and Italy every point and the way there's vulnerability to to you know to Russia a of of course um\nUm but I think what kind of interesting in terms of the ... the public policy level that it's the hardest place to build the infrastructure is actually in Europe itself meaning that there was the you know the most uh disagreements and and ah you know attempt to to ah ...\nYou know change that you know no sanctity of contracts attention you know tempted change the agreements on his you know so it's kind of interesting I think we we face as in the United states as well or you know both Republicans and Democrats everyone agrees we need to fix infrastructure but getting that right ah\nIn a highly democratic environment where every you know every little house every little street can't think of the big public interest but only how it affects its own real estate

is the John ... show I welcome Richard ... he's a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution rotting most recently in defining ideas he teaches law at NYU in the University of Chicago we turned our attention\nShort of the mid term election I'm twenty eight teams to the concept bandied about often on campaign trail democratic socialism no longer progressive is certainly no longer liberalism\nDemocratic socialism there some outspoken voices Bernie Sanders the presidential candidate from Vermont\nSpeaks often of it and Richard has an essay asking what is it and what does it mean democratic socialism\nRichard a very good evening to you your essay reminded me that there was a candidate for the governorship gubernatorial race in Florida his name is Andrew Gillum he is now the mayor of Tallahassee he until twenty Seventeen\nLed a group that also uh celebrate democratic socialism and I read from their mission statement because it reminded me very much\nOf what you're dealing with when you come across young adults who want to know what happened with socialism and the twentieth century isn't it a good idea\nThat we all share writes this group led by Andrew Gillum on their website until he resigned this is the segment called economic justice\nQuote we know that ... predatory capitalism is a threat to the safety wellbeing and survival of our communities in our planet as wages stagnate an intergenerational wealth is concentrated in the hands of the few pathways\nOpportunity are becoming less and less excess accessible to the rest of us\nWe are uniquely aware of the importance of challenging our system of predatory capitalism and working towards a set of institutional arrangements which allow us to access the necessities of life from housing food and substance and health care I'll end there Richard because I think I've surrounded the story\nDemocratic socialism it is a dreamy utopian presentation of something without history a very good evening to you\nWell yes I mean let's just start from the beginning about the system is being quote unquote predatory a predatory capitalism and going down there is actually a technical a\nTourist or anti trust violations called predation which has been urged by many and what this predation ... stuff it consists of situations where vendors sell goods that lower prices and higher quality than their rivals and the ... will come to court and saying this is an unfair form of competition and it ought to be suppressed a\nEverybody who makes those kinds of claims essentially is trying to keep a price floor\nAt the cost of consumers in order to help themselves as inefficient competitors and if you don't allow these actions to take place what will happen is that the in Syria competitors we the exit the market will become superior if you do allow it to take place it means that the new entrance will not be able to gain a foothold\nAnd so the stagnant economy will come because you quote unquote stopped the predators what's missing in this analysis of predation under these circumstances really quite simple\nConsumer welfare also matters and when you raise prices and what you lower\nOr access to goods what you do you make the life of ordinary people a little bit more precarious than all otherwise meet\nAnd so what is the gums talking about is how is this going to affect consumers would you have to realize is that by a protecting one set of competitors you make the life of consumers more precarious that also increases the likelihood\nOf disease because you have less food and it decreases the opportunity for employment because there are fewer jobs going around as the old from stagnate with some kind of government protects\nHe talks about the problem with what you're supposed to do about the health of the planet and so forth and if he thinks that what capitalism means is that anytime you create a form of pollution or you are going to protected against liability he doesn't understand that along with freedom of contract goes to the development of the system is tort law\nWhich is designed to protect against a wide range of aggression is\nThe most obvious so these are kind of killing and murder and theft and robbery and rape about nuisances whereby you spill pollution on private property or on public lands in waters has always been regarded as a kind of a wrong for which the appropriate remedy\nIs human joined it um if you have time and you require damages to be paid if you don't have some mix the two if the situation turns out to be more complicated\nSo a capitalist system has no particularly used for somebody who thinks that the way to protect private property for yourself\nIs to destroy private property of somebody else and the mood that you've always following these cases is that you use an anti nuisance law because you must take into account the last set the nuisance inflicts upon somebody else and that\nTurns out to be a social loss not just a profit last so competition is a positive some game a tort creation including nuisances a negative some game the\nTraditional capitalists theory understands that Mr Gillum clearly does now\nThey're trying to figure out whether or not one sister another is going to work for the long term benefit of the community overall output\nHas to be critical so it would take a place like Venezuela and it turns out that you so destroyed the means of production that people fleeing the company there's open starvation and the latest report so of course of rampant disease that takes place which always happens when\nPeople crowded together under nourished in various kinds of location of the Democratic socialist cannot solve the problem of coordination\nThe way in which markets can they don't believe in prices and what they do is they assume that somebody who knows so little about the operation of an economic system like this a government in government of toil candidate in Florida is a term rather miraculously competent to run a system that he doesn't understand\nAnd the greatest aside from the ... tradition\nIs that prices give you information about good so worth without having to do detailed inquiries as to whether the people think do or want it makes it an exchange system rather than an administrative system it's more subtle it's more responsive and in the end it works better for everybody the\nPresident's council of economic advisors Richard has that linked to the report has issued the opportunity costs of socialism Richard is giving the overview very quickly we're going to plunge into this\nBecause democratic socialism does not make common sense period\nHowever it's important to pull it apart on the basis of what it believes is in his star called precedent\nThat would be the nineteenth century and the language of Carl Marx as inherited by the man who you know we call Lenin or the definitions Richard applies in his defining ideas beside never looked at them as closely as I did and Richard definition because they don't make any sense on the one hand we have\nA definition of socialism that includes these words regulated by the committee as a whole what the heck is that I asked myself the other definition we have is\nCollective ownership and the means of production what the heck is that I asked myself and then the updated version of this is from the twenty first century by those who call themselves democratic socialism Megan Megan days Richard citation pooling societies resources to meet people basic needs what the heck does that mean\nI think Richard the language here is so inexact\nDumbfounded because you know it doesn't have history and when we offer examples you just did with Venezuela we can talk about you but we can certainly talk about what happened to Russia\nWhen we offer historical examples in which they shuffle aside and say now now", "show_name": "The John Batchelor Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day":
