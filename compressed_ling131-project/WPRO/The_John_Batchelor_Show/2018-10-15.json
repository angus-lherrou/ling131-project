um but uh the sun ended up playing out I'm\nGood for us where the ... final opportunity and and we made it so it's great you know Josh call the great game regret execution and the drive by a lot of different people or so\nBut we we work on that stuff every week both ways if they had if we had a new touchdown new field goal so forth so I tried to be prepared\nFor that\n... ... ... their team speed was obviously a challenge and he'll yeah yeah hell yeah okay gotcha yeah\nA A N Patrick I'm his ... his ability to to extend plays a you know competing against him in in real time is it what was\nYeah if it you know he did that he made some way nights on 'em\nBut hills as such I suppose player um obviously we knew that going in and they saw the first time\nThat could\nBuild in a game that features so much production through the air and especially a lot of long balls Tom touched on really a critical play on that final drive the third in one hand off to Sony in as good a game as he had\nUp to that point what did that play demonstrate about his evolution at or maturity is running back as ... pointed out had he stayed high probably wouldn't have gotten the first down but he was able to fit through and pick up that it was only runs\nOr not he's picked up a lot of tough yards for some of those big round of sitcoms touchdown run was a big Ron not the guy I think you're going to get that from but he did a great job of\nGetting a ball in the end zone there and [noise] um [noise] so we didn't have to kick field and I'm thirty five so yeah I mean there's a lot of good runs in the game but you know that sometimes you're getting comes down to a yard being able to get it or or defend us and um [noise]\nThose enough space in Arizona made a good good Rhonda to pick it up so\nYou know that last year that was really one of the big differences in the game for foreign sure your jaw sensibly so [noise]\nYou know we made a big big emphasis on that we're able to get on the one yard line of all the goal line and the third one so those those are the situations and the the turnover obviously hurt us both you know they're not putting the game was\nStill\nCoach um historically ... than to well against ya and in the ... the trend was continuing second half Kansas ... one points can you attribute to anything in particular as to why they often see about what was so much great in the second half the Kansas or their explosive to admit it a good job\nOf\nA bill you guys did a nice job limited hill in the first and second happy ended up finishing with seven catches for a hundred and twenty six charging three touchdowns what did they do differently in the second half the getting more involved\nAnd unless you're going to get a lot of it on a scramble for so um [noise] I mean look I got a lot of good players a\nLot of now there's a lot of production other all across the field on both teams\n\nTo just start talking about ... pick their late in the first half and how big was\nIt was a big play for us um thoughts us for a drunk clicked those big solves force in the writer service [noise]\nPlease sex but made fourteen points so those are those are huge place um [noise] so yeah I thought I read her\nDefense really you know save us there in the first essay sort of points um [noise] we're unable to do that in the southern half as much but yeah so that that was a big thick and thin suicide tower so set us up a offensively on a five year old line or whatever it was so stupid close force\nMissed a couple of other chances where her hands on some other officers couple other throws a a you know we're pretty well defended but it was a great throwing very catch beat the coverage so\n\nBill I'm In our sports conversations we kind of always loved the next big thing you know and and the homes is one of these young rising superstars but what do you think you know Tom said can I have not maybe holding that off a little bit that it's kind of you know the way she played tonight\nThere was a lot of the pillars in the field tonight I mean it's a good teams and they compete both competed very arcane down to the final play the game there's a lot of good football players out there in both sizable\n\nHey bill just in terms of when the game is changing that quickly and the gay marriage when the time management my clock management and a number of decisions that have to be made is which is a unique game in that respect just in terms of\nA lot was happening in a short period of time and managing time out all the different things that go into managing maybe the last seven or eight minutes\nI mean like et cetera games different so it's getting a phone dynamics and\nThe team you're playing situations and they're all a little\nBit different so sometimes I fall into a general category sometimes they fall a little bit outside or just have to try to react to do that she can\nNow as you know is a more a day of cancer survivor a lot of the players is Scott how inspirational to me with them what do you have to say for the platform at the end I found the patriots are able to give survivor it's like that's\nSome good they're part of it and and um [noise]\nYou know some of our players are great ... of our team and uh do many things for\n'em I like having cancer patients but their families and I know that as well so that's always been a problem um something that our team organization I'm Robert his family and our team coaches involvement supportive of proud of and so probably for the ...\nSix thirty WBAL rose dot com\nWhite in the back of\n[laughter] I can\nSee how many times I think back during the long ball\nGod tells\nMe Eighteen yard line [noise] looks ... artist\nFor the way it forty Allen writing down\nTurn toward God he's not a card to another place like\n\n[noise]\nThe drive of the game is ... by safety insurance providing comprehensive coverage for your family a small business ask your independent agents\nOf safety that drive of the game being the patriots finals arrived at knife seven sixty five yards and it feels older when it for twenty yards ... foot didn't write down the middle\n... it's just the way in forty three forty the final score\nIn Fox for over a there was a great field goal kicking from even got scouts decent I thought there appear to be some issues on kickoffs including one that I Can't figure out if he\nMissed the kick which was my initial thought on it I think it was a squeeze on purpose for it was a squid that went horribly wrong I I don't know I I don't understand it I watched it in real time and then I watched it twice on replay and I still don't know exactly if it was a swift kick or not I I Hope someone\nMy understanding is going to ask him my only still in the building I I mean I think that it is from everything that I've read about it since ... at the time it was like oh he just loved it but no I think that that was on purpose and maybe they just didn't executed correctly either way that was who you can't do that to a team like send you that this\nKind of off and no you can't no you definitely cannot do that and I think that I'm just in general you got to kick it out of the back of the end zone for debt given them an opportunity to have any sort of big time return that's what I Would say about this game tonight\nBack to that audio do we just played up that last Dr ... what stones really like I Wonder there's really not too many teams in this league and I think would\nBe that bold that you have a lot as a sixteen year old and a white and it's thirty nine for grants to get them down to the ten like that was they weren't screwing around like that I think they're actually trying to get a touch of the time and I tell you when I say go you know started going to solve okay you know we're going to sit on this we're gonna you know we're inside the tent here we're going to get the easy field goal yeah\nWe're going to win this damn thing but uh it was a hell of a finish the real you know what I think the balls is more than I was thirty one ... catch\nOh the guy on the guideline yeah that was crazy third one is the New England\nThirty four yard line and Brady hits a connection with Hogan for forty two yard pick out there was a flag in the eye on the play but Hogan made the catch anyway a welcome back resulting glad you can make it back for weeks six I'm great catch by him great play and that to me was just having some real guts to do that on third\nOne yeah and I know that I'm not alone in feeling you know that maybe it's something that's been up between him and radio little didn't look like he was looking on his way I think even if it might have been the third quarter\nThey when they set up for a field goal Hogan was wide open in the end zone it's again with this and I know he finishes for for tonight and end up having a big second half but it just I don't know it uh it eases my mind oh no you're right\nThough second half this patriotism ... came out of the locker room and they were black man yeah support as citizens by Brady including what you just mentioned there were issues out of the gate and that's I can happen this often yeah\nBut as with the way the Hogan finished and everybody was looking at his way at least it makes me think like OK he's not being phased out or whatever the hell might be going on here um maybe he's just\nA yeah I I don't know what it was because it did look like [laughter] like that when they come into the locker room in for most of the third quarter\nMan I Can't stop watching this time retail touchdown drawn harm it did not take a great NGO on and now he did not after the catch was made is harming in recorded chasing them down on the sideline ah and then a fan through a beer on\nYeah not a good look no hold on a good look terrible and I'm not\nTrying to tell you the diary kills up a good guy because he's not but that doesn't that doesn't mean you should throw it to be around and everybody look bad when you do that garbage\nI was just doing his job but I Know look ... believe me I Know we get emotional when I was a ... you know the the most of the fourth quarter ear and splits bill slamming the table and dropping bombs in public but you know for us and other people\nKnow six one Seventy seven seven nine zero Ninety eight five Eric's in Connecticut tonight Eric\n... a a great game today you know that was a good team I really hope we don't see them again but my biggest question is what is dollar check thing here on special teams today um there was no reason for the square pick at all that led to a field goal\nAnd nonetheless they're kicking it to us on the one every possession\nEverytime Kansas City came down to ... we had to kick or every time we ... we had to kick till he kicked it so why kick it ends up there was a touchdown result to that point the game shows have been that close hope we don't see that to him again they gotta most employers are ... he needs to step up until I got\nOkay very good data majorities definitely in the crosshairs we're ah patriots fans tonight\nToo bad we form it's been too bad we are I don't think he was that good in that in the Annapolis game you know he was getting exposed and was a was a ... right beside him you know he ended up having a big game for indie you know feels like now two weeks ago when tonight again the recording like okay good first half of them a second my God\nCan porch looking confused miscommunication I don't know what's going on\nI Would just say this though this team Kansas City has done this everybody for the most part yeah I mean this is a good team a team that you knew you were going to have a hard time competing against I mean when you look at that take a nap all I can think about in the final minutes was if the patriots lose this game I'm going to be disappointed that they were better run off into the second\nOut I don't know I Would set I Will be with the defense I think you are out match against Kansas city's often\nI think there is far more talent on Kansas city's off and then you have on your defense and it's just you know apple is that the thing is though and I think it's jarring for was for me they're better than you but that's okay it's it shakes he won't be ... that they strike so fast I mean the law is especially in the hills down to tie to forty bank or well oh my God like you you think\nThat okay how they're gonna figure this out with three and change they're going to try to think and dumped on ears are going to be more Karimov no bank one that just for Seventy five yard strike the hell we get a tie game and that was like them to be the third already like hills ability right now is the receiver is better than ... as a safety ... he's been in the league for what it\nHow many years now and I mean yeah\nGo ahead I'm Sorry that that there is no shame in that yeah so if you can do about sorry there's not so bad angles\nYou know they there was there were some times and they looked like he just looked last summer was there a miscommunication miscommunication whether it was him with arming or someone else and the secondary yeah you know of Aurora game\nAgainst buffalo I might I might get pissed off really I'd be ripping guy tonight but it's not it's Kansas City this is the other good team in the AFC yeah and the patriots I think that I'd had far more to gain in winning that Kansas City did in winning because now you've got I think two teams that have as as we go on and the schedule and we're now in the middle of October\nHave established themselves as the two teams to beat in the AFC Jacksonville fell apart today against Dallas they're going in the wrong direction patriots are clearly going in the right direction tonight they get to win over the five into undefeated cheats there you have it you've got your two big time contenders in the AFC everybody's everybody's looking up at the patriots and she's now yeah\nAnd it was obviously an enormous game in regard to the ceiling and the conference like you're getting that and they lose those were possibly talking about this team playing on wildcard weekend and now it feels like orders minister restored and the AFC and there's other teams that\nFeel like they might be a little bit frisky you know the ... the charges of kind of figure things up and therefore into this ravens team has been you know pretty good defensively eleven sex on markets Mariel today so you know I think there's going to be some teams that might be a little bit
