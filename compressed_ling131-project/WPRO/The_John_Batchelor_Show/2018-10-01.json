needed a break to be able to drive your he isn't it true that you will not give us his nose you gave the wars you drew you belonged yourself for ... most of your life\nIsn't it true not one single witness not know boy you said and the guy who came from you you're there you go up and who\nIsn't it true that you said that in two thousand twelve you finally awaken and wits your psychiatrist because you were redoing your house and that renovation about the security door is what made bring back memories of this attempted rape\nExcept there's a problem we checked your records and you built the house you did the renovation of two thousand eight not two thousand twelve you're a liar they could've said are you a democratic operative how many Democrats did you speak to connect you with the top Democrat lawyers and George George lawyers\nTo get involved in this case they could've after a thousand questions they could've after ... you will they did ask her who paid for your lie detector tests and I don't know what do you mean you don't know where's the follow up question everyone knows ... why would someone do it for free the whole thing is ridiculous\nThey could've after about a thousand issues like in two thousand twelve when you claim out of the blue you enter repressed memory of rape\nIsn't it true that in two thousand twelve Mitt Romney named\nThree potential people it'd be a Supreme Court nominees and one of them was Brett Kavanaugh is that how you came to know Brett Kavanaugh and isn't it true that Planned Parenthood two thousand twelve took out ads in newspapers all over the country that said roe versus Wade make believe it was just overturned and they showed the pictures of the night Supreme Court justice and they replaced Ginsburg faced\nWith Brett Kavanaugh and they said this is going to be Mitt Romney's Supreme Court nominee overturns roe versus Wade is that how you got to know his name have you decided to become a heroin or the left by making up a story I mean there's a thousand things they could have said is it true your father and CIA is it\nTrue your grandfather was CIA [laughter] it's a true your brother was working for a law firm that found and GPS fusion is that possible and you're not a democratic operative where all those questions\nHow down at the true the bread Kevin O's mother Marilyn said John trial judge Robert bonded over the foreclosure with your parents who do you know and I\nAlways get me on that one 'cause they claim it was never quite for closed minded they got the house back\nSo why she was a young girl she was standing in a in a courtroom singer parents being questioned by a judge\nThe judge and incredible power over the future of her family's life had even that will eventually they tend to lose out that's my understanding they did not lose the house\nAnd the judge actually in the end kind of root for them it doesn't matter you may have developed a deep seated hatred for that judge and found out that that judge his son is going to be Supreme Court nominee there's a thousand\nThings you could say that CIA one is amazing that's not a conspiracy theory or dad CIA at her grandfather CIA and her brother is with a company with a law firm founded fusion GPS on all things considered\nThis and other deep state fraud conspiracy there's no other way about it there's no coincidence any of this stuff but having said all that listen let's forget all that for\nHim it forget it forget he gave\nThe most beautiful opening statement I've ever heard in my life I cried five times all my friends cried I've spoken to fifty or more women on my radio show my TV show and letters to me over the last three days all sit they cry because they've got sons\nAnd they can't believe that there is some was crucified like this I Believe America's I'm Brett Kavanaugh outside and I believe any poll you see that says ... says otherwise is another democratic ... job another lie another over sampling of Democrats\nI got a hundred letters today my column in the Vegas newspaper which was featured at real clear politics as one of the most important columns in America today over a hundred letters Ninety five percent of them were pro I Love your your great way what you said about ... and and I'm with ya and five of them were liberals\nAnd all five of them in one way or another basically told me I Hope you get murdered or ... I Hope someone comes in murders you or one of them had a great line they said I Hope there's a woman in your house and shrimp tonight the plunge didn't injure at his house\nAnd mentally disturbed left is all they know how to do is talk about murdering people disagree with and then they call that's crazy I mean you're just dealing with sick\nPeople who do anything and say anything because they believe outlaw solid Lenski that the ends justify the means and that's why this Christine Fort came forward and that's why the woman came forward and that's why the ... charge gang rape came forward and the next\nFive women you hear about this week are all going to be liberal women wear pink vagina hats in March and anti Trump rallies who think they are saving the world by coming forward in line it's as\nSimple as that this guy is innocent he's a boy scout Jimmy Stewart is an easy Andy Griffith and made very are empty he's a fine man at what they did as a character assassination and they're sick people there's something wrong with all of them Democrats have men bill there's nothing else you could say\nWe are target number one white straight Republican men are the target of the Democratic party simple\nUglier ... other provable back in June of twenty sixteen Trump Luke twenty five judges that would be on his list\nFrom what you would pick one of those twenty five million Supreme Court you might recall June July August that was a big deal with twenty sixteen she said that because I'm Kevin O's name was on the Trump blitz during the campaign not also triggered some thought she had to come forward and do whatever\nIn reality ... Kevin O's name did not hit the Trump blimp until November twenty seven dean more than one year after the election his name was known in the listener to react to December twenty scene but the media done boy that out either\nYeah listen the best case I think of all of those out of all I mean they're all the name but the best one is that Dianne Feinstein knew about this in July\nIf this was real how can any once it gets real when they interviewed him one on one face to face and never mentioned that there's a woman claiming you attempted to rape or\nThey have it for the last days to see first if they might be able to beat him some other way and then this is going to be their last chance Hail Mary to try to destroy and let's just go ahead and read them and they're using the same deal they used\nAgainst Clarence Thomas told the the exact same playbook hit the same playbook they used against judge Roy Moore I mean I don't know anything about Roy Moore bill I really don't and I thought his answers were kind of strange\nAnd invasive and I wasn't quite sure whether I should support him\nBut in the end I came down on the idea that this was forty years ago and a bunch of women were making up stories none of which could be prove none of which had evidence and none of which had witnesses you cannot allow a man to be defeated based on that and they decided to work with judge Roy Moore\n\nSo for service has been guiding principle that drives Army National guard soldiers to be always ready whenever disaster strikes every Army National guard members serves not only to protect the nation but also their local community so they each have a stake in the security and well being of the neighborhoods where they live in\nThe hour your next door neighbor and your colleagues in school offices in factories since the early days of our republic the Army National guard has continued its timeless commitment guaranteed peace and security for all Americans are proud legacy\nWhich has been nearly four centuries via guard soldiers stand ready to serve an all time for family for community for country selfless service it's what inspires the men and women be Army National guard to be part of something greater themselves to learn more\nLog on to the national guard dot com or contract an Army National guard recruiter in your area sponsored by the Rhode Island Army National guard feared by the Rhode Island broadcasters association\nAt this station ...

I Want to tell you what troubles me greatly about Thursday\nAnd then I Want to get your perspective and I I kind of look towards Fox News often as a place I can go to ... conservative commentary and things of that character and ah after ah the doctor forwarded testified the the son of Mike Wallace Chris Wallace said\nForge testimony is extremely emotional extremely wrong extremely credible no uh no into listener delivery delivery of those words and talk about the soul to the impact it at our life and not have your ... or this was a disaster for the Republicans so started Chris Wallace Thursday Afternoon\nJudge ended up ... generally I respect that I think Dr Ford is exceptionally credible Karl Rove the great political theorist that forward as a credible unbelievable so one when I heard those commentaries I thought we were done\nAnd then I of course watch Brett Kavanaugh's testimony and they're still in this the Democrats show toward him Thursday Afternoon and everything flip completely but but when you have Chris Wallace\nAnd you have an Android Apollo ... and Karl Rove saying that a woman is credible\nWho provide as witness names that turned out not to be witnesses at all\nWhen you have ah Christine Ford straight up lying about her in capability of flying which you flew everywhere but every one of the witnesses re future story has no memory of the gathering and the woman who wants a anonymity to testify\nTurn down the opportunity to be questioned in private then we find out her lawyers never told her she had that opportunity at all\nSo every time I Try to test her credibility making bars it turns out to be great grossly lacking so when conservative commentator said she's believable she's credible and clearly she isn't have we completely lost our way\n[laughter] I think my ... to Karl Rove yeah completely lost our way because you went to one telling us that Donald Trump never had a chance of winning the people can see through it I think most people that I was talking to your testimony that the women and men I\nFound Brett Kavanaugh people even though there was such a notion from a falsely accused innocent\nMan who in the in the court of public opinion and they are they going up to this oh unquote hearing I yes life with completely turned upside down his wife with getting death threats\nAnd his career with cooking the entirely sabotage and destroyed as well as his reputation and here we have Christine horn and I do believe that something happened to her she obviously has been in therapy for that age uh she said herself she has two front doors\nYou know anybody that has to car door bell no there's no snow\nSo obviously she had this you\nKnow it just because she says something happened doesn't happen and we have plenty of examples\nThat or just because she says Brett Kavanaugh outrage or maybe not but all the evidence that she adds up are all start being out in\n... in fact if you presented us with a quarter of all in which the so called victim provides for names Brett Kavanaugh mark judge PJ Smith labeling Kaiser including her best girlfriend legal in God's or\nWho would have no motivation to honor allied all who said I don't even know Brett Kavanaugh\nAll of them said the fed didn't happen including mark judge you wrote on the floor supposedly with the ... with Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Ford he said it did not go get discount marked judging okay what about PJ Smith was simply a classmate\nWho said these events never took place when Christie ports said they did in wheeling ... her best girlfriend that they didn't happen but she also said I believer why believer but they didn't have\nAnd I don't know I don't know how that works at all and then you have are saying that well I I was flabbergasted when Trump running for the president being twenty sixteen what's the name of bread cabin on the Supreme\nCourt list fact the matter is he didn't put his name on the list when he was running it didn't have the November twenty Seventeen so how could you be frightened during the campaign about bread Kevin I'll getting the Supreme Court one of his name one on the list at all\nAnd how can she be believable to those are like you just mentioned Chris Wallace Karl Rove and the pilots on up I don't know because\nI ... exactly what were they watching and hear like you said when I had a sexual harassment case it fell short of being an assault case however I had the burden of\nProof it was my responsibility or order for a present the evidence I had to be cross examined I had to beat the post let me tell you something I wasn't given won't lawyers from the defensive side that treated me with kid gloves no okay it was a very uncomfortable hearing solved it talks about equal rights and gender equality what do you know what\nI was treated not as a woman that as a mad\nAs a person bringing bringing forward charges against another person so to watch that lawyer that the Republicans hired\nTreat her as though she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily poll cold and the many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly in that we find out she was all over the world ah and also just the holes in her story said thank thank God for people thank God for Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd thank God for Lindsey Graham because because Brecht without Brett Kavanaugh or Lindsey Graham's defense there was no other Republican up there will know than Brett Kavanaugh\nNo in fact judge you know Jeff Flake hiding out in an elevator as you get to Ted Cruz type assault\nOr from some screaming woman who says look me in the ... I would've said lady\nI'm On your side I'm not in favor of sexual assault we're trying to find out the truth you know I mean do you believe every woman who said she was sexually assaulted if that's the case the\n... the Duke lacrosse team would all be locked up and they use UVA Rolling Stone story never would have happened about ten to twenty percent of these stories are dishes eighty Ninety percent of legitimate", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The John Batchelor Show", "city": "Providence", "day": "01"}
