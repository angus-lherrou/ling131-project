calling us at aged aid money pit\nWell if you're tired of that plastic water bottle going out with your recycling or worse in the trash every week a whole house water filter might be a better option for you\nKnow that's right a whole house you'd filters the water at the main just as it comes to the house bringing you Chris clean water from every tax in your home to learn more we turn now to this old house plumbing and heating expert Richard ... through we welcome Richard him now Americans sure having a version to tap water but filter it\nHas to be better and less expensive than buying bottles or they did it go to install these shelters will\nIt really depends I mean you have to think about attacking water filtration in steps if it's a whole house you need a large unit that's going to handle\nAll the water's coming through and in that case you're going to be going after the really visible impurities dirt and rushed okay um when you think about the level of water you're going to consume you have to the local you have to think about a filter that's going to sit on the kitchen sink to give you clean beautiful water for both cooking and for your ice make\nWas true because if you put it at the main me not only are you filtering your drinking water but it's ... or ... yeah\nYeah so it's you really have to do it in steps you know we're a there's a whole industry it's an industry that's growing because people are more and more worried about the quality of the water what happens if the bad guys touched the water you know just if they want to have some level of security in in their house\nMhm so how do you go about choosing one and then getting installed\nWell I think it's a a dirt and rush filter is what you think about it the least case of the water main coming in and I think that's going to be a function of local water quality I mean there's so many parts of this country the water is beautiful I mean we take for granted in this country was writers as good as it is\nSo you may not need that but if you had an old rusty main that ten year old town you know or you had a a galvanized a water main coming in and that was going to give you a lot of rushed you know you're not and you can't change that new Maine to new Maine you might want to have it\nRush filtered but what about a filter that goes actually at the top I've seen a wide variety of these types of filters sometimes you see the ones that\nWe want to wear the arid or we'd go get other times you see them to be large and fit I'm inside the cabinet what's the best way to approach that\nWell I think this to all the ones that you spoke about you know the ones that go on to the end of the U.S her kitchen ... they will usually includes something called ... she graduated activated carbon\nAnd want to go through this carbon and it cleans it up as it comes through and so that's the least case which you would put on the kitchen sink the either the little ones you see above the sink or the these could be the ones that sit down the canister underneath on your cold water feed\nThe other thing that people will put in is a thing called an arrow reverse osmosis now that is a unit which will bring water through a membrane with high pressure it'll push\nThrough this membrane so only the clean water gets through the membrane and the west pressed of the water\nYou don't push through this membrane the clean water and the rest of the water will discharge to a drain so it's a lot more elaborate to install on that you not only have a supply but you have a drain and people will complain that either wasting some water okay but the water level is clean and pure it's almost ...\nYou know when it comes to a changing filters because the amount of time between Celtic change it's really very big type of cleaning second you have in where it's located\nIn well it's a function of water quality again I mean you know ... years ago we we had this filter that was so good that it would clog up all the time people hated it but the water was perfectly clean because it was taken every bit out of it\nSo it's this is this balance point between taken out the important stuff but not having to be that you have to change it every month or every every two weeks\nYou know what it is important to change it when it needs to be changed because I remember in the Twenty years it's been as a home inspector I'd seen filters that folks put in with great intentions and then never touched it again for two years and in fact if you do that I guess it could become unsafe I think it also becomes almost something

Trump for loving Jews is now Trump is being attacked by the mainstream media in Washington Post for somehow causing directly or indirectly the murder of Jews when Trump is the best friend\nThe Jewish people I've ever had\nA few hours ago Sarah Sanders put out a choice presidential press secretary quote\nIs there any tragedy the Washington Post were not exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump\nIs an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel so oh one headline Saturday yesterday in the Washington Post said bomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump to put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans\nSo that the president's being tried to assassination attempts and the murder of Jews\nNot by some far left wing website is filled with hate but by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post\nThat are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they're not in fact on the day that CNN received\nThe photo bomb in the mail from ...\nThe New York times ran a progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself assassinating President Trump with Russian help\nIt's unbelievable on that day and in fact\nCNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know was a co sponsor of the play in Washington park that simulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare is Julius Caesar\nThey had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and their performance\nAnd uh one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN\nNow can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent company of Fox News had a play in Central Park that simulated this stabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama I Want to know\nThe media reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor see Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar that had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump being stabbed to death\nIn fact after James Hodgkinson attempt to the masses assassination of Republican members of Congress resulting in the motor wounds ...\nThe Washington Post the next day ran\nA story about stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio even though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate of a Bernie Sanders and also posted many complimentary things about Rachel Maddow\nSo instead of focusing on the facts Hodgkinson actually traveling hundreds of miles to the Capitol take the leadership of the house of representatives and it was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter or frequent viewer of MSNBC\nThe Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by right wing talk radio over the last several weeks\nMuch like the ah the photo bomb sent to about fourteen people there have been at least twenty examples\nOf left wing or sending envelopes filled with white powder for many many Republicans in fact all Republicans people like sex or a defense James Mattis the president himself the vice president all the adult children of a President Trump have received in the mail\nEnvelopes containing white powder simulating rice and in fact the the the rice in like substance was sent to the home\nOf Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh so all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it because all the news that fits they print\nAnd if that doesn't fit and then they don't print it if\nThere was a political violence committed by James Hodgkinson\nOf Illinois they blame conservative right wing talk radio\nOf course we know about Ted Cruz an IT cruise chased out of restaurants and also when a Senator McConnell was having dinner and a low of a restaurant a Democrat\nGrabbed his food and threw it in the street other diners came to the assistance of Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio ... and his wife who's in the cabinet\nAnd the media\nDoesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one CNN anchor birth Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised Republicans for using the quote an word\nOne other example whenever a white nationalist they got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street progressive activist cover the words they expressed as violence\nBut win\nLargely violent leftist from in ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all\nAnd so this is a long history\nOf radical leftist\nAnd some on the right committing acts of violence that is covered completely differently by the objective mainstream media the worst in my opinion it's Time Warner the parent company of CNN providing money to sponsor a Shakespeare play Julius Caesar\nWhen the main actors dressed up his trumpet he stabbed to death and people apply\nIn fact when Louis ... Louis Farrakhan the left wing nation of Islam began the anti Semite\nSettled a large rally that Jews are termites and thousands in attendance applauded and cheered calling juice termites that is the same person Louis Farrakhan\nWhere President Bill Clinton and Brock Hussein Obama stood next to had pictures taken with\nAt the funeral of Aretha Franklin and in fact a Obama had the political sense to know when he ran for the presidency and overweight not to allow the public to know that he was a friend of Louis Farrakhan they ran around together in Chicago\nAnd that that's the classic anti Semite that the media completely ignored the relationship between Farrah Khan and Obama because it was bad politically so this whole thing disgust me\nI Hope soon very soon\nBut a few hours is killed either a by lethal injection heading electric chair shooting whatever it takes powers has got to go the way it Timothy McVeigh for violence and Bowers\nWas a Trump hater but the Washington Post has somehow implicitly tied Trump to the murder\nOf God's loving eleven Jews yesterday morning in Pittsburgh\nThe whole thing is disgusting when you get your reaction plus we're going to have later on David Wray affair to talk about what's happening on the southern border is anyone thought about the public health crisis caused\nBy thousands of immigrants without vaccinations flooding into the southern border with type ... may souls who cough aids fiery or diarrhea gonorrhea in the health crisis cause then you wouldn't think about that\nDavid to re has has a fair so let's take some calls we have three lines open to be calling out eight six six six or seven seven three three seven eight six six six or seven seven three\nThree seven the Drudge Report tonight as a bunch of headlines about the country coming apart\nHughley stuff's going on I wouldn't quite say that the country is not coming apart we're going to be fine the country was coming apart though in Nineteen sixty eight that's when the company that's why I asked one of the country was coming apart was Nineteen sixty eight right now the headlines on drug jar usa on edge\nWhen\n\nThey said you need to reach me applied individual results may vary see what's extra detail\nI'm buying a huge flat screen TV so I can finally see it without my classes when you get\nThat's what I'm hearing my glasses and contact her pain I'd love to finally get rid of\nThese but who can afford lasik you can\nBecause some basic vision issue is offering dramatically low prices and an absolutely complication just try to three five zero revive zero\nLasik vision Institute has already perform over a million procedures they use the latest FDA approved lasik technologies that helps the majority of patients a cheap twenty twenty vision for fraction of what others charge\nLet her vision better value the late sixties she needs to to make this year you finally get lasik for a free consultation plus an extra twenty percent discount to actually try to revive zero three five zero\nYou'll see for free tickets right for you next E.

... former NYPD investigator and a very knowledgeable about the situation is whether it's an attempt to mass murder or whether it's an anti Semite who kept below the radar most of the reporting on this\nUh on Saturday today a has been along the lines that this is Robert Bowers was just a wonderful guy that ah NBC News this morning at on a neighbor lived next door to him a\nVery sad woman who said boy kept to himself quite friendly that kinda stuff joining me now is that a saint Thomas Russian former NYPD officer investigator detective and Thomas Redskin welcome again in the bill Cunningham shown Thomas are you\nGoing to be\nVery tough situation an awful um well when I watch some of the morning and afternoon coverage of Robert Bowers forty six years old I guess no previous criminal record at all\nAnd I hid menial jobs there was a truck driver did various other little things next door neighbor a woman said boy he was quiet to kind of shy\nAnd he said oh goodbye no difficulties\nHe had posted online for quite a while and I met him ranting and raving including hatred for Donald Trump the president because he thought Trump was two uh two nights on Israel didn't like the fact that Trump's grandchildren Jewish and ah he didn't like the fact that a Trump like the state of Israel nonetheless\nUh the media is pointing this out somehow Trump's responsible\nFor the Washington Post a yesterday afternoon it today did ugly reporting saying that uh that in fact Sarah Sanders put out something a few hours ago just said is there any tragedy of the Washington Post will not exploit\nTo attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because Trump is such a on a public defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nSo let's go back from a police perspective some have said or the analysis the experts come out of the woodwork now saying to Pittsburgh Police should have known the FBI should've known\nHow many thousands or millions I I've been tempered comments rather racial ... anti woman anti male whatever anti homosexual or ... is on social media like everyday who's going to monitor that monitor that and Tom do you see any followed by by law enforcement in this case\nAre not as one I've seen\nYou know there's always twenty twenty especially long horsemen or the investigative world when I Can't believe no one else was on\nSocial media and other things that he was hosting it couldn't have alerted all we want\nWe always say is a few things see something [laughter] you know when it seemed right\nI could've alerted the police police we find out that the police the FBI some law enforcement\nIt's told about Bowers and do something or to look to see if this guy does have guns or potentially follow him we can criticize the police but until that time police law enforcement agencies intelligence agencies\nDon't have the manpower or the bandwidth to be able to follow every single person that they get a complaint\nAnd even sometimes like the shooting and Broward County there was a woman or call FBI numerous people had called about an Eighteen year old punk mentally ill insane person that just shot up to high school\nAnd even though call in or an FBI people called in that wasn't followed up on even if those things happen there's no perfection there's no perfection and law enforcement correct\nThere's no perfection on horse you're only as good as shifts today and wish I could keep on force is very easy to do after the same law enforcement is tough on so I Know from my experience with the NYPD we always look back we always\nDid a review of what had happened and what we could do better at the same way that they're doing with the case the bombings or the bombs that were sent 'em they're looking back and figuring out what we do better in the future and that's what law enforcement agencies I'm short in Pittsburgh\nAnd the FBI and other agencies are doing towards ... and ... hours\nIn fact a Bowers said a postage just a few hours before the slaughter on Saturday morning quote I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw the optics ongoing in unquote so whoever he was dealing with social media somebody knew or should have known this guy was this integrating\n... and I and that person did not do anything now the experts have said because I'm sure there's several thousand individuals sadly in the country like ours\nWaiting for a trigger moment that social media exacerbates highlights these kinds of feelings because those of like minded get together and they feed on each other's hate\nBefore social media ten twelve years ago you sent letters or you made phone calls but in social media you can be a friend hundreds and thousands of people\nOr other like minded like those clowns marching around Charlottesville shouting slurs against uh against Jews and against African Americans every several hundred who did that they use social media to get together in the they feed on each other and feed on their hate now the media doesn't well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump\nHe he he'd previously road I never voted for Trump nor a vibrant own Warner even touch the mega had\nHe goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish\nBut the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing the president is one of many causing it so when you went in NYPD or you go back right now the Pittsburgh Police were going back in time and say\nWhat did he do when did he do it who didn't send these messages to and investigate them as to why something wasn't done and about the guns right now according to media accounts three fifty seven magnitude since and blocks that were legally purchased and they are Fifteen they're still tracking nothing down and see what it is\nA ... if someone is posting anti Semitic slurs and saying I'm going in and they have guns that isn't that another tempted something's about to happen\nThat's what you would hope you would hope for the polish Pittsburgh Police departments standpoint you would have gotten that call or the FBI would have gotten a call and then if you drop the oil is a law enforcement agency [laughter] and it's on you but in this case nothing I have seen about ... hours\nTo respond to a ... guy goes

blow up his own car because he would have killed if not injured hundreds if not thousands of people\nBut there are not like this around the country is what keeps law enforcement people up at night worrying about this lone wolf the guy who is not really talking to someone the guy who is\nSort of a loner a guy who's pretty well thought of in this neighborhood who is capable of grabbing his guns\nAnd going into a place in killing innocent people for no other reason than his ideology or his private jeeze\nHummus is out there all the way but Thomas Rosekind former NPT NYPD officer thanks
