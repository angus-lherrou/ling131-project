I'm not putting down what you say I'm just puzzled here if we have a complete picture because we're concentrating just on one day\nAnd there were some other ups and downs as well and the second quarter you had a real lack\nOf spending on inventories we sort of expected that to come back in the third quarter and pump up the overall number and I did on the other hand there was a big surge in exports a and the the trade deficit narrowed and the second quarter that helped GDP and conversely a an ... the widening of the trade deficit and the third quarter\nOr hurt the growth rate over all that kind of balanced it seemed to me in the second quarter those two things inventories and trade deficit sort of balance each other out and I think again and the third quarter what we ... you know bottom line there are a lot of things that I should say\nA weak point a was a residential fix construction or you know home building is clearly being hurt by a higher mortgage rates higher interest\nRate shortage of supply the with the price the market especially for new buyers\nYes and but I think that I think the good news there at least if you kind of go back one step household formation numbers are still quite strong so at some point this is you know people have to live somewhere\nAnd I think this is a market I think this is an industry sector I should say which in two thousand Nineteen could prove to be a source of strength for the overall economy because it is clearly lacking\nThe Federal Reserve project has guesses about what Nineteen and twenty are going to look like and the strength three point five percent which I'm told by Steve Moore\nA took a we we the gas prices took some points out of this may be up to a point three ... so we're in a place where that that all of a sudden that gas bike hit the third quarter but the Federal Reserve protects projects two point five and twenty Nineteen to point\nA to point zero in twenty Twenty one pointed in twenty Twenty one well they revise that now because of the three point five are they going to stand pat on they're blooming as\nWell [laughter] well I think they're\nGoing to probably continue to look at it at a downturn ... I don't mean a recession but a downturn in terms of the growth rate ah I doubt that these numbers will change that I think the real issue confronting the fed is that inflation the price to later a inflation numbers generally are incredibly modest and so\nYou know the conversation that's kind of developing now is what is sort of the neutral rate\nAnd is it two percent is it more than two percent or because\nYou know you look at where our rates are now and compare them to for example a German bonds\nThree point three percent and ours are now a well over two percent so\nWhat what's the difference there I mean is that really makes sense are in other words are we really kind of a ham praying or growth by jacking up rates a little bit too aggressively kind of like President Trump has talked about or is there really a good solid reason for that it seems to me the inflation pressures are\nUsually coming from two sources one is a\nA plant and equipment capacity utilization there is no problem with that we're still way below ... a historical averages are plants and factories can accommodate further growth the the one issue is a labor and yet you look at the labor participation rate\nThere are more people who could come into the workforce\nIt hasn't really happened to any big degree\nBut again if you look at historical averages\nIt you know there's more than a million workers who could come back to work if wages\nAre counting and you would kind of hope that that's what begins to happen at this point in the cycle\nInside this however there are strengths and weaknesses for example Korea is an innovation powerhouse because it's been as Chris just indicated four point two percent of its GDP on R and D but it's very weak in the labor market according to the global competitiveness report\nAnd in products product markets there's not much competition do you feel that in your work Chris\n... absolutely ... in South Korea specifically you have the ... the eight large dominant\nCompanies in in certain sectors are the Korean government has set up or you would see is kind of two pillars so\nLet's talk consumer televisions as an example we have Elgin Samsung is the two large competitors the south Korean economy is very much oriented towards a large companies working very closely with the government as you've seen with some of the corruption problems there at times too closely\nBut the government having a direct invested a investment in support of those major employers in uh the basis of those employers having large employee bases and really helping to drive the economy forward\nJapan which I Would have thought was perfect America because how well they've done these last Seventy years their fifth overall income global competitiveness is good for Japan but\nThey according to this study have weekends to two sons and we corporate governance does that show up in competition with American firms\nIt very much does the Japanese economy is that there's great innovation there's great research but the Japanese a historically in business has been very um a\nCautious towards restructure towards layoffs some of the what you call creative destruction that happens in the U.S of a company may grow company may fail people fall out of that company and start new companies in Japan that's not quite that way you have much more of a government a\nDesire to minimize unemployment to in many cases supporter prop up businesses that may not be economically viable simply to keep order and to keep employment at high levels but that kind of brain some of their competitors competitiveness quite frankly\nA surprise to me Australia I talk often with Australia I follow the governance is part of the Anglo file world it's very good about growing it has a vibe vibrant population\nAnd its fourteenth overall and it has something to grow but that's the envy of ... most of the planet by these sites labor rigidity and we can't invasion is that your experience and can you explain it\nYeah well I Would say is ... Australia still\nPrincipally export economy with a a principal\nClient of Australia being China so if the Chinese economy a catches a cold Australia catches the flu or they're they're very much dependent on that export economy you also have very high minimum wage a a lack\nOf kind of scale innovation of growth and that ability to challenge incumbency use while a very\nInteresting place in some very very smart people besides to a certain extent the high labor cost and the\n... the lack of major brands that you would see converting are investing can continue to hold the economy ...\nIs that or they felt it are the Australian self aware that their weekend innovation but they've got the education and the skills and the resources to be strong and\n... what you see it in tech at least is that some of the best and brightest from Australia especially in the tech world just simply leave Australia to go to work for American or European or other tech companies there's not the native base such tech in Australia that you see\nIn many other countries so the best and brightest because they're portable because their\nWorkers and the knowledge economy simply\nSo there's a brain drain and it's caused by Australia not responding to the competitiveness I'm a competitiveness a report now we moved to the big uh the the emerging markets which are all the excitement I was very much surprised to see Malaysia grouped in with China\nA which had they both have thirty points to the frontier that means to a hundred the u._s. is doing very well we're not as a hundred either nobody\nThat a hundred according to this Malaysia before we go to China do you do you sense that Malaysia is growing very quickly and that is innovative\nMalaysia's growing very quickly you have a rising consumer are rising middle class there that is very success oriented quite entrepreneurial a Malaysian historically had been traders and very open to commerce as a whole I think the big thing that we watch the or simply\n... the government and whether the government stays in a liberal western democracy type style or swings towards the potential more fundamental\nI pick up on that on the charts saying that they have weak institutions that's the way they expressed that uh and there's not ability with the institutions week institutions in Japan too that means I translate that Tammany Hall a lot of back scratching All right onto the mainland China\nChina's emerging technology along that the emerging technologies of Asia break down into three groups I mentioned the top group Malaysia and China\nIndonesia the Philippines Vietnam Thailand and Brunei or in the second group and at the bottom in Asia in east Asia's Mongolia Cambodia and Laos but we are gonna tend to China China's said in this report and it's very generous\nTo just it's an inflection point to move from an investment driven economy to a consumption economy is that happening\nChris because I hear routinely that China is not diversifying its economy nuts switching to the consumer\n... with the time that I spend their I'm always absolutely fascinated by the consumerism and the incredible modernization where the some of the best consumer some of the capital of the world are there in China I\nThink that there's a very very rapid rise of the middle class in China in that embrace of consumerism that politics aside you have a motive needed very intelligent population that seeks to bring China to first world status and they understand how to from learning from the\nKoreans or the Japanese or others to look at how to embrace technology how to embrace consumerism to really mold and economy in the model of the u._s.\nSo they're aware that they have to work on consumerism that that is the missing piece of their economy and are the institutions permitting them to get to that or to allow shopping you know that's what we do crafts we shop where shopping were great shoppers are they learning from\n... from from uh once you spend time in Shanghai and seeing the great shopping capitals of the world whether it be rodeo drive or London high street uh Kensington or other the shopping and the shopping you folks in Shanghai rivals any place in the world and you see the\nThe consumers or you'll go into a factory where there are dozens of domestic phones produced in China and the factory workers who have lower incomes on the scale all one iPhones\nThey want that consumer branded product they aspire to that product even though it might be much more expensive the domestic brands but they are classic great shoppers\nThis is a scholar report with the IAU Chris regal a scholar a leading marketing technology company travels the world and we will continue\nTo look at the

sort of sparked at and the migration of the great awakening itself from New England to New York and then to the border states and the Midwest was six\nExactly the passage bet the abolitionist movement made before the war as it grew and grew and ...\nAnd what this means is that you have the social justice warriors today who call themselves progressive as the truth spiritual\nOr inherit us of

of the abolitionist movement as a whole was also military and meaning it sought to create a new promised land after the struggle and struggle itself would be one of cleansing and purification and in the case of the civil war\nAlthough I don't think anyone intended it or even imagine\nThat it could happen they cleansing purification of the civil war\nWas the clemency and purification blood and so

sponsored by gala gala a\nLeading marketing technology company powers millions of digital times around the world leading the wave of retail transformation visit scholar dot coms today to modernize your digital experience the business of America is small business this is the American business report with gene marks\nWho writes the small business column for the guardian as well as the Philadelphia Inquirer very good eating to Eugene there is good news in all directions for small business as the small businesses of America I've been telling us for several years things are getting better all the time indeed we have a three point five percent first round report\nOn the GDP for the United states consumers are spending an eye sees on that because that's what small business cares about you have reported that\nThe fed beige book is indicating growth steady growth going forward although there are trade concerns will mention that bug do small businesses continue optimistic or is there some hesitation is winter approaches in the north good evening to\nChina it's great to speak with you yeah all all that information or that you report it is accurate the uh uh GDP\nNumbers came out day is three and a half percent it was above what estimates were expecting um the economy um as continue to grow\nUm some people are are forecasting more than a four percent uh yeah GDP increase in two thousand and nineteenth or wait to see on that a jobs numbers good consumer spending is up consumer sentiment is leveling off a little bit but\nThat could just be a monthly monthly blip now\nThe Federal Reserve um every month they go through and they\nThey surveyed their um their their regional banks and um you know they put it together actually into like sort of a quarterly report that they like to do their twelve regional banks Kobe the fed beige book and what it is it's again it's just a it's an anecdotal survey of how\nThings are going in the different regions of the country and um that Facebook or results were were released today and uh we're reporting what we all know already economic growth is\nSteady although most of the regional new Federal Reserve's reporting that businesses and all across all regions are\nStill are concerned about tightening labor market higher wages um is a potential concern or for for business as well as\nTrade and how that's going to impact a you know a lot of states economies I mean John some states\nYou know California a twenty two percent of their GDP comes from trade with overseas partners I mean Michigan it's like thirty eight percent or\nSome big numbers um so some states themselves are are very you know are relying on on on trade Canada Mexico or are the biggest trading partners as well of course as China\nSo right now we're at a stage and trade where you know you know North American trade seems to be on a good track I there's been some you know agreement there still has to be signed by the president and um as well as the Mexican and Canadian a prime ministers and presidents of China's the big issue now is so uh you know a lot of the Federal Reserve regions are concerned\nI I Will resorts all because you know I watch China very carefully there will not be a quick resolution to that because\nBeijing is not prepared to change his business plan where it has become the number two economy on the planet by pretending to be a developing nation and therefore it can subsidized just can steal it can cut corners they can ignore international agreements that's not going to resolve itself quickly\nUntil the leadership in Beijing resolved to join everybody else and play by transparency and rules so I go to\nWhat's wrong here in the United states right now and you mentioned it there's a shortage of workers Jean and I ... that has to be a continuing concern for small business\n[noise] yeah it does I mean I I wrote about this in the Philadelphia Inquirer um you know just a a week or so ago how employers not only in the northeast region but across the country continue um to to have a hard time when when when the unemployment rate comes out and shows a historically low rate lowest rates and show them the late Nineteen sixties\nUm you know the Trump Administration shears the economist year uh but uh you know my clients and small business owners around the country are not cheering\nYou see that because it is it makes them it makes it very very hard to attract new employees to their companies they are fighting very hard against larger companies um they are dealing with a companies like Amazon as well as Wal Mart target that are paying higher minimum wage is going what what a lot of small businesses\nCan't afford it is you know it's it's a good the good the bad we're seeing a your growth ... it's great that unemployment is low but a lot of small business owners um are are finding it very very difficult to find\nPeople I can tell you that you know some of the things that I'm hearing across the country as I speak to groups I meet a lot of business owners many of them are reaching out to\nHigh schools technical schools community colleges nurturing relationships for students I'm really at a at a high school age inviting them to their companies offering internships speaking at the schools themselves\nThat has become a significantly more popular way for small companies to try and attract workers um into their businesses um and they'd been forced to do this and be innovative with programs like this and some of them are really succeeding\nGene you know a deal about personal income taxes and business taxes so therefore how do we all get to be Jared Kushner is there a secret formula that you can lead on well ... ...\n... about a week or two ago the New York times had a front page report about how Jared Kushner had not paid any taxes in the past five or six years and [noise] you know it was kind of referring you know inferring that oh you know what kind of sketchy deals as you doing where he's\nCheating the government out of taxes and that that's just not the case I mean whether or not you agree with with Jared Kushner's politics or not um she did not paying taxes because he took advantage of certain incentives and attacks on set up that have been around for a while that I think a lot of business owners need to understand as well ... and the real estate property business\nHe buys buildings in rehab damned renovate them and rents them out there are some specific new depreciation allowances that are allowed\nFor businesses like him so he can take some upfront deductions um that that offset any income that might be coming in business owners themselves have the availability to take some significant deductions on capital equipment\nThat they buy from many case of a million dollars a year John and if you're a business owner and you want to buy equipment like Jared 'cause you don't necessarily have to pay for it you can put a down payment you can finance the rest as long as you put that equipment or that property into service\nYou can take a big tax deduction for Cushing who did this\nTo the extent where it is the ... were even exceeded his income and then he was able to carry forward those losses or even carry them back as well so everything he did was\nCompletely legal and above board and not only that it's good tax strategy a business owners themselves should be paying attention to that kind of tax strategy making investments like that\nAnd capital equipment property taking the tax deduction I think it's a very very good you know strong business move and I hope that a lot of accountants are making those recommendations to their clients did\nCall one eight hundred eight nine eight hair to learn more dads one eight hundred eight

leading the wave of retail transformation visit gala dot com today\nTo modernize your digital experience Jean right for the Philadelphia Inquirer his small business ...\nAs well as the guardian we go to optimism\nAnd post recession high and small business I like this talk gene I liked the fact that businesses are happy small businesses especially but is this in the rearview mirror you've been traveling do you see this routinely or are those worries we've evidence this evening\nA crowding you a combination that's\nHuge on on Capitol one bank um they just came out with their latest small business growth index ah they do this twice a year and this index found that sixty seven percent of small business owners I think that the business conditions in the area are good or excellent\nAnd that was up from sixty percent uh this time last year um they also found that a third of them plan to hire in the next six months which is up from twenty five percent over a year ago so is it that's all good news\nUm but that that small business grows index also found that there was some current concerns that small businesses have things that we just talked about in in our last segment obviously finding people are but in addition to that you know the high cost of health care remains a big concern among business owners\nTaxes and their impact on on their business whether tax reform will have an impact on of course trade a could have an impact like we talked about before so the optimism is still there a business owners are are happy and looking forward to a good holiday season but there are some concerns that still weigh on their mind\nAnd here's a concern that I didn't know existed but Jean's column and the guardian points this out that we're looking at a nation of lawbreakers who don't mean to but you know in touch with reality is not something you can plead in court you either break the law or not what is the bottom ... and how is it making people a a troubled well it's\nNot just bought a fire but it's it's any music streaming services and so you know you might look because my sister she she runs out of the family doctor says she's a small business owner she runs a practice down in Philadelphia and she streams\nA spot if she's got music playing right over the speakers for her patients in the waiting room to here she's not alone right we go and coffee shops\nRestaurant boutique hotel and plus they're all yet draining the music right right turns out that all of them including my sister are breaking the law\nThe the license agreements for that streaming music as evidenced by a company called soundtrack your brand or who is a company that goes after things like this\nI'm a said that eighty three percent of businesses small around the country and around the world or a list at least using these services\nSpotify apple music for public consumption you're not allowed to use it for public consumption that your own personal service you oh these people are you a license fate and because nobody's paying these license fees\nIt's costing the music industry more than two and a half billion\n... is this like it's like the the little sign on mattresses right I mean it's like a penalty of ... I write a voyage which was a threat in my youth but I then I learned that we're all going to go to jail together so I relax [laughter] well\nI said a good luck to soundtrack your brand and good luck to the music industry try to find all those millions of small businesses and collecting royalties [laughter] I don't think that's going to happen any\nTime that you've alerted them to the possibility that the that the that the music police could be showing up at any night knocking on the door saying All right\nUh entrepreneurs we celebrate them in ... in our world in a in America today you have the king of Prussia a new guys we have the Silicon Valley new guys there in Austin, Texas how is it that they make bad decisions given that they look so well to do well\nThere was a new study that came out as well that I wrote about on ink dot com and it's got a great Dane John it's called\nCurb your enthusiasm is the name of this study was done by researchers from the university a bath and Cardiff in\nLondon School of economics and you know what you know what I found it found that optimistic entrepreneur is earn less money they surveyed a bunch of entrepreneur is in the u._k. and other parts of the world and they found out that ...\nThat have a more optimistic outlook of the world uh turned out that they made worse business decisions\nThan entrepreneur as a business owners that were more pessimistic hat so it turns out that if you're a glass as half full person some times you can be blinded by what the right decision or not as opposed to being somebody a little bit more\nHow shall I say cynical and John I'm a I'm a CPA cynicism comes as part of my job and so I I feel that I have nothing to worry about there but if you're that kind of a person you might want to temper down a bit or at least surround yourself with somebody a little bit more realistic\nFinally we have a minute and a report from Philadelphia this was in the Philadelphia Inquirer or very well informed about China China and tariffs what do they want\nThey want to see the the Chinese published a punished excuse me in fact from a recent study by a company called um there's by cell they study choose thousand entrepreneur is an overwhelmingly they supported President Trump's move against China\nSo you know the president has support of the small business community behind them and doesn't surprise me again I think I mentioned earlier businesses have been complaining about you know China's unfair trade practices and allegedly taking of technology\nAnd all that ... they're pirates their part it's it's not it's not a debate here they are pirates but I what I welcome is that small business owners in Philadelphia a city you and I love right there on the front line of foreign policy thinking good [laughter]\nThat they get it there one with Capitol Hill in fact they were probably ahead of Capitol Hill which took a while for the members of Congress to realize that those Chinese checks balanced\nGene marks he is a small business columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer and for the guardian the business of America is small business this segment sponsored by gala gala a leading marketing technology company powers ...\nI'm Tony DeJesus from big blue bugs solutions I've been in the pest control business a long time and one thing I've learned is that you never stop learning\nThe reason big blue bug solutions has so many satisfied customers ... New England is because we keep up with all the education about the ever changing world the best and the latest method to controlling a lemonade and even help solve wildlife problem and\nWhen we say no

washing news on all the\n\nTime when it gets pretty\nImprovised explosive\nDevices and the bombs were no hoax\nSee I have to have been unraveling since his arrest revealing a dark history of at least nine of rats including threats to blow up a Florida power company according to police reports he sent them a warning saying it would be worse than September eleventh\nThere is also making threats against high profile people in the media on his Twitter account mainly directed at CNN journalists\nEven with south in custody investigators are stressing it does not mean to threat it's over\nToday's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages and transit now\nA inside landing on Mars you've got a\nYou've got coming up uh the fly by the New Horizons are the kind of a belt object\nTo Dawn Dawn it series dawn and Siri who know Juno Jupiter yes yes Juno\nJupiter you've got various Mars orbiters and so so this is and you know now they have a pro heading towards murky mercury and you also got the ... so it's a very busy season\nAnd so that's one of the reasons they wanted to hold off I suspect they will try again come January\nJust have to keep our fingers crossed that somehow that solar panels get revealed\nOne of the concerns is that uh the cold temperatures will ruin the battery for good and because there's no dust in the atmosphere think about it's always warm on a cloudy night when the sky is clear nothing to hold the heat it and the storm was holding the heat in till it's gotten colder\nAnd so it could very well be that opportunity is finally left us\nWe're coming for a opportunity okay just fit right there will get their soon sums whom to suit or walk right up and say that it's ... it's All right we go to ... to a this is the third reversal why why did they were\nWell here's the deal they originally going to land in late October and grab the sample um but the ... right you grew\nDoes has no tiny dust pauses no soft mood sections nothing at all it's all a rubble pile of of boulders rocks and that's a problem they hope to have a landing area that was enough that was at least\nSixteen meters across that's about what is that about two hundred feet\nUm but they didn't find anything that wide what they found those something the best they've been able to find something twenty meters across without fifty feet\nForty feet so they decided to do additional rehearsals hold off until January the landing and so they've done now\nThey've done one of our solar earlier on and they this month they've done now to rehearsal sigh of links to the pictures I posted the closest image and they don't have any scale so it's very hard to know that we do know they were going to try to get within twenty meat as the surface about sixty feet so that's probably what this is so these are very tiny rocks on\nHow good that their aim was I don't know they haven't live at least a press release they now have in a couple of months to relax because\nI'm the son is moving in between a ... and the earth and so therefore communications is not easy they won't lose communications but because of that they they got to hold off and he is more complicated new is we just have to wait and see what will happen in January\nWhat is Parker [noise] the park or sell the pro if you remember was launched a few a month or two ago\nUm to do a series of increasingly close ... of the sun to tell us something about the atmosphere of the sun and the corona and did a flyby of ah Venus in October early October\nAnd what what's key here is that this week it turns itself around and talk looked back and took a picture of the earth the mold\nHad posted on behind the black it's not a particularly spectacular\nImages an unusual picture of the earth the moon Bob I'd have to say I wouldn't immediately recognized are so\nNo you wouldn't it basically looking at is low resolution\nClose up of of the earth the moon picking behind so it's just a bunch of pixels that's slightly oblong because of the moon's presence what's important about this image isn't the image itself but one day could point that the instrument precisely\nTo look at the earth and it demonstrated to that the instruments wide field camera is working properly\nAnd that's really what it was done for instrumental operational test to make sure everything's good and that's what's good about this and so what the we're heading towards the sun and it's not going to burn off\nAnd Bob the Parker probe in a new information we're gathering up are backing up we have a couple of sun probes up there now so different different this is a\nBig star remember it might be an ordinary style but it's a big and so we there's a lot of things we just do not know and we've never been this club when no previous probe ever went this close to the sun so we're going to be diving into areas we'd never seen\nYou know at the same time it's going to be looking at other data to come from other theories you know it's always the same there's some things you confirmed something should learning new the big thing is it's getting close to the side and that's what's important\nSaturn has a moon named ... and sudden and not a rock star suddenly they're stripes on the on I didn't know to look Bob but clearly from this report you're pointing us to these are mysterious tribes why\nYes um what they what scientists have done is they look back at the archival that are of Cassini which is unfortunately no longer at all but around Saturn\nAnd ... and the images took of the ... and they what they tend to five was 'em long narrow strike scattered across the surface that generally tend to a hundred kilometers in Lancaster so that's approximately thirty to three hundred miles long\nThey tend to be very narrow two to three miles and the brightest into our surrounding terrains that parallel to each other and they ... features and straight are not affected by top hog if we think of a road that goes straight along the county line goes up and down and around because it doesn't turn just doesn't\nIgnores the ... well the same thing with these the suggestion they're also parallel to the equator\nThe suggestion is that there's some kind of they were laid down from um external dust on materials that came in from off the planet that this is not unusual in a violent or shatter um you've got the Saturn's rings and a lot of material being transferred between point days to point base\nAnd so that's Paulie they think what's going on here but they do not know\nUm there there there's a great quote from them the quote the material could have implications for the biological potential of the sub surface ocean\nThe honest I'm not sure how they connect but that's what they said and\nThey wait wait wait do that again biological interpretation\nI yeah I don't know why they say this but you know they're always trying to sell their projects and anytime they can talk about life\nOn I'm told that I Know I was thinking that this was crop riding in some fashion you know the way the way the aliens take a wheat fields and signal to\nYeah I don't think that's the case it's more likely if you were right remember on behind the black if you do a search on behind the black you'll come up with a great images Saturn some upset in any moons near the whole inside the rings and they tend to ... have these gigantic ridges at the equator because they\nThey gather dust from the rings at the equator\nI'm so they almost like spaceships you know fashion saucers well here could be these a parallel to the equator and they'll lined up with him or it could be that this is just stuffed being picked up from ... how it has any implications biological but nonetheless they make that point and so let's give them more\nMoney our friend Alan Stern has another great idea this is the man who are devoted more than half of it live two New Horizons which is now in the ... after the fly by Pluto what's the latest about what\nThey did is him in a few other scientists and engineers did some research to see\nHow could they go back to Pluto and the most effective manner that they they had been in this there's a debate you know we want to go to Pluto again at all but at the planet the the whole planet we've only seen half but they also want to get a ... a pro about the type of deal to do research there and what they did is they said if they use\nTo a a an eye on type proportion system that was used on dawn which allowed us to visit more than one asteroid they could launch a probe to Pluto and then using sugar on as a flyby technique\nOr leaves off it at some point and then use the the iron propulsion to travel throughout the type of belt so in other words they get to bangs for one book and this is their proposed they said this makes sense and this allows them to get everything in one mission and so this is probably going to be opposed to NASA or others and they got to try to make this\nMission happen and I think that's really really exciting\nJobs ever many keeps the website behind the black when we come back engineering I'm John bachelor this is the John

is why I'm very pleased that Mary at a stage show gravy the America's\nColumnist and editor for the wall Street Journal editorial board is here\nTo help me understand this phenomenon that sometimes in some magazines in North America is called Trump him or Trump like the man's name as both a narrow I first recognized him when he was attacked during a rally stabbed in the stomach he's recovered\nHe is in a run off and he is given great possibility of becoming the president of Brazil\nThough I don't know where that takes Brazil because it's been so troubled and is in a deep recession right now\nWith former leading presidents either in jail or in disgrace very a very good evening to you both so narrow I can understand both in our I can understand if he's none of the above what does he present so what is he going to provide Brazil but it needs good evening to\nWell they've named John um I think the first thing we can say about books that are oh is that he's not a member of the Workers Party um he's not a left wing social it and I think I'm a lot of the popularity explained by the fact that uh you know he was\nUm he's he's the alternative to the socialist model on and you know why other why other on\nA Kennedy did not catch on because there were many other candidates and the first round is a good question but I think um they were to ordinary to run to the mail to a mainstream\nSimilar maybe to what got the attention of voters in the United states during that the Trump or the two thousand sixteen campaign on both in our Dario spoke and he's not shy about saying things that are politically incorrect or sometimes he makes very rude comment\nUm but I think that people feel like there's something real about him\nUm and they are just so disgusted and were filed by the socialist Workers Party because not only the collapse of the economy\nOn their watch but also the gross corruption I mean it was unbelievable the way that they just a ... abuse their power to enrich\nThemselves the business elite and um and the party and you know all the while that people are learning about this there also\nAre hurting economically they had nearly three years of recession then they had\nA very slow growth in this chair and next year it's not for cats do much better so they're looking for other ideas and both ... not a market liberal he's basically I Would say the and an\nAntidote to um to socialism and we can talk about that a little bit more because I think that it's not entirely clear what his\nWhat his solutions they're going to be but I think that people just started saying anybody but the socialists and that's how he got where yet\nYou've taught me over the years that Brazil's a hybrid mixture of socialism at one scale kind of redistribution and back scratching and also a big data's economic forces enterprises that are vast\nAnd take a and grab capital and don't permit entrepreneurship or experimentation is both an arrow both an arrow going to answer that these big ... like Petro bras and ... and then the peasants who are who are who are bought off with abroad\n[noise] well that's the sixty four million dollar question and of course you know he hasn't won yet people I talked to give in between uh Seventy and eighty percent chance that per gallon\nSunday but I'm a even if he does win all it's not clear his he's been in Congress for twenty seven years his voting record is bad for the state\nYou know I mean this is as we talk about right in Alaska and I think sometimes the language gets very confused but you know he's not a free market guy a according to his is history or that being said\nHe has a University of Chicago PHD economists\nWho is who is chief um advisor and consulted on and he is also need certain commitments for example he says that the central back must be independent\nAnd of course the central bank losses independence during the ... the government and that was a big reason why they got into so much trouble and they got back to double digit inflation and so forth so\nHe's made some commitments that I think are very encouraging he's also said that he will privatize and you have\nTo remember that under Lula um and ... the state was getting back into all kinds of economic activity\nSo both so now he says he will reverse those decisions he'll get rid of those stayed on enterprises that I think there might be somewhere around fifty of those um but he also has stopped shortage thing for example that he's going to privatize cut your boss he says he wants to keep in state hands what he called\nStrategic companies\nAnd that's of course a disappointment to those of us who believe in the market um but I think a lot of people are just hoping that uh that um you know in terms of orders of magnitude he'll get closer to market economics\nThen obviously than the P. T. is even if he does you know do the full Monty\nSecurity uh I Do I have never traveled to Brazil but I read anecdotes to say that the streets of the large cities can be dangerous because of abduction dangerous for the well to do does ball so narrow speak to that is ... is what he says credible\nWell first of all I Would say that most of the danger when we talk about danger I think like with respect to haunt us by most of that occurs in poor neighborhoods and the the\nMajor victims of the high a homicide rates are um the poor\nI mean they're the ones who are killed in these bad neighborhoods and that is why I'm despite the fact that he's been accused of being a racist and so forth um he does have some support not huge um but he has some support or some significant support I Would say\nFrom on people in those neighborhoods\nI'm I'm a little bit skeptical as to whether he can I'm actually make a big debt in crime any part of the problem is that this was organized crime and it's funded by uh the drug habits of wealthy Brazilians and wealthy a Europeans and at American um who by\nDrugs or you know through the supply chain but eventually\nThese are the people who are supplying them so um those people have a lot to lose their very well armed um I think it might be very difficult for him to\nDismantle those organized crime groups not like nobody has ever tried before I'm having said that I think he's going to do some very simple basic things\nUm who who just have you know almost absolute despair in terms of their future\nOf course they want to go to the United states but not by the way the way some native is field because they want to come here and um you know live off the off the welfare state\nThey want jobs and they see the United states is a place where they would have opportunity so you know if you start organizing and you tell people okay we're going to use\nUm strength and numbers to get into the United states you're going to get a lot of people to join you I'm having said that I think it's really important to understand\nWhat is it in the economy for these countries that is making\nA these young people so desperate and that's why I wrote that column about the silver mining Guatemala because that's silver mine was implying well over a thousand people\nAnd all of a sudden you got these um you know NGOs coming along and say well you know the challenging the a right of the silver mind to operate because supposedly um they didn't\nUp properly consult with a indigenous group in the area before they began operating silver mine and you know you dig down you find out first of all that that the senses of the most recent census when the wind was started found that there were to\nDo\nThat to see W O\nIndigenous people in the whole area where the silver mine was operate\nThis is the ... ... is that how you say it ... the I guess it's\nA shame to and you know I'm not I'm not a you know\nDoubting that the shouldn't have right\nBut on you know the inside the the property there was not this impact on the ... community that there is that the mine is charged with being sort of you know sensitive too and uh once they proved that the court\nUm said well okay that may be true and we acknowledge it there were only two there but um we think that ah the\nGovernment should go back and interview and look into it more and you know they've been dragging their heels on the line has been closed for well over a year\nA note into a year and a half I think and all these people who were working for the mind and by the way the mine with not accused of any environmental degradation it wasn't accused of any labor violations it had spent millions of dollars in the area on education and community um\nEnhancements for the people who lived in the area and now all of a sudden the mine shut down all these people don't have a job and um and and by the way the mind also\nThe court had the option of saying that the mind could continue to operate\nA while the government went and did these consultations with the indigenous population and the court had done that in other cases but in this case decided not to um I think that there's a lot of questions about\nHow those judges made their decisions um but regardless of that the bottom line is that here you have the Guatemalan a Guatemalan government as institution\nUm you know deliberately shutting down a source of employment and wealth creation for a large number of people in a very poor part of the country and\nThis was in an isolated event this happens over and over again in these countries\nAnd um I think it's one thing that we need to keep in mind when you see all the people that of course our hearts go out to them we say you know that they need jobs and and they're moving through Mexico now because they're desperate but you know what you're nice country due to make the where they are where these people live\nUm you know more attractive for them to stay and there's plenty they can do but they have to have the political will to do it as I said this is not\nUm this this movement of people through through Central America and Mexico is not accidental these people are marching in lockstep they're organized I'm not saying that the migrants themselves are necessarily political but it's a political movement that is is basically\nOn as a as we said in our editorial earlier this week it's very similar to when she del Castro unleashed all of the migrants from the port of Mariel in Nineteen eighty\nExtremely just said destabilizing 'em and difficult for the country that is asked to accept them\nAnd um so I think that the Trump Administration is right to be a challenging um uh the the organizers of the larger than to be telling people that they this is not the way that we accept in Nebraska\nOr you mentioned Cuba's so for the final minutes here you have a column about Cuba's conduct and you identify it as a as a master of Venezuela what we're seeing the catastrophe event in Venezuela must be looked at\nAs what Havana once is this what does this help Cuba that have the people of Havana uh the people of Caracas without food and resources\nWell that doesn't care if the people of that is well I don't have food resources Atlanta wants to control Venezuela\nAnd um if that means that as well as to empty out and there's not going to be any when they're at the very small population of added a care about that because then I had done that to the island itself\nOr six years so this is a um a matter of geo political strategy on the part of Havana and yeah I mean I think that uh it's quite obvious that the Venezuelans would not be capable of the kind of in ... intelligence control\nOn control over passports or the electronic voting systems the ID cards\nOn it by on people that has you know it has chemical everywhere and that's a that's a very Cuban on a a strategy and tactics on that ... has been using at home for for many many years\nSo I mean the reason I wrote that column is because people keep saying what can we do to help the Venice well and you know because it's that they're they're they're quite um\nYou know they're they're suffering a lot right now and I think that it's just wrong to think that you can solve this problem and crap that this problem that has to be solved the Nevada and this is the problem that was\nThat aid and abet it by Brock Obama\nWho basically supported um the dictate the military dictatorship of the doubt Castro gay that oxygen gave it food gave it support when it was breaking down and that gave\nIt to you about the lifeline it needed to keep going and to reach out and to expand it was already working on this expansionist a project in bed as well but that very much helped\nOn the Cuban um military dictatorship continue and I'm so somebody has to do and I'm assuming it would be the Trump Administration or the next us administration but at some point\nThere you know that the democracy that the region have to get together and and tell her that I like you know my you know and that hasn't happened and and\nAnd the ... the result of that is is when you see that as well right now\nVery Anastasia ... indeed she is the America's columnist and editor at the wall Street Journal editorial board I'm John bachelor this is the John ... or so [noise]\nYou're allowed
