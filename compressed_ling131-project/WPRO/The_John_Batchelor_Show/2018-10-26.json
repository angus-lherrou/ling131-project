I mean they're in what studio or are they in that day\nYeah I don't know a studio there was built apparently by professionals for television broadcast but it sounded like a Steven was ah I don't know in some sort of the tunnel while I Know that he uh sometimes does the show on a lake from Philly every once in a sign of he was in one of those like tiny room he was in a studio ... in that and to get up studio or\nWhatever but I Try really hard to avoid that show pretty much at all yeah yeah I only I only ever seen clips that I've downloaded for the\n... yeah exactly and when you know Steven ... is actually making sense on the ... and you know they've gotten off to another so often just started tonight in Oklahoma City\nWhich is really ... funneling I mean look if they don't play defense that's NBA two thousand Eighteen not being able to score with all this offensive talent he I don't\nIt it yeah and I think a major major part of that so far and ah our friends are screaming a hit upon it is that Jay Brown is really struggled out at the gate and Gordon Hayward minutes restriction or not and I'm not saying this in a heartless sort of way\nBut you have the Gordon Hayward you have\nAnd so if the twenty five minute an Gordon Hayward is\nNot really boy and all that well then that that's a problem in jail and brown also is playing out well and Kyrie Irving and shooting whatever it said five percent from a three point where I think he's sixteen percent whatever it was I mean yes do we expect to be offered to buy this level for the Celtics like Steven I said yeah I think we do\nBut yeah it's a it's a little bit discouraging that they're having so much trouble scoring here in the early going I Wonder if Russia was one of those things where\nYou know could we talked about it we raved about it in the pre season how everyone seemed to be on board right our buddy cheeseburger Morris was like oh yeah totally onboard a whole bunch of ten minutes whatever it doesn't matter to me but I Wonder if there's a little bit of complacency in terms of\nVibe it all night tonight we have so much talent or do deep at somebody will pick up the slack and and maybe they're experiencing a little bit of that something may be able to easily overcome by the way but I kind of wonder if maybe that's what's going on here in the early going that's why for\nMe I was harping on Brad Stevens toughest job is getting all the pieces to fit you know when you're coaching a team it's like a puzzle you got to make the puzzle fit\nAnd I don't know what's the pieces fit and the more they continue

right around election time about what to do what it did in July and hurt the Republican and particularly the Trump supporter brown as\nFar as the optics I don't know what we can make with so little evidence\nAll I can say is that people are rushing to judgment and then they're saying if they're on the progressive side that um puff speech results or ... violent actions such as these but of course that's a passive aggressive attitude because for the last two years most of not all but most of the rhetoric\nOf kicking people and get in their face and punching them behind the gym or has led it's

suspicious bomb packages I'm On Democrats doorstep right because of that Trump was pretty on script that first but at the beginning\nUm other rally and he he really wanted to make clear that it's his job to keep Americans safe and even though this is Democrat um he cares a lot about finding out who did this and wants to bring justice so he was very clear about that in the beginning\nUh but then as soon as he started going and you uh\nUh the Wisconsin rallies you know the constant elections themselves on issues at stake here he certainly went off script and with having a lot of some of the crowd was certainly feeding off of the reactions just getting a and with you know people were doing that the typical chance and\nThe media today has focused for some reason on this lock her up chants that they're claiming people were uh\nYou know chanting for ... a lot of the rally and honestly John I Can't I Can't actually think of when this when this can't happen like I Can't recall it my recollection of of this whole event\nThough with a very quick chance and maybe a small group of people that did it at at one time but\nUm it's certainly strange to me that it's been a headline was\nWell let's let's think out loud Corey let's think out loud I Can't I Can't be certain but let's think out loud in terms of what we do a a deal of reporting is getting clicks these days correct I mean you you want people to come to your Web site or your social media page or to re tweet\nYour remarks and and the people of Wisconsin are wonderful and the people of northern Wisconsin I've been to Milwaukee I've been to Green Bay I've been to\nMadison but I've never been north to this wonderful place most of it All right but I'm going to presume that there aren't as many people to click and most any as there are in Manhattan I'm just going to guess that effect as I said ...\nAlright alright so lock her up because it's controversial an edgy\nAnd refers to a part of the president's campaign this is\nA during twenty six gene when he was um using aggressive rhetoric against his opponent Mr Clinton lock her up has become a way of demonstrating that the president hasn't changed at all and two years and if you're going to lead with the headline about most of the I'm guessing\nYou wouldn't leave with a headline about how the crowd was entertain 'cause that would rather people have most of the clicking on that you ... you would leave with lock her up is that a fair guess\nI think that's a fair guys and I think also I just sitting on the ground observation lock her up with kind of you ingest almost like this is like a a thing like Aaron ... if you're going to say it there was one guy but it doesn't really when I was talking on the crowd is that as a smile and it was almost like I'm not a Trump rally I'm gonna make this joke but it wasn't it wasn't talking about Hillary by any chance\nLet let's let's let's remind everyone who's never who's been to a Trump rally your memory of it being happy is correct and let's be who've never been to one I attended the president's speech at the park and February\nIt is it is a ... he's chiefly a performer he's out of them\nI literally and people were just so excited I mean so so John that there's this long long line right to get through security and to the end to the rally right and you walk across as big field and you're there the small tarmac at the airport but there's this large fields where the lions winding\nAnd everybody's in a good mood and the crowd and blowing up carefully and it's it's sort of like a fourth of July picnic where everybody's waiting for the hotdogs\nOh absolutely and everybody's Wagner there from here and there are selling Trump here and there was music being played and to the song there are a bunch of you know American American bombs being played um but then there is\nUh we are the champions and we will Rockies that's kind of songs eat expect from Trump um but it was it was a lot of fun absolutely and the American flags everywhere\n[noise] what did he say about Wisconsin about the political race in Wisconsin Governor Walker icy is hard pressed and\nUh the reelection

uh and and crime uh all the way up to our border\nBut the seems to me to be a a conflict in in the way we respond to what do you so as we summarized we how we got to where we are today in the in

is the John ... show high most well ... my colleague and friend the deputy head of the foreign policy affairs department of Azerbaijan in the presidential administration\nPick met ... who is here from ... to comment on the visit of the national security adviser John Bolton to buck code to discuss critical themes for the region the south caucuses and the Caspian Sea bass and\nBut also for the United states of America in these last days before the U.S will impose very strong sanctions on Iran which neighbors as about Sean and his dealing always with the unknown ambitions of Russia which neighbors Azerbaijan\nAnd also is keen the United states and the Trump Administration to resolve the frozen like conflict between Azerbaijan and its neighbor Armenia\nDating back to the end of the Soviet Union and the late twentieth century pick them up a very good evening to you and thank you for visiting the first thing John Bolton visit\nTo and to sit with and speak with President at least I Want to know that this is extremely welcome because I Believe that the U.S has not visited for some time and there have been very few visitors at John Bolton level to discuss critical matters is that all correct good evening to you ...\nA good evening John and thank you for within a ... a about with us in a relationship\nYeah All right but we always have it within ... it's been a United States or the bike\nAnd jump off of them have you're going to have a core knowledgeable person and he's also a with a quote in the current you know it ... it was it and uh he had to adopt a discussion with my phone I'm On president Ali\nAnd they had that change where you are on such a promotional you write it down pat and shit and many of the area\nAnd he also writes we mentioned but otherwise it's but it's ... or in a country and it made a joke but they just wait a important region and uh we got a job but we ... a energy cooperation quite against terrorism to go to their latest cooperation\nAnd many others wears a trace of cooperation between the United states either by trial\nLet's begin with energy because uh my visit last summer was right before a very important document was signed in the Caspian Sea bass and to make possible for Turkmenistan to join with Azerbaijan\nDo connect to Europe with natural gas which\nProvides energy security for NATO and for our friends in Europe I'm going to assume that that is all going very well and John Bolton was there to secure\nHow good this is that as a by Sean and Turkmenistan and the base and are participating in the support for NATO do I have that correct\nA ... year Sean I just wanted to add that in general we either by John olive valued United States for true and as you both your closet by John ... over the age of the gap independent uh anything that they should have the Soviet Union when I go into the end of independence\nBut what about that time for other white got about eight or it's a I was like I'm public I mean I it's called ... also joined a A N construction or that they can and be part of the world on the other way gas oil and gas in the surface of international market\nSince then our lunch counters that energy at all and it caught on the other but John Cleese and ... and ... it's like you're ready to go in countries\nWildly allies and partners uh you know I could stay\nOut of ... ambition gas for just let the come up on top of that takes CAT scan of the gas to the European market ought to be also a shake the United states support to reach project but as I began a gas or the or doors for you\nTo a joke and find out what he told me and a European Union member countries including and let me tell ya and some others will get benefit from with energy corporation you also write the nation's a like a convention owns the stages of the Caspian Sea with my other presumptive almost a tremendous with contributed to his ...\nUh finally we have in all ... states of the cat fantasy and also be called the constitution of the Caspian Sea\nPort wise and predictability and security in the Caspian Sea basic I don't support white to cooperation among the wizard of country\nIncluding a in a a security on that for weddings security and safety or in the white castle at sea bass and and the ... approach will continue our corporations that it's all countries of course the United states support to all of his ... or more to much welcome\n... ... it's a with a ... for John Bolton we discussed extensively interviewed cooperation in the United states and Azerbaijan\nThe concern here you know as we approach the severe sanctions on Iran which the U.S regards as the chief sponsor of terrorism in the planet\nIs that sanctions on Iran because it's your neighbor and because you share road systems and transportation and the Caspian Sea\nThe U.S I see from John ... voice of America does not want to damage Azerbaijan ... economy as well I'm assuming that was part of the discussion between president ... and John Bolton that the sanctions do not hurt our friend Azerbaijan\nAnd yet you are in general foreign policy novel foreign policy we are seeing a witness relations and other kind of has managed to establish that quote a partnership and wasn't able to relations with its a neighboring countries including Russia and Iran and some other countries\nAnd uh that is no alternative or having a normal unstable relations with the neighboring countries\nAnd therefore are we are also looking for a for\nA better on the funding from our friends are in the United states all the regional a context almost as developments and because either by John\n... is a it's in a corporation was regional countries on of course I was in that context on that age you know an international issues have been discussed\nAnd Ken just repeating myself not what a game but otherwise gone up to that of emphases on for the development of the regional cooperation on good cooperation but the neighboring countries and uh once again simply that is no alternative ... until we also appreciate what I Want ... on the fact that he's you know come to some other John development that's\nYes I see John Bolton is sensitive to that in his remarks to the voice of America where there's an English translation as well as translated into the languages of the region\nA Armenia Armenia I visited the front lines in the ... when I saw was an ongoing tragedy damage to the land damage to the environment and no one is prospering either in Armenia or ... or announcer by John because of this frozen conflict\nI ... I read that John Bolton speaks of this as well and hopes to move the process so word peacefully is that a fair summary of his visit does each contribute anything that will help in this conflict\nWho is about to make a case standing before the Supreme Court about an issue that you've all heard of class action suit what you didn't know and I've learned from Ted now\nIs that class action suit benefits the law firms bringing them but in the case of very large class action suit such as a recent one against Google\nThe actually offended parties get almost nothing if nothing at all\nThis is a twenty first century version of ambulance chasing to my to my amateur eyes shed a very good evening to uh this is a revelation to me that law firms are in the business\nOf chasing class action suits not to share it with the offended or harmed or litigants but to in fact cut it up for themselves or directed in some fashion\nOr two powers of their wishes they says ... Seventeen stroke non sixty one Frank versus cows you're the Frank\nYou're arguing on Halloween to do with a federal rule of civil procedure about class action suits wear ... according to the quote that you provided to me where so doing is quote superior to other available methods for fairly unofficially adjudicating the controversy\nThe question before the court is whether or and what circumstances\nA sigh press that trust law doctrine award of class action proceeds to provide no direct relief to class members supports class certification and comports with the requirement that a settlement binding class members must be fair and reasonable an adequate my amateur translation is\nThey're going to decide whether it's okay for the law firms to get everything and the litigants or offended part is to get nothing what is your presentation to the court jak good evening to\nThank you thank you for having me the conditions in the court is before a court can approve the settlement under the rules of civil procedure to have to make a finding that it's ... an adequate\nAnd it's not fair and reasonable by definition of the attorneys are getting all the money in the class is getting nothing and trying to hide that the classes getting nothing by steering money to third parties in this case the attorneys all the martyrs it's an alumni donation using the classes money basically\nA doesn't make it an unfair settlement fair the\nParticular case if I follow correctly and Ted is my guide here I'm just reading is Google Google offending or the the class action team because it took advantage of privacy restrictions and didn't adequately follow or provide information\nTo those using you know we all use Google so we're all in on this and the estimate of the New York times article right up of this is we're all due for sense that's not going to happen because it's inefficient so therefore the eight point five million dollars or portions up\nEntirely to the law firm is that right cat\nIt goes to law firm and then a basically a slush fund of organization that the law firms and Google wanted the money to go to a and you know these are suit alleging violations of federal law and if the crew\nThe violation of a class number with the title to a thousand dollars so that clearly didn't think they could actually prevent this\nThey settle it for as you note force them to class member now we're not asking for the force but you have this eight million dollar pot of money and you can find a way to distribute it to class members the reality is\n... these notices in the mail and and you can make the pot of money available to people who filed claims to get the notices and say yes I Want my shirt that eight million dollars and the reality are so few people ask for the money you could distribute five or six dollars per climate uh I\nHad these notifications over the years because of the end of certain companies that I purchased or the companies went out of business because they sold out and they send me this document saying you're part of a class action suit and I say I don't want anything to do with that so I run away from it\nAnd and that's what most people do a lot so it's possible to get money to the class if they actually want to write a they just didn't want to do that because they'd rather see the money go to their own them out\nAnd the four and the court is in this case this is the Ninth Circuit court that's a pretty big court had been out west they dominate the west the Ninth Circuit court isn't going to apply the law firms at issue and you you give me their names one's in San Francisco not theory and John or young and the others in Colorado camera law\nThose law firms are not required by the federal government to make good to all the injured parties couldn't they do that isn't that imaginable\nIt it is and that's what other circuits have done we won cases in the seventh circuit in the ... circuit and the third circuit where the court says look the the attorneys have if I Do share a duty to their clients to\nGet the money to the clients first if you set up the legal rules like the Ninth Circuit did that the attorneys get paid no matter what well of course the attorneys are going to prefer to give it to a charity the Senate wants because then the defendant will say okay\nWe can get two million dollars to class or for a million dollars to our favorite charity and the attorneys say will give the four million you don't get the money to the class give it to your favorite charity and then we can get a larger attorney\nNow this is Google right Google were all have Google Google had easily communicate with all of it what do you want to do with your four cents John and that could give me boxes to check off you know the red cross or the ASPCA\nOr a protecting of a wild habitat they could do that and the law firm could direct Google to do that that's not that's not a painful ran the tea do you agree ...\nWell I mean there there's a reason they don't do that and that's because if they told the class members hey you can make a claim for a five dollar check or you can check this box and you could give it to my alma mater a ... everybody's going to demand there five dollars right there they're not or they're not going to make a claim at all\nUm they're not going to say I want the money to go to my lawyers favorite charity\nIf if I Want five dollars are going to charity I can write a five dollar check to charity or or bigger ... to ... um ... it but it it's that the lawyers are are are trying to not give consumers that choice and they don't want to because the consumers would want the money\nIs a well known problem cat has this been going on for a long time it's sort of a deal between lawyers in courts and we're all ignorant of it\nUh I mean it's been an increasingly big problem uh and it's going to get even bigger if the Supreme Court doesn't act or this year a another nine million dollars and it was a small class it was only a billion people it would have been and they had everybody's address what you would have been really easy to just bail everybody a check without\nEven asking them to check a box\nIt's just because we have too many lawyers and not enough work is just because of the lawyers in India who are doing jobs on line is there is some crisis and I didn't know about Ted we've got about a minute\nI I it's just we have the rules in place and judges aren't enforcing those rules because the the the attorneys have the incentive to to maximize their own attorney says\nIf you're in a class action suit you can do something you know ask you for your for censor your five dollars to the law firm as and say what the heck you didn't try to reach me you didn't try to give me any money at ten Frank is arguing this before the Supreme Court on Halloween he is the director of litigation\nAt the Competitive Enterprise Institute I'm John ... this is the
