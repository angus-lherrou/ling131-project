this and the news is indeed that as of right now for ... for\nBy the FBI and the supplemental\nPlace in New York Times investigation has found that Donald Trump received at least four hundred Thirteen million in today's dollars from his father's real estate empire much of it through tax Dodgers in the Nineteen nineties times reporter rescue\nDeveloped sort of a network of sources through its weird thing more than two hundred tax returns eventually they were filed by his father and his father's businesses over the years um in general letters and baking favors but really provided a very for sexual undercutting who will be concluded\nThis will help that because amongst other things that does require higher wages to be paid in countries like Mexico or or actually specifically in Mexico which gives them less of an advantage now\n... you know how this all sorts out in terms of international competition auto makers are gonna have to figure out how to uh not let their costs go way up so that become uncompetitive that's the flip side of raining in this kind of outsourcing to Mexico and other cheap\nLabor markets but you know what they're going to have to do that and probably they'll do it partly through automation which may\nUh remove some of the advantages for American workers but going forward I think the important thing was to get a deal inked now we have that and now\nTrump can turn its attention to the eight you enter Japan the big issue as we have discussed before or one of the big issues anyway is getting all of our trading partners\nIn agreement that the WTO\nNeeds to be reformed to\nRein in the bad practices of China China is still treated as a developing nation also the WTO has no rules that regulate the kind of state owned enterprises that figure so largely in China's economy they can cheat\nLegally if you will because the WTO has no rules to prevent them from doing that it's incredibly important we get that done and I think now that's what Lighthizer and these guys are going to turn their intentions to\nLose I've been having conversations about doing business in China with people who travel there frequently it is surprising and dumped founding to hear how aggressive the Chinese capital is our and shaking down and pirating and leaning on anyone doing business in China\nIt is surprising and discouraging to hear\nHow the Chinese government offers free factories to ah to companies to invest in China to bring businesses to China and\nThose free factories become the hub where your your prey to the supply chain it is surprising an alarming Liz to understand the citizens who traveled to China are routinely minded and watched and persecuted and must be very careful about how they speak I Do\nI Believe that the Trump Administration has done a good job here communicating to the American people that China is not a capitalist state is its piracy and ed brutalizes anybody who does business there\nWell I think you raise a really good points but by the way that's gone on for Twenty years I mean this is not a new\nIssue I remember reading a book ten or Fifteen Years ago about a fellow doing business in China and he laid out all the things you've talked about how it works how you go in set up shop at a local partner or two years later you find that local partners taken you know how and built an exact replica of your plant down the road and it's under selling you it isn't\n... there is nothing honest about the way people do business in China I don't think that's an exaggeration\nAmericans go in there because of the way we are brought up because the way our economy works expecting fair play they do not get that and I uh you know their secrets or stolen by the way the first\nStudy on that intellectual property theft that we've all talked so much about that was done in two thousand three again these are not new problems the good news in my view is that Donald Trump is finally\nSorting uh businesses\nAnd the country to stand behind him as he confronts China because by the way the stakes have gotten significantly higher we're not talking about a country that is knocking off the way we make T shirts anymore now the country has knocking off are very most sophisticated\nArtificial intelligence our programming or chip companies everything else they want to dominate they've made it they have a program laid out in ... called made in China twenty twenty five they wanted dominate high tech and they will use pirated a means to accomplish that goal so\nI agree with you a hundred percent I think it's alarming but it's not surprising ... the only thing that surprising is the way businesses react after they've been in China for a couple of years they find out that they've been duped but\nYou know what the good news is the message is getting out\nUh I don't you know I think that ah the chamber of commerce crew has finally figured out that this is not a place where they're going to make a lot of money because China won't let them\nAnd and they are perfectly the the interesting thing is a little bit culturally it's perfectly OK in China you're supposed to be brass knuckles fighters for your\nCompany and your enterprise and that's what they are\nAnd yet our lives is it popular known that if the PLO you're dealing with when it comes to technology and high tech and intellectual property is it properly known that wall way is a function of the pie LA they're they're they're spies they're they're\nThey're they Rob everything they touch is that popularly known I I'm not sure I I'm I'm kind of was dumbfounded as to what I've just been listening to\nI don't think ah no I don't think it's well known but I Do think as if it's frankly a people read the news with any care they will find out more and more about what's going on in\nChina you know for years I Would occasionally get an email from some university professor saying we had a Chinese delegation come to visit our University of Michigan Tech lab or whatever\nAnd I'm pretty sure that those guys stole documents that was just routine we had I mean honestly I don't think anything has been safe or\nSacred and our dealings with the Chinese I Do think people are waking up to it and by the way now again as to the stakes having been increased\nWe also have these confrontations in the south China Sea which are getting a little more attention now very alarming a nachos to Americans but to the entire region I I mean I you know this is a country and particularly under is easing paying\nA who has been become incredibly aggressive and\nAggressive on all fronts militarily economically et cetera the good news is what you do hear coming back is the Chinese are afraid of Donald Trump they think that he is unbridled a and aggressive and heat that they really does mean business so was it that really\nWill provoke any kind of change in their behavior I don't\nKnow the U.S embassy a alarm them lose what you read of that I mean they they believe they could buy your I guess they think they can buy Canada as well\nI think that's true I I think they felt that\nThat Donald Trump but sort of a blunder bus and he was sort of wrecking all these trade arrangements making people angry all over so they had instituted a charm offensive particularly with the e you trying to make sure that we did not partner with the EU with Japan with South Korea\nIn trade agreements and again with reforming the WTO in ways that would disadvantage that Chinese I think they were very uh\nAnd I think they were optimistic remember oh I think six to eight months ago they profit for some pretty mild a terror of a reduction in ... and thinking I think thinking that that was going to be that that they would ... you know that are\nUm a posturing versus them was sort of play acting and all they needed to say was here's some concessions instead of twenty percent or import duties on soybeans is ten and that's not the right product but it was things like that\nAnd all and the Trump Administration turn right around and said no that's not sufficient and I think that really set them back on their heels because there used to American politics and politicians who don't\nDo what they say and do say what they mean a and I think this has been a real education I go back to the first time is easing paying met with Donald Trump or a member of that we can at mar a Lago\nBut Chuck where ... yeah\nYeah where he ... he written excused himself from dinner and basically a allowed us to bomb Syria in a very very obvious message to the Chinese that we mean business and that there's a new sheriff in town and I I think that message was received loud and clear\nLoose peek a shoes on Fox News and she writes for the hill as well and when we come back to domestic news

MCA a ... ... and in a moment but first trade coalition of the willing it has the ring of a Kudlow invention what does it mean Larry good evening to\nGet anything done wonderful back well look quite simply um\n[noise] what you're seeing now with our our called them renewed relations trade relations with the European Union and Japan uh we by the way find the tribe apartheid agreement at the un meeting last week a\nForming a coalition a against all the um\nChinese missteps illegals\nProtections feeling you know I ... ... technology transfers a tariff non tariff barriers so spell it out very plainly that's the first time the big powers a huge fan of us\nI've actually come together in a statement a which was issued up at the un um bats are Lighthizer night one for the press as soon as we got it okay that was a major move and then of course quickly this week we moved to the ah\nUS MCA I learned how to say that a guy called NAFTA which is actually quite an extensive agreement I'm not sure folks appreciate what's gone on\n... problem is China right that's the center of the broken trading system and we are now on the same page\nUh in fact the even the the Canadian Prime minister Trudeau\nWith President Trump in a in a phone call uh yesterday\nI talked about how to deal with um unfair trading practices from outside North America so everybody's pretty much on the same track right now and I I think it's a terrific turn for the better and um it bodes well this is you know hard going\nTrade negotiations probably the tough thing I've ever seen but\nNonetheless we are in prosperity and I believe these trade deals are going to help grow that prosperity and I'm trying to get the message I Can't be sure but they do\nI'm counting Larry twenty eight countries in the European Union ah UK I'm going to include in the twenty eighth for the moment Japan and the three\nCountries of North America that's thirty two altogether thirty two democracies\n... uh at this point stating that China that you must mend your ways that you are in violation of the WTO Larry there's no exaggerating China they have been brutal towards everyone for the last decade decade this isn't a problem that the Trump Administration inherited\nFrom the Bush the Clinton the Bush and the Obama administration and you're the first team that stood up to China and China is speechless at this point thirty two democracies saying no more\n[noise] yes well it's a very important the way you put that some people are blaming President Trump a for using all it means that disposal including corrupt it's always part negotiations but the reality is dumped by truck he inherited this and he's trying to fix it\nYou'd like to get rid of tariffs and non tariff barriers and so forth a heavy you'd like to have fair trade and these are like that reciprocal trade and he liked to have China play by the rules which they do not do and having for about Twenty years or as you mentioned other presidents\nHave mentioned it but they always back off a President Trump has the backbone as my full support in this and I think you know\nWe may come out of this on the other side and very good shape it may be a tremendous boon to the world economy but it's very important that the allies I've got a call the allies John Yoo Japan us\nMexico and Canada make their trade deal we upgraded and modernize NAFTA now\nAh we're making our trade deal and we're making our statement and I can only hope that China will listen we're willing to negotiate it off to China or in any serious way so far it's been quite unsatisfactory but we'll see\nLarry China's violation of the WTO is not the whole of it this piracy practiced with brutal tactics if anybody trying to do business in China\nTheft of intellectual property is part of it but also everyone going to China's watch there's intimidation this is not to China Hu Jintao not that China\nDoes the beginning of this century this says Xi Jinping's a tyranny in practice now also being aggressive geopolitically the confrontation with the USS Decatur these last days I Believe that what you at the Trump Administration\nNot only talking about trade Larry you're talking about piece of the planet you're\nTalking about a a rogue nation that has to be that has to comply with international law limits\nWhether I'm not at China scholar I'm learning fast on the job but I I Will say that the brilliant reforms both the market reforms the\nTrade reforms and the political reforms that were lost by ... many years ago uh eighties nineties right toward a twenty two thousand\nThat stopped yes that stopped I'm under President Xi and that's the most regrettable and I think a lot of people including myself think they're moving in the wrong direction I mean for example just in the trade economic sphere why biggest problems is\nAmerican companies and it's true by the way other not America these companies want to open in China\nThey are not permitted ownership China insists on these so called joint ventures which are in most cases provides them with fifty one hundred and fifty three or fifty five percent ownership us as a minority stake color white there is a huge problem\nFor the simple reason that the Chinese owners can command the American business people to literally lay down their prints on the desk\nAnd from there the technology opens up and that's how they do the stealing and that that is a force\nA turnover technology that is in and said the essence now they had some very tiny false starts with it give some small financial companies ownership guess what they will not grant ... they will not well I had a wonderful conversation with\nThe president at Google late last week I because there have been some issues you know are you being fair to conservatives and so forth and we talked about the world situation Google with lots of open it up and try to get you know they walked out years of censorship but he's running up against same problem\n... leads the economy he Farley healthcare here are leaked immigration so that's a problem for a priority high camp you go to West Virginia John and there's a problem for Joe mansion state that Donald Trump does it get five times in part to put pressure on ... situations like this\nIs mentioned for cabinet John ... says he'll win that race by about twenty five to thirty points but if he votes against cabinet John\nThat lead shrinks to all of two points so very simple for any votes for cabinet game over the votes against kept a game on so this is a very problematic calculation red state Democrats right now\nOne more twist bill I've been told by David Tucker my colleague at Washington Examiner that a democratic operative mentioned to him last week sort of mumbled out of the side of his mouth ironically that the thing to fear from the Democrats as an empty seat on November sixteenth on the court does that make sense to you\nA please locked\nUp in other words Kevin ... is not confirmed and the Supreme Court remains at eight seats and that the future is unknown and the next democratic operative was anxious because that would encourage your reaction from the Republicans I guess we're already seeing it it doesn't have to be empty\nYeah it's got to be empty I did it I think it's two things here number one just the way they've played this game last minute dropping those commission on him that sixth extremely personal that frustrates Republicans but secondly John when you look at survey after survey what motivates Republicans and Democrats the Supreme Court is a\nBigger issue for Republicans and Democrats plain and simple so\nUh the issue of America ... for example you would think Democrats would have been so enraged to twenty sixteen about miracle and it turned out numbers to punish Donald Trump Republicans but that didn't happen but they're twenty Eighteen this issue does drive Republicans loopholes\nTurnout in Texas this is ... congressman and Ted Cruz senator and I keep seeing pictures on Twitter these enormous crowds so has something changed from the red state of Texas\nBeto O'Rourke is sort of the beautiful cat people's candidate and the great state of Texas is doing big rallies Willie Nelson as jamming at his rallies and it's all kind of the great progressive could buy a moment\nBut here's the problem Beto O'Rourke is very popular a spot willy Nelson he\nLikes to go on the likes of bill ... Bill Maher show on HBO but it remains to be a state of Texas is that progressive there's a month ago and that race Ted Cruz is going to spend a lot of money as they try to introduce bed or work at a very negative light to Texas voters but the simple leveraging voting to Texas John where there's a governor's race sitting on top of the Senate race\nThe governor but very popular incumbent Republicans seeking reelection he'll when I was raised by Fifteen to twenty points it's very difficult job to go for a Republican voting by Fifteen or twenty two a Democrat upsetting Republican incumbents so I don't think Texas left the time but it's just a narrative that the media love the idea of Texas somehow being democratic\nYou remind all of us at the voting is already underway does that favor either side [noise]\nUm it it's ominous for Republicans in Florida in particular where you look at Miami Dade County which Democrats need to uh to win the gubernatorial Senate races in that state and turnout is up sharply or I should say the request early balances up shortly so that it\nThat his arm of the Republicans look at the question of your of your walk up voter fueled the day folks\nNow this is the Trump strategy you're twenty six tend not to put a lot of trust in the early voting the Clinton campaign did the Trump campaign thought it would get a large walk up voting succeeded very well for them so the question is can Republicans do it again and twenty Eighteen strictly that's very hard to do with maternal elections\nDrunk we also turn to the year of the woman or the look for the woman you mentioned in your Forbes peace now there is a woman Kennedy and Tennessee Marsha Blackburn but she's facing a centrist Democrat at least it he passes for centuries these days\nPhil Bredesen so are the advantages to women when their democratic candidates and not to Republican when they're women Kennedy\nYeah it does work that way for Republicans does it and that's part because of the so called war and one in ... is the Democratic trope a Marsha Blackburn\nHas a couple of problems of one is that she is part of the system she's part of Washington and former governor brightest and it's not so he's running as an outsider secondly it's interesting you look at her on the stump in terms of talking about accomplishments in Washington She's not talking about number one thing that the house has done this year which was a tax cut she's she's not bringing that up\nThe decision is made major network set the evening shows especially the show that is popular on CBS I Believe I don't watch the bill I might get this wrong is going to cover the election as if they're the election desk is this a good thing for the Democrats are confusing things for voters in general\nUh this is the Daily Show we're talking about what\nBut on the comedy channel at a Comedy Central is a bad thing for Republicans secret large jock like several things have come along in the past twenty five thirty years which are just absolutely poison the well politically one else they'd be on the Internet and yet a quarter and so forth which makes you know\nCollege acting more cowardly uh but I think also the advent of John Stewart who I have no personal against the debt\nBut the problem is this is where young people turn for quote unquote news and information and he's meditate or none ... so young people from the political views on what has very snide sarcastic reporting it makes them more cynical about the process so I Would just encourage young people just\nLook elsewhere for the news just don't buy into this as a\nBill in the next day the Mitch McConnell the majority leader in the Senate says that he's going to bring Kavanaugh for a vote on the floor of the Senate up or down at this point I don't have any special information\nIs that going to be forgotten issue the way we forgot that op ed in the New York times about somebody inside the Trump Administration trying to undermine the president wrote the way we've rub forgotten about all the other scandals unless they're in front of us that day are we going to forget capital\nYou just all my life I was gonna say John two weeks ago you and I are pondering who wrote that in order to start writing the ... and\nNow what I Know I think Kevin us fix because I think this gets to the heart of a of a central question Republicans the idea of the court the idea of legislating from the bench as something that really does to find the right person to the west so I don't think this one goes away as a campaign issue\nAnd therefore the vote on friday will be remembered both sides will use it in advertising they'll pound is with it Kavanaugh Kavanaugh forever the court goes away but Kavanaugh is with us is that it\nOr they Kevin knows what this job because Kevin I worked very well for the Democrats the terms of votes in the house in terms of suburban districts and the women's vote but it works very well for Republicans red states so you know what is the Donald Trump thinks he can always get what you what you get what you need both parties get what they need\nFinal consideration has Russia gate disappeared bill you notice I didn't ask about it is it gone Rosen scene of vanish\nWhat has been it gets keeps cutting postponed the truck um that's one of the variables in terms of October surprise that could happen trouble of actually meet with him what Trump decides to our and before the election\nNo no no no not they're not going to happen I I I I think we've forgotten Russia gate bill Hi I'm the only I mean I my show we talked about it all the time but I Can't get anybody's attention bill well in both to think yeah go ahead\nSay two things which are which catalogs eclipse number one

last week's including of course the last ... hours when an ambassador to NATO indicated that the U.S might have to take out Russian intermediaries intermediate missiles\nIn violation of the start treaty and a member of the cabinet said the U.S might work does have the capability of black hating\nRussian energy supplies that would be a crippling the nation and an act of war she was discussing the myth understanding between Israel and Russia that happened immediately after the shoot down to the Russian and surveillance craft\nWhere the prime minister was eager to\nA calm the waters and the president of Russia was in a position of having many voices in his ears some of which were ready to react immediately please continue to\nPut his first reaction was to be conciliatory and excuse Israel\nThey all it was just such as the war zone in Syria it shows\nHow dangerous it is in the states get made I don't know if you use the expression fog of war but that's how Russian media interpreted his state\nThey couldn't didn't blame it on Israel but on the fog of war his own military said absolutely not Israel fully responsible the prime minister of Israel the ER and his defense minister Lieberman writes I\nWanted to fly to Moscow that day\nI imagine this now John they wanted to see proof and persuade them of some ... said no you can't come\nAnd the reason you can't come you didn't say this was is that I Can't let you come in light of what my military\nIs saying is that you are responsible so interested in Israel sent a low level military delegation the upper shot was\nIs that who switched positions\nAnd adopted the position either because he was persuaded by the evidence the ministry of defense gaming or because his political position wasn't tenable Fifteen Russians had died that's not nothing John\nFifteen Americans die I mean we've come we don't pay attention Afghanistan but if they died at rushing hands someplace that would be an uproar in this country\nAnd I believe that it included a general officer or who was a ... a prominent in Russian defence industry and we're talking specialist and surveillance aircraft these were not where are the ones who were these were not draftees\nDirect so we're looking at an incident that has been a blow to the Russian military no matter who did it in the Syrian sit at the but the Russian reaction has been halfway belligerent to then say we're going to deploy as three hundred which is where I'm politically different capability than the two hundred that shop down the the surveillance crap\nSo now prudent has to make a decision\nAll it would appear\nThat he was being told by some members of his military\nBecause they blamed Israel for having position the planes as it did and having done it on purpose\nThat Russia's shoot down a few Israeli planes insurance I mean they wanted really aggressive action who was going to do that but the decision he made his ram a fine and we ought to talk about what it means if we know what it means for many years Syria\nAnd also by the way around\nHas wanted this air\nYou know surface to air defense system known as the S. three hundred which are now there appear to be an older and newer variant of this and the report is is that ... having made the decision\nNow at last after three years four years of Syria asking for it to give this system just are Russians will operate it not sure what it's a powerful system we don't have anything like your\nExperts agree that it has multiple it asks you to shoot down multiple aircraft over something like I don't know two hundred and fifty five hundred I mean it has an enormous range in effect\nWho could declare a no fly zone over this area of Syria now so this changes everything\nBecause the Americans are operating mirror the Iranians are operating barely Israelis all this is a very big decision for who he so far as I Know\nHas never given any country\nThere is also for hundreds system which the Chinese one and he may give it to the Chinese but that's a separate relationship\nUh Americans are not in a Chinese combat show\nSteve I talked with them is a former Israeli generally know leads a think tank in Tel Aviv and he indicated the three hundred system if deployed and there's some question whether it will be deployed because they've talked this way before if deployed would be in the hands of Russian agents\nNot given to the Syrians that still doesn't solve the possibility of accident but it does remove the possibility that there'll be another incident such as a couple of weeks back there was a twist here\nIf that system is deployed around or in the vicinity of Iranian missile factories which I Believe was the target for the Israeli air raid that led to the Syrian firing missiles in all directions\nThat means that the Russians will be in a being a place where they have to decide if they're going to stand down\nPending an Israeli air raid it's not a good story Steve it's not going to need fashion\nWell let's look at first of all this look at the political applications it means now officially that Russia's will come to protectorate\nOf sharia correct\nCompletely correct politically it was a protectorate\nThat has to say ... representing Assad the president of Syria in world affairs now\nAssuming this has got to be a no fly zone you'll need Russia's permission to fly operation\nWhat must not happen is an American or Israeli airstrike killed a Russian that must not happen\nWell that's why I say we now moved to new level in the dangers of the new Cold War while we're sorting out the ... that we've been distracted but this is really something new and important\nThe second thing it tells you is that if you weigh the geo political things in terms of victory and the loss is\nI don't like to do it but there's no question that went poof entered Syria three just about exactly three years ago September two thousand this thing and everybody in the west that it would be a disaster and the Russians couldn't do anything with from that moment\nBecause it was Russia that destroy the Islamic state not the United states in Syria to now becoming and remember Mrs Clinton had argued during the two thousand sixteen presidential election that she was president she would declare a no fly zone over Syria so Russians couldn't fly there\nYou can see how far potent and Russia have come on the world stage by this this fact I mean I don't want to say it in a primitive way because of world politics\n[noise] so this is geography or Russia annexed Crimea\nWhich is a connection with no natural land border with Russia except through Ukraine and the Ukraine border has been closed So Russia has had to supply Crimea it's very expensive\nEither by air or sea about four months ago folks might have seen the TV footage of it it was very dramatic Russia's been building I think is fourteen mile bridge I don't know if it's the longest British in the world is a very long bridge\nFrom southern Russia to Crimea and it's going to have as I understand it three bridges actually won for automobiles one for trucks and one will be for trains the one for\nTrucks I think I've got this right open five months ago and putting drove the first truck truck a trunk of a truck across the one for automobiles so like if I wanted to go to Russia\nAnd visit Crimea I could now drive a wouldn't have to apply a that's to be open\nAnd I think the rail bridge is probably about Eighteen months away that means that the port of ... now you and I talked about or you will remember this\nI Do remember there was an offensive a drunk driving and Mario pull that right up big guns rattled in those last week of the hot\nWar well that's right into fourteen when the civil war began\nA following the fall of Ukraine's president on them by Don square and the uprising Mary ... was taken by the rebels is a very very important seaport maybe the most important in Ukraine I'm not sure but it's very very important and\nThe rebels held it for about two weeks and then the Ukrainian army controlled by Kiev took it back and controls it today [noise]\nSo since the bridge has been Russia has become very interested in the sea lanes of Mary ... or what sits on the sea of viruses off which is a tributary of the black sea the whole region is the black sea\nUh Russia has been moving warships and I guess these little boats whatever you call them these patrol boats into the area and it's been stopping certain\nFlag burning shift and examining what's on board them Ukrainian Turkish French I think Russia has since said this is our water now\nAre ... and and legal or if it stays a certain number of miles from Mary ... borders at whatever age three miles or twelve miles but it's been a\nRandomly stopping ships the president of Ukraine punishment gal who has single digit support\nAnd is up for reelection quite soon in March I think of next year has declared he's got a ...\nIn the house all see Russia with his naval power which Ukraine doesn't have much it has some ships and these two ships that the United states sent to Ukraine you told me John really are at war vessels or patrolled though\nRight unless you're a ... unless you're a smuggler no they wouldn't have thought of another warship\nBut the significance of this in my mind is it's been dangerous enough in Ukraine but it's been frozen the fighting has been going on in a boss off the line that divides a gun boss from Kiev control\nUkraine has meant that the fighting has been spilled into this other part of Ukraine civil war has been kind of remote\nFrom people that goes on people die every day uh to Kiev army still shells during the day when kids go to school they're not supposed to an all reports say that they do they're all sorts of proposals to end this war but this is an escalation because it now could become a war it see and ...\nWhich is ... I'm not sure I pronounce it that you Mary ... is terribly terribly important and Russia will now uh bring pressure to bear there\nAs it feels it has a right and Ukraine depending on what Washington\nOh we'll do something so we can see here now on water\nThe un Adam ration of foreshadowing other kind of catastrophe that took place in September in Syria where people died now in this case it's Ukrainian and Russians\nDo the difference between them is often hard to tell both Russians most Ukrainians speak Russian uh as well as Ukrainian so this is a new emerging\nHot spot in the new Cold War and it couldn't get much worse very quickly depending on what Trump does and here is a question in my mind that we probably won't discuss tonight and you probably know the answer but\nWho is making these policies in Washington\nBecause Trump clearly doesn't want a war for ... soup with Russia and yet look at all the quotations examples that you cited today and recording by officials of the American government they're very warfare Trump clearly was not in control\nA rash of balls washing so why we have this new and I think more dangerous Cold War we have an almost unprecedented situation in Washington\nWhere the president whatever we think about him\nIs not in control ... at least a policy toward Russia which raises the question who then is just to post script then I'll quit you'll remember I'm sure they didn't to sixteen President Obama got it in his mind to cooperate with Russia against terrorists in Syria\nAnd they struck an agreement secretary of defense carry once a Moscow now with ... they shook hands it was destroyed by the department of defense which attacks Syrian troops and that was the end of that\nSo it's not without precedent conflict or opposition or perhaps sabotaged the President Trump faces when he tries to quote cooperate with Russia\nDavid detail here to mention for another week but perhaps\nOil is above eighty a above eighty five and I'm told by people who watch it as professionals that it's headed towards a hundred dollars food and is not in a bad way if ... goes to a hundred dollars do you agree we have thirty seconds\nRussia's federal budget is in the process\nWhere the oil at sixty this is this is world prices not ... right right So Russia is well above that now but I Will ask your question all water in the world would possess this minister this the secretary American Interior to threaten\nA naval blockade against Russia\nHaving to do with the export of energy it sounds like economic competition by warfare means it has nothing to do it and he just said he didn't want Russia shipping\nEnergy it's a very strange from our guy I Will look into it professor professor Stephen F Cohen New York university Princeton University it's good to have him back on air we had a lot of where there are a lot more incidents to recover but we've done the best we can for the first week\nI'm John bachelor this is the John ...

Sanders might argue that the\nMark it doesn't create the outcomes that they want would want it to create but this is a perfect example of the competition for workers heating up to the point where now workers have the bargaining power and\nWalmart and target and a Wal Mart are all in a an Amazon are all in\nA massive competition for workers uh they've been raising wages consistently for the last

inflation even if it slow and a workers are ah spoiled for job opportunities right now\nSo it's hard to imagine things being much better\nAnd finally you mentioned Wal Mart several times Wal Mart has a great big fancy operation did Walmart missed the boat when they didn't create Amazon what's your opinion Michael they ... they had everything at one point Nineteen Ninety five and then along comes beds out do they do they do they worry at night that they missed it\nI'm I'm certain they do because they're already trying to hustle to catch up in the Internet space but I look at this story as a general uh\nExample of how good market economies are because they are uh businesses have to be flexible and responsive to consumer demands\nA Twenty years ago you and I might not have been able to say

evening to you this is something I worried about you and I talked about it for weeks\nThat mosque was getting ahead of himself he was speaking out attorney was trash talking he was making boast\nThe FCC closed in because of his remarks about raising private capital for Tesla overseas but really it's a demonstration that mosque ... these last years has other reached the limit or needs to go away for a while to recharge good evening to you about\nThat well I don't agree with you on that I think that this to me struck me\nAs much might have misspoken and made a mistake on Twitter but uh you know they are you anybody they could go after almost anybody if they wanted to it to me that struck me as a SEC is like a bunch of mobsters you know night business you have their line would be a shame if something happened to it\nSo they went after him and they got him and this is with Tesla specifically separate for space sex they got him and Tesla to each paid twenty million dollars he used to give up his chairmanship for the next three years and then to install the independent chairman into a new board members a Tesla but must schools are made on the board\nI Would say that that means that he's really not going to be his influence is not going to be reduced very much which is what are the stock of that company really watch the stock holders they want him there whether it reduces his activity a little bit Tesla to give a little bit of arrest because I think his biggest problem is just simply\nA overworking himself he needed he'll he can bring yourself out if you just don't take a little bit of a break and so I think that that's that's the one question in my mind but as far as I'm concerned this is this is the government once again just a a a bullying people\nA sob above a

not they're not making remarks about public public or a public company saying I can go raised private capital in the heck with the stock price\nAnd it's costing money there's no doubt about it but I at any time the government steps in here I just my instinctual reaction is that uh I don't trust them are I don't live as you said to me that Wall Street hates mosque that indicates to me than they might be trying a pin a\nPin him down in ways that have nothing to do with you know protecting\nAlright I'll keep an eye on it Bob forget we got this time we'll see if he stays away from trash talking
