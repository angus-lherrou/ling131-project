San Francisco Jeff the news that the streets of San Francisco are no longer acceptable is reached here in the east coast so that it becomes a routine feature\nHowever there's a new mayor and there's reason now for San Francisco compelling reason to clean up is it happening good evenings huge yeah\nCommunity and John it continues to be a problem for San Francisco a problem if they just cannot get their hands around every time they think they're headed in the right path or a new problem pops up it's kind of like that'll whack a mole game\nBut the problem is now spreading outside the city in the sense that it's become a reputational threat to the city and we're already seeing\nConventions pullout from the ... those are huge money makers for the area we're seeing a other areas outside of the United states say maybe you don't want to go there anymore to their uh you know to their national don't travel there it's not safe it's not clean\nAnd unfortunately San Francisco which at one time was really one of the most incredible cities uh in California certainly that states\nUh is now being looked at as kind of a sad joke and it's it's one that you keep your repeated over and over it's seems to be on the front page of every\nPaid yet everyday and tell us what's the worst part of San Francisco just people listening to us if they need to go there for business what should they avoid Jeff for this street life we're not talking about violence in after dark we're talking about walking down the street and daylight what's the worst part\nYou would probably want to steer clear of areas around the six center and what they call the tender line which is kind of what wall people refer to as Skid Row type areas and then when you go down those streets it's a drug needles everywhere human waste everywhere\nPan handle in daylight in the middle of the day ride but the but the police enforce parking but they don't do anything about what's happening on the sidewalk\nThat is the big complaint that they seem to have enough resources to write parking tickets and Jay walking tickets but not enough to stop the climate and the filth\nThe way we offset how bad it is in San Francisco as we raised immediately to the story of Los Angeles Jeff downtown Los Angeles I recall from my trips there and especially back in Ninety four during the year the quake\nDowntown Los Angeles is near the city center staple center and over to the train station was a replica of the ... and the ancient ... old California life with lots of tourists in restaurants and merchandise what's happened\nOver there are street which was the center of that area you're talking about was a place for tourists would come or families would go on weekends where schools will take their kids on field trips to learn about California in Los Angeles as history it's heritage but now that has been changed because they put a whole new homeless shelter in the area\nPlus the continued growth of the homeless population the problems associated with a downtown\nSo you'd have tourists not visiting anymore you have merchants losing a lot of money you have schools pulling out these educational opportunities and somebody's merchants or even a ... a tempting to sue the city of Los Angeles saying why did you put it right here right well we're trying to make money now you're scared every one off this is what's happening in downtown LA\nMayor Garcetti is running for president I Believe he's he because there's a new mayor in San Francisco but mayor Garcetti is extremely extremely practiced in managing the city is he responding\nHe's responding very lightly he he says the right words but nothing seems to really happen that there's\nA problem with trash right now in a number of the downtown city areas where it it's pile up in some places five feet tall and that's not an exaggeration and you have a you know farming just coming out of the woodwork and uh so his response to that is all three hundred thousand dollars that\nFrankly the problem is in the millions just for the clean up the downtown area but that's about all he does is just for some money on that we're not seeing any long term plans for sanitation for homelessness for the woman problem\nIt's we've talked about this for a long time John but it really is getting worse it seems like it's it's like an exponential growth of these problems\nThese are the two big cities have California Jeff I think Los Angeles has a GDP that exceeds the planet Mars so their resources there to deal with it is there the will just pick up the trash is there the will to pick up the trash\nThat's exactly the problem is that the money is there are the resources there it's the will to get it done regardless of what they say\nWe've talked about type is on and off over these last month we got the fires took precedence for awhile aware is Jeff and uh what can they do about it\nThe first big outbreak a tie for this start\nIn the downtown area we're talking about and ... in Los Angeles in Los Angeles\nIn Los Angeles I'm Sorry and uh the outbreak is spreading because they believe that uh that homelessness and all of the all the associated problems that go with that the encampments down there are creating a lot of trash a lot of waste a lot of food scraps and then all of the animals all the rodents department that come in and\nIt's tied to spread by fleas and now\nThis this outbreak is really threatening to become an epidemic it's moved out to Pasadena which is a very nice city it's the place where they had the annual Rose Parade every New Year's\nAnd its move west to Long Beach or out near the beach and very nice areas out there they think it's moving along a a transit court or there the the rail line the light rail line but right now they don't have any answers and they don't know how to stop this aside from just telling people watch out get vaccinated those types of\nThings are the homeless and the big homeless ten so they in Pasadena and Long Beach as well as Los Angeles\nThere is a pretty sizable population a proportion wise in the Long Beach area because there are a lot of resources it's warmer weather out there\nNot as much in Pasadena past it hasn't been as open to it but frankly homelessness is now popping up everywhere in places that you never saw before even on the outskirts of some of the you know Tony is neighborhoods in Southern California\nThe department of motor vehicles now Jeff we in the east and certainly in the heartland of America have experience with the MPs and large cities so you're going to have to come up with a whopper here to top bar DMZ is\nWhen you go into a DMV ... office you expect that the calendar day you started in will be the same calendar day you ended but it'll be dark how is it in California\nOne can only hope and pray that it will be that way even though when you make appointments\nYou can wait in line between two to six hours actually for some people even you know the legislators are saying what do you mean you're not even doing what you're supposed to do so how do you know you shouldn't be\nAudited it's just it's crazy and uh it's getting worse there because the bureaucracy the rules about the ideas and things like that are making things more difficult and more like say during the appointments\nI'm beginning to feel better that I don't live in Los Angeles All right Jeff you are at the California State University at Long Beach or the executive director of media and you've solved a shock mystery how did you do it [noise]\nWell John uh about three weeks ago a young boy about Thirteen Years old was lobster fishing off the coast of San Diego\nAnd uh he was hit by a shark and he was bought shore and hospitalized then released\nA but our shark lab at Cal State Long Beach or has been working pioneering a new technique called a DNA environmental DNA so as a shark swim through the water or anything goes for the water at least traces of itself whether it's\nAn information a burst of information is social media right now capable of providing that information about these consumers what they want where they're going what what their dreams are\nYes great question I think that the the social media aspects to a certain extent might be starting to pull back a little bit there's the ongoing discussion in the U.S in\nA the you especially with GDP are in the regulatory environment that the Europeans are putting forward where that smartphone that you carry on your hip while an amazingly functional device is also\nBeing used to harvest data around you the consumer in a in a business model like a Google using Android software as or you're not necessarily the consumer your the product the amount of money generated and you can see Google's market capping the bottom line by\nPulling information on that consumer selling that information to branches is amazing slash scary at times but I think what you'll see is\nThat mobile device has been one of the key indicators and the the market is moving a little bit from the customer being the provider of all that data to the customer more opting in and building those circles building those engagements that they wish because there is a tremendous amount of what we'd call at\nFatigue in the world you might have fifty apps on your phone but you really use the same four or five\nFor the majority of the time spent how do you better reach that consumer an environment where the consumer does not feel like your spine are stepping on their privacy but you also wished to influence their decisions and tried to guide them down a path\nWell the old fashioned way would have been you looked at the bottom line each quarter about how much you sold and where you sold it what is the new fashioned way how does it work for us\n[noise] I think that the new fashioned way is really what can you do to convert a customer's\nWhether it be intent whether it be a thoughts towards a brand no longer is it simply a I win you lose where if I as a customer decide to transfer back that I'm going to have that customer from now till the end of time roughly forty\nTo forty seven forty eight percent of customers will go into a retail store for their first purchase but once they've done that first purchase and I know the quality or the capability that product and I'm happier satisfied with that product\nThen why wouldn't necessarily go to that retail store again I can simply have Amazon shipped out and shop on my door at no cost and with a hundred million users of Amazon Prime and the U.S alone today that's a real factor or threat to the physical based retailers of them becoming show rooms for completion by the direct sellers\nI think that the capability or the requirement is for a brand day retailer in this dialogue with customers to give that customer reason to continue to engage and continue that relevance and to be of service to that cost on an ongoing basis if you're not\nIf you're not engaging in driving a deeper relationship than the opportunity for that relationship to be lost is very high\nI read in the economists that this challenge of how to\n... how to have a conversation with your customer going forward is also true for the millennials the new generation that have according to the economists reporting a profile that is very different from the Gen x ers or my generation the boomers\nAre for example there are hesitant about long term commitments and therefore the large car companies are moving towards a subscription base for an automobile rather than making a big financial\nAh a big financial commitment over time thirty six months or five years or something like that so within branding is a is a dialogue that's going on now with the consumers who will be dominant in the year twenty thirty I mean the rich people in the United states\nIt you're exactly right it every Twenty years plus or minus each significant generation is going to dictate the way that they want a Brian to interact with them\nAnd they vote with their dollars which is why it's such an interesting thing that they will choose the brands they'll choose the relationships that they wish increasingly with the millennials is\nDifferent from Gen extra baby boomers their technology Nate\nIf they did not grow up in an environment where smart phones or tablets or interactive a TV\nDid not exist so they're they're natives to technology in many cases where a millennial or a baby boomer would consider hey there's not an associate on a sales for to help me an extra would say yeah I really don't want someone bothering at one to be able to use technology embrace the technology because I find this to be the way I Wish to communicate\nAnd the voting with the dollars is ultimately what you see in many of the rise of certain retailers the fall of others\nThat those retailers those brands are listening to their consumers and you can react you're never going to force say customer to a particular path that they are not aligned with whether that's a North American shop or whether that's a an Indian or a Chinese shopper\nThey'll gravitate to what they are most comfortable with\nRight now according to Brookings a three point eight billion people who qualify for middle class right now that's going to grow according to Brookings in the next twelve years the five point three my mathematics says that's a more than fifty percent almost sixty percent increase so\nThe fact is that growth is going to come in a ... in Asia which is why I mentioned that that nine out of ten of the next middle class people the people who come into the middle class for consumption are in Eurasia I read in the wall Street Journal that there will be a big expo in China coming up\nA is China the epicenter of that next nine of that ... billion or is it spread out in many cities in Eurasia Chris\n[noise] you know it's a great question I think that the\nChina is certainly a very very big factor but never discount the growth that India and never\nDiscount where India will overtake China in terms of population a little bit more in the areas of rule of law a little bit more with English or understanding and tradition as it were I think that the big three being China India and then Malaysia Indonesia as a combined\nArea those are probably the three points out the triangle the difference being how those different brands ... I'm sure there's different cultures understand and react to branding in\nShanghai in many of the main Chinese cities that are extremely accommodating for western brands you'll see Chinese consumers where there may be knock off brands for sale they want to buy the original item they want to buy I fell and they want to buy the Nike sneakers because they believe in brand\nIs much themselves and understand the quality that that conveys in that relationship\nYes according to the ... brand network but I'm looking at the top growing brands right now everywhere in the world in the solar system our Amazon and Facebook COO surprise right and that means that they're all headed to Eurasia Chris regal is the c._e._o. of scholar\nScholar is a ... is date information business at Chris what is the way to translate what scholar does for what the conversation we just kept how does it participation in Brendan [noise]\nCertainly so with skin a customer and what we call the moment of decision I'm In a retail shop I'm looking at a shelf I may have a screen on that show I may speak to the consumers mobile device or make interact with that consumer and some digital form to serve that consumer and help them gather the information\nGive the messaging or information that would influence that decision so it's really\nVigil in digital messaging right at the tip of the spear where that consumers are going to make a choice\nChris ragle CEO of scholar and you can find the website it's called the dot com I'm John ... this is the John ...\nRetirement questions you can bet ... probably have the answer joined in every Sunday at eight and two ...

the stamp or in Eighteen fifty grand compromise was reached but in both those situations the the um artifact that had been created\nAnd embrace that was supposed to solve everything and creative future of amity was in fact quite the opposite so that uh the repeal stamp act had no impact\nOr in that the British Parliament was more and more determined to find some other path in which to force

fifty\nA that slave act led directly to a gigantic backlash in the north which in itself led to the kinds of confrontations later in the decade that lead to civil war now what's important here\nIs the

Sarah Allison Center for foreign policy at the Heritage Foundation just returned\nFrom the Caspian Sea bass and I talk about it and deal I'm keen on looks observations I was there in July and August and the heat of the summer and there was great news anticipated\nThe signing of an agreement for the state of the Caspian Sea bass in to share energy pipelines future development on the great Silk Road look good evening to you and thank you for joining your back from the Caspian Sea bass and\nThere was anticipation of success you've been there since are they celebrating our they disappointed what is the word and back to about the working together with their neighbors good evening to you\nThanks John and good evening and thanks for having me on that just came back from a as by John I was in Baku and also in knock shove on which is a separate region of Azerbaijan\nA boat for very fascinating place to visit I've been to ... number of times\nBefore but you're right this was the first time I've been since the agreements in August and then I was about John people are very optimistic and excited about the agreement I think that most of the countries around the Caspian are happy with the agreement other than Iran\nAnd I thought was interesting or looking at some of the reactions of social media many Iranian felt like the President Rouhani\nOf Iran betrayed uh the country and betrayed the people over the agreement because the Iranians see themselves as having this a historical legacy of the Caspian region and they feel like they should get\nMore ownership of the Caspian than what they are getting out of this deal but nevertheless putting aside or on the concerns of the concerns of your average Iranian which let's face it they have a lot of other problems right now\nPutting those to one side this agreement does offer a lot of potential to bring new oil and gas resources from the heart of Central Asia and the Caspian base and to\nEurope and many of America's allies in Europe\nYes this is the southern gas car door and\nI've tried to do I've described it to the audience Luke and I want your help to it say it's a connection from the ... the natural gas the there are two platforms developing at but also from Turkmenistan also from Kazakhstan through\nAzerbaijan and then through the ... guy through Georgia to turkey and then across turkey through the Balkans including Bulgaria into Greece under the ... the\nAnd all the way to Italy so we're talking about not just the riches of the Caspian Sea bass and are we talking about energy security for a Europe that's how I saw the possibility Luke ...\nYeah absolutely the you know the ultimate goal was southern gas court orders to allow Europeans to get gas from places other than Russia or Iran\nAs so we're we're talking about right right now in terms of like practical deliveries of natural gas to Europe using the southern grass court or we're talking about really either by John\nBend the future because of the Caspian agreement we could see this expand out to Kazakhstan and also Turkmenistan because they're on the other side of the Caspian\nAnd there's been this debate over the years on building a pipeline connecting the west eastern side of the Caspian Sea where you have Turkmenistan for example with the western side where you have either by John\nAnd the reason why a pipeline is required is because I like oil or natural gas uh it's very expensive to ship\nA by by by boat you have to liquefy it Ellen gee you've heard that term I'm sure many of your listeners have\nIf they have to liquid liquefied natural gas\nSo it's only profitable to do that when you're when you're traveling more than let's say a two thousand miles or so whereas the distance between the two coasts of the Caspian we're talking only about three hundred three hundred and twenty miles so into a pipeline has constructed is not profitable to move this gas\nTo Europe through the Caspian but tell the ...\nMeant an August a pipeline was unable to be constructed because there was no legal framework to do so and now there is so there's a lot of optimism about Europe able to get news sources of\nOf uh of gas or to diversify where they get their energy from away from Russia and the more from other resources\nAnd many of your listeners can be thinking well how does this impact me and and the United states and that's actually a very simple because\nMany of our European allies in NATO for example we're obligated to protect or through the NATO or the north Atlantic treaty and it's in our benefits that they have security and energy independence away from Russia because that gives Russia one less lever that they can\nPool to apply pressure on many of our allies\nYou mentioned Iran and it's unclear where that had it but it certainly is a rough neighborhood Azerbaijan lives and I want to just to attend a moment to Georgia because this pipeline goes through Georgia and George gets seized from it also gets energy from it Georgia is threatened state\nOf the south caucuses it was pulled apart and the two thousand and eight invasion by the Russians\nHas not been put back together and I see the court or or at least this agreement in the Caspian Sea as one additional way to backup what's left of the Georgian Government is that a fair generalization look you study this area very carefully\nWell absolutely that's a that's a very important point that is actually often overlook to Georgia is very important trends that country and what the Georgians what is as much energy transiting their country going to Europe is possible\nThat only because you know from an economic point of view Georgia would get transit fees they they are able to get a certain amount of gas and oil from either by John because of the transit\nFees and the the transit rights but they know that the the the more oil and gas transits Georgia to get to Europe and and to get to the international markets means that there's more international concern and focus on Georgia and as you pointed out Georgia's already\nPartially occupied by Russia in fact twenty percent of the country is occupied by Russia and they know that if Russia tries to take any more land or there'll be a bigger international attention on the situation because of the oil and gas traveling through the country\nThe Silk Road it's a theory it's a dream it's an imagination but they have a port ... Bach who they're waiting for the development of the Silk Road how close are we look to getting that trends that uh the pipelines the highways the railroads\nFrom China to Europe or we within Twenty years ten years what's your opinion\nBut actually say to some extent they exist right now I'm In its existence it's been around for a couple of millennia\nA bed to different degrees and there is a huge aspiration to do a lot more with new uh pipelines new shipping routes Newport's new rail links and I think we are we're seeing good progress of with all of this but I think for for to really see its full potential we're talking another\nThat's correct yeah the idea here is um the code if you will inside the cell\nIs the DNA and we want to find ways to get our own code to go inside the shell or inside the tissues in the body and here to for that's been a challenge of and so editing a DNA or inside the body is something that has been a real I'm hurt a hurdle for the field to get over\nA will be create the vertical nucleic acid what we do is we create a system that is a little bit of a Trojan Horse\nThat allows the DNA or to get inside of the cells\nAllows us to now start correcting faulty DNA\nOr in some cases like cancer or putting in kill switches so that we can actually genetically target cancers and are able to get rid of the cells that have a particular gene of interest or that may be leading to a cell that we don't want to the body like a cancer so this is generally called immunotherapy\nImmunotherapy is a one way to use a DNA productively inside the body\nImmunotherapy space right now is as you mentioned it to your intro very hot topic this year actually very hot topic absolutely a Noble Prize just went out a few weeks ago for some of the developers and the pathways for me to therapies a gym Allison and has to go home Joe\nShirt a Nobel Prize for this idea that you could use the body's own immune system to fight cancer\nAnd in fact there are drugs that are now on the market that are helping patients with cancer use of their own immune system to fight off a cancer causing cells\nBrain I GI track lungs skin there's the list goes on about where this is useful their cells all over the body that can go awry and you have a way of treating the cells without being rejected does the\nS. N. A. does it sustain itself the body will attack something from the outside eventually does it a road or does it does it stay with us as you mentioned we kept\nBusy it actually care we're developing drugs and many different therapeutic areas I'm In some of the first therapies in these areas that are genetically targeted so the idea is to go after the underlying genetic causes of disease\nAnd sure enough if you correct the genetic defects that are inside the cell um you can create sustained medicines the ones that are actually heading towards cures\nWhere we've created a way to modify the underlying disease source and we're not really just talking about treatments anymore but we're really talking about opportunities for us to correct mistakes or inside the code itself\nUp for um diseases and all different types of Oregon's\nThere's a video to several videos that accompany or website and the emphasis is on three dimensional why is that important David three dimensional approach\nIs one of the discoveries that we made that was the basis of execution was that cells and tissues don't like two dimensional a linear DNA or nay that's floating around\nIn fact your body's evolves to try to get rid of the DNA in our day I'm over evolutionary time\nAnd that's been a huge challenge in the field for the last Thirty years because people have always looked at two dimensional structures and tried to puzzle over how to get those into the right cells and tissues\nWhy the three dimensional sphere ... structure is so important was the discovery that we made at Northwestern university it's part of my PHD working at a laboratory of a gentleman named ...\nAnd what I discovered in the working group was that when you create these three dimensional structures now this was a key that the cells recognize the cells like a three dimensional structures and now are able to take that DNA into the cells productively where we're able to make genetically defined medicines\nWe have an FDA Europe has enough to Asia as if everybody has FDA's where are you in the process of getting this to market to the physicians in our FDA process\nSure so you're correct\nDifferent jurisdictions all over the world right we're currently working on clinical trials in the u._k. in Germany and in the U.S at actually care we're gonna run our first us based trial in the mid ... therapy space using our spiritual nucleic acid and we're anticipating starting that trial in patients with cancer before the end of the year\nBefore the end of this year twenty Eighteen or expectations that we're going to be injecting the first patients with our ... therapies\nAnd how long is the process if you are successful I mean you're learning from this I understand them not presuming success right away but how long has the process for the FDA\nLong process to get through the stages of clinical trials success along the way so we're starting with a phase one beach to trial or we just announced last week successful completion of a phase one trial\nUm after you get through the phase two trial you have faced three trials and then out into the market\nJust process can take a beat us several years to do a one fun part about making DNA based medicine as the front end as much faster so we can sit at a computer we can design and medicine and we can get into patients to test it out to see if they can work much faster than traditionally done in the development space for drugs\nIn our conversation David you gave me a vision of the future vision of the twenty first century you use the word decide you can see an individual's DNA and respond to what is that where we are going in that it's\nAbsolutely so I mentioned that we had the idea of DNA and the structure of DNA solve since the Nineteen fifties\nAnd two thousand and three we declared success on sequencing the human genome and that tells me how your DNA John is different than my DNA\nAnd what at the individual nuclear base level that age the g's and T's and sees underlined the fundamental aspects of life or different between you and me in different between a disease state in a non disease state\nBecause we have that code book now in front of us we can actually sit at a computer we can type in the code of the medicine that we want to make and I can design a drug that will work and your cells and will not work in my cells\nAnd so we're at the point now where we got the code and we've got the tools we now have the spiritual nucleic acid which we think will allow us to make designer precision medicines that will impact lots of different\nAreas for one person wanted to an ... you had a one person comes with an affliction or is diagnosed with an affliction and you respond for that person or that family I guess it would be similarities and\nYeah that's the vision for the future right now what are the areas that we're focusing on a genetically find disease and these oftentimes are inherited diseases that pass through generations of families a spinal muscular atrophy is one of the ones that were working on these ah severe disease that affects a motor function and children\nAnd that's an ... an inherited disease that's genetically based but you can sit and you can look at that type of um a change in the DNA for the different patients and you can see how one patient is different than another patient\nAnd my vision is that Twenty years from now you're going to be able to walk into your doctor's office and walk out with a medicine that specifically designed to go after your faulty DNA switch from inside the cells\nDavid Gale Johan is the guy for X secure is the company\nIs traded on the stock exchange XP you are it's not hard to find to biotechnology but I've I've used a little bit of David language

John a very good evening to you Jeff Bezos is a very good business that\nHe has gained great wealth because he's aggressive and far ... what is he the and the Fifteen dollars after all you establish the fact that minimum wage is not about growth good evening to John\nAnd John I think what he says tablets does what he's always known\nThat poorly paid workers are incredibly expensive or the media have focused on hourly wages at Amazon but that's never been the principal or the the sole way they've they've compensated their workers all the way down to warehouse workers narrowly workers you arrive and you are awarded\nTo shares and then you were able to gain new share every year\nAnd that's what they're doing is that they are um ending that form of compensation hourly wages plus shares and there'll still be higher hourly wages plus there will be a share a blind plan that they will Institute for all their employers they ... they want everyone there to have skin in the game\nOr Amazon would not have three hundred thousand plus employees if it didn't pay its employees well it just does so differently and so ... says inside is that he's going to pay more and then also figure out a way to get them shares in the company\nPay more also you consider that Bezos has his eye on Washington how does the Fifteen dollars help him deal with are very very powerful state\nWell this is the unfortunate part I my sense and I can't prove this I'm barely speculate is the is the basis looks back to what happened\nTo Bill Gates Bill Gates didn't have quote a man in Washington and he paid for it dearly with a wasteful lawsuit foisted upon them by the department of justice and so my sense is that\nIs a base those fears that he fears\nThe success of Amazon getting him in trouble in in Washington\nAnd so there's also the political aspect of it I don't think this is ... for a second I find it offensive when people say described this great business but as a crony I think he also did this to kind of signal to Washington look at me I'm doing these things that you want a Institute in a higher minimum wage that's going to force other business to do it [noise]\nUm I think he would have done it anyway but I think there is that fear\nBecause Bezos is often in the news because we're watching him he said global businessman he's looking out\nAnd the future for Amazon I I think the anecdote is that they're they now have warehouses I think it might be in Hong Kong but I'm not sure where they are very few employees I remembered the number four and because they're mostly are going to what we can call robots how\nHow does Fifteen dollar minimum wage fit into the world that Amazon is going to which is to automate as much as possible\n[noise] well actually it doesn't it at all but it doesn't not no way that most people think pesos doesn't want low wage employees\nAs any businessman those low wage employees are expensive he wants higher paid employees and so ideally the scenario would be to automate that would be the real war that would enable him to grow the business even more and attract workers\nThat would command even higher wages for being much more productive than this is important to be as some people said in response to basis as decision that he was just calling for a Fifteen dollar wage as a way of putting out of business is less automated competitors\nAll the more realistic assertion is is the basis wouldn't have time to focus on them in this scenario\nAll businesses want to automate all businesses would want to automate whether the minimum wage was zero or whether it's Fifteen simply because when you can automate\nEmployee functions you can pay your workers a lot more and when you can pay your workers a lot more than ... you're able to do that because they're more productive they're less likely to leave it cannot be stressed enough that low wage workers are very expensive\nNo business would go out of its way to grow with them\nIs Jeff Bezos of crony\nHe's the opposite of a crony I think that what needs to be stressed is that because Amazon is so large because it's so valuable successful he has to worry about Washington in the ... in ways that a small business does not and so it I don't begrudge him\nThe need to occasionally thrilled bone to Washington to say oh I'm for a Fifteen dollar minimum wage he's not foolish he knows that this can be a barrier to employment for some people\nBut he has to police masters who don't care that he's a great businessmen and precisely because his great businessmen wants to cut them down to size so he must needlessly\nAnd and unfortunately play the Washington game on occasion\nI Know John in your parentheses in your column you mentioned that if that does was interested in cutting down the number of workers he must pay he wouldn't have bought whole foods that you you just say that labor intensive is an understatement good heavens\nWhy isn't that true he's doing this as he's starting to add a brick and mortar stores in the form of bookstores and he's doing it as he buys whole foods\nUm he ... the best way to reach customers has to have on the ground stores and so this is not about taking out as competitors again no one wants low wage workers think about any business you are you want to get the most talented workers who logically costs more\nThat's the path to grow businesses don't become really unsuccessful by exploiting their workers Amazon's not going to be the first\nWe go from one self made man Jeff Bezos and the future is bright for Amazon that is a solar system brand for heaven's sakes do another self made man or is he he is now the president of the United states Donald J Trump the New York times has reported\nThat they can document and I don't doubt them than Mr Trump inherited more than four hundred million dollars from his father who was a very successful real estate developer in New York and in the boroughs\nAbout the employment to population ratio that tells us the right now that American Jobs will just get better and better in the foreseeable future what is the employment to population ratio called the ... good evening to you at\nGood evening a well that's a standard measure that the economist particularly labor economists like to use\nUh the typical number that people are familiar with of course is the unemployment rate\nThe employment rate isn't quite the opposite of the unemployment rate but it's close to the opposite end it's the it's again the metric that economists prefer we actually prefer uh employment rather than unemployment so let me just tell you what that is here's here's how you want to think about it take the\nTotal number of people working that's essentially the number of people who have jobs\nAnd divide that by the number of people who could have jobs now when I say could have jobs the way that the bureau of Labor Statistics defines that is I'm a in a particularly grand way and that is anybody sixteen and over could have a job so Ninety year old could have a job\nSomeone who's in school and high school could have a job so what that means is that the employment rate is never going to be a hundred percent because you're going to have a\nSignificant fraction of retirees it's never going to be a hundred percent because you're going to have a significant fraction and school but the number that we tend to see is going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of sixty one sixty two percent and then the last a recovery at the peak back in two thousand seven\nThe employment rate reached sixty three and a half percent\nUh and that was about as high as it got for a while and then it started to go back down as we hit the recession so the question is where will it go and where does it need to be in order to in order for us to be at full employment\nIt just in in a one sentence the answer is sixty one percent it's right now about sixty and a half percent so we have about another half a percentage point to go\nThat means that there's growth they had and that translates into lots of jobs but I learned from you also\nThat it really matters this idea of full employment that really matters having to do with the Federal Reserve and everybody watching that are literally are the people who who follow I think it's called the Phillips curb are they aware that we have room to grow on is that is that reflected in the feds remarks\nThey are this is a debate that has been going on inside the fed and actually with me I've been in touch with a lotta fed officials\nAre about these issues for a couple of years now and you know to be honest that everybody was on my side I think that history has actually proven me correct because a couple of years ago\nI remember the unemployment rate it just you know ... below five percent everybody said wow you know things are great at full employment that I said we've got a a long way to go and again it was because I was looking at the employment trade rather than the unemployment rate and a couple of other indicators as well\nBut based on those I said we're gonna we're gonna continue to grow or going to continue to see rapid job growth for another couple of years and in fact that's what happened so the fed it certainly aware of this but the reason this is relevant and as you just pointed out is particularly relevant because\nThe fed is concerned that we may be overheating and they're trying to get ahead of the curve and in order to do that of course they've been raising interest rates and uh uh as we know that's a cause some volatility on the stock market over the past couple of days\nThe White House the Kevin Hassett and Larry Kudlow they're ... they're watching these numbers as well\nHave they got a persuasive case given these I mean there are some surprising demographic numbers now add that I've never seen before the lowest unemployment for some of the most vulnerable populations in a generation maybe two generations\nIs that they're never is that significant for growth\nOh it is it is absolutely I mean it's it's significant in two respects first of all it's a measure of where we've been so it's a measure of growth it's a measure of our success [noise]\nUh but the other thing it tells us is where we can be going and for that I Would say you always want to focus on the prime age workers and particularly in the last couple of years\nAnd those workers who are between twenty five and thirty for your years of age and mostly men actually in that group ... mostly men because the women have been doing fine but the men have not\nAnd recently if you look at the past few months what's happened is the employment rate among those among that group of twenty five to thirty four year old\nHas picked up and picked up dramatically so that's good news for a couple of reasons first of all those are people who we like to see back in the labor force of the ones who should be working\nBut second it also tells us that there is demand out there for people there are jobs available and when those jobs become available people will fill those jobs so again another indicator that the economy is continuing to expand\nWage growth that is also an indicator to watch how does that translate because there's been a complaint especially by partisans in the Democratic party that the wages in not growing means that this is a rich man's economy and not for everyone what his wage growth tell us about overheating and about ... pro\nRight okay well you know you raised a couple of points one is that the distribution of the wage growth who's getting the wages and who's not that's one issue but I I'm going to speak about your second one because that's the one that really it's more closely to your earlier an issue about whether the fed should be concerned about this\nWhat the fed worries about is that wages are growing more rapidly than they would do permissible and permissible is kind of a funny word but they have a rule and their role is look at the rate of wage growth and compare that to the summer of two things one\nProductivity growth and second inflation targeting inflation so we know that the Fed's target inflation rate is about two percent they'd like to see about ... percent inflation and the economy they think if you're below that that's not good they think if you're above that that's not good so they'd like to see two percent in addition to that\nThey are quite happy if wages grow by the rate of productivity and and the reason is that if you're producing more output and that out but it's going into the economy\nThan if wages are growing at that same rate that's not inflationary because the output is there to cover those wages so what that says is that if you look at the numbers for the recent years\nThe fed would allow us to have wage growth that about three point three percent that's the some of the two percent plus the productivity increases over the past a couple of years actually passed year it's been two point eight percent so we're still below that which means we have room in terms of wage growth\nBefore we're in a situation where the fed worries that if there is overheating in terms of what is sometimes called wage pusher cost push inflation\nAs well as the air was chairman of the president's council of economic advisors two thousand six to nine he's now

space program\nWithin these last hours there's been an update and that's why I go to Bob specially on the so use craft failure that led to the surprising and successful recovery of the two astronauts one cosmonauts one astronaut\nWho are now reporting by the news back at the biking or cows my job so the investigation underway\nBob a very good evening to you I was I was keen on this twenty four hours later because this profoundly affects NASA and its planning\nFor I manned spacecraft to and from the I asked asked and for plans going forward what do we know now about what happened and what is the state of the rock costs most ... program could evenings you\nCould even in John well okay what we now there have been tentative um\n... reports coming out of Russia that suggest the problem occurred when the strap on suicide boosters up the first stage separated it appears there is a valve that's supposed to open to [noise]\nTo release adored done didn't oxygen and I suspect also that action helps push the side a ... a strap on its way\nAnd for some reason that valve did not open\nAnd it appears they think there was a collision occurring when those first those\nThose are strap on separated or maybe a ... a collision occurring when they first and second stage is separated and the cost stage in the middle separate slightly after the trap ons released this is somewhat pulmonary we don't know yet they picked up some debris of the first stage\nThey're still looking into it they've opened a criminal investigation this is for Russian\nUm but in this case considering that we had a\nA someone's really hold and uh so use capsule there before it was launched in at hiding it I don't blame the Russians here for being a little bit paranoid even if this is their culture um the status for I assessed down the road is interesting job the Soyuz capsule have a two hundred day life span in space\nAnd so when a crew goes up on it's a a saw use that capsule should be used to return within two hundred days which will not but it's like seven months\nUm eight months something like that well the crude that's up there now there's three people up there they were going to come down in December\nBecause that's when this all use a capsules warranty runs out well right now the Russians have said they're not going to launch a manned mission until they launched at least one on man so I use first to make sure everything's okay\nUm [noise] but these guys have to come back in December that's why there are two runs out on this all use lifeboat so what I think is probably going to happen here is that the December flight they're going to try to figure out what went wrong and get it fixed\nAnd do that dissemble launch 'em a without anyone on board and what that will do is that will give them a new life both that can give them two hundred extra days that way I assess will not have to be left\nNow they put an unmanned craft up to par ...\nExactly and me the craft that they're now they stuffed with stuff why not you can take advantage of this stuff back and they'll just send it back on its own\nUm [laughter] I I don't know offhand that that's probably the grass it's got the hole in it so there's another reason maybe not to put people on it um and so uh this actually might work out very well it's not great for the crew onboard because that basically going to have to extend their mission and um\nI've been told by it costs ... to take long missions like the shooting you know how long emissions supposed to be any kind of pace yourself to do that mission now suddenly you have to extend it it's hard but they can do it and so that's where we stand\nIt might be that I Will be unmanned or that would be the first time in Eighteen years that no humans in space is pretty impressive situation\nIt would be a tragedy to lose that string I was really hoping that the Newman's would\nUp in space for the rest about human history [noise]\nUm but that might not be the case I felt they say can be manned in state operated face for that anybody on board with a by mission control but there's maintenance questions involved for example the two astronauts that we're going to be on the soil use craft one of the they were trying to do certain space walks do maintenance on the station\nWell they're not there and the Russians have said they're going to launch these same two guys in April because they got to get them up there to do those maintenance space walks it's also made an impact the investigation and they only because they were saying they were going to do an during one of those space walks they were going to expect from the outside the whole\nUh and so this is a complicated\nSpecial shift to see how it plays that in the future Bob I Want to\nPress on this because you have you ever see there was talk of a criminal investigation has dropped or is that still on\nThe vi V. um the science V. engineering investigation and the panel that's doing that has also opened a criminal investigation of Russia's I mentioned the Russians\nAre and that's not unusual for them to open criminal investigations this kind of thing they have a different attitude than we do but considering the fact that they had what looked like might've been sabotage on the Soyuz capsule it's an all but right now\nAnd considering this has happened and considering they have so many problems they've had they've had six failures of soy use variations the Saudis rocket and the last two years\nFor oh I'm Sorry for failures but either way that's a lot and so they're paranoid right now and even those culturally that normally somewhat power line the Russians you know the whole statement just because your parent does not mean someone isn't out to get you and it could be very well the case here that there is\nThey could be great dissatisfaction within the engineering crews that build these things\nBecause they don't get paid much affect their pay pittance compared to engineers the rest of the world and the management is not great and detectives generally been poor and so Russia's around happy country right now so I wouldn't be surprised if the criminal\nDecades and let's go to the U.S side how can we get our spacecraft ready to do routine back and forth to the I asked us to operate as if it was so are you\nWell right now our schedule is that uh the space sex is going to do is unmanned test sometime in January and then five months later it's first manned mission that that's not that's not an operational mission that's still a test mission\nAnd Boeing is going to go in April with unmanned and then in August manned so that sometime next year and those are still the test flights\nI'm One of the reasons the January the January unmanned test\nFlight of safe sex was delayed
