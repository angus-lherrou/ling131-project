I'm looking at it again we're watching it here he made a great play on the ball for that touched but there's not much from those no there's no fight from the defenders though and that doesn't mean he wouldn't have gotten it anyway but\nLet's not call Randy Moss yeah OK let's reserve that for another but that's good he's a part of the things I think the patriots off ants rod Murkowski by the way he looked limited you at all tonight with the echo\nA so I think this is going to be something that'll trickle of the more you watch plays even on his I think might have been the first or second reception you know the NFL dot com or whatever and if I Want to order that put it out there on their Twitter feed if you look at him after the plane I'll find it retweeted\nThere's something with that left ankle it ... you know he comes up a little ginger on it you see I'm kind of ... or something and even in the late when he got mauled after catch in the fourth quarter yeah I'll be gone up a little ginger like there is definitely something\nGoing on with that guy All right well I thought he was effective do I thought he mattered when he was on the field sketches for Seventy five tonight and safely get started with any kind of major injury I didn't like the fact he was playing yeah he was a part in one of those turnover is one of those picks they went back and forth as to whether or not it was only a Gronkowski far more pick they\nSettled on it being an interception which I think is the right call the statisticians upstairs settled on that being a pick\nAs was the ball that skipped off the hands of Chris Gordon and then you add a bunch of Bozo Colts defenders celebrating in the end zone that was full she oh mine was that fool it seems to be the downs fourteen celebrating a pick by running like thirty yards\nTo go over to the end zone to celebrate in front of TV cameras like\nYou know you see it all they do you see it all over the league now it's the group defense celebration with like they're taking a group self and you see it everywhere growing every Sunday Now I don't you know even when you're down to touchdowns acceptable yeah still a lot of stupid team struggling Tom stoop pretend\nYou're you're one in four now indie to ease up on your celebrations when you're down to who scores\nOne in four Frank right Andrew Luck all of that here's my one issue with the Patriot defense tonight they didn't get pressure on Andrew Luck well hit early right out of the gate area go you're going to see this tonight and then it disappeared they did not put him in pressure situations and all that\nAnd there was a couple of issues in the secondary use a ... and a ... Gilmore chasing at times when we weren't already learned a few times and I can't remember which one of these no names that was on the Colts in terms of the writers wide receivers but look at it beautiful ball I think in my late thirties early for the\nLeft side line drops it in a bucket in planes out the guy's hand and Gilmore is chasing the whole time like you burn right the line so\nNot really a great night for them if you're playing the better team maybe if this is you know the chiefs in ten days like that something that\nHas to get that has to get cleaned up certainly part of the McCord he did have a nice play restrict the ball I I Will give him very much credit for that I Will say though you're right I don't know that he had a great night in coverage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm joined us good job or\nA billion two running backs so to have ... active on the roster tonight how big a factor was tonight to see sort of Michelle step up in a in a second game as the lead runner on the ground and to have the contribution the passing game as well\nAs those guys that a great job both of them to a great job we're dependent on them for a quite a bit and they they came through the book or to heavy load\nA productively and did a great job ball security and and making the plays a that were available and also the eggs and plays on around them at some guys missed votes and tackles games next year or so that was a great job I both those guys that really came through force or\nKind of along the same lines built just some of the blocking on the interior that they were getting from Andrews and they have won it just seems as if you are friends of mine he's working kind of in in sync very much with the speed on the show and and they're getting used to each other detecting that at all [noise] um\nWell I think we've hit a couple of big round so I mean overall we had said probably too many runs on weren't that productive but those also by some some big chunk grown so I don't\nThink there's more yards that we could make their um but\nThey're good upfront I mean are they have a good front are hard to block um based on a lot\nAbout us on a couple of stunts 'em like they did with everybody man they legally and tackles for last or whatever it is sucking the leading socks so it's so that they got to go from there's no doubt about the other challenge to the blockbuster on it because I thought our guys hung in there but um\nYou know I think we left a few of them fail to\nA bill you guys allowed two hundred Ninety or yards and the second half the cultural to get back into it um were you concerned about what you saw on the second half on defense\n[noise] oh yeah I mean look there are good passing thing I mean they can throw balls walls anybody that quarterback or series good tied in [noise]\nThe ducks well coast so they throw it against everybody ... I mean that's yeah I'm a ... better you know um [noise] yeah\n\nBut what what did you get from Julie in whether it was leading up this week or even just tonight have you know what it meant to be back out there for the first time and I think it's twenty months at a meeting for game\n\n... was with adults or adults a training camp surfer all pre season games there for all all season so I mean he's got a very aggressively I'm Down in the spring uh you know we found out about the\nAbout the news on up and when it came to training camp I mean he came in with the you know strong purpose and work really hard in town so I mean it wasn't here for a while but I mean every day he's been here all year spittle into\nUh yeah but\nI think the question was like when did I see him work harder when that I notice of or he was working when he came back I'm just telling these were ... or turtles which are in a camp we work hard this week in the short time that he had to get ready\nI mean that's what your windows and he's very consistent about doing that so it didn't just start having a couple of days ago so I'm trying to say\nHey bill up here how pleased with what the turnover as you get on defense ... play on the stripping the take away [noise]\nYeah you know you're always I'm always like to see the turnout was on defense you cause sometimes\nUm [noise] sometimes the officers maximus makes a mistake and you get the ball um when you really don't cause it but when you when you cause the ball to come out those are um\nLike defense away take a lot of pride in those that's really taken them all away from the offices posed to them just\nGiven until you so [noise] um we had a couple of places like that we had a couple of other opportunities that we we didn't capitalize on but it's always going to take away from the often so it's a defenses goal and I did a couple of times a night so that was I was in\nA couple\n\nI coach I'm Tom Brady to get a two hundred and twenty six when a career when tied Adam ...
