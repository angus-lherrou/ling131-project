my shirt down to almost stuff\nThe U.S says publicly any way that our goal for the talks as they get the tall bunch to reconcile with the current Afghan government well how can they do that when they very consistently through the years have said the current Afghan government as illegitimate it's a puppet of the Americans and we're the really the real old only real game in town\nThe memory of Vietnam crowds in here forgive me Tom I'm older and so this is the boomer fiasco to review a there are analogies there are mismatched as as well one that comes to me immediately\nIs that the Taliban leadership will not negotiate or derives Ashraf Ghani the president of Afghanistan and these dialogue looks as if gummy is not represented in any fashion the Taliban wants to negotiate directly with the Americans that's a great victory for the Taliban at the beginning\nWell you're exactly right John and that's the whole that's the whole point here is that they're using these negotiations directly with the U.S to try and drive a wedge between us and the Afghan government and this was this causes a lot of embarrassment an added to the tensions with atomic cars like when he was president\nSeveral years ago when the bomb mission try this because there were so many problems that arose out of this so it was embarrassing for Karzai and his government now of course ... puts his character there are all sorts of problems there\nBut this was you know he's still nominally our ally and to basically engage in these direct talks with the Taliban\nA manner that sort of offensive to his legitimacy of sovereignty is very problematic in there is a sort of a with this time around that same thing which is sort of which again is a problem now again the the the ...\nThe U.S is saying that the ... needs to come to the table and reconcile in some fashion with the current Afghan government\nThe ... says the Afghan government is illegitimate we're not going to do that well what's the point of the talks if the central goal to talk for the American side is something that tall by saying is just not doable and that's really the central question here as we move forward\nA wise man once taught me that everything has a price do we know what the Taliban's prices in dollars and cents are they looking at a large transfer of cash in some fashion the way the north Vietnamese and the Viet Cong finally negotiated\nYou know I I Want to be very careful I have to speculate here because we really don't know what their prices and all this and again you know their prices going is influenced by the fact that they smell a desperate negotiator on the other side of the table so they realize that we're desperate to get out and they're looking to extract more concessions just as they did in the past they use these past negotiations\nTo extract all sorts of concessions from the American side without really giving anything up in return and I think you know there there are some different ways to describe the several ways this could play out\nIt could be the case of dog was not willing to give us much of anything um or could be that they're willing to grant is sort of some sort of withdraw timetable for Afghanistan and the price of that could be for example that several provinces there are firmly under the tall bunch way now I'm basically are on touch the U.S withdraws basically giving them\nA de facto safe haven as the U.S leaves and then therefore they can use that of course what's we're out of there to basically start consuming and taking over more Afghanistan once again\nIt may be that sort of that sort of arrangement\nUm it was a big things keep an eye on your to John is that the U.S has begged the top on for years to renounce al ... and of course they won't do it they haven't done it yet\nAnyway and then all these years the Taliban has refused issue even just a generic statement pronouncing all ... and there's there are a lot of reasons for that one of which is that there's plenty of evidence that all kinds of the top on her main closely allied to this day\nAnd that's deeply problematic here because remember all kinds of the organization is still alive it's you know it's lost ... lost a lot of its top leaders but they're still very much an al ... organization\nIn Afghanistan Pakistan it's fighting and they definitely have one eye on us\nYes in the close of your piece and you have limited amount to much of time I understand that but you suggest that a Taliban aggrandize by direct negotiations with the U.S let's hypothetical\nAh taking the U.S promises in some fashion becomes the the nucleus of a of an average that the law or he can use throughout the throughout Asia spreading into the subconscious when in reading\nJohn ... argument I'm also hearing will try to argue that the Islamic emirate Afghanistan the Taliban ...\nIs the nucleus of a new caliphate I still remember this has been totally misunderstood\nThere are a lot of people even in the ... field who have said well kind of doesn't really want to seize territory build a cow that nonsense you can go through their literature through the years they're very clear that that's the ultimate goal and what ... saying is that the Islamic ever Afghanistan is a nucleus or the crown jewel of this new imagine\nHer he signed on to that that is that he's identified says\nThat his argument that they'll ... argument that was Osama bin Laden's argument and so this is something that could easily have ramifications for outside Afghanistan\nAnd does the American side ... or the Trump Administration acknowledge that that is that suits a lottery to negotiate directly with his ... his agents\nWere only be blunt John I talked to a lot of American officials [noise] um I don't think it's widely recognized inside the U.S government at all with all kinds of positions on this and I think there's been a lot there's been a very large incentive to downplay or dismiss the kite angle and all this why because it's very inconvenient to and sort of justifying this sort of\n... and wouldn't look up to say the U.S retreats from that al ... yes no that that's not acceptable by your making the case here that's why he has been outspoken with his ambition\nAnd by refusing to negotiate with ... with with the ... the president of Afghanistan that is what they're putting together they're putting together a caliphate endorsed by the United states of America\n[noise] yeah I mean there well the the crown jewel of the nucleus of that would be endorsed by the name ISIS America certainly because that's basically we're saying that the Taliban state is legitimate um by ... granting this I mean you'll you'll you know when you look at all kinds of Afghanistan today John we do our analysis based on multiple different sources\nPrimary sources are based on what kind of saying us raids Afghan rates you know who they go to target where these guys are where they're fighting remember the reporting

the great voice the great lakes joins man we're welcoming Gordon Chang of the Daily Beast\nWe're going to move through several anecdotes about the Chinese Communist party these days were puzzled by these and takes at least I Am because here to for over the last ten years garden I've been talking about\nThe Chinese Communist party's diplomat they are black they are peaceful rise say hang in the background in fact an anecdote from\nFrom the twentieth century when the KGB followed Chinese diplomats in Moscow or Leningrad cause they routinely followed everybody back in the old Soviet days\nThat was the best duty to have because the Chinese diplomats were so boring and predictable and never went anywhere did anything interesting and so everybody wanted the Chinese Communist party detail if you're going to learn how to travel people around Moscow\nToday I imagine it's very difficult to follow them\nGarden a very good evening to you tantrum tantrum tantrum worthy of pre school from senior Chinese official last week we spend a deal of time talking about how ... the foreign minister had chastised my palm pale in public on deservedly cell but the part was the part that was interesting\nWas that weighing a acted as an Iran a tab stamping funny throwing thing and I've puzzled about it and you said well here he is\nThis is why this is so extraordinary they're frustrated but now I see other officials imitating weighing a or imitating some model what has happened in court and why are they acting this way these are diplomat good evening if you've gotten\nGood evening John and that is I think they're really two reasons\nFirst of all I think China really is frustrated a lot of things are not going it's way and so the Chinese are just not used to it for their confounded by the situation\nUm second of all um and this is a background reason but it does explain the behavior of Chinese officials\nAnd that is that a few jumping just demands maximum physician\nAnd so people have to demonstrate their loyalty and the demonstrating the loyalty\nIs to either going after Americans or jailing um leakers at an unprecedented pace or whatever to show that they are on board with these programs these programs are really likeable I think a lot of Chinese officials understand that there are not in China's interest\nCertainly the Chinese people don't like many of these but it's what the demands and so while he is still in control they're going to do what he requires\nThat is a garden are there any problems within China itself but are exacerbating the tensions and the tantrums of is Communist Party officials\nWell I think that the the part of the problem is that when things don't go well I'm you know if you go back six seven months or so ago\nUm everything was going trying his way and so I think Chinese officials just got a little bit flabby in a sense and that's understandable um because they had been bullying people and people had been actually doing what they want and that includes not only countries that are small but also large countries like the United states\nUm you know but Trump decided that he had enough of that and so he's pushed back and I I actually think that you know you're starting to see real problems in the economy\nUm and and that is really something that is concerning the Chinese um you have for instance drops in auto sales consumption all the rest of it that really nobody foresaw I'm just a few months ago\nGordon let's let's turn this a little bit and talk about the Chinese economy because you've written about it most recently the national interest\nOr the pocketbook issues drive our politicians when the economy is bad there is no place to hide although they try especially at election time I'm going to guess at the Chinese are exactly the same as the United states except that they don't have election time they have one party all the time\nYou published that what we have here is a damning Chinese J. D. P. going forward and strengthening American GDP that's not supposed to happen now she has the long game does he have this short ... does he understand that this is a cycle and that he can\nAnd recover from it yeah actually I don't\nThink that they want a recession they don't believe that they can accept one so they're continuing to pour on debt and you know something which is really worrying ... China got a lot of praise over the last three or four years over climate\nUm they've made certain climate promises people applauded on but we are now starting to see that there are increased use of coal I'm more missions more CFCs going into the air and that's largely because they're really pushing the factories to produce\nSo we're seeing I think um some very short term thinking because they just don't know if they can get to the other side of this you know Trump is confounded American politicians well of course he's confounding the Chinese they don't know what to do they don't know how long the quote unquote trade wars going to last\nAnd so they're pulling out all the stops and it looks like a little bit of panic on the part of\nSenior Chinese technocrats fatty\nPart of the problem with Communist Party has said that liberty is the enemy of prosperity and security and so when they're out of recession or any kind of economic downturn they're\nGoing to do everything they can including putting their own their own country to try to avoid that aren't they\nYeah well they certainly are and and the bigger backdrop which we've talked about before is that feature thing in his term is general secretary so we're now talking about six years\nHas really started to turn is back on on the things that may China's economy pop you know it's it's reform and opening up our are no longer the by words today we're closing the economy down there they're going back to state dominated markets and state determination of prices\nSo you know at this particular time um this looks really bad because it shows that um this is the way that season ... thinks it's going to admit they might be able to do a little bit of short term getting through it by determining markets but they can't really have a long term solution here\nAnd you know you're absolutely right this is I think the inevitable result of communism see jumping is not an aberration he's the inevitable result of China's Communist system\nI'm going to use the chess metaphor I Am not a good chess player but I certainly know how to use the metaphor Gordon uh whenever the night moves on a board I've learned pay attention\nThe night is the hard to predict very dangerous piece when on the attack I read a report from Washington a pie by making a rare second trip this year to Vietnam defense secretary Jim Mattis is signaling how intensively\nThe Trump Administration is trying to counter China's military assertiveness by cozying up to smaller nations in the region and share American wariness about Chinese intention Madison is the night\nDavid just a moment I Want to check with Gordon on this uh Gordon\nThe concern that you've had for some time about these summits the first one and now the proposed second one is that Seoul is is taking advantage of it or is weakening faster than the conversation permits\nIs so it's all being driven by another concern Gordon is Beijing behind this weakening of sanctions by a prospect of commercial enterprise\nWants the sanctions to be weekend because they've talked about this in public but what's really driving event here John is not so much the Chinese but it's ... yeah\nI'm ... and Jay is number one goal matter of fact is number one to number one hundred coal is unification of the two Koreas states so he's doing everything possible to help Kim Jong on\nHe's very pro North Korea his advisors in there you were advocating the overthrow of the south Korean state by North Korea so right now you got to political establishment and so that really is very pro Kim and very anti US\nDavid David the concern here is that there's something sinister is there or is this just along frustrated trail of reuniting the Korean Peninsula or how\nHow to regard this from a great distance\nWell it's either it's either sinister or it's ... and I think that uh that Kim Jong il I mean the moon J. N. wants peace at any cost and I think that that is really is driving a Porsche is that he wants peace I and he wants to be the one to bring peace to the Korean Peninsula\nThe problem is he is making South Korea vulnerable uh in his idea of maximum engagement of course we'll go against the sanctions are and will actually could potentially strengthen North Korea\nUh in show whether he he wants to unify with North Korea under North Korea's control which I don't think he does\nI think he is has the misguided belief that if he engages with with Kim Jong him and he like President Trump believes that he can trust Kim Jong il and that's where I think they're both making the mistake 'cause I don't think ... trust it\nA show he is embarking on maximum engagement and to go back to the earlier a editorial that you started with the United states has got to enforce sanctions and if South Korean banks are providing financial ah services to the north they may be violating sanctions the warning\nYes the editorial goes on guard and now I'm ... I'm a size this this is the editorial on October Fifteen from salt these incidents clearly show that the U.S now regard south ... South Korea has the weakest link among its allies international sanctions against North Korea is that justified Gordon\nIn some ways I think that it is John I mean one can argue about the Chinese or the Russians or whatever but you know Moon Jae in is definitely very pro North Korea and I hope Dave is right that he's just naive instead of malevolent\nUm but he's acting you know if he were malevolent um he'd be doing exactly what he's doing now so I don't think it really matters what his intentions are it's just that\nUm what he's doing is under cutting the American efforts to um denuclearize North Korea we've seen Moon Jae in actually become Kim Jong un's spokesman um that started in March and continue now uh every time we hear about something favorable about Kim Jong when it comes from ... trillion\nIs extremely worrying John\nWhat about the Europeans David how are they getting ahead of this as well I note in this editorial it talks about France and it also mentions the IMF in the world bank\nBeing asked to play and play an active role so is is the U.S going to be in a position the way it is say with Iran negotiating directly with our allies not to aid a sanctions ... state\nBut I think this is yes we are becoming isolated because uh again that's Gordon shed Moon Jae in is reaching out I ... made the statement\nThat the international community really needs to reward North Korea recognizing it for the pledges that it's made and we should keep in mind North Korea has done nothing of substance\nTo indicate it sincerity to dismantle its nuclear program but again a Moon Jae in is reaching out uh and of course the French said that they would certainly assist in denuclearizing\nShould North Korea do that and of course in addition to being the mouthpiece and spokesman for Kim Jong il a Moon Jae in is also becoming the messenger because he intends to deliver a letter to the pope inviting him to pee on your own\nGarden you have a question for\nSix months from now do we impose sanctions on South Korean banks of the south Korean government on South Korean enterprises for violating sanctions\nWell I I certainly hope not because we must step back and remember that the you know there is going to be no success on the Korean Peninsula oh without a strong rock us alliance and so we I think this was a warning to South Korea\nDon't do this but we really have to uh to work on alliance man management uh and and rebuild or some of the bridges and some of the fisheries that are are are appearing in the alliance this is really important\nAnd I think the United states as being proactive in giving this warning so that we don't have to a section them because that would be a terrible blow to the alliance and of course feeds right into Kim Jong moons a desire to split the rock us alliance\nA divide and conquer divide the alliance to conquer the rock\nWhat's this look like David a best case scenario from ... to uh to to govern ... governments one peninsula do they have a working working planned in mind or are they just smiling\nWell that's long been a proposed by many past leaders are certainly by the north uh I Believe that the north proposal to have a one country two systems is really a to support its support it's a version of the south and eventually dominate the south\nI think those in the south who believe that there can be a one country two governments are that can gradually unify I think that is the naivete that exists\nThere is no end of the nuclear program there is no end of the crimes against humanity as long as the Kim family regime is is there really needs to be a United Republican Korea that secure stable economically vibrant\nNon nuclear an organized under a constitutional liberal constitutional form of democracy determined by the south Korean people nodded Republic of Korea\nWe have less than ... go ahead garden\nSo so what are the south Korean people think about the motives doing\nThirty seconds to take out that uh that uh\nThe south Korea there are many in the south Korean a population who are becoming disillusioned of course they're having internal economic problems and the like the moon is focused on one clear objective piece at any cost and I think you're seeing a both young people\nAnd of course the disorganized conservatives are that are in the south who have no real viable political power but they are a\nBeginning to oppose this and they're seeing a\nJames action or may not be\nInterest of the of South Korea to especially peace at any cost\nDavid Maxwell the foundation for the

us to the\nAncient entrance of the city of Jerusalem which is um the if you're coming under Jerusalem and the heavy traffic you go up over the rise with a new convention center is what if they found about ... ah Indiana excuse me what have you found Indiana\n[noise] well this is one of the most exciting discoveries of recent time it it was produced in with the considerable fanfare because it was a Twenty one hundred year old Hebrew inscription\nIn Hebrew and Arabic but with a in he was using Hebrew letters\nOn a piece of limestone on earth in in Jerusalem at the site you mentioned your the convention center where they were doing construction of a road\nAnd it has the first the earliest known mention of the full name of the city spelled\nAs we do today it was a sin menus high a column that it was probably used to in another place and then moved to this location where they also found what they believe was a pottery a factory\nMaybe for people entering a Jerusalem it but it was certainly a maybe a richer using the Jewish craftsman building and it has the name\nOf the um uh uh ... uh and the name was subscribe to a part of a Roman structured during the first century bc uh which was found in it earlier excavation\nBefore they pave the road at the convention center so\nAh the ah the the it was written in Hebrew lessons I said and appears on us don't come from a from this earlier or\nIs it in our mass Malcolm it's it's an Arab ... that was that was a language of Jesus ... lingua franca\nOf that era and uh and the only other known instance\nIs an inscription ... calling from the Jews revolt against the Romans at the end of the second temple period\nSo according to the scholars who ups a study that uh\nThis uh inscription clearly indicates the use of Hebrew it clearly\nPuts the lie to the to the un actions which took place that very weak again declaring by UNESCO that uh the cable the patriarchs the tomb of Rachel all of these things were in Palestinian territory Palestinian sites and as you know they have eradicated Judeo Christian names\nFrom the record in only use the moslem names here you have such a clear message to me the the the report showed that the archeologists started shaking when they when they realize what they had head\nAnd um it at that distance scripture and they also found their ritual baths as a as well as um other fights with Hebrew lettering at the site\nThat well you you can't have more of a re affirmation of the history of the claims than this\nThere was very clever of them to ride in stone knowing that we needed two thousand years later Malcolm Thaddeus\nAs Malcolm Halloween is coming we hear tales of headless horsemen [laughter] and we also had Louis earthy [laughter]\nUh this is to set a story to laugh about but in in excavations that are going on in the area called the Russian Compound because it was owned by Russia and Israel in fact turned it back\nTo the Russian government a few years ago it it's wherever there was a big Russian Orthodox church and dislocation where the new ... Academy of arts and design is going to be built and it's right near the offices at John ... of the city municipality\nThe they found a hundred and twenty five skeletons more than two\nOut there doing activation ride Malcolm that's why they they underneath the for\nAny site in Jerusalem can be constructed on and before any road is Doug they they present in the archaeologist because it's you know everything you have some significance generally it's it's the vast majority of places\nSo they first have to get approval from the archaeology department and then they can then go ahead with construction and then if they find something they have to find a way to protect it or to take it out or to build over it\nSo the construction here in the Russian Compound all of a sudden opens up a a

complicated was hugely\nProductive and innovative and fun partnership to belong there at the end um and I so I went on to you know do many of the things uh that was that when that was definitely important chunk of my life\nCertainly there were extremes in the French Revolution that word a that disgusted the parliamentarians ends and made England fears so that they became resentful of anybody speaking of what's it called leveling there were also\nA moments in the American revolution in the American civil war where the English Crown found it easy to preach to the people that that is these are radicals they're not to be accepted\nIn any in any in any civilized place but Burke had an observation of what was the what was the driver\nFor the depravity in the French Revolution and what was the driver for the disorder and violence in the American revolution how did he explain it to his parliament as he addressed and Peter\n... dress them any address them and uh what started as a letter to a young man Paris could not understand why Edmund Burke the grey wig with a friend at all if all of her career had defended freedom explaining to the young man why he broke with not ...\nAnd the side of the French revolutionary because the French revolutionaries Burke argued for the first time in human history\nThought I kind of revolution that was theoretical in dogmatic it and not only at changing who governed instead of the king that people let's say it aimed at changing opinions ideas\nReligious faith cuts them and so on it's thought to be Burke called it quote total revolution and this he said represented a new one ... three to freedom because freedom depended in significant measure on inherited customs inherited\nTraditions the Brits were ah Burke said men of quote now and taught feeling I'm feeling it didn't mean they were crude and folder he meant they didn't have to go to college in graduate school to learn how to live a life of freedom because their traditions taught them how to live\nA life suitable for free man\nAnd I I Want to translate this and other because birth didn't have the word he saw the French Revolution is a threat to freedom yeah as a threat as and we would use the word ... today yeah\nAnd he didn't have that word but he feared what he saw which was a transformation of the French or tradition a transformation in into something that was violent and dictatorial and he rejected it quite quite different from how we saw the American revolution how did he hold the American revolution\nOh yes I Am quite right and I I I'd like to underscore your points on while he didn't have the word he clearly had the concept and mother of a totalitarian isn't total revolution while the French revolutionaries did not have the technology that would allow them\nTo monitor monitor people in their homes they certainly have the aspiration\nShared by totalitarian of the twentieth century even remake human nature and of course the American revolution fundamentally different the American revolution was we would say today and I think accurately and broke understood this very much\nYou could call it a conservative revolution in what's at\nThe American revolutionaries were not attempting to change\nDog much change religious faith changed custom and tradition quite to the contrary they thought to preserve the way of life\nThat they had that brought over from England and the seventeenth century Burke warned of this in Seventeen Seventy five he said he said who are he said the parliament those Americans actually they don't have a legal right\nTo be represented in debates about taxation imposed upon them but you're never going to be able to convince them of that because they're too much infused with quote again that fear love of liberty\nClause quote which they get from being British But then having that are energized by being three thousand miles away\nSo the Americans were preserving a way of life from what they regarded at the abuse of power by ah by the British king and in fact\nThe Americans introduced the constitution that was designed to keep government limited so actually fit and could continue to live their traditional way of life or we should say if they wish to break with tradition\nA matter of conscience they were also free to do so under the American constitution\nI Want to I Want to go over a detail here Burke was inheriting a tradition that he's English yeah and the tradition was hard fought from the sixteenth century through the seventeenth century to the glorious revolution through Cromwell to the glorious revolution and I've recently been reading Peter there's a new book\nA young Benjamin Franklin in which the author Nick bunker takes us back to the sixteenth century England when the first of the lord start partition up the land in taking away arable land and grazing land from the from the ... from the peasants\nAnd make them a wage slaves said they're imposing a kind of slavery on the people who resent it who revolt\nAnd that ... takes a hundred years but we come to John Locke\nAnd the early ... berry and the glorious revolution all that transformation that's a tradition that Bert takes for granted\nThat he's inherited over a hundred years that's a tradition that our forebears came to America just speak for themselves and I've often had I've had it wrong my whole life America didn't invent this tradition we inherited it from our English forbearers\nI I think that John that formulation is a exactly right I don't uh quibble with ... one small prey said a burp took it for granted in a way ... took part it took it for granted until the\nFrench Revolution then he saw the tradition which he knew to be the source of his freedom with under with under profound threat and so that's how that gives birth to what we now call modern conservatism wedding and heritage or of this English tradition of freedom\nSees a rising a direct threat\nFrom also within the tradition the French Revolution to freedom and their began the great and recurring challenge for those of us devoted to freedom which is somehow reconcile the claims of individual liberty and tradition\nYes we we we will address that sometimes called writes abstract rights Burke worried about it here in the twenty first century\nIt pens just in much the same way when they partition the grazing land of the lens

the workforce I welcome Richard Epstein professor Richard Epstein the Hoover Institution is senior fellow teaches law at NYU and the university\nOf Chicago because in twenty Seventeen riches are reporting\nThe number of CEOs of fortune five hundred companies declined from thirty two and twenty Seventeen to twenty four and twenty Eighteen are we going in the wrong direction does this mean that\nThe advances made by gender equality these last years has been reversed suddenly because then fill in the blank Trump or is there more to this about the workplace and gender\nRichard a very good evening to you certainly this debt chest take about decline of CEOs indicates a headline\nYou do not find however anything of substance underneath it to support it so we go immediately to California where they have a new law California law that insist upon balance or at least some numbers of women on the boards of companies in California\nYour measure of this is that it is much about no facts in the workplace there have been facts in the class when women have been restrained by court orders that is not now the case do I read that correctly\nWell court orders is not the correct term by legislation will be the term but essentially what happened is in the history of the United states starting at the end of the civil war there were many formal disability on the ability of woman to\nHold certain kinds of position at the entrance to certain kinds of contracts and those limitations we're pretty much removed as a formal matter before Nineteen hundred and then in the next Twenty years old the political restrictions on women suffer\nJust were lives so at that particular point as a matter of legal contemplation every woman in every man had the same degree of illegal capacity to enter into contracts to make ...\nThis is Brad well the earth is Illinois and Muller versus Oregon You're referring to\nThe bride well which is an extraordinary case there was a situation in the state of Illinois where they\nPut a ban on women working the majority opinion said there'd been recent cases about privileges and immunities which indicate that the federal constitution does not give protection to women um who want to enter into these occupations\nI'm so therefore the cases out and this was probably an incorrect reading of the stature of the constitutional provisions but take it and then there was one judge who in concurrence basically announced that the national biological condition of woman was such that it was perfectly appropriate to keep them in the home\nDomesticity became not only virtue by the legal requirement to\nWhich the obvious answer is if you open up the markets and more women want to go when that are currently there they will do so men want to go and they will do so it turns out if you actually look at the way these markets are organized today this free entry and exit\nBut there is by no means and the density of men and women and all kinds of places and all kinds of firms in the law and the same thing is pretty much true in every other occupation\nAh within medicine within ... within science there always tend to be sub specialty so to have Wi Fi male and a heavily male and these numbers have been roughly constant for the last twenty or Thirty years\nSo unless there's some major legal course they're not going to switch soup Mahler against Oregon is an ironic case it was from a to Nineteen oh eight and a man who wrote the brief\nUpholding the statute which had a minimum wage law for women only was none other than Louis Brandeis was probably the most prominent lawyer in the United states at that time it was I thought a dreadful briefed that he wrote about he persuaded one of the conservative judges a man named Bruins I'm too will basically to\nUphold that statue to set a strike it down in that particular case all the women who were hard were fired and replaced with a Chinese workers so it wasn't as though it did them a lot of good\nAnd then the long run most women rightly in my view of come to the conclusion that sex linked um minimum wage laws are flatly unconstitutional off because of what it is that they do and so what was the heroic advance in Nineteen oh eight turns out to be a constitutional on par nibble offense today which indicates just how\nStrange and a funeral all of these issues are\nOpen up the markets certainly but does that mean parity in every position\nNo because the available pool was not based upon the number of\nPeople in the United states by sex which is what Jerry Brown thinks about it's obviously going to be dependent upon the number of people are the kinds of qualifications it unique forgiven kinds of jobs\nAnd who knows what that is\nAbout the one thing that is quite certain and many advocates for women on boards agree with this point is that the last person who knows what to do about this is the state of California and it turns out that it's really complicated\nIf you have a four people on a board and you want to add a fifth of all of a sudden you have to have two women that means you got to go to six but once you're a six you have to go three women so now you're at seven\nAnd it's very difficult to fill seats on boards and if you're going to try and fill hundreds of seats literally on major public corporations with a group of women\nAnd then you're going to face the other question can you have a sex only\nRule here and Blount acknowledge that this was a constitutional difficulty but the wages that you're going to pay for the men and for the women are going to have to defer a because the men essentially are not going to be in the same demand is the limit is gonna be a very strong demand for that query\nAnd can you buy sects used different wages other companies may be completely boxed in and most people say oh my God was aboard you put people on because of specific\nAreas of expertise and it may be that there are many many women with MBA's an advanced degrees\nBut the question is you know something about a particular form of solar energy development and if you don't you're not the kind of person that you need for that particular board and we do know that you know for example if you look in applicants in schools\nDo social work eighty five to eighty eight percent of the albums tend to be female you do naval architecture it's over Ninety five percent male so the sex decoration begins very early on and it works its way up through the decision tree the boards of directors\nOr Richard ... is there any indication anywhere from the empty I studied in one I'm reference before\nA is there indication there are there metric to demonstrate that parity such as California is recommending would grow the economy would lead to prosperity habits anybody ... able to come up with a study that we demonstrate that\nWell they purport to do so the number the size of the game that they claim which is roughly twenty six percent of the economy piece opposes that women\nAll of a sudden or identical to men in the productivity is abilities in school but\nThen there was nothing to show that the current pool of women\nIf in fact put into these positions would be able to create that sort of game um and in fact nobody believes it's possible if you make a major reform in various areas of wall and you could cope say one tenth of\nA point GDP gain out of it you're doing well and if you get three or four or five of them together and you could sort of get a half a trillion dollars and that's real money or the thought that somehow or other by changing the rules on employment\nOr that you could get a twenty six percent improvement means that new thing every business is colossally stupid and the way in which is organized itself bypassing up this pool\nThat they really are willing to blow up the machine in order to get even with what they regard\nLet it go unless go to number two the recommendation and I've heard Gerald ... who is if if the Democrats control the house of representatives slated to be the chairman of the Judiciary Committee speak of impeaching justice Kavanaugh is that a practical thing well\nRegarded as a very dangerous suggestion\nIf you're talking about the situation in a nomination for the Supreme Court but the advice and consent function of the Senate\nThe Democrats have a perfect right to vote against capital for any reason on and on and so you don't care about burden of proof and eat all the Democrats who are convinced that misplaced before it was correct\nWere also adamantly opposed him before you go into an a peach but it's a criminal trial and all of a sudden they really are due process rules and there are examinations and all sorts of other things\nAnd for somebody to sort of announced that you're going to do and impeachments situation\nMeans that they have to assume that they were right on that particular case and it seems to me that the reason the NY voted not change is that the uncorroborated clams on the one son did not stand up after\nMultiple FBI investigations and not only the denial by justice ... uh but by all the corroborating evidence that was introduced on his side so I regard this as a terrible idea it will simply keep things worse and it will try to create a stain on the court I thought the\nBest thing that happened uh the other day is when he was sworn in all eight other justices of the Supreme Court came to the ceremony if one of them had been absent it would've been a terrible signal about the legitimacy of this and I think in effect what happens is\nEverybody should accept the appointment\nJustice cabinet oh I think made a serious mistake in the way and when she got so angry although I forgive him for that but I think going forward what we have to do is to get all this and everybody has to behave as though it has never happened\nAnd that includes a justice capital she cannot sort of try to take this out on anybody knowing everything I Know about his character not personally but from other people\nI think he's up to that task\nConstitutional overhaul that can take many faces let's say that the president no longer has authority to appoint a Supreme Court justice and passed off to Congress or other recommendations as well or is it very unlikely we'd overhauled the constitution but it is to just it as a remedy two of the cabinet or unhappiness\nWell the two things one it'd be an absolute me late to sort of assume that the Congress gets to pick somebody without a nomination the process of nomination with advice and consent for principle offices into our judges has been with us for many years\nIt's obviously a political process but things are worse the important constitutional change would I Am in favor of making is to make these appointments for a term of say Eighteen years Fifteen Years right\nTerm limited next recommendation term limits that it\nI have defended that for many many years I think it's absolutely critical there is a factor in the United states all article three judges as they're called have lifetime terms so no one ever we create a specialized tribunal\nThere is an enormous resistance on the part of everybody to make them article three judges is much more efficient to put them in a bankruptcy court and so forth which has a fourteen or Fifteen your trip we should make that the\nConstitutional norm I had a recent discussions with Jeff Rosen an Adam lift tack on that atom who's from the New York times and I disagree on many things but we were one on that particular propose\nAnd term limits ...\n... ... is there a number that they talked about Richard that everybody Fifteen\nTo Eighteen years you don't want her to be a short his political appointments but you don't want it to be so long or the other restriction which I'm In favor of this getting people out at seven eight I'm saying this when I'm Seventy five so I'm now barred\nFor life but I Do think what you want to\nDo is to make sure that you don't get these generational shift in fact I Believe the same thing is true for the Senate and the house the libertarians always used to say three in the\nIn the house at six years and two in the Senate I thought that was much too short when I'm In favor of something like ten in the house in four in the Senate or twenty and twenty four years I think there's something\nDeeply wrong with the process when the head of two committees based on city already about eighty five years old trying to figure out the way in which the future should do I thought Grassley behave admirable I cannot say the same\nThing about Senator Feinstein and will not but if you're thinking about this is a process you do not want people at that age taking dominant position is in the United states if they're still vigorous they can do all sorts of things in the private sector but incumbency is not a rapid or sensible road but figuring out the way in which we govern this country\nAnd finally the McConnell rule which Mr McConnell is called the Biden ruled this is just suggest than in the final year of president said the nomination wait for the people to vote before the new president or the continued president makes the choice\nIs that a recommendation that could be institutionalized\nIt's already there this is something that you don't need to do by legislation um let me go back and say what I thought about the McConnell decision backed is respected Merrick Garland\nPoint number one is gone with a perfectly qualified judge a judge of some genuine distinction and a great deal of affection by everybody who knew there was no issue about quality whatsoever and that\nPoints to should not have come up but\nOn the other hand it was very clear not withstanding the fact that it was sixty three notwithstanding the fact that there was more conservative than the other four liberals on every major vote he would have switched essentially the other side and that includes campaign financing it includes guns that includes affirmative action the whole Schmidt an abortion\nNow I think the Republicans should have said\nWe don't care about the next election we just don't want this guy and we think we want to keep this open and we lose the election then you get to a point Tim and somebody else I think candor would have been much better that Democrats were perfectly candid their attitude was if they had even\nA majority of fifty one forty nine there's no way they would have confirmed cabin on the only grounds an objection that they would have made a what we don't want to switch it over and at that point they would have done something which\nThank God the Republicans did namely that would not have had hearings at which point we would not have this terrible situation what happened this time around is the Republicans knew if they played it safe\nThey're going to win fifty one forty nine fifty two forty eight with causes it was fifty five forty five ... not going to get that the second time around but Democrats knew they play it safe it's fifty one forty nine and they lose so they have to blow up the entire thing which is why long before we actually got to the sexual scandals involved in this case the\nDemocrats were having people come into the courts that we're having points of orders that were grandstanding in one form or another and keeping secret information which they laid a load on the ball\nAnd I think an effect that is what I regard as is not a not acceptable if they all of them in a house that day number one we will not vote for this man right\nRight because we dislike him I'd say thank you it's an understatement at which point I Would do the following thing I said good we don't have any need for Harry convince you don't want it we're convinced that we do want him why do we want the craze if you do have a hearing I have another recommendation\nJohnny ... go ahead twenty never\nLet the candidates speak because all you'll do is you

but they won't let him make the leap\nAnd that's important to understand that because that's his motive here\nHe is not just an ambitious young that I learned from you that he is ... he is trying to break in to the dominant class in America and that's not allow\nAnd it burns it he keeps a close diary much of your book is based on his right can you see it in his notes\nAbsolutely there is a moment

city has confidence in himself that I I I don't have a word for it it's not self election he doesn't have a mentor\nOr he's frightened he's even he aged ... fear of heights fear of flying but he overcomes you talk about his willpower what does he say it is in his notes how does he talk about his confidence\nYou know he um\nFor the first six months of flying he's nauseous all the time they'll throw up in his cockpit will come down you'll throw up he's you know he has height problems he had an injury to one of his eyes and an accident when he was a kid that has left him you know with some depth perception problems this as a kid\nA young man who flying is not natural immediate you think oh it must have been natural it wasn't at all so this is where this willpower comes in he had the strength and the focus to get through it to be above that and yet at the same time\nHe was very clear about acknowledging that fear was an important thing to fear feel because people flyers who didn't have fear who weren't scared\nWe're going to die and they did in droves so what Edie took from the race car days was a finding that line you're NASCAR race we're talking about this now finding that

cheapest level and he knows he's going up to actually fight other aircraft\nThe Germans had superior aircraft the folk her aircraft or extremely superior to the Newport these were French bill but he never backs off the presses and presses until they give him a chance to fly\nWith what becomes the Ninety seven ... however he still treated with disdain by his fellow officers by the other she's a
