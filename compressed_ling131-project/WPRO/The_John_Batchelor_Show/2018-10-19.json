Hoover Institution\nVictor is man at the moment because he has been writing for years from California from the Hoover Institution and traveling the country about the failure of Congress to respond to immigration to migration\nTo the needs of the American people quite apart from the needs of say the Central American people who are marching towards the border right now we're told we're told they're marching towards the border we're seeing videos are marching toward the border we don't know entirely who they are we're told a little bit that are a hundred and sixty people started out\nIn Central America and it looks like several thousand now we're told that they are being handed things that looked like coupons and we can see the video but we don't know any facts other than the fact that the president and his ... responded\nVigorously with remarks in these last hours and that John Bolton national security advisor and John Kelly the chief of staff had strong words or the wall Street Journal prefers the word explosives\nIn the oval office today there was also a little bit that Bolton and Trump lined up against Kelly that sounds more like a more of a fair fight Victor good evening to you\nThe march toward the border this is a re creation of things that we've seen during the Obama administration the Trump Administration inherited that policy and I'm going to presume that nothing's been improved good evening to you\nAnd evening has the Trump Administration made any adjustments is this provocation in order to show up the Trump Administration in order to take advantage of the Trump Administration how to regard it\nWell I think it's no it's right before the midterms and so I think the international well Central American governments would encourage one of our left is suggesting that if\nThere's a melodrama psycho drama like there was in July where families can be separated under the guise of being a fry them seekers and refugees rather than just people like most people come the United states wanting a better life\nThan that with her own Trump in the mid term and therapy ... as you remember about three or four points in July of two calls may team\nAnd so that's I think that's the timing and then\nA contrary they feel that the Republicans might keep the house there might be a border wall authorized and actually bill and so this would be the last time you can get across I think the mid term loom large as far as the timing of\nHow to regard this from the part of the partisan the bass first of all the base Republicans responded very well in twenty six team to the talk of build the wall is that still the case your measure Victor\nYeah I think it's a it's a much more winning issue even now than it was then because we've gone through all of these either rations a psycho drama that Colbert or melodrama from I think people are starting to see that the news cycle is for people here illegally that are committing crimes that are impacting negatively\nCommunities and that's when California about forty percent of so called Latinos Hispanics expressed the desire to close the border\nAnd the Democrats are there was a great deal of attention to the separation of families over those last month that ... that issue seemed to have been park to the side they went to a more exciting headlines like Kavanaugh\nJust this issue of the ... of the caravan they call the caravan it looks like a a march toward the border does is engage the Democratic base\nAll right I think that's the effort but I'm not I'm not sure it is for the priest cynical drawn I remember it's only based on the idea there's twenty or so million illegal aliens or when there was three or four number that Chuck Schumer and the Clintons Cesar Chavez even were for border enforcement because they felt that\nOpen borders negatively impacted minority communities are there uh it competed for social services eroded the wages of union and the level workers but only when they flipped California New Mexico Colorado Nevada do they feel that open borders were advantageous\nBut it's kind of predict it's kind of emblematic of the current Progressive Party that the laws just\nA useful if not that's no sanctity of the apps trucks or whether it's cabin on\nThe end of due process we're talking about getting rid of the electoral college were making the Senate like the house all of these positions are predicated on power so open borders now or a good thing and and if they were right wing\nCubans they would not want them coming in\nThe Mexican police are reported very nicely at a ... a manning the U.S border\nTo prevent the caravan from charging illegally across the border\nThere are those who have need for sanctuary and they can apply there are those who have papers many are boasting they don't what's so hard about this story victories that I don't I don't rely on any I Can't count on any of the sources the information all seems loaded\nTo go one way or the other so since we had a the upset in two thousand sixteen we have a new president I'm low in Mexico who has been a ... who has been cooperative with the Trump Administration in terms of trade\nDoes that suggest that there's going to be a ... a change of tactics used by Mexico this time the caravan reaches the border\nYeah I think there might be a likelihood that they're going to try to help a little bit more than they have in the past because\nThey they have a ... economic remember they run a Seventy one billion dollar trade surplus with us when they get thirty billion dollars and remittances mostly from illegal aliens are subsidized by American social programs but\nI don't think they want to jeopardize that may feel for the first time that trumps the type of unpredictable president that might in fact jeopardize that relationship so I think they're going to be a little bit I mean they want them to come across the causes discomfort or the Wayne what's in their self interest\nThe report here from the Associated Press Mexico's federal police commissioner said the officers\nDispatched will support immigration agents Mexico said migrants will have to show a passport and visa or apply for refugee status otherwise they will face deportation that as an update of what we saw during the Obama administration and the first year of the Trump Administration now the larger story Victor ... days to go to the to the mid term\nImmigration is one of the stories that that can be told on the well known cables I keep repeating the political science mantra that we vote on pocket book is that still the case or people's passions persuading them that there there are these other issues to key on now\nI think it's it's complex but I think it's still you know four percent economic growth and record near record on them a little one in ... but the only danger and that is that when people are doing very well they have the leisure the complacency that to to look at hot button social cultural issue that's what the Democrats\nAre counting on that this can be a referendum on the cruelty of Donald Trump but I think you're seeing with Mexico that for all of Obama's um ma liberal of a ... an international as some people didn't have any respect for him and people are starting to sense that\n\nI'm John bachelor this is the John ... show I welcome my colleague leader Lisa dumped her she is the foreign desk and she reports dummy routinely on Iran and the matters of Iraq dishes about Iran but it's not\nAbout Iran in ... it's about Iran in the\nIn the university environment today and the discussion about Iran and the university environment today I've told similar stories about China but this is the first one I have that Iran is the centerpiece leads to a very good even do you are a very happy graduate of Rutgers University and most recently within these last days\nYour schedule to give it to give a presentation on campus about Iran in the world uh what was the presentation and why did it not happen good evening to you Lisa\n'cause he's a well this was a very unfortunate situation by my alma mater with by the by the university itself often when you hear a ... protests that are shut down\nA are cancelled by this all this is usually a teacher or the fringe organization or you know the calculus or ... or a a group that pro Israel a set down by pro Palestinian group but this was an invitation from the university itself\nAnd I was given the subject of a by the University of south to speak about radical Islam on college campuses\nI expanded that to talk to your freedom of speech on college campuses that was going to give a very comprehensive talk about the environment of the college campus today a in light of protests in light of empty hashtags in light of those are good\nEt cetera last week the vice chancellor of a school called me I guess with a former professor of mine that I just want to let you know that's a\nCounter protest Shaq was started again you coming to the school speaking and alleging that you are and as long as\nA now they're on you know he very well and those who follow my work very well it was that the bulk of the work that I Do it in the bending of Muslim the Muslim world\nAgainst terrorism against human rights abuses against yes again sex slavery against either that\nOr something that I've always defended again\nA with a a very ugly and tore a movement now at the petition that was started by one a student and the students is the head of the a progressive students a group and that worked on Bernie Sanders' campaign is also a Muslim students part of the ... to the organization\nA deliberately misquoted me a in a speech that gave that Heritage Foundation of two thousand Fifteen which I said uh the uh you know Islamic terror\nA claim to take a break from the Koran and he claims that he he quoted ... thank Islamic ... for a check on the Koran and for that do that I Am\nIn back in a log into\nThe school did not look into the allegations they said that they have to be sensitive\nAh students and shut down\nThe speech and cancelled my talk now in the statement that school released to the press they said that he talked with his back postpone but when he spoke to me they said that it was cancelled but they don't expect me to accept another indication from the school\nUh but the last few days this has gotten so much media talked to a crowd of other statements thing that they are in fact inviting me back to school or to do with talk yeah you know I'm an offered me for different they\nAre claiming that the school doesn't believe in fact in freedom of speech when in fact obviously it appears that they shut down to the beach in my talk so obviously John\n... a very uh\n[noise] uh I Would say ugly painful a week that I've had because this was in my alma mater the I only ever see that this when they talk about I was going to give out the freedom of speech\nUh and really having the school not believe in having my reputation and good name uh in in this arena or where I have again always always differentiated between the Muslim people are and the hijacking of Islamic political Islam and radical Islam\nA reset and Lisa this sounds like you're you're helping Rutgers learn something about a game that's going on and it and it's going on in many campuses and it was directed at you it really doesn't matter how the weapon is what the weapon is\nThat people claim a grievance and the university or the college campus immediately runs away it's very strange I hear the story again repeatedly is all the different subjects but at the same matter fact at the university didn't look into the person who written the complain they didn't know they call him on any homework did they\nThey didn't you anyhow my will be that they met with the students yeah or the vice chancellor told me on the phone that to be honest with you I didn't understand his grievances against you but I have to be sensitive to them because they sound like they're very much injured by you\nAre and they and bite you kept it\nUp again these are words and your social justice but where where they get people to sign a petition because of the word Islam right because of the word racist because of the word bigot because of the word ...\nPrivate it's a it's a bit down the list it's a\nTemplate where the attacker has the advantage and you were attacked us and you have no there is no easy defense and because of the university went along with it now is the university why sir have you heard in any well fashions from the deans of the professors you were speaking with that they've learned a lesson here\nYou know it didn't seem like they learned a lesson in ... they learn a lesson in so far as she's defend their their name her PR purposes because thankfully the silver lining if people like yourself John gave\nMe a platform or or reported on this story and we we want and that is a silver lining\nThat initially I was very much frustrated because I thought one because they launched it very I'm disabled attack again rotten without any proof but like I\nHave you heard about have you heard from the University in anything like an apology\nWell they the apology was that that email that they sent in the form of a second statement saying that uh we're sorry you should\nUh that's not an apology Lisa that it's not it's hard to tell us now and I think that's the old I'm Sorry if you were offended that's not an apology Zach\nFell by ... by it soccer\nThough when does this mean when when one could whether they invited you when can you go on campus 'cause everybody's gonna want to hear you know\nEveryone wants to talk but to be honest uh John I haven't I haven't made the announcement yet but I'll make it or if\nI'm alright alright fine if sooner rather than later ride Lisa\nWell I think that's going to do this speech on I'm On social media that I have a broader audience short I clicked yes and I could face because I have received threats when I wanted to go to camp is a and you know what I I feel I feel betrayed by by all the modern so it's very difficult to say I\nI

get the message that you better not go after you know permanent residents in the United states in third countries that other journalists that mean that's what I think a very important thing that it's important norm that we would like to\nUphold at this point that the Saudis violated and so they have to pay a price that said I Am not in the camp that says we should reevaluate the relationship I I don't I don't think that\nIn America's interest by any stretch 'em so there are some options and those options I think of revolve around a couple of points wanted something known as the global Magnitsky Act which\nAllows the United states to impose restrictions on the travel\nUh finances of individuals without addressing necessarily the military to military or the Allison's relationship between Saudi Arabia in the United states [noise] another thing I think is again to resist the temptation to go along with the Saudi cover up a that does not mean that Donald Trump has to\nYou know give a speech where he blames Mohammed bin Salman but just not having the United states\nYou know ... you know whoa side on whatever story the Saudis are going to give us about\nTheir minister of intelligence and it was ... you know the crown prince of know about it if we believe that that is not true then the United states did not feel that they have an obligation\nTo go along with it and that's an important point as well and then I Would I Would ask the state department to investigate the disappearing journalists I Would um\nYou know I Would I Would I Would think about you know not necessarily a wholesale suspension of arms sales but something where you know they got the message that certain systems they might want that aren't exactly necessary but I think they have to be that there has to be an understanding that they pay very heavy price at this point\nEven if I think it's unrealistic to the United states can affect\nA you know some sort of changing leadership at this point because my ... has eliminated all many of his rivals and a lot of ways so you know in the world are stuck with him but that's not necessarily a good thing\nYou were on the eve of the Iran sanctions on the eve yeah is that is that a significant factor just a coincidence\n[noise] well I mean I don't know why uh again I think that uh any rational person they would have been in the room when these decisions are being made you know would have said this is crazy to to do what you're thinking you're going to do here but\nUm you know there I think that there was a mistake from the Trump Administration which is that they basically looked the other way when you saw all the sort of signs calming\nHariri thing or you know some of the purchase I mean we we we've heard rumors that it wasn't just the Ritz Carlton House arrest where he you know got a lot of money in back taxes and the claim there were some members of the royal family who had much more grim\nFate or out of helicopters released this has been reporting in some places so the U.S should have been a little bit fervor on these things maybe you have just waited\nA Mohammed bin Salman from thinking he could get away with something like this and ... that's a kind of speculation that by the way it's an argument also for\nTaking a tougher line with other allies like journalists in Egypt where you know I last I heard something like sixty thousand people are arrested not all of those people are Muslim Brotherhood\nYou know terrorists I mean there are a lot of you know regular dissident liberal that you know only a few years ago a decade ago George W. Bush made it a big way of\nFighting for those cards and exemptions and so we need to send a message that our allies are going to be held to a higher\nStandard than uh the world world's rogue states like North Korea Russia a country like that and again it's not just to make us feel good because you have an interest in making sure that journalists like myself\nAre not going to be abducted and killed if they are going through with Saudi or some other countries out you lie leg is Bloomberg View\nWelcome\nHome line conference presidents major American Jewish organizations I'm John bachelor\nYou'll know that I traveled to the republic of Azerbaijan this past summer it was my second trip in two years broadcasting from the richest as the Caspian Sea bass\nI discovered that Azerbaijan as a country of bountiful resources the farmland produces the fresh food in Eurasia the energy sectors are expanding by the minute now reaching out pipelines to Asia Minor in Europe\nTo help with energy security for our allies and for NATO\nWhat I've learned is that as a by John as a prosperous country with big dreams and the leadership to support the dreaming of freedom and growth of the legendary Silk Road I'm most privileged to have the embassy of the republic of Azerbaijan in the U.S to support my weekly business reports I Will be highlighting what I'm learning about Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea regular\nFrom food to energy to a knowledge economy the Republican ... and the Caspian Sea bass in is a region I look forward to exploring and I invite you along [noise]\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nI spent years studying how to make this the best I didn't make this because I wanted to make a company other companies are starting to catch on to this and I buy every single other product that comes out so I can look at it and see it in test it and I fear that people will buy some counterfeit don't be fooled this is the real stuff we have absolutely\nThe best process and I can say that because we purchase every single one and check them out\nI don't think that was on the market nothing ever worked for the first thing that's really worth nothing can compare what the benefits of balance of nature\nFor a limited time use discount code John and we'll take thirty five percent off your first preferred sets of fruits and veggies and have them shipped to you free call eight hundred two four six eight seven five one\nThat's one eight hundred two four six eight seven five one or go on line to balance of nature dot com and use discount to John\nNow is the time to start planning does remodeling projects with quality\nTile counter tops in West Warwick I'm ... quality Kyle countertops is a family business and the owners villain Denise how to model that I just ... we're not trying to be the biggest we're just trying to do the best job for you before project lead their facility it has to live up to their high standards if you are not happy\nThey're not happy and projects are all done with minimum disruption in your home they created a template of your counter tops then remove the old and installing a new countertops in just one day one day quality tile countertops has a show room with entire kitchens and bats\nOn display for you with cabinets manatees sink faucet back splash options of all kinds [laughter] they're easy to find right off the highway\nSixty nine after St west Warwick\nPaul eight to six Ninety seven hundred or visit quality tile R.

up the turkeys in the story to help us\nVery very carefully because there are a lot of coincidences here is Steve Cook the any Enrico macho by senior fellow for Middle East African studies at the council on Foreign Relations have a very good evening to you okay a one or two private aircraft landed his double airport\nAnd very large men get off associated with security services to proceed to the\nIstanbul conflict of this out of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia within hours\nA man who's been held for two years Andrew Brunson and a pastor charged as a spy or a security risk by the Turkish authorities is released coincidence or do these dots connected in any fashion good evening to stay\nGood evening to you um you know ... my mind I it is a happy coincidence that the government of turkey\nThat at a moment when the government is Saudi Arabia which is an adversary a turkey is under fire for the disappearance of a journalist named ... gee I'm the Turks\nSuddenly a release a this pastor Andrew Brunson who's been held since\nA number of months after the attempted coup in into two thousand at sixteen I I think the Turks are looking to ride the wave of goodwill coming from the release of Brunson and the outrage here in the United states over the killing of could choke gee\nUh to their great benefit welcome\nYou have ... written a obviously a lot about turkey and try to assess\nA president or the one's intentions this clearly was a godsend for him at a time when its economies and collapsed they've had this new focus a Ford the public attention so the question is what does how do they benefit will to press\nThe oil refinery the major oil refineries turkey get a waiver to continue buying Iranian oil after this November sanctions\nDo you think that um that this will boost are the ones efforts to transform you know the new turkey is he called it and give him cover after his horrendous actions including arresting a hundred thousand people\n[noise] it's it's really rather extraordinary ah I think that the Saturday missteps in the disappearance of presume murder to mock show she\nUm had made air to one a paragon of press freedoms and protections when we know that he's actually the world's leading jailer of journalists\nUm and he is riding a certain amount of goodwill on it is true that the major Turkish oil refinery to press wants a waiver on when it comes to sanctions on Iran although it seems that everyone wants to hang tough on on the question of sanctions\nIt it it turns out that actually trade between turkey and Iran was higher under sanctions that it was after section so and there's all kinds of incentives for Turkish ministers to engage in graft and corruption around these these sanctions\nSo aired on after releasing this American pastor who'd been in prison um looks like he's gonna hang up and try to defy the United states on on sanctions but overall he's looking pretty good right now I'm at a time when his economy is on the verge of collapse so I think\nUm Saturday missteps or have really helped a lot of ways it's a it's it's a rather stunning turn of events\nYes just last week Steve we were hanging around the water cooler thinking now ... and ... and Rowhani talking about invading the sanctions and ... about the loss of turkey and now Turkey's back\nIs is is this what Turkey's been like for the last hundred years since the end of the Ottoman said goes out of favor in favor of papers it's cyclical\n[noise] it is to some extent cyclical\nDestroying the Cold War every time we had a problem with the Turks who was swept under the rug because the Soviet Union was the overarching threat to both countries um now it's kind of come in and out of favor although official Washington has tried to continue to sweep things under the rug\nThink with the return event Andrew Brunson a there is a a brief respite in the tension between the two countries but there's a long list of problems between\nTurkey and the United states chiefly um the Turkish intention to buy Russian air defense systems from uh from Moscow uh the uh help that the Turks have given the Iranians in the in evading sanctions\nThe U.S relationship with Syrian a Syrian Kurdish fighting force that the Turks regard as as terrorists these are these are just three of you know Fifteen or so problems between the two countries so it's likely to rear its ugly head again after the good feeling after the release of Brunson\nUm but you know official Washington has a has a long history of sticking his head in the sand when it comes to a Turkish misdeeds\nNothing but there are other aspects of this that again get a little attention as people just focus on the murder and how they murdered them how they caught him up I'm ... and one of them is the regional message both what the United States does\n... if they don't come down strong enough or they come down to strong our allies read this and one in particular and I was hoping you could comment on something that is sort of baffling we've seen how prisoners OCC was United States recently met and he very positive and yet his rhetoric\nAnd some of his speeches have become a more of a throwback to the anti Israel language of the same time that they are fully cooperating in in military and security cooperation\n[noise] yeah it's interesting I mean it it comes around the same time as the annual Egyptian celebration of their quote unquote victory in the October Nineteen Seventy three war\nUm but I think that you know there is a limit for the Egyptians when it comes to cooperation with the Israelis and I think that\nAt least publicly I think that the military to military and security cooperation is extremely important to\nTo both parties but um she she is vulnerable politically he has been consolidated his power\nAnd one of the things that Egyptian leaders are you know they go to the well on is a is Israel and painting Israel as an enemy and and and having to\nYou know have kind of national unity uh in in a confrontation with a with the Israelis I think this is a lot of rhetoric for public consumption but behind the scenes\nOr it strikes me that uh the security cooperation will continue if if only because Egypt since really need it they've proven themselves to be benefits the incompetent and trying to pacify their own territory in the Sinai Peninsula and it needed a significant amount of Israeli help\nAh the thing is he still I'm taking phone calls from Moscow [noise] oh\nTechnology and compassion\nMost of all you can choose where you or a loved one who

dot com\nThat being a you know in a year\nI'm John ... knock on the whole line early the seventeenth Israeli town\nA rocket fired from Gaza long range lock struck back ... that's a large city to the north of the Gaza Strip a lot of Russian immigrants live in ... I visited once because they'd rocket at a school this looks like a much larger rockets drop this is a mosque Malcolm now Hamas rocket\n... this was an upgraded grad missile with a bigger payload and larger and it hit\nA house in ... which I Am a single mother and her three children were living but you know they get usually a Fifteen twenty twenty five seconds warning but she heard as soon as she heard the sirens that an incoming missile was on the way they quickly went into the basement\nThe whole front of the house was shared off this explosion took a concrete home and shattered\nSo this was not a a small weapon this was a significant felt license significant impact I'm ... and certainly in Israel that fact that they attack that's one of the red lines Israel can't tolerate that can't you know it's one thing when the shooting mortars across and\nThey made life miserable for half a million or more people in the south the fires from these balloons the incendiary devices that burning tires that has caused a respiratory illnesses amongst many children\nAre at the they burn half the fires your gossip about twelve hundred actors of land but and about altogether between farmland land about ten thousand acres destroying crops killing wildlife destroying forests\nAnd and Israel has demonstrated such incredible power it the attack on the ... goes beyond that\nThe response was immediate and yet the response is not adequate Malcolm because their other aggression or the tunnels where are they\nThe tunnels are very serious matter and and you're quite right the people of Israel are demanding harsher response was I think Egypt\nMaybe others are urging the Israel to a moderate its response and not to pack and uh the they began again negotiations the Egyptian intel chief was started it again or between with the ... with us\nOr as you know there are layer upon layer here yet Hamas versus the PA Hamas versus pigeon other groups\nAnd you have of course turkey involved Iran and route car and Bob uh the war with Israel so many things in this ah onion that you can take layer after layer but the the Israel or the IDF attacked twenty targets military target somewhere rocket installations others\nBut one of the most important was the tunnels and these are tunnels for terror they're very sophisticated these are not just the saint castle operations they uh they involve the costs of perhaps millions of dollars that they are electrified day of like the air conditioning\nAnd they are developing the Palestinians the terrorists are developing new means new technologies new materials\nThat can deflect attention Israel has technology they use a combination of of the sensors territorial censors 'em and they use intelligence and a technological sensors\nTo um to gather information they destroyed sixteen tunnels this year including the one recently which was a huge one\nBut the estimates are that there are perhaps thirty attacked tunnels and several dozen more that are defensive and bite defensive I mean that they're used to hide arms die soldiers you know underground so that they can go on to do a surprise attack with it or when they come under fire they can hide their\nUh we've seen that these that they're getting more sophisticated in the rockets and mortars that are are um are are being fired\nAnd be a so Israel has to develop new methods all the time to detect the tunnels because there are only purpose is for ... they want to kidnap they want to murder and the uh you know they have the fence now that's going a little Israel's borders so it helps protect somewhat though not the\nUh completely so the the tunnels remain a really serious or a danger and that's why the idea of hit them and try to hit other infrastructure without causing civilian casualties and nobody knows this but there are no reports about civilian casualties\nMalcolm who claimed credit for the rocket attack\nNo one and it's interesting how ... both said wasn't us we're investigating wasn't us and um that seems to be quite common in the middle east today but the fact is that\nIt has to be you can't fire from Gaza without them knowing especially you know a a large rocket ah being able to track exactly where where it's coming from and who was behind it\nAnd the you know the Hamas has been charging if uh you know when you were in charge you're responsible even the EU issued a statement that said that the indiscriminate attacks against civilian\nPopulations that are not acceptable I Wonder if discriminate attacks are but they said you know that rockets and he has to stop but they will take no action they don't do anything to implement it\nIn the meantime you have the escalation because it's diversion from the internal problems you know the PA bart the oil from going in now Israel has closed obviously the crossings and stuff because they placed bombs on them are on the Israel's border are no Israeli soldiers so it's not against\nOccupation and that's come us itself said we're using the divert attention from domestic concerns in domestic or domestic problems\nMalcolm whole line conference presidents major American Joe ...

we met with a cabinet minister who was in charge of transportation as well as security\nAnd he talked about a rare a plan that will cross Jordan and I believe link up with the old railroad line that goes all the way down the red sea coast of Saudi Arabia to Jetta but I'm remembering and distinctly what is it\nNo you are actually remembering quite correctly I think the the the outline that we were shown they're now talking about serious consideration being given to developing a this railroad that was\nStarted high ... which is a long Israel's Mediterranean coast than in the north of Israel would go across to the beach on valley more central and then on to erupted which is in Jordan\nThan south to Janine in the Palestinian authority there with ... with the existing or a train tracks\nAnd eventually make the way to Saudi Arabia\nAnd to ... to Saudi Arabia and to the Persian Gulf you could think of the economic implications this would have how beneficial it could be for everyone\nAs I recall two years ago they concern was that the Palestinians have no\nRight and they still have not said yes even though it could mean a tremendous economic boom\nOf all of them and ah you know the existing guy he just existing railroad is there's so many of the much of this could be done a fairly quickly and you know the trade it would give them\nAccess to the Mediterranean ports that his Jordan and Saudi Arabia and it would have income for the Palestinians for Israel for the other countries\nUh it it could be beneficial in so many ways but as you know that often the Palestinians put their own political ideological or personal interest head of the interests of the people and the benefit of the people\nIt's a very good idea it was the time that it occurred to me that the Palestinians will never go along with it despite the obvious advantages much like I've seen other parts of the world how come where any allergy Trump's or any prosperity that sanity right a there is a secret delegation in Ukraine now what kind of secret are we going to put on the air here about\nWell we're not telling everybody else is just between our eyes okay because it wouldn't be nice to to

uh going through a military exercises\nJointly and there's you know there was a great deal of cooperation between us and Israel military and defensive and security measures and in technology and other things but here you have a specific are concerned that both have been with the as three hundred coming to Syria\nOr which could impact both Israel's freedom to to fly in the area and the United states is freedom to to act um this is a very interesting little tidbit that was\nHow to respond that's another way of saying how to defeat correct I mean they ...\nThat's actually how you're going to confront if you you know Israel says they have the technology to be able to handle it but of course they don't want to see any Russian casualties they want us to try to limit the\nCasualties and here by having this opportunity to to train on the U.S three hundred to see how\nIt works um is is will be very beneficial that that we're seeing at Fifteen planes were seen training in Ukraine against the

they had delivered over overseas you know in a row boats\nThey've got a copy of your book what are they doing about it how they got a response good evening to your job\nWell thank you so much for having me and I I I feel obligated to note that the book has very brisk sales in Europe and in New Zealand their spikes\nIn the play in sales in the places that have these new space sports that are coming online so there's definitely a keen interest in space in Europe and they're ... they're falling behind the United states um and all the different regulatory in industrial reforms and all this reinvention spaceflight but I talk about\nIs having a real back then the Europeans are apparently very nervous about it they they uh this report from the advocacy group that came out is\nFilled with peril and ... they're they're not all that ... the United states that the United states has reinvented the way that they uh that that we achieve space uh and and and can take advantage of orbit is very interesting development\nYes they do they do have the European space agency but as we've learned big space isn't the answer what's going on now is commercialism of big space and you note in this

states does and that's what they are worried about their where they're going to lose their autonomy when it comes to space and the space industry\nAnd they look at the commercial space effort and the United states investment that you the commercial space industry and how the government that ... to do more things in the military and the industrial and then that's aside and they say what about all the you know we're we're falling behind what can we do the catch up\nThere and that's what this report and that's what I was reading about uh and and today's are right up\nDo have lots of bird but look some bugs in investor and commercial that they have some what they need our flag of convenience yeah what they need what they must have because I see China's a ping this by\nBy coming up with what they call small sat private companies which are actually an extension of the pie LA a launch vehicle system but what they needed something like rocket lab I mentioned rocket lab Joe cars rocket lab is one of a matrix of small sat launch boosters companies\nThat are looking to win contracts commercial contracts and rocket labs has now chosen wall of silence here on the east coast Virginia\nFor its launch site and that's an example of what you have throughout your book bay as a because the the whole ...\nThe the multiple the multiplication of launch vehicles is what's driving the story here not having really one launch site which by the way I mentioned Joe is in the new world not just having one launch side but having many launch sites and having the flexibility of companies to compete for those long sites\nWe're seeing the space\nIndustry led by the it's it's hard not to be ... about this because the United states did a a very calculated gamble and it started in the Bush administration and endured they say the your bottom administrator and and the Trump Administration is embracing it\nAnd doubling down on it in many ways and it's the United states is doing something different approaching space in a completely different way and it's paying off enormous dividends NASA\nCan now rely on cheaper launches focus on a more ambitious ex exploration\nRobotic and manned fight as well and the um the commercial side\nWhile but you know it was small satellites coming up on what you mentioned rocket lab that expands greatly the number of places that can get involved in the number missions out there more missions means happy space sports and I you know this experiment that happened with these three subsequent administration's they may not be another policy that\nIt has survived those three administrations intact like this not long that's wildly successful um it's starting to pay dividends they're there and what's happening now is the launch system's getting into space as being commercialized now they're looking at\nHuman space flight commercialize it\nAnd also landing on foreign bodies on celestial bodies landing on the moon is going to be leverage by commercial technology\nBeing military launches per although of billions of dollars pouring into military space a lot of that as being leverage in ah be of the commercial space companies that are coming out and not not just SpaceX I've actually lost the most recent one\nBlue origin um there's a new rocket I'm ... America hey that's being ... by the U.S military so this robust industrial base is really paying dividends and an enabling US government to do things that are lapping the Europeans and\nAnd are keeping pace with the new stuff with the Chinese are doing and and winning the United states off of Russian human launch vehicles to all these things are happening right in front of us so if it sounds like we're being optimistic or or being ... were just you know for me it just reporting what's happened\nIn the you you single out in your article and Popular Mechanics and the United kingdom space industry or is that all in all lead situation are they aware of the problem more than Europe\nThey have a a big steak is but I mean especially in satellite manufacture I think it's like forty percent of the\nCommercial communication satellites that\nAre roots in the u._k. somewhere they've got the space port in Scotland the new one coming on line there very much but very proud\nSpace industry even though it's not very well funded and\nIt's hard to point to what the what they do\nIn the same way that you can ... with other nations but what they do is very good if they find these niches and it can exploit them in the future then they'll find a home but they want an organic capability to do this and\nThey're waking up to the fact that other people have this and the wall and it doesn't sit well with their national pride in their national security or certainly and uh\nOr the or misrepresent patients about I'm a genetically engineered organisms and also the herbicide like likes to say that her years with them um and a ... law suits and all sorts of manifestations but specifically\nA what my recent article was about was that you use or misuse\nOf freedom of information request a to hire as academics at a public institutions\nAnd so um there has been a professors or who have been a Harris than intimidated by these mountains of a freedom of information request that the University of Illinois University of Oklahoma law school\nWashington state university University of California Davis and on and on and on\nAnd are among the worst was professor Kevin fold up a plant biologist at the University of Florida who uh who how to turn over tens of thousands of emails\nBut and he estimated that his institution a public university to spend over a million dollars in a betting man to decide which ones were disclose the ball and\nWhich ones were a now a this technique the freedom of information request a intimidation and stars that has been picked up\nA Europe as you alluded to so there's a a a an investigative journalist supposedly and since that harms of who uh is a requesting freedom of information a request a documents\nFrom various universities\nAnything to do with a biotechnology company or a conversations about so called ... disrupt there's\nA and it's very intimidated because researchers up neither the time nor the resources are to contend with with this kind of thing\nAh the the activists I should point out are very very well funded upkeep pockets from the organic industry on both sides of the pot and uh also\nUh they share the very same agenda\nUh with the Russian government that has a unleashed its trolls and a and a and an agent's a to a compromise American R D and the commercials like biology\nUs right now is the chief NGO are advocating these nuisance to against universities but I'm struck Henry by this a parent\nOr this apparent sympathy for the U.S right to know has with the anti vaccine activist as well is it the same group of people I mean do they have to have do they do they take phone calls from two directions and are the university's aware of this\nWell I ... the the universities are aware of it if they are if they read the expos those of us\nOr to to us right to know and some of these other groups now you you're rightly asking what the connection there is\nNot only are the groups like us right to know\nA funded by the organic industry they're they're they're ... um their ... their fellow travelers if you will or the natural products industries that the purveyor of quack chores who don't like vaccines\nAnd who don't like a legitimate pharmaceuticals\nWhich they regard as the competition and so or whether they're simply ... technology cooks or are taking their marching orders from the uh the ... ... quack chores who also fund them or or both\nOr is anyone's guess but they they certainly are a shells bought and paid for by the York down at industry and the uh the crack medicines natural products industry\nSo there have gotten will travel that's what they are us rented a right to know and is is for rent\nTo our country first seal activists who and this too and these two instances are looking to undermine are challenged best practices in Europe the European does your opinion to have a way of defending itself Henry or is it on every man for himself\nWell I think it's a it's every man for himself because the uh the ...

number is demanding alpha Nunberg command\nThere are a man named Bruce Ackerman are they aware as they plow into the Russians that they're out numbered and overwhelmed and being pushed into a strategy that can't possibly work\nOr not not initially they have there's some cause for hope ah you know the the central assumption of Austria Hungarian war planning\nBefore Nineteen fourteen was that the great war would be against the Russians and even if they were able to fight with the Serbs the Russians would intervene and so the bulk of their strength would have to fight the Russians and so they had pondered how would the\nThe relatively small Oscar Hungarian Army fight the vast Russian Army\nAnd this is a this is a really a perplexing problem for the Austrians because the Russian Army is going to advance on a very broad front from the Baltic Sea all the way down to to to Ukraine\nSo all the way down to the nice stir so where do where can the Austrian strike with any hope of victory well there was no hope of a victory in the sense of breaking through or sweeping around the Russian flank and marching to St Petersburg what's\nThe uh the Austrians always plan to do is to give it a short sharp jab at the Russians and knock them back and inflict heavy casualties and tear up their railways and retard their mobilization\nIn by time for the Germans to win and the west and then transport the trips to the east so often bag and a ... often bag and ... the three generals on the on this ah Eastern Front stunk all in the north for a out from Bergen the center of brute um in in the south at ...\nThey were the army's that uh we're gonna make the short sharp jab at the Russians and try to throw their mobilization of war they called it ... that was attacked\nIt's kinda like the the US marine corps you know hated all did a lot of the middle this was Austria Austrian armies slang for you know sort of a macho attacks you know smartly delivered without a lot of preliminary fire maneuvering and flank and just straight up the middle and uh you know over power the enemy with your mainland is as it were\nThis isn't really September Nineteen fourteen and you haven't seen that illustrate to me how nothing was going to work at one point\nSix Russians patrol get lost in the woods\nAnd they come across two thousand Austrian and they tried to surrender the Austrians instead you report one of the Austrian officer says in check to the Russian let us surrender to you and so six Russians take prisoner two thousand Austin\nYeah and this was you know this was a month or less into the war and already extreme demoralization on the Oscar Hungarian side and this was you know for many reasons first because the army was already suffering badly from nationality problems before the war\nParticularly among the checks which for one of the more sophisticated and and uh numerous\nA national minorities and the empire and they they held a lot of slots and the officer corps they were an industrialized rich province but the checks were really treated like second or third class citizens\nAnd they thought this was particularly appalling because of all the concessions given the Hungarians and Eighteen sixty seven the checks it always held up for the same kinds of concessions in and get them so by the time they get into the war in Nineteen fourteen\nYou see extreme disaffection among the checks both in the on the Russian front and on the Serbian front ah when we talk about the Serbian front we see whole check Eunice dissolving under fire and in this case that you just cited of this to the ... of check infantry surrendered by their own officers to patrol of six Russians\nThis it it doesn't get much worse than that\nBut as for the actual plan for the offensive there were two options there was either a ... southern stroke\nFrom ... to try to get around the left flank of the Russians are there was a ... northern stroke\nA northern blow to try to get around the rights of the Russians and the problem is that the Russians were so numerous and they mobilize so quickly unexpectedly quickly because of these huge French investments in in Russian infrastructure before the war so they could now mobilized and deployed far more quickly than the Austrians are even Germans it anticipated\nThey have so many troops on the line very early in the war that the Russians that the Oscar Hungarians really can't get around either flank with any hope of success\nSo in the end they launched this first battle of there's a battle called crowds Nick and then a battle called comb are off these are the first the opening battles on the Eastern Front both are are you know a small time Austria Hungarian victories but they're rapidly absorbed by these huge Russian numbers and the tables are quickly turned\nAnd then after that I mean after these these short sharp actions of the very beginning of the war it's all downhill for the Oscar Hungarians\nThere's a photograph in your book on September tenth Conrad the commander of the overall army but that's certainly the commander of the strike north\nAnd Archduke fried Rick I think they call him principal\nOr they travel to the front for what you say is one of three wartime visits and they're standing on a road looking off into the landscape and very flat and behind them looked to be a number of German officers German Natasha ...\nAnd they look ignorant no one's briefing them I guess they hear gunfire in the distance in this picture and accurate presentation of what intelligence they had about where the Russians were\nWell that's a great picture and uh and it it's interesting because it shows the the the very\nStrained relations between Conrad interested Frederick they're not really like ... who worked very much in tandem and they're very effective pair\nIn fact a freezer 'cause a half's burgundy's militarily inexperienced and Conrad is very nervous and thin skinned and so there's sort of gazing off as if to try to divine what's happening\nThey had good intelligence in the sense of that all of their frontline units where I'm from the second army and the and the third army\nAnd the fourth army and the case of that photo they're all in contact with the Russians and they're passing back information that they are in contact with you know a division or a brigade or a core or whatever\nSo they have a pretty good information plus they've got some limited aviation capabilities so they're getting flyer reports giving them you know it's a bigger picture of a Russian movements but it's just that um\nAs I talk about in the book their whole strategic conception was deeply flawed Conrad really believed he was an expert on into the offensive and he really believe that if he just kept attacking the Russians he would somehow over all of them he would somehow destroy\nTheir morale and throw them back and make them quick and um this was not a view confined to Conrad I mean you see this all around Europe in Nineteen fourteen the French are\nAre are just as bad in this respect the battle the frontiers in the battle of them are and they're launching these high concentrated attacks at the Germans and suffering grievous casualties but the the the the the differences that\nThe French rapidly adjusting shuffles everything back and change his tactics and goes into trenches\nContract never read things that I mean oh he does obviously by Nineteen Fifteen sixteen but throughout Nineteen fourteen in the first half of Nineteen Fifteen he's just like attacking relentlessly and his general just saying you know ... we can't I mean we're we're big were being destroyed\nAnd or the troops won't do it they they they won't go forward they've they've seen this this movie too many times\nAnd and yet Conrad who in you know you mentioned that photo and it's also quite good because it captures the essence of these two men who were shot two generals par excellence I mean they only go three times in three years to the front\nAnd uh and uh so they have very little sense of what's really going on and what it feels like to attack Russian quick firing artillery heavy artillery and machine guns and they're they are trying to make sense of the battle and and despite\nBeing briefed and everything else they're still or in these attacks\nThe ... the book is a mad to
