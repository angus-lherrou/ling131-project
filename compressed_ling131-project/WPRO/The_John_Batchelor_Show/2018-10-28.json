{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WPRO", "content": "Uh other agencies not not the city council but uh that's it I can tell you that\nIf you're coming before the council and you know\nYou are a had decided agreements\nAnd we voted on in other collective bargaining agreement in two thousand sixteen this one was an amendment to a collective bargaining agreement that was voted on a two thousand twelve right how you can come before the council and not have\nA a come before us and told us that there was this I'd agreement that significantly impacted a what we believed was the compensation package is unconscious\nWho presented it to the fire chief\nOr the fire chief yup and you have it ...\nIt seems to me yeah now\nNow I read in the paper that may arrive at the Asian had no knowledge of this yet the administration paid out the the the money that goes along with the amendment\nRight what does that tell you\nSo I don't know how that occurs it seems to me and you\nKnow we're we're a part time legislative body when people come before us and gives it give us fiscal notes and tell us the impact on our budget we assume they're telling us the truth mhm\n\nAnd somebody lied year well\nIt wasn't you know you can call it a lie certainly wasn't the truth\nThe intent is the issue right I talked to is that right out a little you know it's the talk to a guy about it though I\nCan't ask I Can't oh sue what the intent was what I can tell you [laughter]\nEverybody damn well knows what they're supposed to do when they when they come before the city council and the collective bargaining ugly and I expect people to tell us the truth\nWell that's the issue and I talked to move in regards to yesterday said well some people are ignorant to this I have a I have a zero ability to believe\nThat all that that's a fire ignorant to it if they paid out\n... right I'm I'm Talking about ... ignorance of the fact that this stuff has to be um that has to be ratified\nUm there's no way anybody in the seventies you know the rehab\nSo we're we know and it was witnessed by the um the city solicitor for the city award who reports directly to the mayor\n... yeah yeah\nDo you is there any ability for you and desire for you at the council to call for an investigative body to come in and look at this as a result well\nObviously we have and now uh you know when you say investigative body we've hired and accounting firm and every day it seems like ... or more accurately every week uh the the task that\nCPA for changes as their investigation goes deeper and deeper and more and more is uncovered\nWhat about law enforcement ...\nEvery time we start investigation to look at something that you know Mr Cody missed the block brought us those documents are a few months back\nWe provided doses CPA firms were not auditors are they went in a in and started looking at it and as they requested records are more and more information started to come out um\nAnd uh it was very upsetting\nSteam role as the city council president ... so what about law enforcement here at this point the attorney general's office state police is there some are going to be some kind of ah you know recognition yeah I\nDon't I'm not going to jeopardize any investigations but he's talking about what may or may not be going on that's not my role my role is to approve things\nUh and there are other agencies are that look at this and make determinations\nAs to uh intent and uh I don't think it's in the best interest of the citizens of war word that I turn around and said that uh\nThat there is an investigation or there is an investigation of we're assuming that someone did something wrong or that's not my task as an elected official\nWell hold on a sec what do you mean by that others will hold on a second that's why that doesn't make any sense it is a city council president ... represented the people it sure is within your purview to say listen uh we see some sneaky stuff going on here so it's called the police Letterman and I\nThought it looked like we have an I I've already made statements have active investigations happening and I'm not going to talk about potential litigation matters because I don't believe it's in the best interest of the city as to what could or could not happen\nWell hold on hold on it's like when you see investigations you talked about an order that's being done is law enforcement involved in looking in this\nI Can't answer any questions regarding any pending investigation that's that's up to the agency\nHas the city council officially gone off to any law enforcement agencies and presented this and say maybe guys you should you take a look at this\n... very good question [laughter] ah and you know\nIt's a yes or no I I Know that this issue just came up with regard to the to this\nContract I'm sure that people are working and I'm not going to jeopardize investigations by saying that they are are they are not\nUm you know this is a very fine line here between a\nPending investigations and making statements and I'm sure your work very well aware of it ah as to whether what my beliefs are compared to what the facts are and I have a fiduciary obligation to the citizens that I can assure them that I'm that I'm following life or do share yeah\nHold on one second costs mineral I get a quick break and come back to the ... the city council president we come back and when I just want to ah just going to explain what he just said a little bit more and ask them a couple more questions will do that we come back next\nCity council President Morsi Merle was on the line with me come from\nI just want to kind of clarify something for me I'm sure in your ... you don't have to talk to me about any potential investigation but you know you can tell me what you've done have you and your capacity of city council president or anyone in the council contacted law enforcement to look into this\nI can tell you that wall any\nInvestigations that people have contacted me on or requested information from war any a\nA investigations in the future I have and will continue to cooperate with and I don't I Can't I I Know you're trying to get me to say was there a crime that was like\nOh no no I'm trying to get by when I don't know that that's a threat to the agency I get you from a\nCivil perspective you know what we've done is an extensive amount of research which continues to to yield these unprecedented results as far as I'm concerned of where we're finding out the good agreements were that's what\nMy my my my asking you to tell me about that I'm asking you about whether or not there is a crime I'm asking you whether or not somebody ... you think somebody should look into it to see if there was a crime\nOh yeah that that's what we're doing\nOkay yeah I mean I mean it was that what you're doing obviously just shoot at the time is it is it that you've seen yeah\nIt it it was what you seen say you know it's time to officially in publicly ask the state police to come and look at this order after the U.S attorney to come and look at this\n... I'm Sorry could you repeat that oh\nWell from what you've seen and what you know about your with your what you've seen so far is do you now think that there's time to publicly call as a city council president for federal law enforcement or state law enforcement to come in and look and see for crime has been committed\nWell I I just said that as far as investigations that aren't cooperating with any investigation or\nHave you been in contact I had an area and that's as far as I Want to go have you been ... not going to make it into one way or the\nOther from the trucks delusion studio used on the line I Am six thirty WPRI accumulation [noise]\nSpecial report deadly Pittsburgh shooting I'm Evan ...\nFirst of two vigils were staged in Pittsburgh tonight to mourn the victims of this morning's deadly attack of the baby naming ceremony\nThat tree of life synagogue in the city squirrel hill neighborhood corresponded Jessica dean is that the six Presbyterian Church has coming out\nWith one another they are also coming out to shell that lives have greater than\n... here at the church\nEleven people were killed in the attack on the suspect forty six year old Robert Bowers is in custody of Bowers has a history of posting very lonely anti Semitic threats on social media and police say he was shouting all Jews must die while firing randomly and the synagogue\nBesides the eleven murdered several others were wounded Bowers was also hit by gunfire but it said to be in good condition the Justice Department says he'll face many charges including hate crime charges I'm Evan hanging\nTo tell the president United States they've had it with them yeah that's that's the ... that's that's it it's not complicated unless you had another theory I\n...

All right thanks so so this guy's got a felony possession of\nCocaine charge against him selling the possession of cocaine is going to be treated the same manner especially when they got aliases issues in the city of Providence and the city's Central Falls where do you think those those police departments just turn those guys back into the street it's complete bunk\nThis [noise] he's on your show how ...\nBoth elected and campaigning for office you know miserably in statewide around here are trying to use the same modus operandi for different purposes\nYou know I'm a sanctuary city that's where halo as though I'm not a sanctuary\nCity in the criminal we just arrested in process through eyes would never have had that happened he'd still be walking the seeds in Providence and as a speech problem is Central Falls these things are in in in system comparison to what the way the law enforcement operation works of art that is not true\nOkay now\nPut that aside for a second here's our lights little this is a nice little did he for you when it comes\nTo Alan songs presentation on this arrest today when he is governor he's now going to attempt to make communities pay the price\nThe feds they're not want to have to quote guess\nWho is walking out\nAnd perhaps after try and detain someone in a situation where family might be waiting as well as for the conflicts arising\nThat's not cooperation and that's not putting the safety of other Rhode Island is\nFirst that's putting politics first\nI've been asked how to incentivize cities and towns cooperate with my no sanctuary state\nPolicy well simple and also a tough love the city's like Central Falls in\nProvidence or any others are going to thumbed their nose at the federal funds when refusing to cooperate with the feds on these cases than perhaps they don't need to see an increase in state funding as well\nIf they don't think they really need those federal dollars then I guess they don't need more state dollars I Would freeze currency to them in his palace and I'm not talking about school they'd only the city's side at current levels to incentivize cooperation [laughter]\nCan you can I can I take a moment to just laugh out loud\n[laughter] ...\nOh [noise] what first of all first of all\nThe Trump effort to penalize cities and towns or or to threaten to penalize cities and towns on federal funding was met with ridiculous bravado on the part of some Democrats across this country\nRidiculous ...\nThat they wouldn't that that that they didn't need that money\nThat they could they would stand on principle rather than worry about the money and I do believe as my recollection of moves me that were halo is the mayor of Providence I'm that\nGood same and maybe even the mayor of Central Falls echoed same\nThe truth is and then we will be from the New England truck solutions to the hands of al than I Am six thirty WPRI accumulate station [noise]\nSpecial report deadly Pittsburgh shooting I'm Evan Handler eleven people killed in a baby naming ceremony a tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh this morning\nTonight so first of two vigils was held a second to take place tomorrow morning President Trump is calling for the death penalty to be carried out for cases like the Pittsburgh massacre and he says churches and synagogues should have armed guards\nThe president felt an obligation to carry on with the Saturday schedule speaking to a future farmers of America and make America great again rally\nWe don't want to let people that are evil change our lives and we'll keep our schedules away is supposed to be and we should all do that\nBefore heading to the rally he pledged to tone down the rhetoric is crowds love with one exception\nAnd I'd have a much different zone frankly if the press was even handed the press was fair\n... Washington\nEvil in zero degrees outside the heat of building and there's your degree New England went winter\nBut you always had to either decide that you were going to be in Haiti mode or ... the whole system how to be the heating and cooling fright or this or we introduced you for the first time in a residential application we've been able to do with commercial before is a thing called the heat recovery\nAnd he recovery is different it has a BIG Magic box outside\nAnd it has three refrigerate lines that go inside to the building to these distribution boxes and then once we're inside we can have up to twelve different air handlers or different delivery methods to building but the key\nIs that we can simultaneously heat and cool a building for the first time ever well that's the first time ever in residential while so I was always in commercial you could always do I so now\nThat means it's time to be coming in the south side of a fall day and you need to cool that top floor Sunnyside bedroom\nWell when you do that you're going to gather some of that son's he's into the refrigerant and then normal you should send that down to outside it to be wasted on the what we can do here is we can say no we can we we can use this energy to good effect and we can hate the north side groups well the final piece of ...\nThat makes this thing such a breakthrough in my opinion is you get one additional heat exchange off of this system right\nAnd that ... has refrigerant into it and we can use that waste heat the heat that we would've dumped outside to also heat the water for faucets [laughter] so this is now while all in one what everybody's trying to ... ... is joked about this for a long time so we're we're incredibly excited we we love being on the front end do you got to be\nFairly watching this project yeah wow yeah just to see how it also rules out before let's go and ask you one more thing now obviously this building has to be very tight and you used that technique sure I think it's called aero stealing to got us for infiltration that sounds really fascinating about that Dr ...\nSo ... was the stuff that I think steals the duct worked right same company came up with the next generation of single Errol barrier and this is a way\nThat are in a house on the construction or an existing house has incredible infiltration\nTen steel itself up to a level that you could you could never drink before [noise] so what they do is they put the building under a little negative pressure they push her out in a row yeah so they're pulling putting fans to

the entire cast this old houses erupt production on this their fortieth season and all this talk of home remodeling has you thinking about your next project you can call in your home improvement question now to eat any money\nIt's presented by home with ... dot com well the heart of every home is the kitchen and that's where meals get prepared and homework is done and guess always loved to hang out and that can that tree in this kitchen was made by the craftsman plane and fancy customs camera tree\nAnd Brian you're on I was looking at your website and I sounded pretty interesting that you guys make every single happening by hand is that true that is absolutely true yes in the heart of Pennsylvania yeah it's a it's the work you're just spectacular so what's the last us like I mean\nObviously cat that's kind of standard sizes but you guys basically cut the parts and put 'em all together by hand and they're kind of supervise no process the whole way\nJust absolutely a we make cabinets at Clinton's ... to the sixteenth of a niche though there is no real standard size for us uh we make our own doors and drawers we make all of our cat in the tree whether it be European ... or traditional framed in sick\nSo I think a lot of folks don't realize how mass produced most kitchen cabinets are are in their ... and there's a lot of trade offs in that process\nThat that is true or we are what I like to call a\nLocal customs cutting to jump on steroids and we do some production minded work but we're also very custom a lot of hands on work we do a lot of custom cabinet tree for any room of the house that a lot of other companies really don't want to touch\nAll right so let's say you're hearing this program you're thinking about a re doing your kitchen you blank slate um how do you tell folks get started with that process\nUh basically we have a network of professional kitchen a bath designer across the United states of America or they can go to our designers and they will talk to them about colors woods style temporary traditional whatever it is and try to narrow down what their goal is for the project\nSo that's really the place to start once that's done we're the manufacturer we take those plans and create and order and builds that exactly to their specifications what's unique about the kitchen that you know here in the gyms townhouse will it's quite unique were using the transitional door style is actually the name of it\nAnd it's done in very precise equal sized panels that would be the maple white painted part of the kitchen a lot of the rest of the chemistry in the house is a risk ... which is one of the hottest what's going right now right in in the custom market\nWe have done some blue mud room cabin the tree and we also did do all the vanities in the house\nSo it was very good design very easy for us to make it to fit right on and make it look like a the customer wanted so we're we're very proud of it looks fantastic\nYeah it looks it looks it looks really great so what are some of the mistakes that folks make you think when they start to plan kitchen where people go wrong and then to her credit for many years well ...\nYeah I think a lot of times um people tend to get caught up in trends ... or so they will pick something trendy and then they'll find themselves five ten years down the road still living in the same house with no plans to move there are thinking about doing it again yeah I think a lot of times people tend to uh get wrapped up in counter tops\nAnd appliances right takes a lot of their budget and they end up spending not money they should for the quality of cat and if they need to less than a lifetime and a lot of times a day do the buyer's regret not\nCase so careful planning working with designers you're going to be the kitchen in front of a million years I'm signed on from playing advance a cat is thank you so much for stopping by the money they rated vice thank you for having

he's working for us down here in Rhode Island you know his goal is to try to use much insulation in his houses off\nSo he went to a two by six law and that gives us a deeper cavity the other thing that allows us to do is because the two by sixes are bigger than two by fours you can read them out and you don't have to be sixteen inches on senator you twenty four inches on center and that allows you to drop some of those two buys\nOut of the equation and again as you know when you take the two by fours out of the equation there sort of you're weak link that where you get the thermal bridge again have insulation in the wall is in the wall and we were able to drop about forty percent of the lumber\nA lot about what he did that connection from from outside the insight for those two by fours now you have fewer studs and uh you're going to have that much less connection that\nThermal Britain has basically been limited they're\nAbsolutely and then we're fighting for every possible without reduction trick that we get and that was one of them\nThe windows were another thing that you worked hard on you very very carefully selected some windows for this area that we're triple paying\n... yeah so a triple windows helps us a lot when you look at sort of a house and you think about the wall assembly if you use a fancy word you know how it's built you've got two by fours you've been insulation you've got air sealing the window which is otherwise is a big hole in the right to you like oh my gosh everything's going in and out of windows\nDull pain is better than single pain triple pain is better than double pain and that's what we actually have year we're also controlling for the UV um are controlling for he says the up\nAnd said you know like you know he gave them in and out because you have to minimize the amount of air conditioning they wouldn't need 'em and eat load and the friends that Marvin helped us you know not only designing these windows again you know up to code right up to speed for us but there's lots of them and we want as many as we possibly could so an efficient windows ...\nProjects continuation of your branch Generation Next initiative you got some friends is working here how's that initiative going in and out what your message young people that are out there\nThe message to young people is that a career in the trades can be a very good one it can be something you do after college or instead of going to college there are there's a huge need for people who work with their hands and have skills and we've got\nTwo young apprentices who've been working with a side by side one of the young woman who keeps us from Mississippi the other one is local former marine who's already been employed by his wieners so it's a great way to show people that this is a good job\nNow the other thing that was unique about this is you had owners that we're pros so that must have made a process easier because sometimes it's hard when you're building a project to communicate the needs to the owners that are not pro jihad architect and designer here husband and wife who owns property\nA noxious pros but smart pros and and\nThe ones who sort of manager their appetite and\nIt's not a big house they didn't want a big house they didn't want access taste um and it was really up to Don architect really at the dawn to come up with the net zero calculation to make this whole thing work so we were pleased to be working with them it's still going to be on them over the next twelve months to live accordingly places you know even if you build a perfectly\nIf you leave the windows open at the air conditioning crank too low you will not make net zero so now they're the ones are going to have to actually live here and make that and

winter\nBut you always had to either decide that you were going to be in Haiti mode or ... the whole system had to be heating and cooling right well this we introduced you for the first time in a residential application we've been able to do with commercial before is a thing called heat recovery\nAnd he recovery is different has a BIG Magic box outside\nAnd it has three refrigerate lines that go inside to the building to these distribution boxes and then once we're inside we can have up to twelve different air here\nThose are different delivery methods to building but the key is that we can simultaneously heat and cool a building for the first time ever well that's the first time ever in residential while so I was always in commercial you could always dry so now\nThat means a son to be coming in the south side of a full day and you need to cool that top floor Sunnyside bedroom\nWell when you do that you're going to gather some of that son's he's\nInto the refrigerant and then normally you just should send that down to outside it to be wasted on what we can do here is we can say no we can we we can use this energy to good effect and we can hate the north side groups well the final piece of this that makes this thing such a breakthrough in my opinion\nIs we get one additional heat exchange off of this system right\nAnd that ... has refrigerant into it and we can use that waste heat that heat that we would've dumped outside to also heat the water for faucets [laughter] so this is now while all in one whatever he's trimmed at every is joked about this for a long time so we're we're incredibly excited we we love being on the front end\nDo you got to be able to watch this project yeah wow yeah see I don't see how it also rules out um before I let you go and ask you one more thing now obviously this building has to be very tight and you use the techniques are I think it's called aero stealing to got us for infiltration that sounds really fascinating about that Dr ...\nSo ... was the stuff that I think she feels the duct work rising company came up with the next generation of single arrow barrier and this is a way\nThat are in a house on the construction or an existing house has incredible infiltration\nConceal itself up to a level that you could you could never done before [noise] so what they do is they put the building under little negative pressure they push her out in a row yeah so they're pulling putting fans to push push year out to the building against the ... the walls and then they put these little Adam ... stations all around and what happens is\nThat this find miss that is in the air\nIf it finds a crack anywhere at that point it goes near the crack\nThe velocity increases when that those aerosol Bears Ears so ... beads bright go through an coagulating and will deal it's like it's like a victorious hungry it's unbelievable and so\nWe saw this thing that this was already tight building relatively tight but we saw this thing go down I think by ... percent less so uh [noise] and what what I like is that their houses that were done on low bid there were two houses that have no ... bury their houses that you are would be desperate and with this you can actually do it in a retrofit you'd have to\nYou'd have to cover horizontal surfaces you know because you know your couches and the floors with plastic but you could literally retrofit a house and they have this computer gauge do you watch it shows you what the infiltration is you know three hundred C.
