I read some way of a expert from the independent women's forum Julie gun like coming up later on but Patrice lay on wood 'cause it's been on my show many times\nWrote a column a site this morning Sunday Morning\nAbout supporting survivors and standing with Kevin Oh she said those to promote the slogan set up a false dichotomy if you believe that survivors of sexual assault it'd be it should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you\nThat you then must believe the allegations of Christine afford therefore you must agree the judge Kavanaugh was lying and you must have poses confirmation she said this is a false choice as a woman I can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse\nBut also care about the facts of each specific case if I was a member of a jury sitting at a rate matter my sympathy would be what the victim\nHowever I Want to hear the evidence or lack of corroboration and inconsistencies to make sure that the correct parties identified and she goes on to point out the number of times the Innocence Project in others have exonerated through late a DNA testing\nRape rape is to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory counts and Van Dyke Perry who's spending combine thirty seven years in prison\nOn false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime and the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted that she lied\nOr how about the Hofstra University case in which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from Hofstra their lives ruined about a gang rape of an Eighteen year old fellow students and twenty nine\nThe accuser later admitted that her allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges for the damage to these young men and their families were already done plus innocent projects it go to innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men exonerated\nOf rape charges when later evidence came out why can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent of the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate but ten percent or more are not accurate in other words there are uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock\nOf American Jurisprudence this writer goes on to say as a woman as a mother as a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness and the me too movement\nThese fires are not in competition to treat men\nFairly all victims deserve justice but justice is not one sided due process and fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men\nSo when you look at the allegations of professor crocheting afford they completely falling apart they don't exist there is no cooperation\nAnd so you can't say we support the me too movement and we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty those two principles are not in conflict except in the minds of Cory Booker\nKamala Harris and a senator Hirono of Hawaii when asked this morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist to chase down to Republicans in restaurants in elevators and airports\nShe could not say that as wrongful activity she couldn't say that in fact they indirectly demand violence against Republicans\nAnd show you where

States Senate\nI didn't think I'd ever see this in my lifetime Susan Collins stood up like a tenfold beginning tonight she was really going over forty five minutes why she was going to support and then I I tried to listen to Lisa Murkowski who made no sense at all\nIt seems like fly ball tactics have good consequences as long as you make the slime ball tactics they seem to work Lisa Murkowski in Alaska I mean there was no reason she could not listen to what Susan Collins had to say\nAnd maybe she hates Trump so much you could not stand to put one of his nominees on the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I'm so proud of a bright Kevin all his wife his mom and dad as girls and what they had to put up with the like he was crucified on the Democratic cross a political correctness and title nine\nThat's what boys go through in college when charged with a girl up some sexual assault and most likely did not happen to get into title nine court and presumption of innocence cross examination of witness confronting your accuser is all that kinda stuff doesn't apply\nSo in the minds of Democrats this was the title nine case in which the allegation was made\nAnd therefore you cannot investigate professor Ford\nOnce investigated mainly by the conservative media practically everything for that fell apart including the four eyeball witnesses including her river version\nThe facts from er twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen therapists notes including the front door the fear of flying whatever it was I'm not sure she said anything that was truthful at all nothing\nAnd so Lisa Murkowski is stupid the woman from Alaska stupid Susan Collins took some serious flak from the radical left like my friend Bryan kill me did a Fox and friends\nAnd she stood up and did what was right I don't know if she's going to run for reelection and two years but she ought to\nBut now clowns fools to come out of the woodwork like Valerie Jarrett up in ... the fame to run against or in Maine have asked\nLet's continue their calls is go to a Lewis in Chicago Lewis in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Lewis go ahead\nThanks bill appreciate you taking my call yesterday I guess one of the a comment on the relationship of the Democratic party to the pornography industry if you don't mind sure yeah though you know the Democrats\nClaim to care about women but I'm over the years or one of the largest supporters has been the pornography industry and I'm just wondering if they're really cared about women why did it take money from these people who would like women that way\nAbout Michael ever noted the porn lawyer and I I think he did a great job I mean he's got to be on Don Lemon but I'm On CNN or MSNBC a lot more times Michael ... he is such a loud mouth clown in such an embarrassment he defends porn stars and this guy says he's going to run against the president twenty twenty\nCould we be that lucky Michael having any run against Trump\nI Hope he does bill but I tell you you know you look back to the Clinton years they did have one criminal ... should against pornography and open the doors to all this I Believe I Believe it open the doors to all this you know bad stuff is pilots stuff you see out there\nDuring the porn stopped at porn industry has given millions of dollars to the Democrats along with the abortion industry so killing babies in subject getting women July for sexual assault is what the Democratic Party is all about if they if they cared about sexual assault or women\nThan their leader would not be the U.S Congressman Ellison and he would not be the candidate in Minnesota if they really cared about women and sexual assault\nBill Clinton will not serve out his term if they really care and the enabler of Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton wouldn't have been the nominee and twenties interesting if they really cared about sexual assault correct\nCorrect absolutely right and do you do but actually are doing a lot of harm to these people because of you know the old affect the boy who cried wolf you know nobody's going to believe women who are are telling the truth\nOr if a woman comes forward with the probably eight or nine times out of ten it is correct but every now and then you have Hofstra every now and then you have the Duke lacrosse team or UBA every now and then you have the Innocence Project that's listed hundreds of men cleared of rape charges\nFrom false allegations and so yeah I'm going to believe a woman a Ninety percent of the time but I Want to hear the story I'm sympathetic with professor for it I Want to hear what happened how it happened\nHow'd you get to the party how'd you get home from the party Hoover the eyewitnesses tell me about the second door telling me about the fear of flying all these things\nLewis turned out to be a lie or misstatement or not true you know the truthful thing that happened is I think in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen when she wants to see her therapist she spoke the truth\nAnd she said and twenty ... twenty Thirteen before a Kevin always going to be a nominee she told the therapist\nThat she was a attempted rape by four boys in her late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties and the reason it didn't fit Kevin all his because he was one boy and by the mid Nineteen eighties\nBrett Kavanaugh was not living in Maryland anymore he had moved to Connecticut so she had to\nTell the fair but then it was ... but the but the notes of the therapist clearly indicated it could not have been bred to Kevin you see if you go to a therapist or a doctor\nAnd they were seeking help psychiatric help or medical assistance you are incentivized to tell the truth not going to go to a doctor and say my right arm hurts when it's really your left foot\nBecause you one treatment so when Dr Ford went to a therapist in twenty ... twenty Thirteen who made copious notes about what she said out of her own mouth she said and twenty twelve now for boys tried to rape me when I was in my late teens in mid Nineteen eighties\nShe had flipped out on Kavanaugh and change the story completely suddenly there was one boy and not for\nSuddenly it was in her late teens it was Fifteen suddenly one in the mid Nineteen eighties and it was Nineteen eighty two she had to change your story in order to fit Brad Kevin Hall that clearly indicated to me that she was mistaken at a minimum and probably line\nLet's continue with Brian from Indianapolis Brian in Annapolis welcome to the bill Cunningham show Brian go have\nA really good evening how are you a great day to being an

association\n[noise] and you're there for somebody else over an hour with Julie gun locks of independent women's forum\nAbout a woman's perspective and I made this point with her about two weeks ago then I'm of course a man you might be a woman but if you're a woman you're probably married to a man or was married to a man or want to be married to a man\nYour father was a man what kind of feeling step towards your husband and your dad your brothers are male what kind of feeling step toward them and you may have male children or grandchildren you want to live in a world where because of your gender your automatically just believed or believed\nIn other words every now and then a woman lives and every now and then a man is not guilty of rape or sexual assault happens all the time\nSo you can't say because a woman speaks we must listen or because the man is charged he's got to shut up there was a line to be ... merged between the me too movement on one hand and wound up ... percent acceptance on the other\nThe fact you want to believe a victim of a crime which I naturally would do is a criminal defense attorney a take off my dad and I generally believe all of a person's as their car was stolen or a person says my house was burglar Raj or victim of an arson or a victim of sexual assault I naturally want to believe that person\nBut then if a person is charged I Want to live in a world that says that person is due process rights because that is the rigorous\nReaction of subsidies every procedural due process that pursues the truth and make sure that those are telling the truth or confirmed and those that are lying or rejected\nAnd Democrats never wanted to put professor Ford through a any rigorous process that determined to voice you were saying was accurate now here we are several days later\nAfter she testified what about ten days ago that practically everything she said was false including the number of people that attacked or what had happened how it happened ... how old she was\nThe timeframe that happened in the two front door was a kind of hard the fearing to fly was ridiculous and her boyfriend came out and says she was a safe and some of these other facts come out and you're thinking now wait a minute maybe what I heard originally is not accurate when Chris Wallace of Fox\nThere's you testified said the Republicans are in trouble I thought to myself\nNow hold up on that car let's find out what Brett Kavanaugh has to say and now that she's testified there's going to be a several day process to check out what she says is if it's accurate the two front doors was either a misrepresentation or a lie\nBecause the front door went in and twenty oh eight not twenty twelve and it went in not because she needed an extra way out but because a small business owner a therapist want it to rent a part of her house and she wanted a separate entrance for her patients which was the second front door\nAnd had nothing to do it cost a phobia\nThen the boy friend follows the affidavit saying wait for little planes all over French Polynesia and to Haiti\nAnd or Hawaii we also went on trips to Central America South America and Europe she had no fear of flying it was a lie in fact there is nothing she said actually that turn out to be accurate but see the Democratic party didn't care about\nFinding the truth they had a ball face\nMitigated allegation that could not stand the rigors of due process so they quickly ignored and said if you want to get into the veracity pursuit were not with you on that she said\nShe has mainly X chromosomes therefore we believer and the person with the Y chromosome ... that's a liar\nBut then the truth came out and it's like well don't don't bother me with the facts that's what caused a writer for the Kobe or CBS late night show to say quote aerial doom is said quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruin Brett Kavanaugh as life unquote\nFat is reflective and indicative of\nWhat the Democratic Party things today about Brett Kavanaugh we've ruined his life were ruined his wife were ruined his mom and dad and were ruined his daughters\nSo aerial do myself there Steven Kobe or show\nCalled whatever happens

that we got to run take a look let's continue\nLet's go now to Mike in Wisconsin Mike in Wisconsin welcome to the bill Cunningham show Mike how are you\nA great really how are you good really I think we need to learn from experience and you had an earlier caller because Brian maybe at it and that was an inspiring phone call because he like he was a traditional Democrat and he's now come over to our side how are we going to get more people to come over our side of it\nThree ways number three people like Brian saw\nNot only dishonest they are downright evil they will do that nothing to get a power number two that Democrats socialists progress is incapable of analyzing back whether it be about climate change or whether it be the lives that that Dr Ford presented in front of the Senate tradition\nDrew provable lies now still are ignored by the mainstream media provable lie\nI Want to be ... say they're misconceptions but damn it they were alive because she lied about flying\nShe lied about that second front door she lied about them for boys became one she lied about her late teens now it's Fifteen she lied about the fact that was the mid Nineteen eighty nine Nineteen eighty two because Greg Kevin all in the mid eighties was in Connecticut she lied lied lied\nAnd she wasn't covered because she was a woman\nAnd and really let me tell you the most important thing that we learned and that is that we Republicans we didn't stand up to them before they took advantage of our moral character and we learned this time that the only way to like them is by route\nOn his political force hats off to McConnell yeah I talked to college hats off to Lindsey Graham about political force is the only way that we are going to eat them and we can avoid a civil war as your last guest said how can we do that by ... wedding course my beat him in at the ballot\nGot away and you got to vote you got to you know Schumer said one thing Saturday and that was correct you got to vote it down or if you take away the Democratic party from the coast and about seven or eight major cities\nThere is no Democrats hardly anywhere there's this sea of red from seed a shining city it say irrelevant minimalist party but the problem is the mainstream media is there a megaphone ... and the major media will not cover objectively this president nor any Republican president\nThey didn't cover Alito correctly that didn't cover Roberts and look what they did a cabin all look what's next to Amy Coney Barrett ought to be the next Supreme Court justice\nAnd from Notre Dame and when that happens all hell is going to break loose and Barbie gene ... made certain maker you watch that fight\n[laughter] really didn't get a venue today to hear Eric Holder who scale contempt of Congress to say that now we have to call into question the legitimacy of this of the Supreme Court\nLet me see Billy and the last forty years since Nineteen thirty seven says conservatives had a majority on the Supreme Court we never questioned malignancy of a prominent but now all of a sudden when we go through a legitimate process of confirmation all of a sudden they stand up and say we've got to question the whole legitimate process do you recall outrageous\nDo recall in the third debate that Trump made a Trump was asked whether or not if he lost the election if he would accept it\nAnd the media has a meltdown one Trump made a statement to the fact that he might not accept the results in November elections\nIf he felt it was rigged against him and the media Hillary Clinton in New York Times jumped on top of Trump because he would not accept the results of the election everyone thought accord sailor was going to win and then Trump won and up to this point\nHillary and the major media has not accepted the outcome of the election and so they became what they criticized\nAnd the third debate Trump said I may not accept the outcome of the election\nBecause it looked like it it's rigged however the media went after him Hillary one after him Hillary said let's be clear about what are you saying and and that means he's talking down American democracy and I'm appalled that someone is the nominee I'm One of the two major parties would take that position quote unquote Mallory Clinton\nBut then Trump won and Hillary never considered the election she'd never accepted the ballot box

his book code red about a\n... issue voter issue of Freud and America now to show your cities\nYeah I I think that there is a bunch of him example in the city of Cleveland there were more votes cast for Obama\nThan citizens registered in certain words and and it's because the because Cleveland's in an important state my home state of Ohio I'm sure there's massive voter fraud in Chicago New York and whatever but Ohio in Cleveland Columbus I Would not be surprised at all if there was hundreds or thousands of illegal votes cast\nBecause of the tabulation system and there's no check and balance 'cause there's no Republicans in Cleveland\nWell the thing is Mr Cunningham if you're ... code rich out of concern would be an excellent for your show before the terms but here's the thing [noise]\nWay or the algorithms and the ... and the companies that on the other factor than it is only three or four the entire country and it's done in the cities\nAnd what you would have is a situation where the machine is program where the Democrat as a thousand actual votes cast the Republican has an actual votes cast the machine's gonna say eleven hundred for the Democrat nine hundred hundred for the Republican it's programmed in advance\nAnd the person that runs the city that Democrats in most cases they're the ones that oversee the installation of the ballots for the term who's on the ballot what have you on the machine can be corrupted and the algorithm would a waiver from the Republican the ads are the Democrats\nOr give me the name of the guy in the book again I'm going to talk to my producer\nJonathan Simon and the book is code red and he was a guest on coast to coast a month ago when George ... he was on her three hours and it was really a riveting and it's been

loyalty for the next two years anyway there is a big deal the five conservative voices on the United States Supreme court and maybe one or two more to follow this president good to have as many as four or five selections because\nSmart money says Clarence Thomas and the next year or two of the Senate stays Republicans going to are going to bail out he's got twenty seven years in and he's made

they care about the\nPeople know that that right now for our\nAnd they do it for a while and they do it for green clean tech every it's so not Americans sit here so I I've had so many problems in my life but he gave up and I said I\nPicked from what I Do I go where no one can do to brush her picked her up our soldiers that are in fact there let's move on to stop blaming our government when it happened within our ...\nWhen John can you imagine if the Republican Party had they're shocked troopers that they called out to attack Democrats in restaurants airports in elevators what the media would do with that\nSaid there are treated here it's ... people are going to get it in water do enough for the country they're not ... ... that's what the Democrats that because they're the party and they do and\nWe saw this play for the past couple of weeks to gain back a little bit of power\nWell it wasn't about helping out professor Ford who wanted to keep things private and it was about using her to advance their political agenda and even a\nA Democrats understand that Brett Kavanaugh academically and my character deserves to be on the U.S Supreme Court said they had to come up with ... and keep repeating it through their megaphones in the mainstream media to act as if there was a point to be made that break Kevin ... might have been a serial rapist\nWho spent time drugging young young girls and that was\nThe former parents and what they did it man\nBut it's unbelievable and now he he can't you can't teach anymore because the left to go crazy and maybe came and coaches girls' basketball team that think about that\nVery sad third ... sad day for America when they when they get to that and ... it's a shame I never public than we ever tried to get straight to anybody whether they're Republican or Democrat and where to take this man on this lady last couple of weeks it makes me sick to my stomach\nNo you can you think of a similar times when the Republicans in restaurants airports elevators acted the way the Democrats acting Brian kill made a friend of mine with Fox and friends is harassed on a regular basis with megaphones on the streets or do you\nThink about that here though\nI mean what that is they they are what they are the fastest that's what they are\nYou one hundred percent they only had two Democrats they interact in return trip from around what what's finger or conservative than ...\nParts per year than if people actually offered it\nNow they do and well it's because the mainstream media falls forum that's why let's continue now with the Joe in North Carolina than I've been in Florida Joe in North Carolina Welcome to the bill Cunningham show Joe go ahead\nYes sir thank you and your and your calls down here in North Carolina Thank you\nYeah if I could say this I think it's worth thinking about with respect to the cabin off a issue I I I Will say all but I Would guess that the vast majority of Democrats would be very happy to know\nConclusively that Brett Kavanaugh at salt the swamp and that they would be very very disappointed\nPlayed five games so far and they have for overtime set an all time National Football league record Middle East they won and overtime for a change so let's continue their calls let's go to a Bob and the great state of Maryland Bob in Maryland Welcome to the bill Cunningham show Bob how are you\nA great bill a great to be with you and I have three things that I think we all my keep in mind as we go to the polls in November one is that just like you mentioned this woman who says that she doesn't care what happened she is glad she room Brett Kavanaugh's like wonderful what\nThe left and the Democrats have indeed done to others they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh would they try to do direct capital they will try and do to us if they can the second thing is is that\nAll remind\nEntirely destructive behavior of attacking institutions people the people of constructive in ten of these things about our society it really to me bill is nothing less than the continued some version of our nation beginning in the Nineteen twenties\nWith the communist and their attempt to undermine us from within and I don't think we see that but I think if we do a it will provide a great context for the situation that we're in your Catholic as mine are you aware of this terrible a present\nState of revelations in these facts abuses and the official cover up\nThat that was actually very much started by the communists\nWell whatever it was it's all to you know as long as it should be able to do and now let me\nTell you this Joseph Stalin the mass murder and Soviet dictator wanted the church undermined from within to neutralize the seminary and to eliminate\nThe a healing power of the church that have the Freedom Tower the church in this country a woman named ... died who was a member of the Communist Party starting in the Nineteen twenties late twenties and for Twenty years I introduced into the\nSeminary placed in the American Catholics seminaries one thousand one hundred men who were communists\nAnd of or no overload faith or morals and according to the plot money who were ... a sexually deviant once that was established\nThen successive waves bought it more of these people and they work their way into the priesthood and ultimately into the higher or\nMe say this if the devil himself\nWanted to destroy the Roman Catholic faith he would have done exactly what many praised him and do in the past forty or fifty years and I want to go to deep and it is but if the devil himself wanted to destroy Catholicism the devil could not done done a better job than what I see going on\nLet's continue now with Patricia and the great state of Florida Patricia go ahead you're on the bill Cunningham show but treasure go ahead\nOn wind up to up to the kind of am thank you I Want to say something I think it's about time dying fine I think people love it and they become pope Chuck throat sabotage you want to go through with it\nI think\nThat they want to get up at random thing and\nThey pretty interesting isn't it wonderful that the Republican Party\nWhich has become conservative of light and the president has individuals like Dianne Feinstein Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer and Dick Durban to run against and Blumenthal of Connecticut the war hero isn't it wonderful to have someone like Elizabeth Warren to run against I mean you couldn't pick these caricatures\nAnd he better ... you know by that I'm coming back on the game and crack the demon rats\nAnd why they have mental problems and a lot of rain but they at her background alive and that they can\nDo anything anything they want to people and I don't really know what went in I haven't minding my own but yet they can
