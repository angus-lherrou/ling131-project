Chicago as well as at NYU\nHe is most importantly a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution writing most recently a defining ideas on climate change or as it has been said over many years now global warming the inner governmental panel on climate change from the un has issued a new report\nThat is more alarming than the last report\nAnd if I understand this correctly we're in deep trouble if the statistics demonstrated here are accurate they are claiming that in order to save our understanding of how to live in the temperate zone we must from we must reduce carbon dioxide admissions by almost half\nBy twenty thirty that isn't a mere twelve years and make carbon dioxide emissions neutral by twenty fifty that is within sight of everyone who is in their thirties and forties right now it's just tomorrow\nAt the same time that kind of dramatic change in our carbon dioxide emissions will reduce our GDP by fill in the blank will we will not be\nCapable of pushing a button and ordering the Amazon anytime you want Richard I'm very good evening to you I Do not believe the BCC wants to talk about the GDP and gross but that is a major concern you have to have if we're going to follow along\nAnd the recommendations the PCC is making let's get let's get right to it richer but\nHe's GDP is the major threat yes we're going to talk about forest fires and hurricanes but the GDP is a major threat and they the the those who advance global warming fears do not want to talk GDP good evening to you Richard\nThe it's a very difficult thing to estimate\nWhat they're trying to do is to say that we have to have radical changes in the way which everything is put together a not only the way in which the energy industries work but everything that we do expect the land transportation and so forth\nOr they have no recommendations is through exactly what should be done if you thought that there were massive inefficiencies in the industries that we are about the day\nSomebody said you had to make them better than they are it say okay we'll try but they don't identify any particular vulnerable point inside the system a production of distribution and so forth and in fact if you look at a relatively unregulated economy the United states\nThe iron is without any prodding from the IPC see the Paris accords or anything else\nWe have by their own stand is the best measures of all these things namely and affect\nThe United states has managed to increase output while reducing carbon dioxide missions in the last year two thousand and Seventeen nobody else has done that\nThe real elephant in the room is China who's the missions total is twice or as well but they are still committed to a coal economy they may cut down the amount they going to increase it but they're not going to cut it down at all\nSo essentially what they're doing is they're trying to get everybody else to cooperate knowing that China will not this thing becomes a total impossibility for anything that you want\nAnd so what are the changes that you could start to make is a very fair question that they\nDo want people to ship ... night you wanted to make sure that the food supplies going to be very very short they learn to try and stop innovations in drugs and pharmaceutical the basic history as a kind of a Tea Party on this by all the standard measures that we have agricultural productivity\nIndustrial safety in the like the world is a much safer place now\nThan it was in Nineteen Ninety three and a much more productive place so one would have thought hey the trend is go in the right direction or we really want to do is to continue to hold our technological edge and to avoid making any of these precipitous remarks and they're going exactly\nThe opposite direction without the slightest acknowledgement of the ways in which the changes have come from either their\nWhat effect does this have on the GDP nobody really can do but it's likely to be extremely substantial if you'd do it\nBut it will not be done the willingness of people a sense to go to bed hungry and cold every night in order to change a carbon dioxide balance down the road is non existent and if you actually try to look at the science or they do is they say\nIs we're lowering our target for two point oh two one point five that's not all the bases erodes the base somewhat higher than that because they're trying to get back to industrial pre industrial times and say it's a ... percent reduction of carbon dioxide admissions if you haven't shown any past dislocation\nNobody in their right mind would rely on a series of highly controversial models to push things\nThe opposite direction when all the models that proved to be rolling up today so I Would say in effect that this is going to be stillborn from the press it will get all sorts of abstract support but it will not get any admissions\nOr any support from any administration that actually has to do it\nEven those states that have try something is modest the carbon dioxide tax have essentially realize that they're highly expensive and they produce no short term benefits\nIn the new cars forest fires California had a bad and early forest fire season there\nWere metrics just suggest that the global warming trends or the climate change ... at trends have contributed to fires by you represent and I believe correctly because I've read about this as well\nThe builders and the cities that have spread into unusual areas of California have also contributed to this sense of emergency that the fires are getting hotter and bigger but at the same time we're not we're not able to do anything about it so at this point\nThe PC is measuring the forest fires will deepen because of global warming can we make that direct to question Richard\nKnow this book you're talking about changes in temperature at the global level now which are running in under ten\nDegrees a tenth of a degree in a year would be an enormous civil or is this just in the last Eighteen years the increase has probably been in the order about one tenth of a degree and I was standing at Thirteen percent increase in carbon dioxide levels what really determines forest fires are a bunch of other things like the much of a\nBasically fungible material fish unable material burn up all material which gathers and if\nYou were to improve the management of public lands for example would make a much greater difference in this area of forest fires than trying to do anything for global warming\nThe contrast between fires on private lands which are very low and on public managed plans are very very great if you look at the aggregate I went back and check some of these now as far as far as it down globally about Seventy or eighty percent from what they were around Nineteen hundred\nIt's a striking decline that is going on and so is every you don't want to look at a dramatic incident that day but you have to do is to get aggregate data\nIn the aggregate data doesn't support the claim that the fire system is going out of control and to the extent that there are changes the thought that somehow or other would want to change the entire economy instead of figuring out how to manage forests that are more sensible fashion\nIs wildly over broad you're looking at the wrong thing there are no solutions that would work better even way you build houses the kind of clear as you do and so forth there are many many things that could be done to deal with fires without having to have the kinds of transformation that the PC is talking\nAgainst Asian Americans and in favor of other ethnicities on the basis of how well the Asian Americans must do as opposed to others a very good evening to you and can we leave this is a paradox or must we started out good evening bill\n... well it's a mess John I'm either because the Supreme Court is basically ruled on a couple of these cases are with affirmative action that it's okay to discriminate little another words race can be a factor but it can't be the deciding factor but\nYou know where you draw the line is um is unclear um\n... the reason the Asian Americans are complaining is because we sort of know from places like California where they have\n... where they prohibited um race being considered that Asians\nMake up about forty percent in at Harvard there about twenty percent of the school even though the population of Asian Americans says you know skyrocketed in the U.S and the number of applicants to the schools\nHas skyrocketed in two thousand nine a Princeton did a study on served tan elite universities and they found that on average and African American I mean a I'm an Asian American would have to score four hundred fifty points higher than a black applicant\nI think it's two hundred Seventy points higher than a Latino applicants and a hundred and forty points higher than a white applicants to get in\nWhat strikes me and your measure here is that the United states is the center of great interest around the world were a global global focus for people to educate their children that were not just national boundaries anymore to come from everywhere\nAnd I it strikes me that Harvard's unhappy decision making is based on a parochial model a national model that's out of date that fifty or a hundred years behind\nWe're we're we're attracting the best and the most eager from around the world and Harvard doesn't want to change that's why Asian Americans I mean nine I Nobel nine out of the next ten\nPeople to become middle class will be in Eurasia not in the United states there are some bishops in good for them and Harvard isn't recognizing\n[noise] well I think that they would they would say is that they value diversity by which as we know they don't mean diversity of opinion [noise]\nUm they mean racial diversity and they believe in their own balance and that they they are the people that should be allowed to seek the bells now for many years um when\nThe uh the victims of that\nKind of process for white applicants people thought well that's okay ah for diversity we you know minorities Latinos and African Americans are taking their rightful place and whites would have to give a little while now it's another minority\nThat suffers as discrimination it\nDefies all the stereotypes and it's because\nThey say they have this formula for diversity and and you and I are both friends with for trip seen a lawyer right in with a law professor NYU's written very good articles on this and his view is they should be free to do that or we should just get rid of the title fixed because the people who are rejected would have good offers\nSomewhere else um [noise]\nUh it would free us up from the government getting involved in this bill would Harvard does is Harvard is only in court because it takes federal dollars if it didn't take federal dollars it could burn its missions the way you want it to 'em but title six apply to entity to\nGet any federal assistance and that includes not only grants to the schools but if any of the students can any federal financial aid that counts too if they gave that up and they have a thirty nine billion dollar endowment um they wouldn't be in court\nThey wouldn't be in court but they can't give up title six you point out that they are and dominance thirty nine billion dollars and they're not going to suffer damage to that\nIn order to comply with federal law so the the result here we're headed towards a a crash that these two things are going to crash and we're picking Harvard out because it's been especially creative and its discriminate\nOn it's like being sued right but everybody\nEverybody knows that other ... other colleges other universe right through all the\nSame and in fact John to your point there was an abacus brief um submitted a by many of the other schools including Yale or because they do the same thing everyone knows ... are to stand in for um uh most of our leading universities\nSo let's mention Hillsdale because I Know the facts here support that he'll sell has made a stand in not taking titled sex and what does that make available to Hillsdale that Harvard Ken how\nWell the interesting thing is Hillsdale in Harvard make the same argument we ought to be able to wear private institutions\nWe ought to be able to run or admissions the way we want to inhale silk case the way they want to is they want to be colorblind in back in the seventies the department of health education and welfare wanted Hillsdale to count older applicants by race and gender and they didn't want to do it\nAnd still founding charter I I don't know one is from Eighteen Twenty one or something but made it the first school in America to be open to everyone regardless of a race or gender so it was open to women\nAnd African Americans I mean long before the rest of society integrated they famously refused to play in a Nineteen fifty six bowl game their football team was undefeated but the bowl official said you can't\nField you're black players they said okay we're not coming then so this is the schools had a long tradition of this and they were fighting\nA they were fighting for different things from Harvard but at the same principle they were fighting for the right to do their own emissions\nIn a colorblind process so what they did\nIs um after a Supreme Court decision they decided we're not going to take any federal dollars anymore or do what are we we're going to forego federal dollars and that includes financial aid for the students that was a that was a hard thing to do you know today\nI'm more than three years after they made that decision they only have an endowment of six hundred million or so um but they made the decision they stuck buying a ticket to stronger place for it\nWe have a minute bill and it it's impossible to walk by Elizabeth Warren and not bring her into an\nElizabeth Warren making claims that are do do do indeed creative about her heritage or make a mockery of the whole idea of Harvard that they can decide what you are on the basis of their categories and not just the fact that we're all mixed up we're all mixed up\nRight I mean as my colleague James Freeman wrote today you really have to wonder what does identity politics mean if you're one\nOne thousand and twenty fourth and you can you know call yourself Cherokee because of that it kind of becomes ridiculous that kind of means you can call yourself whatever you want right um but that's not reality and I I think I think the Cherokee Nation has disputed\nYes senator wore him\nHere it's just ridiculous I mean I think we owe her a great thanks for exposing the silliness not just behind her claim but the whole idea of this stuff\nAnd uh I think she's made a fool of herself in the process and she allowed herself to be voted into this test by President Trump a but it's just it's just highlighting the absurdities for ordinary people\nThis

subject not because you're a spy but because I just thought that it is but I Know you've been interested in it I Know you've written novels about uh yeah you follow\nIt um that's just talk a little about the way that intelligence services seem to be in the headlines today because that's not where they usually want to be they prefer to be in the shadows\nThey are secret or if they do secret deans they're not interested except when they need some good publicity and a blessing and yet suddenly we have major\nPolitical scandals are the kinds of that could very well result in a transformation a bilateral relations\nIt's in the countries involved and in the forefront seem to be our there's no doubt about it intelligence services consider all night here in the United states what we call Russia gate\nWhich is based essentially on intelligence agencies allegations about what the Kremlin did to try\nSuccessfully or unsuccessfully to compromise President Trump then we have you mentioned it in the United kingdom the attempt it appears to kill a former he was actually a British age and they turned age and\nHe had been swap living in England but an attempt they say by\nRussian intelligence agencies to kill Mr ... ball who had been living quietly in Salisbury England and his daughter and then we have now almost recently this gruesome event in Turkey in the consulate of Saudi Arabia\nWhere if a journalist us Saudi journalist who was residing with a green card in the United states and actually a Washington Post columnist who apparently was killed in\nEach of these cases it'd be needing actors are said to be intelligence agencies so you would agree with that premise so far\nI certainly do agree with it and I'm On a on a layer it a little bit Steve these intelligence agencies have their own ideas about how to oppose there or the other country and they always have and in fact in reading about how the Soviets thought of America and\nHow Great Britain thought of the Soviet it's exactly the same the Soviets wanted market Margaret Thatcher to lose in Nineteen eighty three\nThey were and they worked very diligently to undermine or I did I get out the cyberwarfare\nTo see how the first chief directorate Senate illegals and to influence in the tray or the Thatcher government and in fact they supported labor Michael ... was a longtime\nConfidant of KGB of agents so Steve it's it's not it's a revelation to me that in the detail because we now have the filter of Russia gate but I don't see any update whatsoever Steve they the it's like both both sides have these template of how to disrupt the other government\nBut this takes me to a nother concept that is always put out there when we try to figure out what actually happened evidently Russian intelligence agencies were involved in this for Paul fair\nBut the question is did know about it or was it in the word is used a rogue operation so what I Want to do just suggested we need to use me John its end of allergy season\n[noise] um we need to rehabilitate the word roe it's true and history teachers in recent history too that if it's quote a rogue operation it could just be a commercial criminal\nActs because these guys have all sorts of freelance operations\nThey were for the official intelligence agency but they freelance at least Russian intelligence agencies have they work for dark money people they get involved in all sorts of criminal activities and occasionally somebody wants to debt\nWhich has nothing to do with politics but I Want to go to the other possibility\nThat these rogue operations are actually political\nThat is to say it's possible because you have this industry tent usage adjusted\nThis before that they are run by opponents of the leader\nA router I Moscow right out of Saudi Arabia to disrupt a foreign policy that the opponents don't light now we have a history of this and the Soviet Union for example\nGoing back actually to Nineteen twenty four but the one that keeps coming to my mind I Can't place the date but it was the early sixties when there were no diplomatic relations\nBetween the Soviet Union in West Germany and ... the Soviet leader decided he was going to restore formal diplomatic relations with\nEast Germany and in the run up to that of course jobs enemies ran a number of operations to disruptive to sabotage it including a gas attack on the west German ambassador\nAnd it almost destroyed goose jobs a plan with ... pulled ahead we also out\nFairly well documented that when Eisenhower and Khrushchev off the gang their d'etat after ... death [noise] uh and they had a third meeting planned in Paris\nOr what it must have been Nineteen sixty I think that someone\nSet the YouTube spy plane over Russia it was shot down\nThat disrupted Eisenhower cush job do not need to get that was the end of that they taught and record seems to show it was set by the CIA the plane belong to the CIA that forces in the CIA perhaps the director\nDouglas himself was opposed to detente with Russia took we come back to this idea\nThat well we casually referred to\nAs rogue operations could be\nPolitical operatives symbolic the highest level policy would it be opponents usually intelligence agencies or the intelligence agencies themselves are opposed so we do not know\nOr we may find out we can analyze that we can't be sure whether in the case of the attack on script Paul in the United kingdom\nAnd on the case of the killing evident killing of the Saudi a journalist in um turkey whether the leader of the country\nCorrect ... and a bomb had been solving knew about this or these were operations against these two leaders remember that at the moment of the crop both leaders at different times were making a major effort to improve

CIA now CIA and my five is the equivalent of the FBI in Great Britain and my six is equivalent of the CIA\nThese agencies tangled with each other all during the Cold War they continue to tangle with each other\nThey have their own political agenda\nThey have lots of political analysis analysts within the company they're not just all agents of acting illegals another country and doing dangerous missions very few of that\nVery few actually are occupied in that but they do have political ambitions and one is to make sure that there are at odds with the other side that increases their budgets that gives them great power and as we saw in the case of the Soviet Union one\nOf the heads of the KGB moved to be the\nPremier of the Soviet Union as we saw in the United states\nA leader of the CIA moved to become president the United states and the son of a president of the United states so from the outside\nBoth intelligence services have been politically astute for many decades are they now acting with similar ambition and see if the question we can answer today Thirty years from now they'll be\nThey'll they'll have access to material we don't and they'll still be in a fog that's the nature of intelligence services they not only do disinformation they provide glimpses that you can't be certain are real when I go through the ... case and he remains\nIn in hiding or in ... incommunicado somewhere in England today when I go through the ... case I Can't be sure I really can't ... how he served Margaret Thatcher and how he served Ronald Reagan and how we serve Great Britain the queen decorated him\nBut he looks from the Russian point of view to be an arch traitor\nAnd part of the apparatus that destroyed the Soviet Union it would appear that that was an accident that he didn't mean to destroy the Soviet Union what he meant was to encourage democracy as you said at the time in his in his in his country\nDo we have actress today in our agencies that my five and my six CIA FBI\nWho believe that they're encouraging are strengthening democracy by undermining if you see my analogies do\nI Do but I disagree with you on one point but maybe it's not a disagreement maybe you didn't mean to included I didn't hear the case of gr Russia gate allegations against Trump\nWhich are also allegations against ... that is proof tried long ago to recruit from compromising and he's been success\nAnd still happening on him and and run and run to\nThe right it's sad it's sad that is clearly a political agenda no question about it\nA Obama's intel cheeks particularly John Brennan editors CIA\nPursued this agenda record is clear Brennan's made no bones about it\nThat he was a kind of the godfather of the Russian date allegations very early on and he's still pumps that out today because he has a perch on some network and he gets in the New York times on the op ed page when he wants to\nBut it appears to be also a line of the people Trump\nAppointed to these agencies [noise] therefore it's a corporate position we can't say oh it was just Brennan no it was the high level of the CIA and it seems clear to me\nIt from the beginning when Trump first uttered these words earlier in two thousand sixteen cooperate with Russia they did not want this new policy and they continue to not want this policy and therefore in the case\nOf these intelligence operations that involve Russia I think we can say that they are intensely\nPolitical and we can analyze them as part of the political story so it raises the question we raised up before because there are many episodes I remember in July ... forget there's so much News John\nJuly uh when after Trump what the Helsinki to meet with boot and in the first formal summit\nAnd when Trump got home he was literally accuse by the New York times in the Washington Post and by John Brennan himself who is now retired of treason\nFor doing what I was simply having having add a joint\nPress conference with ... and this has never happened to an American president every president since Roosevelt had met with the Soviet or the Russian leader Trump is called treasonous for doing this so it raises a question of who's making Russia policy in Washington\nIs it Trump or is it forces with the backing\nOf the intelligence agency so we come now I Do in my head and I'm not a conspiracy theorist but if we agree that intelligence agencies and the major players in high level politics particularly foreign\nWell the the history and history is adamant on this Steven leader for the first Cold War we agree\nOn yeah so [noise] as historians we accept that as a historical\nFacts they have been very very active uh and not in the realm of intelligence gathering in the vocational sense but in the political sense so we have to ask Carson\n\nThe headline you gave at the top of our talk tonight these American Ukrainian and to a certain extent NATO joint warplane actress exercise\nClear sky Eighteen yes\nSo it was not

we're going to do this exercise it is really gonna theory the Russians are but we're going to do this because you crave aids to practice it doesn't planes that we gave them\nDid Trump authorize it didn't even know about it I mean I think we've got to that point\nWhere we can ask the question now people will say that's conspiracy thinking but I remember the history we know pretty well that the CIA aborted Eisenhower's summit meeting with goose Johnson Nineteen sixty with the EU to flight so there's precedent for\nThis and how we know and drop off as ... as premier of the Soviet Union took

sanctions against Russia and against two and\nA badly damaged the Russian economy and therefore ... standing in Russia and the short answer is though they hurt\nAnd they hurt ordinary people in some

a hundred billion dollars\nPartly generated by the sanctions including the sanctions on Iran oil prices have short from the mid fifties the federal budget of Russia is based on fifty three dollar world prices for oil it's now eighty four I don't know what it is today but it's in the eighties correct John wrecked so\nAnd it did what's happening is is that the hardliners here here say well look how the sanctions have weaken the ruble okay it causes some inflation in Russia but for Russian export companies think about this\nHigher price with a week we are ... are the dream of profitable

Apollo eight in the great success of Nineteen sixty eight\nNow available an audio version we go to the news right now very sad news of the loss of one of the heroes of commercial space Paul Allen\nOne half of the genius putting together Microsoft\nPaul Allen devoted himself to many many activities and\nExperiments and funding a brave funding uh but the his work on the brain especially but Bob is going to help us understand the investments that Paul Allen made into commercial space shuttle launch Bob a very good evening to you I did not know Paul Allen was ... lost to us at sixty five\nA clearly a he was a very well to do man but he used his money for invention and too especially invent trying to launch so let's define what is trying to launch Bob in what is the state right now\nTrying to launch was Ellen's idea of his way of reducing the cost to getting payloads into all of it all that we've talked about it a lot of times on your show job but they did is they purchased to a seven forty sevens and they use\nThose in their engines to build what will it would be the largest airplane ever launched they call it rock are all the names\nOf the legendary flying richer\nUm and they've been doing tests on it recently and building up to speed on the runway and they hoped in a multitude of launching the idea was much like I'm\nNot from Grumman packets his rocket launches under the bottom of the L. ten eleven a wide body plane uh this this giant plane would have a rocket underneath it and its fuselage what it takes off any runway which gives you lots of flexibility lowers your costs enormously takes off\nTo hire you know goes up to a pretty high altitude and then it releases the rocket which then goes into orbit and you save money in in your infrastructure on the ground you could flexibility your customers and launching any inclination and location and uh you have a much more flexible and when you watch them where you don't have to worry about a lot of ranger she's\nMuch cure and and that was the idea of the company has been building the plane for a while they had a problem getting someone to build a rocket that would go underneath the plane\nUm and they went through over like K which is now the Grumman who dealt practices rocket than they were ... they were trying to space X to do what they turned it down then they said they're going to put Pegasus rockets under rock but those are tiny rockets they don't need rocked really do that so they she is the company's shuttle launch announced that\nIt's going to be building its own rockets to go under rock uh several versions of water which would be a completely\nA a a a some kind of like a um\nMany shuttle in a sense it would launch from the bottom of the plane\nGo into orbit drop off a payload and then it could come back and return to earth\nAnd so that would be usable law system and so they made that announcement that's a few years down the road a lot must be pointed out he had shot is that Paul Allen's death and this young age is is going to be a factor often is effective for companies like this because\nThere's no question this is a visionary approach which carries great risk and what what you've done those kinds of circumstances you need a specific powerful well these are individual with vision\nAt the head of the company to force it through when things go wrong a corporate\nCommittee type situation often chick chickens out they can't get it done if anything goes wrong they lose focus and so this ... we don't know yet how we set the company up who's going to be in charge afterward there's no names have been brought up about that company\nAnd so we're going to just have to see how it goes to they could affect them um I Will say that um\nI I had my concerns about\nAnd because they lack of getting the company to build a rocket underneath the ... the ... airplane I'm at the same time ... switch to getting government money rather than to building that's rocket independent government\nMeans we might be losing them as a low cost rocket company and then this is a company that might save that day provide some competition to space X when we need that competition so we just don't see how it plays out from\nIt's a loss though there's no question of it he owns ... to ... sports teams a lot of ... pay a lot of money went to a lot of good cause the\nBrain as we can brain Institute I mentioned it's often a ... a useful for items in science and nature magazine I'm presuming that law continue he does have a family bus driver launches our focus on commercials based I go from one ... one last two one failure and the failures so used to launch\nMost recently spectacularly failing the rescue of the astronauts cosmonauts\nThere's an emergency commission set up in Russia to investigate this becomes a long process Bob what does the loss of so use means for the the immediate future for our traveled to hire staff and for missions to earth orbit\nWhere it's a little unclear yet what the consequences of the commission is going to report its findings they say by October excuse me October twentieth which is what the end of this week they are poor moving very very fast\nThey are the the surgery a critic of who's the head of the manned space flight program in Russia is also a former ... who also is the first to flying the shuttle and was the first to one of the first team to occupy access\nHe uh had a press conference last week and what she said they tend to down to what happened is the first stage of the stories rocket is actually for strap on boosters and the costs stages that that has strap on to attach to the second stage\nThey fire launch put at a certain point those four strap on separate off\nAnd then of course they takes over the stage and what happened is one of those four strapped ... did not separate properly and that was what caused the collision or limber you might remember I talked about our vows did not release and this was ... it was supposed to release oxygen to\nI think like us rushed to push that strap on away so it didn't separate that's where the problem came from [noise] they have not said when what's gonna happen in terms of launches there is a man's assemble launch\nUm uh uh uh uh the crew on bought supposed to return and December because it's being replaced by another crew in December the Russians are saying they have not yet\nRescheduled that mission they are hopeful that we'll have a solve this issue and moved on by December and that might be the case they're supposed to be a progress launch a in between and they ... and that's using a Soyuz rocket they might use that launched to test to see if they solve the problem\nYou once again now beginning to look at the sub company in Russia which is really just the division of earth cosmos to that builds a strap bombs to see if the source of the problem came from there will have to wait and see\nRight now we're in a holding pattern we don't know how the demand program will be affected the American we're trying to build the commercial but placements to the Russians and it's unfortunate that American government doesn't seem to have much urgency to move that up or push that forward\nThis is John Green and if your teeth are staying from coffee tea or smoking power swabs as the answer in five minutes you'll see

images page\nAnd so that indicated or why they finally figured out this problem they've got the backup computer working and everything is good but there's been no images since October fourteenth where a couple of days later and they usually set down anywhere from fifty to two hundred images of the day when it's working great\nSo I Do not know what the status is there has been no press release or

war\nWith pressure and with Italy it was called the Oscar oppression war and it was for control of the states\nHave Germany and the state to Italy and Austria was trying to defend its role in Italy a controlled and he showed the port of Venice in the hinterland up out to Verona and then it controlled the German confederation which was this league of thirty nine states created the Congress of Vienna and Eighteen Fifteen\nAnd it was controlled by a diet of princes so the king of\nToday the king of Prussia the king of area the Austrian temper but the Austrian ever was presidents have this German Confederation and this suited Austria perfectly uh gave the appearance of great prestige and power but brush him\nUnder came home the first holding sold him\nAnd his brilliant a prime minister auto fun Bismarck really shaped this arrangement and so they push throughout the early Eighteen sixties for a war with Austria so it was to dissolve the German confederation to reform Germany under pressure rule which would eventually happening in these two wars of Eighteen sixty six and then the Franco ... war of Eighteen Seventy\nSimilarly in the south the the Italians were being organized by the kingdom of ... who was trying to unify the entire peninsula\nThat unified most of it in Eighteen sixty one\nUnder the under the leadership of the house the void the Piedmont these dynasty and all that remain to them was a new show this Austrian held province in\nNorth eastern Italy and the papal state the city of Rome and the surrounding area a lot to do but also the papal marches and and parts that are hadn't yet been annexed by the kingdom of Italy so Austria last that war so really the there you could say that Eighteenth sixty six was really the death knell because\nThey lost their ... role in Germany they lost their ... role in Italy they were forced back onto their own territory the the the Austrian Empire\nBecause of all the internal Russians that went on during this last war of Eighteen sixty six the emperor felt compelled to make an arrangement with the Hungarians where he divided the monarchy into two halves the Austrian half of Hungarian half called Austria Hungary granted the Hungarians of parliament\nIn eastern Austria and and then there was the German parliament in western Austria and so really the ... the country was\nThe the the idea of the emperor's idea was that he was retrenching that he was shoring the empire of for the long haul after the defeat of Eighteen sixty six but what America's asked if he really talks about in the first third of the book is how this ... this great compromise of Eighteenth sixty seven with the Hungarians\nRather than strengthening and retrenching you'd actually desperately weaken the monarchy because it creates it exacerbated the nationality problems that had already been quite sharp before Eighteen sixty six but they became much sharper after eating sixty six because of this compromise with the Hungarians basically\nEastern Austria the part that was taken over by the Hungarians as part of his great compromise and making sixty seven\nWas was Hungarians were actually minority\nMajority in eastern in eastern Austria this area called translate the any of the ... area east the life of river where slobs and remains\nAnd the Hungarians were you know about a little less than fifty percent over there and them and and the majority were slobs and Romanians and so the Hungarians ruled eastern Austria with an iron hand they insisted on Hungarian\nIn schools and churches public office administration\nAre they in franchised only seven percent of the population you had to be a wealthy educated modular Hungarian in order to be elected to parliament or even to vote for deputies department\nSo you had millions of slow vox Ukrainians Romanians really chafing under this very hard Hungarian regime in the eastern half\nAnd the western half was a\nThere was more concerned for cultural and language rights but you still had a German master nationality and most of western Austrian in the far flung outpost of Austria Galicia where World War one would would principally be fought this also belong to the Austrian half so the or nationality problems rather than being\nLaid by the arrangements made after the feed agencies to actually get worse as you march through the Eighteenth seventies eighties nineties and into the twentieth century\nAnd so really uh in the book talks a lot about this in terms of the pre history that the monarchy was really coming on done there were nationalist demands from every quarter from the checks from the slow vox from the ... ... serves Hungarians Romanians they all wanted to have\nMore say in parliament they say a Ukrainian speaking university Ukrainian speaking schools more Ukrainian deputies in parliament her check deputies or polish deputies you name it\nAnd the emperor was you know constantly trying to juggle all these things making little concessions here and there but having a really hard time keeping it together the only thing that might have served as a hardcore was the Austria Hungarian Army and yet the book shows quite convincingly\nThat this was a lost cause too because the Hungarians very deliberately\nWhittled down the army in the years after Eighteen sixty seven make it made it increasingly small weak underfunded under gunned\nSo that by the time you get to Nineteen fourteen it's an army the size of the Serbian Army with ludicrously old fashioned artillery bronze guns off without crew shields very low caliber short range hardly any heavy artillery at all\nNot nearly enough machine guns fewer machine guns per regimen battalion then the Russians even who are also very backward\nAnd you know and in a dismal level of training and the other thing the Hungarians do in order to keep the Oscar Hungarian Army small because they say they don't want to pay for it be they view it as possibly a conquering force if the\nArchduke ever takes over he makes no secret that he wants to re conquer hungry dissolve Austria Hungary and reestablish the Austrian Empire\nOr you know the Hungarians are are taking so much money out of the army when they get to Nineteen fourteen it's it's it's it's all but an impotent force and uh so that the decision to go to war in Nineteen fourteen is all the more baffling and it's something that the book explores quite closely\nTo the detail here the Hungarians are dominated the empire despite the fact that they had only Nineteen percent of the population\nForty of and they paid only thirty percent of the taxes friends Josef as a Jeffrey describes him became a temp arise or a weekly the man who never attacked a problem while he's found a way

how did he get I'm such a position where he would cut off with twenty other men are sending a message back I Will hold\nWhile the previous day they're gonna have to sell by the fifth regiment and the

attacks as you call the the turning point World War one um\nThe next day they sent the fix regiment into followed the tracks of the other second division soldiers the problem was within the Germans had brought up reinforcements there were there was no cover it was yet another open field just open fields they had a German artillery balloons spotting\nFor the artillery and yet the the the ... the bans went for it and it lasted really I mean it started about eight o'clock in the morning and it was pretty much over a three in the morning I'm just going to advance for machine gun fire

... a retreat we just got here all the messages were building to tell a story which was the original story we know it's so well now\nWe are ... you can forget that it's only a hundred years old this idea that the Marines are invincible the Germans come up with a name for them which means either hell hound or devil dogs and the Marines take to it right away that part of their spring\nOh yeah I mean the legend through the war or the legend was building I mean that that was really the birth of the modern Marine Corps war a first world war I'm\nLike I said they had never fought in such large numbers before a you know each regimen it was\nAbout three thousand men um and uh so yeah they they built the real speed a\nCore right and you know now it's gotten to the point where they'll Kate would use the term soldiers for Marines now you know Marines don't want to call him soldiers there Marines\nFor although you have that nice details that when they're officers especially at Quantico address them they call them laugh\nYeah right yeah yeah yeah it was like you know there are um harbored the airport the brigade commander noted that it was it wasn't like the army will pecking order you had to stay in your place\nHe thought that the Marines treated each other much more equally or go get a cup of coffee let these so it was a different style of discipline\nThroughout your life you know the the uh the conception of what Marines are so hard to talk to\nIs the last summer out the war and the Germans are fighting ferociously so or the French and the British and now they're using the Americans to launch attacks\nHowever Persian wants to prepare\nHis men in particular called the salient where which would be a ... on the line and we go through August with case getting some rotation back to our and our they were thirty five miles from Paris so wasn't hard to go to Paris one day participate in the parade and then be back in the front lines within twelve\nHours and you mostly watch we go now to the advanced the Persian put together along the lines Tom ... called uh September eleventh and twelfth and the second division was assigned to advance I again across a terrain that was chewed up badly body it was\nAs you make the point Jim this terrain you could still see the trees and villages\nAnd fields that was not the case once they get to the Meuse Argonne which is where the battlefield had been for four years\nRight there was actually uses that areas either as a rest area for a German troops um it'd been severely fought over in Nineteen Fifteen and then both sides just said okay let's just let it be but\nUm it was interesting is that when the Americans first arrived they saw that as a perfect opportunity that this is like in Nineteen Seventeen that some day what what all American armies reduce debt ceiling and ultimate came came to ... to pass as part of a bargain between ... and ...\nUh the commander I'm In return for doing assault a main assault with the Meuse Argonne so the Germans are actually\nPulling out of the same yell salient\nAs Americans we're going in it was it was the probably the the was casualties of any major battle that
