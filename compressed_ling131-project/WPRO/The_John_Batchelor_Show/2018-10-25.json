Gordon Chang's the Daily Beast we're joined by Allentown pa new blogs that reality check\nA Allen is our guide on trade especially manufacturing trade especially the concerns that the Trump Administration and many have in the unions with China taking American Jobs and also dominating American workplace with\nSubsidized good we know now there is an event coming up to seven seven December to non December in Shanghai, China it's in it's called the vape expo Shanghai, Shanghai new international expo center in Shanghai, China is described as a three day event\nHeld at the Shanghai new international expo center event will focus on the accessories suppliers finish productions ... production manufacturers trade companies vapor shops online retailers brand buyers famous media is a cat academics\nFamous players and individual consumers in east takes industry in other words a grab bag of material manufactured in China to be sold in the United states exported from China to the United states Gordon is this the event that is at issue about the United states attending or not if I got it right\nYes the United states is not sending a delegation to this event this\nEvent primarily intended to encourage 'em countries to export to China and ... number of people are starting to say that our refusal to go is basically hurting us business\nI say that it's part of I think a very powerful messaging on the part of the Trump Administration by saying we're trying to disengage from China even if it hurts us in the short term\nAnd by saying we're willing to take this pain in the short term um were telling the Chinese that everything they think about the weakness of the American political system is wrong they cannot manipulate the administration that the administration intends to separate us from China and if you're an export dominated economy like China that's a chilling message John\nSo this is about China in Coeur ... encouraging act at import into China that's what this is about it have propaganda\nOr event yeah and that's what they are that's the way that they're building it and they're getting the Europeans and everybody else to go there sending delegations\nAnd are tending their and import economy as opposed to the facts which is that they are entirely an export model\nYes I think they're doing this to try to dampen down a trade tensions and to try to build a coalition against the United states\nAllan uh you have\nA watch very carefully these years and now it's a second year of the Trump Administration dealing with China what is your measure of the U.S not attending a Potemkin trade show by the ...\nJohn ... for a show is exactly right\nBecause as Gordon put China is anything but an import friendly economy whatever propaganda they're trying to put out and what I Would add to Gordon is very trenches analysis here is that it's especially promising this move\nIf it indicates that the Trump Administration is moving away from its stated hope\nThat the trade war that it's conducting with China um is going to succeed primarily if it ends up\nPersuading shining to open up markets to us and other foreign competition\nAnd play fair and treat exports are from everywhere else in the world just like a treats Chinese made goods\nThat is a noble am it's certainly been the standard boilerplate for us trade policy for the entire world for about for at least Thirty years probably longer\nBut with China it's especially misguided because the Chinese have no intention of opening or keeping markets open to foreign competition one moment longer than they absolutely have to win and what I mean by that is\nChina recognizes that there were still good it's critical to its economic development that it needs to cure from overseas\nBut once it's managed to steal the relevant intellectual property once it's managed to conduct the appropriate reverse engineering um that foreign product and the company that makes it gets chewed up and spit out Gordon\nAllen so what we're really talking about is the Trump Administration are encouraging companies to move their supply chains out of China and of course uh once that occurs then um the u._s. is certainly much less dependent on the Chinese economy because we hear a lot of people say ...\nSo it right that the two economies are intertwined but if there are no longer intertwined that has all sorts of implications not only in a trade area but also of course across the spectrum of our relations with Beijing so I agree with you or if that's what the Trump Administration is trying to do and it appears that that's the direction they're going\nThen we have got a watershed moment in American history and that we're essentially looking at an entirely different relationship with China going forward\nThat's right and I would only hope that the Trump Administration if indeed this is it's a shame and I do think it is a but I Would only hope that the administration would make the aim of explicit\nBecause this this drive to reduce American engagement with with the Chinese economy that that's ... that's in fact contrary to the conventional wisdom completely incompatible whether this Dr has of course run into tremendous resistance at home here in the U.S\nAnd it's going to be crucial to overcoming that resistance for the president to explain the stakes the longer term stakes to the American people in a reasonably comprehensive way and we haven't had that yet and I think that's a really important missing element to the administration's China strategy\nAllen have you heard of anecdotes about a slow down here because of the tension with China\nYou hear a lot of anecdotes but certainly you're not seeing it in the economic data or whatever and uh\nI grew up being taught that that data trumps anecdotes anytime a and in particular we've I mean we've had several months of steel tariffs much less time with China specific tariffs but several months with steel and aluminum tariffs\nAnd it's clear Isabel from every major data series that the American government been puts out that not only are those industries that use steel and that and that he was a little with him not being harmed by these towers yet they're actually out performing the rest of manufacturing in most respects\nGarden Alan I'm you know we've had a number of discussions about whether manufacturing it's come back to the U.S and I'm a bit more optimistic than you are [noise] um but what does the data say\nAbout companies relocating manufacturing is coming back here is going someplace else we have a minute Allen you can take your time\nOkay here we only have anecdotes in terms of companies coming back but certainly you couldn't look at us manufacturing output\nIt's growing quite nicely and you can look at us manufacturing employment um which is actually growing faster than overall us employment it's been decades since that's happened the only\nGet your stuff which was a was murdered on the July ... and then a few weeks later Julian Assange came out an issue to twenty thousand dollar cash reward for information pertaining to whoever murder of PSAs rich and then the next day in an interview with Dutch television cost about the need to protect sources\nBut he's never come out publicly and said Seth Rich was my source but the you can look at the history of what the lakes and never have they issued a reward for anybody else or who is a method untimely yeah\nAll right let's leave entire Larry 'cause we're not going to answer these questions were just raising ... what what the F. L. Y. a request has turned up from the NSA that there's\nA link in some fashion with documents we do not have between ... now the allegation and twenty six team that I Believe Russia to get is still working with is that the the documents and the DNC servers were hacked by Russian professionals ... very cheaply ... bad the G argue\nThat those documents were passed to Julian Assange to embarrass weaken in some fashion under caught Mrs Clinton's campaign\nDoes that that does that that information also connects to the fact that crowd strike was called in by the DNC this is a\nA cyber security firm and crowds try took possession of all of those servers all of that hardware and software and told us that it was fancy Baron ... cheaply cozy bear that ... what is what is the crowd Dr what have we learned about crowd strike\nSo crowds strikes founder Dimitri up her or the ... is uh basically comes out of the Ukrainian George family a very much anti Russian [noise]\nUm what what's fascinating is that the ... nobody in the federal government the federal law enforcement agency has been able to get access to the survivors the coup inclusion that was fancy bear and that was Russian is based entirely upon the work the crowd strike did there was a big problem with the work the crowd strike did\nThey started work on the seventh of may they if they did their work right they should have\nCome in and one twenty sixteenth Evans have may twenty six teams after the report exhausted after the report of the ...\nWere doing things properly they would have come in and turned off all of the computers and installed new software and get everybody in the passwords which would have broken the the the the the link to a hacker if there was a hacker\nBut what happened is the emails were actually downloaded on the twenty fifth of may and now we know from an article that appeared in Esquire Magazine in two thousand sixteen in October\nThat crowd strike that not shut off the computers until June tenth and did not start installing software to that weekend of June tenth\nOr this is just laughable because they claim that they knew that there was a Russian hacking going on as early as may yet did nothing to stop it that then gets taken the last the last day of the emails that appear on the wiki leaks\nAh ah an archive is the twenty fifth of may\nSo you've got to raise the question of what in the world was cross strike doing but on top of that than we have the analysis that was done by Bill Binnie\nIs a former technical director of the national Security Agency\nOf bell is a is a true genius in this area\nAnd he he was able to take the meta data that appeared it's he recalled it on Jim for team through June fifteenth fella by the name of goose suffered two point oh surfaces goose or for two point oh claims to have these documents and in fact both crowd strike\nAnd Robert Mueller the special counsel have all pointed to goose suffer as proof that it's Russia because they look at the stylistic parts of the medical data such as language usage\nBuild it and look at style he looked at simple math and science there is a transfer rate and you know how fast information can be transferred over the Internet if it's uh\nBy so fast it could be transferred if you put it onto some ... ... what he discovered was the transfer rape that's in the ... data other documents with goose for two point oh put up\nWith Robert Mueller claims is proof that this Russia in fact could not be transferred over the Internet you could only are corrupt or transfer a download on two of\nThem All right we've established are important ... questions now about Seth Rich about Julian Assange about crowd strike about the DNC server\nWe've also developed information most recently that crowd strike was a was a firm that was connected to the Democratic committee and was represented by a man named soft men\nWho was on a ... who is an attorney for ... now subsequently identified as the firm that hired Glenn Simpson and fusion GPS\nIn order to create the dusty against Donald Trump we also know that Sussman represented crowd strike so crowds like being called in is entirely consistent with the DNC he's\nA law firm ... caught but it also raises the question is why the FBI was not provided access to those server sometime in may and June it never has had access so we we ... we can answer that question\nWhat what you presented here Larry is that the questions that we presume these last two years were answered were not answered adequately or there are possibilities that haven't been explored is that all correct\nThat is very important like concert on this was motivated by the excellent our you spent with Steve Cohen last night\nBecause it highlights that we're trying to portray Russia is this great enemy perpetrating some tremendous fraud against us and yet it's not based on a shred of actual credible evidence it's based on manufactured evidence\nAnd it can only if you look at the documents they point to as evidence that it was the Russians it has such clumsy fingerprints on it that it it's deliberately design to leave trademarks in their fingerprints and\nA and elements to point to Russia while no intelligence\nOutfit worth its salt\nConducts an operation like that particularly the Russians and yet we've returned to Russia's intelligence up and into something into a clown show and are accusing them of something that was put into fair is one in fact it looks like what happened is Seth Rich who had his own motivations he was a Bernie Sanders supporter I'm told\nAnd he was at odds with a couple of his bosses at the DNC had every reason in the world but\nDel ... alright again we open questions that I presume have been answered joining Assad Seth Rich crowd strike Dimitri a pair of it ah the ... law firm\nAlso the question of the Russia investigation Mr Mueller we do not provide answers we do have the fact that the NFL has documents that certainly were not

I've been really a quite aggressive in recent years and there's been on certain the in East Asia in Taiwan included\nAbout whether America would do something about so I think this has been helpful in reassuring those who bought the lie that the Trump Administration was very transactional on trade and might be ignoring ... try and China's territorial aggression\nSteve is there a concern in Taipei about a miscalculation or accident that could lead to an escalation and these episodes where warships traveling at high speeds out on the open seas could misunderstand or miss direct like that incident with the Decatur\nWell I think the answer to that it yes but mostly military circles I find that concern that the greatest\nMilitary circles in Taiwan but also a military circles need us on Pacific command particular they will also have\nSomewhat of a concern about miscalculation on the Chinese part and we've lived with some of these miscalculations in the not too distant ask too in terms of the air maneuvers that led to the the three crisis in the early Bush administration and some of the\nThe the base confrontations we had but in Taiwan generally I think the biggest concern is that the U.S becomes either distracted\nBy er an amber with its dealings with China and Taiwan just becomes a on that is lost in that match Gordon\nGee you know if you go back in the last year which first year of the Trump Administration um you get a sense that the president and the national security team around him in Washington really weren't quite sure what to do with China and it did look at some points that they were willing to do would do with China over a number of things including North Korea\nThis year um there's a very different tone that I sense and you're in Washington and I'm not but I I get a sense that the administration decided that it is going to disengage from China and obviously that has implications for Taiwan\nI mean do you read the mood in Washington the same way or do you see in somewhat different tones\nOh I think there's contending news in Washington and within the administration to president seems very clear that he is simultaneously open to a deal but very burn on trying to reset the context in which that deal with the ...\nAnd certainly in the run up to the ... the mid term election and probably his reelection at twenty twenty\nI Would put very low the odds of some kind of a grand deal on trade or security ... have you are but as you know he has seven intention to consider another meeting with Kim Jong un and\nThe north Korean negotiations could go and very unpredictable ways but for the most part I think Washington was very much in the warm bath conventional thinking on China for so long that it's been unsettled\nBy what I was I think articulated by vice president Pence of the kind of bill of particulars of the many ways China has upset the status quo and the administration's determinations or respond but they haven't really detail how they'll respond and that seems to be to talk of Washington now\nI Do not recall the Obama administration or the or the Bush administration sending two warships into the Taiwan Strait for sixteen hours perhaps you can recall for me but does this mean that the Trump Administration is seeking to embrace the defense of Taiwan\nWell I think\nThat Secretary Mattis has been very very clear about that the truth message he has ... I think you're right in terms of the precedent in terms of uh as as far as the transit Thomas Drake go in close proximity\nUh but this I think has more to do it's freedom of navigation and the claims in the south China either does just the Taiwan Strait a and there are strong thing said going back to the tourist and confirmation hearing as a matter of affirmation hearing\nAbout the south China Sea and this is my first time we've seen I think a stomach and to liberate rushed back of the Chinese and it happens to be the Taiwan Strait but\nI think it's meant more broadly as a signal that China not Jeff\nGordon one more question Steve what is going to be the ultimate test of relations between Washington in Taipei what are you looking\nFor in terms of of how these two capitals worked together are we going to be closer are we going to be farther apart let's say six months from now\nWe should be closer together uh and I think it's actually a time of strategic opportunity for a while there's tray friction and maybe some military question going on in the U.S China relationship\nTo put forward bold positive proposals of things that would be good for America and good for Taiwan on trade and the fat will so I think it's a time of opportunity they have their local elections their version of midterms at the end of November and wants but beyond that distraction hopefully presidents I and her team go bowl\nStephen ...

Jenny is going to tell me what a family offices here in the twenty first century been through changes since John Rockefeller put together the first family office a hundred years ago I learned from the books but then it's going to put his to work\nToday in the United states and around the world for family offices which are changing Jenny a very good evening to you thank you and welcome Cindy family office according to the dictionary is one well to do family\nThat hires who hire people to manage their accounts they're ill liquid and liquid assets and to look out for future generations has it changed so much since John Rockefeller good evening to you\nThank you thank you for having me um I think it hasn't changed in in in in the idea for somebody else this is really it's having neutral people work for you and I have\nNo other incentive but your goals to take care of your financial needs of your legal needs of your children as a school of state spending taking care of your future of the inheritance\nAnd again the important thing is done by us so they are only working for you they're not getting\nPaid as opposed to ... or anything a bank or a private equity firm that's going to take its fees no matter what you have a team of people who only Dick concern themselves with your assets right they cost you\nObviously you pay them a salary but they are non biased when I'm working with a private banker I'm going to end up with some products that may not be the best for me because he sells them to me because he's getting a commission for instance\nYour DC at D.C hyphen finance dot com is the website what can you do for people who are well to do and want to know whether the family offices for them what we tell them if they contact you with us through the website [noise] well\nWe do we do gatherings we do conferences that are held in a New York Miami used in Dallas Toronto London in Israel where we're from which is interesting and I can talk about it later\nUm where they there's no media by the way you know a a Wall Street journal anyone like that are covering it close to the process of the way in that sense yeah we we did they feel more comfortable when they're not you know pictures taking these spoke to that and stuff like that\nI'm a generalist myself whether I'm an extra ... just a couple of Wall Street for global smuggled into the wall Street Journal and Israel and um they learn in a private setting about lots of different topics from investments to a state spending philanthropy for instance in Dallas this week or next week\nWe have a a very wealthy family talking about marrying into money not think how sensitive that topic is she brings her husband\nAnd she's one of the wealthiest families in Dallas and she's going to talk about the challenges he had marrying into money and what comes with it\nAnd both of them are going to talk about it seems from these angle and she's from her so when you have a private setting and you hear about both in ... and other topics that are very sensitive you your your child's future you know addiction is one of the biggest problems for our diction suicide the\nThe very serious topics at ten here that keeps these guys awake at night and when they hear about that from professional people from the fears that are sharing that with them and they get to network with one another to quote investigator on which is a different topic I can talk about that is what they actually want\nAll right now family offices can come to you for these conferences people who want to know what to do with their money that they do they need a family office to they need a private bank of the bankers I'm going to let them go easily after all they've got this enormous amount of money right so you would offer the difference between a family office\nAnd a private bank or or a private equity firm let's quickly defined that what's a level for a private off for a for a family office to work what level of of well\nSo that different levels in different places I Would say roughly in many would argue about that but probably north of a hundred million dollars is a single ...\nYou know single family which means it's like you hear like the ... it's a single a group of people that works only for you is that if my name is Kate so I have a family right right right and then I Would say between tend to a hundred maybe twenty to a hundred is the heightened it with individuals\nUh I like the old shrine that's what's nice to have to think of themselves and they would normally work with the moves that someone multifamily office we work the same\nWay but it's a group of unrelated people who have a team working for them\nRight they work with different families that don't that doesn't justify for them to to hire an entire teen by themselves\nThe family offices are extremely desirable I read from the point of view of IPO's or start up Israel to start a nation the U.S here has a few start it's every once in a while our family offices attracted to start a\nVery very much so these guys are\nOpen minded they unlike institutional investing says your investor needs to return the money some points so that's a problem they cannot invest after a certain point they cannot invest in smaller companies they have a lot of liability than a lot of rules within that they need to operate in somebody else's don't\nAnd the beautiful thing about some of the ... I can come to you right now and put your glasses on you and tell you even though you don't do anything and the art in virtual reality\nPut those best his own you until you this is the future and this is what the future you may fall in love with each right now which is called by the way a emotional investment like they do is art sometimes and you can come to your father or your mother or whatever it is and we got to be involved in this thing\nThe only ones that can make decisions that data family officer so I think the last as long as you you see that they invest heavily in to go to diversify the risks and they love the adventure they love to look at different kinds of tech related investments absolutely\nThe concern I have about family offices and where they are going now is the difference between here in New York and in Israel and in Europe I hear they're different tax structure is Danny I hear that around the world you have to know what you're doing yeah there are people attracted to the U.S version of a family office as opposed to a European\nIt's a good question I think Europe is Mm around the place you know you have so many different cultures which is also a problem is probably number one culture wise they don't always seem to seem to don't agree\nAnd fixation that they come from different countries with different rules it makes it very hard for the call invest go invest meaning\nI Will instead of going to a fund our come to another family that he does real estate and I do do that and I will join them in the roost in investment and they'll join me what I'm good at let's say to college and then we'll take the middleman out and it's just us and we have the same objective\nSo in Europe I think it's it's way more problematic because of what I've just mentioned well the U.S is huge and people came from the same place so quaint listings way easier here than there so that's one of the major differences between the U.S and Europe\nWe had a crisis ten years ago the financial crisis that swept the euro uh cheaply real estate failure in the United states to all of that laws were changed um and I'm thinking chiefly of Dodd Frank and other adjustments in our tax system does that make it more\nNow that we have this this this invasion marching through Mexico marching inexorably toward our southern border the president has now said that he is prepared to deploy the military to seal the border to prevent this invasion from entering this raises a really profound\nQuestion John that has so far been unanswered when does the mob of foreigners used to storm our border\nBecome an invading army that would then justify military action to retell it\nWe don't have an answer to that question get there is going to be a showdown because the president is serious about feeling the border and not allowing these people it will be authorized the use of lethal force what what is going to happen with this\nCaravan this army of invaders get to the border we don't know that yet but we are now in an era of\nMobs and this is what my column in the Washington Times about tomorrow because I call it Trump calls the bluff with the left wing mobs that this caravan\nIs the latest mob but it's also the biggest of them all but we are now being bombarded by left wing mobs\nEvery where we look for in the Senate confirmation vote of Brett Kavanaugh to social media to antifa mobs roaming our city streets\nTo progressive gangs hounded elected officials where they live work and died vandalizing their offices and of course the biggest most most powerful Bob the mall is the media it's a virtual mob especially when it gangs up with entities like Facebook\nGoogle Twitter so we're looking at Bob\nAnd especially left wing mobs in every direction to president of the United states is doing his best John to fend off and I think when you're seeing the momentum move and a lot of these key races toward Republicans\nIt's because conservatives Republicans and independents and disaffected Democrats are all responding to the onslaught against this country\nThe mention of democratic Bob's takes me to my youth Monica always a happy journey\nAnd Nineteen sixty eight August I'm Nineteen sixty eight which was a tumultuous months in world affairs the Soviets moved against uh Prague August ... surprising everyone of Vietnam was collapsing around the Johnson administration the peace talks were going nowhere in Paris\nAnd in Chicago a very large contingent of democratic activists we now call them progress as a ... word charge by the ... by the Chicago police and Mayor Daley was screaming at the podium in the Chicago convention hall during the nomination of\nA ... a Hubert Humphrey for ... president of the United states that wrecked the Democratic power so much so that Richard Nixon your mentor was elected\nEver since then Monica the Democrats have not been happy about those events and have talked about how they never want that to happen again\nSo how do we get here Monica having sworn it often sixty eight why do we see these demonstrations in twenty Eighteen to they have no memory\nWell they haven't sworn it off and I write extensively about this in my column coming tomorrow in the Washington Times John So thank you for giving me a chance to talk about it I write about how in the mid Nineteen sixties\nToo radical left wing professors Richard Claritin and friends and function in argued for accelerating the transition to socialism by overwhelming and then collapsing the social welfare system a few years after that ... the radical revolutionary\nTalked about destroying the capitalist Democrats\nOrder by what ... humiliation and mockery and mirrors and yes mop\nFast forward John to the great recession you would've hundreds of union and other folks descending bankers at home then after that you had the Occupy Wall Street Bob out there in the city streets committing violent crime and trafficking illegal drugs desiccated on police cars\nThat is what the radical far left does they manufacture may have designed to advance the progressive agenda but what they fail to understand or maybe they just don't care is that the United states is still a center right country and when these things happen as they are now\nWell you get a backlash because the great majority is ready to put his foot down yet again as it did in twenty sixteen and as it did yes in Nineteen sixty eight by like ... Richard Nixon\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy two because we saw a repeat of it in ... in six Seventy two with George McGovern\nLeading the progress of the Democrats\nSo Monica we have a story here where the Republicans are responding are inclined to Capitol first and now the caravan is that enough conventional wisdom says the house goes from Mrs Pelosi the speaker perhaps by six plus ... perhaps by plus sixteen\nAnd the Senate dais Republican and perhaps picks up to three or four seats are you comfortable with conventional wisdom\nI never comfortable with the conventional wisdom remember John I came on this program what about twenty four hours after Donald Trump came down the escalator\nAnd try to fix and schools me on though and I told you and I told you I Do not count him out likely to be the nominee and the president rice\nUm and I would against it every bit of conventional wisdom I have now said on this program and others that I Believe the Republicans will hold the house narrowly\nNarrowly but I think they will hold it and what first of all it was a good instinct but now I'm really examining numbers among some key races in the house at those places collectively have narrowed they've tightened Republican intensity\nIs way up and we can attribute it to the ... the foreign invasion about just storm our border we could also attributed to have it all the way he was treated at a left wing Bob and so on you can attribute to to a number of things I also would add in the economy which is incredibly strong\nThanks to President Trump on the Republican agenda\nAnd we're going to get the GDP number for the third quarter first estimate on friday morning so we'll have that number all next week before the election\nAnd that could be a great political gift to the president to end to Republicans as well boiling them a look at the Democrats the left they can't help themselves are out there ... acting insane\nAnd I think it turns off a lot of independent voters and remember\nThe group that elected Donald Trump with Republicans or conservatives are even independents it was just affected Democrats blue collar folks in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio Michigan Wisconsin there had been changed their mind not Donald Trump they're glad they voted for him because\nTheir lives have improved renegotiated NAFTA renegotiating trade deals tax cuts deregulation\nAll served their direct\nEconomic purposes\nSee all of these things together I Do not think there's a blue wave your the prominent Democrats like Bernie Sanders backing away from that whole that whole concept trying to lower expectations I think that the great silent majority has not done yet ...\nMonica Crowley Washington Times watch for her column I'm John bachelor with the John ...

Ninety thousand southeastern these were not\nRegional wars these were these were you know almost village a conflicts and Russia really turned them into a regional war is because it's a very good a lever one thing that I Hope John Bolton will be very different than most of its us predecessors that\nUs efforts have pet and conflict resolution that tend to focus on Iran in ... you know getting the two sides together to talk\nAgree it's really not about you're unemployed cool it's really honestly about Moscow and and and Washington and that uh you know with our understanding how Russia uses this conflict or to hold the region hostage on it'll be very difficult to as all that and I think another point you brought up the ... really relevant is that\nUm I think I mean it needs to acknowledge it physical presence in the gonna Kobach places\nGame with says well there's Armenia and there's the you know ... by force that if it's some separate entity and I think it's not\nA way that build any confidence to solve the conflict you know your I've been I've been to the region you know there is Armenian soldiers serving their the previous two presidents have I mean you are actually from the gonna call Bob\nUh our our Armenian citizen serve in the military and in the region or you know ... it to say they're not there yet if Israel said you know we're not in the west bank that's like local today and forces now as if it's something\nA foreign so I think I think it's also important that uh that Armenia ... you know come clean and recognizes its own presence in this region\nWe have news or you mention Israel the commanding general of the ... of the republic of Azerbaijan forces visiting in Israel for the first time\nI visited with the as about John forces yeah earlier this year\nAnd I saw a lot of first rate Israeli equipment I've heard over the years that as about Sean and Israel work together chiefly ... that's the benefit of Israel when and if there's need to use basing in ... north of Iran\nHowever it is to just that there's more of a a developing relationship for arms and training\n[noise] yeah I think you know many you know media and sometimes foreign officials\nI'm a talk about the relationship between Azerbaijan and Israel's if it's some you know marriage of convenience is if it's just about well interest but you know because as you are based on the Shia Muslim and and and Israel is predominantly\nA Jewish that for some reason there would be some structure into their relations but I think it's exactly the opposite I think that that there's there is there is um ... this whole region has nothing as we discussed the in the previous discussion between it\nHas nothing to do with with a religion just like\nIran and Armenia have very close you know relations when\nYou know our Armenians occupies territory that lead to you know nine hundred thousand or she Azerbaijan needs to become refugees it doesn't bother the Islamic republic of Iran the same thing there's zero anti Israel sentiments a in Azerbaijan I visit there frequently I'd see\n... you know probably the Jewish person I feel more welcome a ... than I Do in most places in in in Europe um ... and again this is actually it's kind of interesting because there were two\nNot only is this the first visit of the chief of staff of us are based on in Israel but the last major visit of a senior either by Johnny official was may fourteenth that does that dates anything to John\nYes make fourteen that was made fourteen so that was during a conflict I Can't recall what was the ...\nUh it was actually the hope that this didn't two thousand and Eighteen it was the opening of the U.S embassy\nAll right here in the middle of and Jerusalem I was going the wrong way I felt some something was happening in Baku yes\n[laughter] so so actually you know the inter inter governmental commission between Azerbaijan and Israel met for the first time in Jerusalem when the U.S embassy was being open you know and basically the whole Muslim world was a a a boycotting end up in arms\n[noise] I think it can and I think it should be a again here the Saudi ambassador ambition was to get tough with the galleries\nOr they said the galleries were supporting terrorism and we're too close to Iran they issued a long list of demands slapped on the embargo um do ... did not in fact meet and those demands has survived the embargo um but because of the interruption of economic linkages\nHas turned in part to Iran and so the relationship between got her and Iran is far more now than it was before the embargo began from an American perspective still largest US military base in the region as in gutter and of course the Saudis and ... and others are security partners as well and so now we have\nPartners on each side of this fragment of juicy block which doesn't make life easy for us and so a really as I think a State Department spokesman a spokesperson said was a view of Mike Pompeo Iran has emerged as the beneficiary of of the state of affairs here\nTo ask so Ron is now entered into this they're watching the show gee tragedy and is this a an unexpected benefit for them\nAbsolutely you know if the Iranians have been a notably silent and and this and uh you know in American domestic politics there's the rule of thumb that if your opponent is in the process of destroying himself or his reputation don't get those way just to keep your mouth shut and watch and\nToaster good fortune and unfortunately I think that's where the Iranians are today because they look at a not just the division between the United states and Saudi Arabia is likely to um create but the empowerment of turkey\nI'm the sort of moral diminish mint of Saudi Arabia the degree to which this has made business and uh and governments around the world less\nInclined to work with\nA and cooperate with Saudi Arabia and from the rainy perspective that's all good news and they didn't have to do anything to achieve that\nNext on the list and this is more difficult to see but a Hariri the prime minister the son of the slain prime minister was for a time in Riyadh and the question was was he there on his own free will the Saudi Arabians they're not saying he's free to come and go he says vacationing\nBut when you mentioned Hariri you are plunged into Lebanon and Syria what are the Saudis up to and they ... ... what is their party at Richard [noise]\nSo a year ago the Saudis um concluded that they did not like the fact that uh has a law who's a sponsor of course Iran or within coalition government with Saad Hariri the prime minister of Lebanon\nA and that they wanted to try to marginalize a ... political influence on their by ... deal a setback to run\nAgain a not a bad ambition um but it backfired ah they\nLured a Saad Hariri to this to Saudi Arabia a forced him under obvious dress a two resigned his position as prime minister Saudi TV a with no real explanation although he was required to end did blame Iran um but the result\nOf this was it didn't hold and within a matter of weeks Hariri was back having rescinded\nThe resignation you still prime minister and it had the effect of actually increasing the political support for Hezbollah rather than decreasing it so it was one more um kick in the counter productive\nColumn you mentioned Israel as a plus because Israel and Saudi Arabia has moved very close together these last years and Mohammed bin Salman is the center of that ... but I see that the Israelis are very worried about ...\nBecause having moved so far with Saudi Arabia they're concerned about losing\nA you also mentioned a positive that the Saudis were ready to back us up in the event the\nIran sanctions a damaged the world's supply of oil especially if our European allies are both those positive now at risk Richard\nI Would say the positive with respect Israel is at some risk in the sense that um ... for the Israelis as for the United states the Saudis or a less valuable strategic partner if you could call it that um than they were before the surgery\nA murder given the program that's been directed\nToward Riyadh uh I I think the oil is a different matter I think that the Saudis\nAh it's it's theoretically possible that they would react to any pressure\nThe world puts on them or with such anger that they would reduce their oil exports and not make up for the reduction and Iranian exports of hurt and so forth but of course our costs them economically precisely at the moment or when they have a big plan to grow and diversify the economy\nI'm not saying I won't do it but I think it's unlikely\nUm but uh but what you said also points to you know the potential kinds of upsides that there are in this relationship which is why I say don't just get rid of the thing let's modify its terms um they have\nStopped their previous hostility toward Israel they are helpful when it comes to pressure on Iran and certainly our counterterrorism intelligence cooperation other things as well\nThe concern here is how to go forward and this is a tabletop exercise it's almost like a game of risk in which you're trying to reestablish relationships after\nUh after you see conflict between South America and Africa for example so what he is adequate you mentioned the global Magnitsky Act I've also had conversation is talking about\nUh the convention on torture or the possibility of the international criminal court getting involved is that is that imaginable that the U.S would go along with a criminal charge against people in Saudi Arabia\nWill certainly not through the international criminal court I mean the Trump Administration and John Bolton the national security measure make clear that they would like to deal with ... the international criminal court and my understanding is that Saudi Arabia doesn't recognize us jurisdiction anyway so I don't think that's\nAn avenue or the global Magnitsky sanctions would be sanctions economic sanctions target financial measures visa bans things like that that are directed at the perpetrators and that I think will happen I'm just in the past Eighteen hours or so I think the secretary of state telegraphed as much\nUm then you've got the broader question of beyond\nPunishing those who are are immediately responsible or as far up the chain as you can determine are responsible or what do you do about the relationship more broadly and here\nI where I come down is that unity of measures are are you know to some degree necessary but they're certainly not sufficient well this is an opportunity and to reset some aspects of the relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia and to try to move them in a more constructive\nDirection so that they're not engaged in a kind of counterproductive ah actions that I described in instead of a you know use this as a wake up call to try to wind down some of the things particularly the war in Yemen\nRichard Fontaine is president of the center for new American security I'm John bachelor this is the John ...
