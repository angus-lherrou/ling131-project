you're probably right we don't know but um we can see the writing on the wall which is we're seeing loyalty tests they've ... they've ah prevented some people from running for political office because

in China and trouble in the United states about China [noise] we've heard the predicates hear of a campus\nUniversity of Rochester a very successful higher education representing all the colleges and kept the universities in the United states anxious about an event about Tibet for heaven's sakes\n... back to back Gordon ... bat it's Tibet back\nAt the Dalai Lama hosted at the White House every president as far back as I can remember in Tibet so are we are joined by a young graduates to a post graduate student at the University of Rochester Rochester\nA essay who came and he tells the beginning of the star mark Clifford of the south China Morning post former editor is also here and he'll ask questions just the beginning of the story that he's disrupted and his plans to hold an event about that\nAnd he gets information that it's not going to be invited on ... it's not it's not pleasant for the University of Rochester to have it on campus because\nSnowflakes yes so fine garden so say who you're going to have this event in a mate auditorium in\nOn the University of Rochester campus march thirty first of this year it\nJust hours before it's supposed to occur\nYou get ... off into a remote classroom you know well beyond um any place where anyone's going to go and you of course afterwards want to go and find out what happened you'd go talk to the dean of students what do you hear from the dean so what\nI heard from the dean on my personal conversation with him was that a um he actually had to leave the room um after it getting canceled because he didn't want the university to look like it was censoring itself\nUm and I don't know if he meant this on a on a on a goodwill or whatever it may be but um he said next time that I I have an idea about holding this event\nI should go and and and talk to the Chinese community first and the university before I hold this before I hold this type of event so that um this type of incident wouldn't occur again\nI'm at and at that point I all I knew that the student group pulled off and and that was the main issue however the weird thing is that up until that time I'm even ... which I actually talked to the dean five days after my event occurred on campus thankfully\nAnd up until that time I haven't got I had gotten a single email from the student organization that actually pulled out from the event\nAnd so he actually then suggested that I go talk to the student organization about what had happened but uh all he knows is that it was the student organization that pulled up and that was the main reason\nAnd and the upshot of all of this is basically the universe is saying that the Chinese students get a veto on what can be hosted on campus which really is essentially what said\nYou know they tried to prevent people from going to your event how many people eventually showed up in that remote area oh I'm unlike unlike what a lot of\nPeople believe we have over Seventy people show up I'm most of them were ... we had a diverse range of students but the most of them were students at that either came from mainland China or those students who are a Chinese Americans but other than that we had a other as diverse members of the university community\nSo despite the best efforts of perhaps the Chinese government but certainly the administrators at the University of Rochester you get an inclusive event talking about Tibet a sensitive subject with Chinese mainland students Chinese Americans in a good cross section of the University of Rochester yep so it was\nAll for not all of this attempt to ... your um event off campus right detail\nGarden or cooking a lot of diverse characters who are also the Centers for the future if those are young people they have long memories will\nThey do John and this indicates that a lot of the efforts of um the Chinese government um and the Chinese security services um to censor unimpressed\nOr a counter productive it just doesn't ... connect us to mark because you mentioned the umbrella movement the a yellow umbrella protests of Hong Kong\nThose where young people those were young people and just to wrap up or what cord and said I mean think about this is quite chilling ... the the uh or would you said John that the Chinese government in Chinese people in in Hong Kong Chinese putative Chinese students associations have a veto over what can be discussed on campus\nAnd I when I find shocking\nThe administrators go along with this so much the time that people are so scared about a\nLittle bit of money that's being doled out through Confucius institutes or or and they just allow themselves to get intimidated look over their shoulders and it's not usually some high level pressured some mid level person who just a two sides are going to pull the plug on some inconvenient event\nTo these Chinese students there at at the University of Rochester they're paying full ticket they don't have scholarships here or there on money from home money from mom and dad what do you know about their\nResources well from what I Know a lot of them actually do pay out of pocket a film them are ... are are on some form of scholarships some from what I've heard is a government scholarship\nBut from ah from what I Know recently is that some of them even um I get sponsored by somebody to come here and study right so um they're paying full they're paying full top dollar um\nAnd that's good for the University in the university way secret and what the motive is here they don't want to disrupt their a flow of ... mainland China the garden there's a Chinese is a student association\nYeah there there's a the Chinese students and scholars association is on most or virtually all campuses where there are mainland Chinese students\nAnd really this is essentially an organization although it's supposedly Chinese students and scholars it's really run out of Beijing and is intended to monitor um students also to organize them for political activities on American soil this is a violation of American sovereignty clear and simple\nAnd the thing here John ... there's a lot of people to get angry at one of those people or set of people are are basically us politicians and us leaders for allowing Beijing to operate on American soil violate our sovereignty year and year out and we don't do anything about\nIt I say I've seen too many Alfred Hitchcock movies so I have to follow this course have you heard talk is their noise about Chinese spies among the student population reporting back to Beijing\nWell I'm over the years uh in in in the University of Rochester I'm I have heard bits and pieces yeah my Chinese student colleagues that um\nThey have to they always have to watch what they have to say on even on campus um even in our private conversations do them use had well there are certain things I I I personally cannot mentioned so I I don't feel comfortable talking about that specific topic like Tibet or or even or even the Christian or even the first to Christians in China\nAnd market that would be an example of how the anaconda doesn't have to do anything\nThat's right but the anaconda in this case is doing something I Know for a factor in Hong Kong at one of the universities professor friend of mine is teaching we'd get no questions from mainland students until she install the software that allows them to ask questions anonymously to her and she gets a ton of questions\nA ... probably should have been meeting pond pay oh in on a previous visit he did meet ... so first he\nSends him to subordinate to subordinate give him a tongue lashing and you know as as we were discussing before we went on air Jon usually in diplomacy you're behind closed doors right you don't do that kind of thing is you try to make a point to to someone your boss as well as the guy on the other side of the ocean\nAnd the other thing here is that what the Chinese are doing when you look at the actual actions you know canceling dialogues and and the rest of it\nOh yeah see dialogue castle in the middle of October of ...\nSecurity dialogue canceled Tobar there are a lot of milk Tamil exchanges that have already been cancelled a clearly they're not going to put on anymore or at least in the near future\nUm trade talks have been canceled all of these things that have not occurred have generally been for the benefit of China throughout the years and for Beijing not to go forward with him as an indication that yeah they're throwing a tantrum but they're doing so in a way which is counterproductive to their own interests\nSo that shows that there's got to be some sort of stress and the political system right now because they're doing things that don't advance their causes and when countries do things like that you know something is fundamentally wrong at the top\nAnd mark life in Hong Kong it's I'm I've not been there but Gordon tells me that it's a magical place that is par space colony part of part of the Asia economy\nIs they're anxious to talk about this is their whistling past the graveyard talk how did they regard these in these notes that are discordant well\nFirst of all I think it's remarkable how much space Hong Kong people preserved for themselves in the Twenty one years since um the People's Republic of China took what was a British colony back into Chinese hands Chinese sovereignty\nA lot of people thought that this was going to happen much faster so we've had a half a million I'd say probably a million people out in the streets in two thousand three protesting against\nProposed national security legislation\nFour years ago we had the umbrella movement where the center of the city was occupied for Seventy nine days\nSo and the one hand that's that's remarkable to Hong Kong people are like water they're usually very gentle a few drops here and there and every once in a while they get together and there's a cascade warrant that sweeps away um be what's in the way however\nThe last few years have been really tough and there is as I said before a very concerted campaign to narrow what is permissible what can be talked about in Hong Kong um\nThe the leading pro democracy newspaper website apple daily is a has been way you know it's been the subject of a boycott and its print operations and on his website so which is seen more and more ah actions of this sort and I I think it's got people feeling pretty discouraged pretty beaten down into 'em\nUp for the most you know people who care are nervous and then on the other hand much of the business community of course much of the government much of the elite is saying don't worry everything's going to be fine\nBut it doesn't look like things are going to be fun because you do have\nYou know you simply you got to have a large portion of the population that's not buying into this if you go back to July first or June thirty I'm\nNineteen Ninety seven I'm the last day of British Rule there was this euphoria that China was going to take over and if you were polled people then which I'm sure somebody did you you have like Ninety nine percent of the people saying this was really going to be very good\nBut doubt if you were to take that same poll you have people say look I don't even believe I'm a Chinese I I'd they they're saying for instance I Want to be independent these are voices we hadn't heard of six years ago so it seems to me that Beijing is doing\nIs I'm actually making Hong Kong much more hostile territory for its interests it absolutely has made it more hostile rhetoric and the thing that's important here today is ten ten double ten day it is the national day for Taiwan the republic of China\nA lot of people in uh Nineteen Ninety seven were saying look Taiwan you too can become part of the People's Republic\nThis is gonna be okay because you're going to have autonomy and Hong Kong we're going to be the shining example that leads you people Taiwan back to the Chinese and\nIt's not working out that way Hong Kong is now the negative example for Taiwan is the example for people in Taiwan and say look we don't want any part of this look with these Chinese did to Hong Kong\nMark I tell a story there people waiting to board the aircraft Ted Kennedy and nowhere to go to Asia right now so they're listening to us All right I tell the story an anecdote no names of a young man who does business in China and I asked him about the security concerns we see the reported in the newspapers all the time\nA Chinese cyber theft\nUh also minders when you arrive in China and the mainland China not Holcomb mainland China\nAnd uh the secure the iPhone and stuffed cure anywhere really unless you turn it off and maybe not even that he told me that when he does business in China which is not infrequently he leaves all of his electronics in America\nAnd when he arrived from the mainland nice aware that there are a minder they're no where he is he has face to face meetings and they exchanged thoughts and then he leaves the country now she has a particular technology I won't name it but it's highly highly sought after around the world\nThat is a story that I Would expect to find in a thriller as I get on the airplane as I'm sure people are reading thrillers before they fall asleep\nBut I tell the story to those lines of Newark and at a JFK because I think something has changed I don't think that was true ten years ago when Gordon and I started talking there's a level of surveillance and now suggest violence is close\nWell there's certainly a level of surveillance that would um I'm pretty much any foreign business person going to China to leave their electronics and home you're absolutely right and most and anybody who knows what they're doing doesn't bring their phones and trying\nAnd without our electronics without being able to travel to China as a a capitalist you have already exceeded to the power of the anaconda you've already surrendered some of your freedom well\nOr looked at another way China's surveillance state is at war with its attempts its own attempts to develop a more modern economy China's largely I'm buying\nBorrowing begging stealing technology and a lot of hard work pretty much caught up in his pretty close to the technology frontier but how are they going to get farther if their own people can't talk can't trust each other can't do we chat which is like what's up I'm\nAnd are um you know under a state of surveillance and can't thing can talk freely I mean it's this is really China's dilemma\nYou know and this is going to be important because obviously control of technology artificial intelligence quantum commuting\nComputing quantum communications fired gee wireless biotechnology

be over ... a businessman turn tell all ... who knows but the point is that China has done something to black and its own reputation\nAnd this is something that's going to take a very long time for the Communist Party to recover from if it ever recovers from it and essentially we're looking at um probably intense political struggle at the top of Beijing because something like this wouldn't

and I could say that in Britain I Want to extend this to the ... does China have a response to that are are they just turning their backs and waiting for it to pass good morning to\nGet even ... I Am actually I don't think China does have a a a response China has got used to effect and way of dealing and many of those headlines of course just reflect what China's to some extent being getting away with for a long time are we there spying that industrial espionage\nWe know about currency manipulation and took control of markets on free markets on trust or the markets\nAnd we know that there's a ... it's just not there so these are all issues that we're the we're we're in a way to be in scouting it are in China now there's been a change of ah you know focus and Washington\nAnd elsewhere and even in the ... even the German than I realized that hey China is not our friend it's not our partner\nTo be much more circumspect and I don't think China has a response primarily because think about what's happening here you're basically asking to China to basically do have a different model from the past twenty or Thirty years and it just ... ready for that that doesn't know how to respond Iran challenged\nYeah I think you're right freezer because what we're seeing is you know confusion on the part of Beijing you know for decades they've been able to get their way they've been able to you know smile and if that doesn't work they'd been bullying they've been been intimidating they almost always gotten what they want\nNow they've run into somebody called Donald John Trump and it's not working for them and I don't think that they know how to deal not only with Trump but also as you say with the English with the Germans with everybody else\nThis is a real moment as time where the world to bits and adopts a new policy in Beijing has yet to figure out how to deal with this\nI think that's right because there isn't a simple well Trump has made a big play for the deficit and not solving things started the depth of too big that's one major and I would argue pay per manager of the overall relationship between China but even if China just starts buying more stuff from the states where there's more oil or you know I energy or if it's grains or whatever I\nFundamentally doesn't solve the problem off and on level playing field when it comes to China it's certainly doesn't solve the problems with the political problems in China you know and and China clearly it's if it's not panic it's clearly a flailing around and you look at this Interpol chief\nThat the Chinese ... that only two years ago and yet here he is being disappeared in China and he's under investigation for corruption so much for the anti corruption campaign ... position and Interpol two years ago in the first place\nIf wherever you look at China that that math\nYeah and and when this this whole thing about currency manipulation it\nIs endlessly fascinating for decades China yes did manipulated currency in other words they drove the value of the room and be down in order to gain a treaty advantage for their exporters\nThis year of course the remedy is falling precipitously against the dollar and other currencies but it's not because of Chinese currency manipulation as we define that term it's because the Chinese themselves don't want to hold their own currency\nSo they've been actually supporting the ... and that's the opposite of currency manipulation\nAnd that just shows the fragility of the Chinese system and I think we're going to see other symptoms of that for Jodi in the economy in Beijing has got to deal with that in a hostile environment because countries like the U.S are not trying to support China anymore\nFraser I went to press you we spoke with mark Clifford our colleagues about Hong Kong and how it's regarding these\nTroubled moments how is Singapore dealing with this disorder in on the mainland China because Singapore is a prosperous community and not not a small amount of it depends upon the success of China\nNot just China but just global trade you know it so I looked at my window and see the harbor from the office here you don't\nBuy reasons are shipped to go through Singapore sports on on a on a weekly basis in the hundreds of ... of the containers um and so the global trade is very important to them that obviously concerned about trade wars\nThat obviously concerned about China and climbed on there to depend on Chinese to to as well but they're all from the sidelines that clearly nowhere near the thick of it and the way the Hong Kong as but a lot of people in an age are white because they simply don't know how that shakes hiked\nAnd of course there are there and what he does well is because many of the complaints against China they know to be true\nThis is ultimately you know it's not calling China's ... anything it's calling the ... and saying look stop bullying the kids\nWere not going to take it any longer things have got to change and so that it's changed coming and no one ... and how that comes is it going to be an inclusive change where we can all still continue to grow but on a federal level they're going to be at retrograde change where you know China becomes more inflated in global trade suffers I never want to become a somewhat isolationist we don't know yet\nYeah Fraser I don't know if you went to the ... conference in Singapore which I think just wrapped up but Ian Bremmer of Eurasia Group the risk consultancy said\nLook the world is changing and we just don't know where this is going and what you just talked about in terms of uncertainty I think is a theme that you hear around the world that we just don't know how all of this is going to shake out because we're seeing policies in Washington and other capitals that we have not recognize we haven't seen him for decades\n\nI I think that's right and I I remember even at a number of months ago being interviewed and asked about you know impact for the trade war and I said that the trouble is that ... there's literally no one alive today who knows what a trade war looks like\nBecause sadly anybody in the business field\nHas been working over the past you know decades off get eight to ... get eight or trade globalization\nGina Powell as I understand it I had served in the number to post at the national Security Council under a general McMaster when he was a national security advisor very close to ... you will recall that the president then\nDispatched with the general McMaster and replaced him with John Bolton the one of the big reasons why Trump replaced Mick pastor\nTwofold actually one personally they didn't have much chemistry they just didn't get on but the other reason is at McMaster as accomplished as he was an is\nMick master in many ways was deep state neck master was established amid this McMaster was off brand to Donald Trump\nAnd well he shared a lot of the president a policy inclination he worked against him and a lot of ways because he still cared what the establishment thought\nAnd thought to preserve establishment influence uh out the NFC and brought in a lot of foreign policy establishment types that were working often at cross purposes with the president and his immediate team\nOn major issues like ending the Iran nuclear deal getting out of the Paris climate accord confronting China on their currency manipulation and the the trade deficit renegotiating NAFTA and so on\nSo there were just too many problems in the master relationship it wouldn't make master\nWas fired or let go a dean of how old is deputy will also chose to to leave because she didn't want to work after John Bolton that not all of that's understandable I think that\nUh the president's daughter Yvonne coach who's very influential\nProbably suggested to the president that it would be wise after the Kavanaugh hearings to replace a woman with a woman and maybe that argument has a has some traction with the president he might understand the politics in those terms but I think\nDean of cold herself as accomplished as she is is off brand for the president\nAnd setting aside the gender issue here and looking at looking at the equation as we really need to rip fleas Nikki Haley was someone who will continue making the progress\nThat she's made at the un I think Rick written elevate far far better choice to lead Grinnell it's like an extension of President Trump he is fearless he is anti establishment\nA by the way he would be the first openly gay uh a UN ambassador a which would be sending a real signal to the rest of the world wouldn't it\nOut and Cornell is a world class diplomat he's spent many years at the United nations under five us un ambassadors\nA nominated by president of both parties Brock Obama George W. Bush and so on so he's got a wealth of experience he knows the institution better than anyone I've ever seen and he knows diplomacy\nOf the problem I think John is that in some ways ... victim of its own success\nHe has been a tremendous US ambassador in Germany he's essentially one of the few us ambassadors on the continent who actually know what they're doing and he has had tremendous success in leaning on German corporations major ones like Siemens and Dinah Miller\nStop doing business with Iran\nIn the face of new sanctions on the Iranian regime and the withdrawal of us from the Iranian nuclear deal\nHe has to hit the ground running he doesn't waste any time he picks up the phone it talks to the CEO's these companies himself he does all of that the hard work and I think the president like having him there I mean the word is that the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a little afraid of Rick which is I think the president\nThat that might be a little loads to remove him from the center of Europe and bring him to New York at the un\nBut my feeling is that he should because I think given all the success he had in Europe he could have even more fitting in Turtle Bay confronting all of our enemies and dealing with our our allies on a more regular\nPost covenant Monica we have to we must anticipate that this is a conversion consent post and that the Senate were way and and that very loud voices\nUm voices we heard during the cabinet unhappiness will speak again there are several senators running for president others raising money in these last days now this process wouldn't happen until after the election but in any event that's an opportunity again to raise your profile for the Democratic primaries\nThat begin pretty much the competition begins right away and twenty Nineteen and the speeches in Iowa so I Know that MSNBC and the red ...\nCorrespondent for MSNBC Andrea Mitchell has already declared Grinnell very controversial talk for unacceptable because the explanation he offended and the angle America all that that translation he's not a one of us okay far\nNo that's the recommendation but it's also warning Monica didn't Mr Grinnell went through a rough process to get to Germany didn't it was a long way and now long way\nThanks to the Democrats Chuck Schumer\nAnd now they're rearm so does I mean it just Grinnell want to face that pummeling again after ...\nAbsolutely he would uh work as a as a friend of mine and he is absolutely fearless and the recommendation that he makes on Glenn Merkel nervous is a good thing and the president signs he loves Rick\nBecause he's a fighter um I also think you know\nThe assumption that Tina Peng which set sail through it's also a big assumption I mean we don't know what are there and after the Kavanaugh situation I think anybody that the president put up for a major nomination it's going to have to go through the ringer\nTo the question is who is willing to take this on who is willing to fight back I mean I think either one of them would be up for the fight but I think if you were looking for major major appointments\nIn the cabinet at the un who are extensions of their president and his populist revolution then I think the choice it's obvious that it's ripped Grinnell\nJohn Bolton a longtime colleague of ours and I miss him I measure John Bolton but you're in the national security advisor and you're [laughter] you're not permitted to talk freely John Bolton the fed to favor Richard Grinnell rich Rick Cornell is that is that's sensible the Monica that the national security advisor wants to have a\nA a voice in choosing the ambassador to the United nations\nYes of course in recall that John Bolton served as the U.S ambassador to the un he knows the institution very well\nAfter being humbled by the Democratic Senate led by Joe Biden yes I Do recall\nThat yes and remember that President Bush had to a point there during recess made a recess appointment because Bolton was does so controversial and the Democrats may dislike for hell\nI remembered that were bulletin was only there for a limited period I think it was a year\nMaybe because it was a recess appointment and so boat and made tremendous progress there but\nHe couldn't he didn't have enough time to actually start to reform the institution which I Know is really heavy lifting it's turning around a battleship in the middle east the ocean but Nikki Haley made tremendous progress in that direction\nAlthough with regard to Iran North Korea\nYou want somebody to succeed her will continue the boat and Haley legacy of confronting our enemies are dealing with our allies and trying to reform the corruption at the un well standing for U.S interests in ideal I think the again the obvious choices wreck\nMonica Crowley London Center for policy research I'm John\nBachelor this is John ...

Year's eve and New Year's day courting twenty ... we will make the first ever close up flyby of corporate belt object and we're going to revolutionize our knowledge what we know about it\nWhat about the dangers yes the risk out there is it crowded\nIs not crowded or the quicker built this fast in fact that the surface area of the corporate belt is larger by a factor of several than all this space from the sun out to the planet Neptune and so even though the Clipper built this teeny with small bodies was small but\nThey are individually separated\nBut great distances and so there is no significant risk to the spacecraft in crossing the Quaker belt which will be doing all the way out in the end of the twenty twenties as a matter of fact because the corporate logos twice as far out as we are now almost\nBut there there may be dangers\nAt the fly by because if both to lead has large numbers of moons or rings or other structures we don't want to fly through those because our speed is so great we're traveling thirty two thousand miles per hour that almost ten miles per second\nAnd striking anything even the size of a rice pellet\nCould treads the spacecraft so as we approach ultima we're using the on board cameras in radio and pictures back to look for moons rains other hazards\nIf we find them in our path will fire the engines and divert to a safer close approach distance or in order to make sure that everything goes well\nDavid\nUm you're you're flying by at this huge speed how long do you stay getting pictures of ultimate too late or is it so quick that you you you don't spend much time getting pictures or how has that determined\nWell that's a great question you probably remember as we were on a ... approach to to do that we started getting pictures that were better than what the Hubble Space telescope to deliver a couple of months out and that's because ... is the size of a continent like\nThe size of the United states uh but ultimately is very much smaller it's about the size of Chesapeake Bay and\nIn in on the eastern seaboard and so although or cameras can currently see it it's just a thought in the distance we're still Seventy million miles away we're closing it's almost a million miles a day but\nWe'll only resolve it and be able to get high resolution pictures and images and other data types only in the last day before the fly by then the day of the fly by\nAnd we only get one shot at that if it doesn't go well on those two days or will come up with half a low for no Los at all\nSo we're planning very carefully and testing all the fly by plans to make sure that this\nVery high speed flyby of this small but scientifically valuable target at the frontier of our solar system is successful\nWe're we're we're looking towards ultimate to lay but we have some hints about what you're heading towards and over the last year I Believe this summer and the summer before teams went to a remote places on earth Argentina South Africa ... uh Africa\nOr to view of the object using a method\nCalled transit the transit system how did they do this Alan and what did they learn about ultimate tool using the transit says\nWell this is a type of transit it's called a stellar occupation and which are we predict mathematically we're on the earth multiple will make a stars week out as it passes in front of and then we position telescopes in ... the expected shadow path\nOf ultimate and from timing how long\nThe sar weeks out we can determine\nSize of ultimate too late and by doing that at a whole series of places in the shadow we can map out its silhouette it shape\nAnd that's important because Bolton is so small\nAnd so far away that even the Hubble Space telescope can't resolve it it's just to point to flight\nThis is the only technique that allows us to determine the size and shape a and we were successful at that uh one of our teams on New Horizons are our ground based astronomy team led by Dr Marc booty\nDeployed over ... astronomers with\nTwo dozen telescopes to Argentina in the summer of forty seven and then again to Senegal\nIn Northern Africa this summer and in both cases or they were able to get in the shadow path watch it wink out a with a\nOne or more telescopes and as a result we are pretty good deed on the size of this thing is I said it's about the size the Chesapeake Bay ab ... miles across we have a pretty good indication of its reflectivity as a result of this because\nWe can combine its brightness in size to calculate how reflective surfaces\nAnd it turns out it's quite dark it's about as

I'm basically I'm delivering one third of all it is against them at most important that\nI recently our state oil company has expressed interest in I'm participating in ... so far\nOnly five percent of all guinea has been gathered fight sell a so called is covered that looking into possibilities of a um a disability study to check out what the possibilities are for either by just participation in this project\nAnd in fact uh what is even more important I Would say is ... role as a transit not only as an end user us as a consumer of Azerbaijan a gas but as an important trends that top employing all the Balkan Peninsula because\nI'm next to it is Serbia is um Macedonia feather it's a um um then Montenegro and other countries that are a kid interested in Azerbaijan a guest to be able to diversify their gas for polio\nAnd will be coming to Europe the sort of get to go get it with our own volume's\nAt a competitive price and vote\nIt will benefit not only as the user and consumer of this gas but also as a country that with recede fantasies yes\nLet me let me recover for those of us who are not living with a map Bulgaria is on the black sea bass in its borders Romania\nMacedonia Serbia but oh yeah it is a green and turkey right and the southern ... the southern guy slide and there's a court order is now under construction starts in the Caspian Sea at Azerbaijan passes through the ... through Georgia\nAnd then crosses through turkey or and through turkey it must chip Bulgaria that's why I'm Talking to the ambassador these that's the interconnected part but after Bulgaria the possibilities are mud many\nFirst of all the possibilities to go through Greece across the ... under the Iranians see to Italy and southern Europe but you're also saying that these guys can connect to the Balkans and slow in Eastern Europe as well because I understand that so it can go in many directions from Bulgaria\nYeah absolutely and in fact the southern gas cornered or that we've been talking about is um the one that stretches up\nFrom the Caspian Sea is a right to mention across a ... and turkey but then a firm turned up it turns into top\nUh from turkey to Greece obey any entity but uh we the connector I'm Talking about is a new one it is that it is not being built yet and they sent their connector connects Greece from basically tap Greece to Bulgaria\nThat is very project is a key\nOne because they support and not only as I said full Bulgaria now as such but for the entire region because it increases predictability a supply and it provides additional opportunities for for a wider um because he ... to benefit from this resources\nAnd Bulgaria needs energy to grow all countries need energy to grow and it's not\nObvious where they're going to gain that except from well there are competitors ... there's Russian gas and there's a Caspian Sea gas and it's good to have multiple choices so this relationship the strategic relationship between Bulgaria\nAnd as far as young makes sense for energy what about the military cooperation how does that work about um about senator\nWell as far as the military partnership is concerned ... is an important NATO\nMember and does it by John is a a one of the key partners and our geography for NATO's partnership for peace program that's why we are all very much closely cooperating global video within NATO bilateral and of course within NATO given different training smell every\nUm cooperation and recently we hosted a huge exhibition in Azerbaijan that's another trip fair the biggest in the region and it drew two hundred and twenty four companies complain to nine countries\nUh it's called eight it's odd X. two thousand eighty then we'll get in a minister of defense was also there with the big teams so we're looking at different opportunities and possibilities to work in this field because we as the country we\nAre very much proud to be able to uh be the most reliable and secure a neighbor a predictable neighbor or not only for our immediate neighbors but also when they talk about why did like the region in fact it does include as it got to such\nGood evening John thanks so much for having me on well I Do think Nineteen eighty two is a fascinating year to go back and look at first of all we had a Republican president\nWho was facing his first midterm which is obviously where we are in today's world and twenty teens but what is also interesting\nAbout that year is that it is in fact the same group of Senate seats that\nWere up that year that are also up this year so when we go back and we know that every senator served six years in the Senate when we actually go back thirty six years\nFrom this year we get to Nineteen eighty two so this is the same classes of senators that are standing for election we also had essentially a new president who\nThe country wasn't really certain about in fact his approval rating within the low forties that range between about forty one forty two percent\nAnd what you ended up having was a year where the president's party a lost twenty six seats in the house but they picked up one seat in the Senate\nAnd losing in the house the house did not change hands as I recall the ... the Democrats were comfortably in control but that those twenty six seats gave the Democrats decided advantage as you were going into eighty four\nThat's exactly right so what we're really talking about here is that the Democrats were already in control but with Reagan's when in Nineteen eighty he had had some coat tails and had brought 'em some Republicans with him\nYou saw the Republican I'm conference shrink um shrink by twenty six seats after eighty two and that made it really in some ways the reason why Ronald Reagan had to start working\nWith Tip O'Neill was because it forced them to find those compromises because he just didn't have enough\nOf even a minority and Congress to do a lot\nWith or I'd four weeks ago were doing political science here on the midterm uh twenty Eighteen someday forty years hence someone will have this conversation about twenty Eighteen C. C. right they're fine\nWe're going to divide it into pieces the house that we've been addressing right now in the Senate post capital because that looks to be the event of the moment although the hurricane surrounding us and that could change the vote in significant states like Florida and Georgia\nOh Laura in the house of representatives right now I have not seen and I have not heard from conversations any significant change in the house races that are most at issue which would be the suburban districts\nWhere the district went from Mrs Clinton over over Donald Trump but it has a Republican representative at this moment have you seen a cabinet change in those districts\nNo I think if anything what we're seeing is that sort of more of those college educated white women in the suburbs um I think\nThe cabinet situation help them make up their mind and mostly help them make up their mind against the Republican Party\nUm if you look at some of the ...\nAligned data what has been most fascinating to me and the recent poll is it it appears as though the to swing groups now in the actual electorate are I'm\nCollege educated white men they are now split essentially um I think the last poll I saw said forty nine forty nine between the two parties in terms of which party they favor and\nI'm white blue collar women um who are still leaning Republican I'm forty nine to forty five but are much closer than they were when Trump was elected in\nTwenty sixteen so what we have right now is that the white college educated women have moved more decisively into the Democratic camp the um blue collar\nWhite men are decisively in the Republican camp but there I'm sort of spouses and mates and friends are not\nNow we go to the numbers that I had over the last week I've had twenty three losses which is the best case for the Republicans and thirty three losses which would give control to Nancy Pelosi do you see anything in that range Laura from your information\nWell I Do think we're probably starting up more toward the thirty five or I'm forty seats and the reason why I say that is right now if you look at the cook Political Report they've already raided Fifteen Republican held seats\nAs leaning democratic or the likely democratic\nSo if you're already starting with Fifteen before you even move\nTo the twenty nine tossup seats then\nIt it starts to become pretty easy to get above thirty because if you just assume that out of the twenty nine tossup seats fourteen or Fifteen in other words half of those are going to go democratic and then you add them to the Fifteen that are already there you're already it's thirty and that doesn't even include\nThe twenty five Republican held seat that are leaning Republican but are certainly I'm more up for grabs\nSo I I Do think one of the things that makes this different than Nineteen eighty two is that our um parties and our country has sorted more and the polarization is much more real\nAnd it's also true that Republicans hold many more seats than they held in\nNineteen eighty two and that in and of itself makes them more vulnerable\nAnd the ... I Want to go to the police that I was just going to say it\nSo I imagine what you're looking at is something more like thirty five forty seats rather than twenty six\nIn the Senate much more difficult post Kevin we hear stories the momentum I certainly see the test or is a toss up\nUh the strength was clear when you saw a mansion vote for a for Kavanaugh that secures him in West Virginia\nMcCaskill and the high camp became under question but the places that I'm paying attention to our Tennessee where we've seen good numbers for black burning these last days and Florida where we've seen good numbers for Nelson\nSo right now in Nineteen eighty to the Republicans picked up one seat is that credible for you pick up of one the with the numbers we're seeing now\nI wouldn't be surprised if it ends up being a plus two or maybe even a plus three but a lot of and that would be a net gain um because a lot of that ends up being how do those two open seats\nReally do land I don't know that we have an understanding of which way Arizona's going or which way Tennessee it's going I think there's also kind of the wild card about Texas um\nJust because they said or has been such a strong candidate he has raised 'em as much if not more money than I'm Ted Cruz at this point and I do think\nThat there is some difficulty for Senator Ted Cruz in turning out\nTrump supporters because of the

daredevil piloting the greatest prison break and re more than a Nineteen eighty we will begin with a gathering of eagles and the fall\nOf Nineteen Seventy but they are restless there are many characters here who have made escape attempts over the over time they have skill sets but they've been individuals escaping we're about to see the construction of a mass escape that will be recognizable to\nNeal blockade and block be they're looking for a way out and they see in the springtime and in the summertime and through the end of the fall before winter closes there's a rice field or near a block be how is it that they come to decide on a tunnel from block be\nWell they they attempted many ways out they as soon as they got into the camping in the fall Nineteen Seventeen they record it and try to figure out a way that numerous attempts to get out jumping fences break into walls nothing works\nRiding out in the garbage bin ...\nUm you know any number of uh of perplexing attack and they ultimately decide that a tunnel is really the only way to get out from underneath a these three series of of of walls and so they begin um but first they need a place to start the tunnel\nAnd in block be uh there were some stairwells that went down to the sellers and there was a partition wall that sort of blocked out underneath the stairwell\nArguably so that prisoners couldn't jump out of the guards coming down the steps but what it became was this perfect entry point a hidden underneath the stairwell where they could start a total through the wall and then to the closest the field\nThe officers are taking the tunnel but there are um soldiers allied soldiers president who are orderly who are treated as servants are Batman and the Germans do not regard them as suspicious so our officers masquerade is as orderly says that how they get X. it is because black\nBe is basically a divided into an officer section in an orderly section and this there was a new orderly section so they need to recruit some orderly to help them provide uniforms\nAnd then the officers a change in a room walk across the yard go into the orderly quarters go down the steps go through this fake wall that they engineer a to tap opened and closed at a seamlessly so it couldn't be discovered to begin the tongue\nYes and they see the rice fields and they know that as they begin in December this concept of tunneling\nThey're going to need to get all out there and they estimate the number of yards any forty fifty yards to the rye field so the rye won't be back till springtime so it's time to dig but before we did they also recruited people from the camp\nHave down my list here let her boys sanitary and that the tide ms and Curt growl from India let's talk about letter boy who was he\nA letter boy was was one of the individual in the Myers office uh and so was able to provide\nVarious schedules guard rotation for the most part of course um these guards ... such a tired and such a poor that even his guards hit him I mean that the joke around camp was it even ... dog could not stand them\nI'm Joe the guards were sort of more open to helping the prisoners if the bribes were right\nAnd that's led her boy sanitary man was not was a civilian and they they persuaded him with presents because they're getting a a parcels all the time though the parcels were robbed by the Germans or the typist um we don't know her name but how is it that they recruited her\nThey regretted her a thanks you very handsome Australian pilot and they'd beat her line or a\nHorrible horrible or Australia to listeners that this cyber leaning forward yes yes blow it's exactly what you think he was a very tall very has some bad who'd lost sixty pounds since he's been captured\nYeah so I mean there are conditions like the camp but comedy of new Myra was was essentially running a starvation rations and and the men were being um support it almost fully by what was being sent to non front\nRight their breakfast was bitter coffee usually the correct that it acorns and acorns are and so they recruit people from the cap they have the order ladies who cannot escape with them because of the order of least they're caught there'll be ...\nCorrect I mean if you were an orderly and you were caught escaping I it was it was in many ways a death sentence because you would then be sent to a coal miner assault minor other other work camp a that was very brutal uh and the life expectancy life expectancy at those camps is sometimes worse than the front\nRats foreign is overall commander at this period a gray and ... kind of hard and Blaine or participate in the original tunnel or so I think uh they're just the two of the original towers that are left because they're always transferring people out of ultimate and sometimes to exchange them in Holland sometimes just to take them to other camps\nCorrect them into the originator their tunnel was actually a a Canadian officer named ... on a who was a six foot six feet tall um and just a monster of an individual I Can't imagine him trying to do this tunnel which was so small that you could barely even raise yourself up on your elbows right\nNow everybody has a feeling of claustrophobia and every time I watch\nThe great escape I have that feeling there was a wonderful twilight zone episode was about a tunnel where that meant got stuck in the title and that was the scary and nobody knew how to get him out that's about to happen they start to tunnel and what you said Eighteen by fourteen an oval shaped\nYes an oval shaped tunnel I'm Eighteen by sixteen inches yeah\nAnd they're digging with what what are their till they're\nDigging with whatever they can get their hands on and initially it was spoons and knives that they had a taken from the uh the cook house ah sometimes it was the ends of the bed dance they eventually got a trial or to help themselves day but they were digging no more than a foot a day\nYeah January February and march they're digging is ... the ground is not freeze how deep down or they were\nThere down a over ten feet on the ground so they can you hear people above they could in in the early stages of the tunnel they could they could feel that almost feels and hear the way to the German guards are passing underneath overhead them on ... and then began to place a centuries posted\nAround the camp which essentially was right on top of where they hope to come out\nWhich then led to them needing to go sixty yard to that Ruy field which was a much tougher tunnel ...\nFour hour shifts and the way they transferred was through the addict of blocked be and down the stairs or you would work in shifts than there would be a bigger and then they constructed bellows why\nWell I mean once once the tunnel was was roughly a twenty twenty five yards long the air began to get very stale down there again it's a very small tunnel uh they're digging they have a single candle and they found themselves losing our consciousness as they were digging\nRun when they handle faded they were in trouble\nExactly sort of the canary in the gold in in the mind and so they constructed this bellows out of a ... jacket\nUm that they tied up and and they would inflated and one man's job was to provide oxygen one was digging\nThe third but sort of look out and the ones who are hauling the dirt out at the tunnel it's and they would embrace it with ... with what they were bracing with bed dance um because they needed a way in the beginning um the tunnel began to collapse in on itself and
