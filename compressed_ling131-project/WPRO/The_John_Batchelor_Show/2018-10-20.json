joined minded grist for changing gears Saturday some sort of warfare right here on WNPR road show\n\nI'm John ... this is the John ... show this is a scholar report with my colleague Chris ... who is this is the whole of gala\nGala is a worldwide information company it does it in through digital signs\nVery large and very small digital signs for information but that leads us to the question of global information flow and what creates conditions\nFor prosperity or retreat from prosperity where the moment now where the Financial Times is is debating what the next recession will look like a very good evening to you Chris before we got into the next recession\nLet us just got something that has you you've made available to me and I'm fascinated with the global competitive miss report of twenty Eighteen this is from the world Economic Forum some of its conventional wisdom but some of it identifies the tools that\nProsperous economy use in order to compete with their neighbors and also those same tools can be used by less prosperous countries\nOr to get ahead or what is your general reaction to this competitive it's a report given that your in the world of business right now it just this speak to the facts on the ground good evening to you Chris\n[noise] but good evening John I think the report does an excellent job of really showing that as\nThe economies around the world continue to move into what could be called the fourth industrial revolution which is technology sensors artificial intelligence\nAll of the really cool things that the tech revolutions of last twenty thirty forty years have yielded that for governments for economy has to be successful\nThe the growth within those markets within those countries has to do with fostering the right environment fostering the creative class within those environments\nIn key things the enabling environment the market ability to succeed or fail the human capital the innovation environments within in that the advantages that\nCertain countries have had a over the last several years economically low cost labor or low cost factories are others are now really being trumped by the\nCulture in the environments that are available at some of the most competitive a economies where you have the most uh centric environments for information technology workers innovation risk taking and it's really building that right petri dish to create the right conditions that's helping the economy six eight\nI'm struck by the fact that this is not a zero sum game that candidate and the United states exist ... co exist comfortably on the same land mass and both do very well in competitiveness and that's the same for Western Europe so there's no reason to beg or your neighbor here in order to be prosperous\n... absolutely you you can have success where\nAll boats or the rising tide lifts all boats if you go to the old amount Susie an argument that uh you get to a population in the world to no longer sustain or an energy consumption level at the world can no longer sustain it never took into account technology\nAnd the evolution of technology being able to provide prosperity such at your Serbia consumer certainly consumers demand and that can open up a\nLimitless possibilities from an economic perspective in from a societal benefit perspective where it's not a wins and be loses both a and B can win and went together\nTo relieve everybody's anxieties the U.S does very well OK fucked good we're very we're very good at it but what do we learn what are we good at and why and there are plenty of room for improvement here so\nI go to the questions that the competitiveness uh documents asks towards a closed for all of us to debate these don't have answers these are observations and\nTheir anecdotal and therefore of them and we'll go through them as best we can is there a formula for innovation or can you plug it in\nA do institutions matter\nA is prosperity\nPossible alongside people and the planets or do we have to ruin the environment and turn people into Web sites and finally\nShould countries pursue openness or do you is control of markets command economy the way forward there you can immediately think of anecdotes so I'll ask you Chris because you travel so widely is there a formula now having read the competitive as\nA survey is there one formula that works in their ... pillars here are indeed the administrative security or is there any combination that you've found magic\n[laughter] I think the biggest thing that we see and we do business in the tech world within twenty eight countries around the globe and have developers and twenty countries around the globe those environments that are free open\nAn open means open to succeed or open to fail but to create an educated populace that free to innovate and risk take the more that of society can\nReward or enable benefit for risk takers the more people will take those risks the more that there is freedom for innovation less central planning less government\nIntervention the freer the better and technology is is one of those pursuit that you really want to be able to say I have an idea have the ability to chase that with smart people unless enough capital to pursue that and having the environment the best thing that government can do tend\nTo create the conditions for success but governments can't mandate success when it comes to attack when it comes to that interaction between ... and consumers\nI'm struck by a little detail here that Korea South Korea and Japan are ... because of what the report identifies as a hesitant as a hesitation built on they don't like uncertainty and R and D is all about uncertainty and trying and failing the certainly that\nThat describes our our our wizards the last hundred years I can you measure and can you think of another country to other countries that are prosperous and the top twenty who are hesitant about uncertainty Chris\nI think the greatest one that we would say is you see some of the hesitancy in Western Europe France as an example failure can be a real challenge their society ... as well as from a government perspective not only the the disregard or dislike for failure but the\nPunitive penalties for success in an environment like France if your going into attacking you have an entrepreneurial bent the first thing that you plot is how do you exit France because God Forbid you should be successful\nThe government is not your partner the government is you're over lord of the taxation level and you have an incentive not to be successful in the economy is like that where the taxes are truly confessed BitTorrent\nInstitutions a weak institutions a do or not successful for competitiveness but I'm struck by worldwide were really good at security Chris did you see that were really really good at it we we do guns well we just don't do open transparency at all\n... ...\nAs you look at tech and what it does to open markets there are in in the news cycles that you see on your show every night there it's a very very difficult now to hide things or to obstruct things from the populist and tech continues to be that open wave for good or for bad that it\nMake certain that good don't come into America from the outside and also people from other countries don't come into America from the outside immigration under control H. one B. visas more difficult to obtain John I'm very good evening to you you begin with the anecdote\nOf the people who put together air conditioners once upon a time Willis Carrier nights you know to and you connect that to a Wall Street journal op ed that ran most recently by Richard Florida and he and a half away\nAnd these two don't exist together job there is there is a conflict here the carrier conflict on one hand the great success and the wall Street Journal's recommendation that the U.S has to double down on innovation how do they not go together good evening to Joe\nHey John they don't go together because you think about ... carrier he\nDeveloped the air conditioner carrier corps was based in Syracuse New York [noise] but it was as though it was based in Florida simply because the advent of the air conditioner\nLed to people moving down south in droves they could suddenly live and work in a place that was historically uncomfortable to live and work in\nAnd we all know what it's like to go without air conditioning to work to be in hot humid weather for extended periods it saps her energy and strengthen she think about the air conditioner quite literally made the world much more productive and so this is the genius of free trade when markets are open\nIt's as though innovations are taking place next store\nEven though they happened on the other side of the world I don't care where the air conditioner was created I just want access to it so it makes me better off this runs counter to Florida and in ... Richard Florida in ... essay they say that if the U.S doesn't maintains technological edge\nAre living standards won't go down if the other world ... the rest of the world laps us no no no no no no we have lower living standards precisely because\nPeople aren't as innovative and other parts of\nThe world that also suggest John as you said before it presumes that we won't go and get the best technology wherever it comes from or the best or the best equipment or wherever it comes from\nWe're not close minded about what we can buy their hands are long standing example of Home Depot [laughter] which is as good as from everywhere and innovation from everywhere\nSo this idea that we're just going to buy buy at home and invested home and the educated home is this is this an expansion of the protectionism talk we've had for two years John is that what's going on\nIt is but what's interesting is I don't you know he and a half away comes from Brookings Richard Florida comes from academe the University of Toronto\nI don't think they realize\nJust how protectionist their argument is but in fact it's protectionist\nThey argue that if other parts of the world they argue that the U.S faces an assault of innovation from other parts of the world they haven't ruined they haven't wrapped Chinese standards of living they've improved it and so what's exciting to me is to think\nAs the rest of the world liberalize as people around the world start um we're pursuing innovation too\nI think about all the Willis carriers that exist in China that are no longer being having their talent suffocated such to think about the future of American living standards if the Chinese grow we are going to have living standards in the U.S that will that will stagger S. for Howard Vance they are\nOr you give a wonderful example of the man who is who was Steve Jobs as father Steve Jobs is no longer with us he came from Syria Steve grow up without knowledge of him but in any event he came from Syria what if he stayed in Syria what would we be today John\nWell if he had stayed in Syria Steve Jobs father stays there there's never an apple it's no mistake that Steve Jobs was able to create apple in the United states the United states doesn't have a technological\nDid you what it has a freedom edge\nTalented ambitious people keep coming to the United states because free people can prosper it's people who drive progress not countries if the if the U.S had a technological edge then\nEast Paolo Alto it'd be as prosperous is Paolo Alto no which the individuals in Palo Alto the prosper prospering in run route twenty eight in Austin, Texas\nAnd so what matters here is that we remained open to the world's drivers because if they get to the United states\nThey have the chance to innovate\nLooked at from the rest of the world\nOur living standards are lower precisely because countries around the world have been suffocating talent forever let's hope the opposite happens what Richard Florida and he had halfway want we want China to thrive we want India's thrive we want France to thrive we want them to create their own Microsoft is if they do\nThink about how will live here the equivalent of what our businesses have done for the world for decades\nA detailed chart and I've had conversations with my colleagues the last day about boosters about investing in ... commercial companies that sell or make available boosters for lifting small satellites into orbit commercials small satellites up a great big communications million dollar outfits but\nA dedicated for mining purposes or population purposes or or um ... the weather and those companies are are growing here like mushrooms\nThat the striking thing is the Europeans have noticed and our puzzle how they can catch up the Europeans have only encouraged investment in space launch system's ... boosters with European space agency big space like our NASA\nThey have not made it available because their markets are ... heavily regulated they have not made it available to build companies that can build rockets and\nSell their I sell access to them do other commercial enterprises Europeans notice the difference I I use this as an example of how our innovation leads the world they're going to try to catch up to us good for them but our innovation is an envy for even our best Salah\nIt without question and think about what it means okay so the the us will be in the lead in space but if markets are open and free advances that take place in the U.S will lift up\nInnovation around the world the foreigners will be able to buy what we produced a no one creates things so that they can sell it to small market any any innovator wants to sell it to the world and so if the if Americans achieving in at harnessing something Berlin from space\nThe rest of the world will benefit and just the same\nIf towel to people from around the world achieve in five gee are driverless cars we in the United states will benefit as though it happen next door to us\nThe important thing is that people are free and the trading laser free after that the where of innovation doesn't matter what's what only matters is that the innovation happens\nJohn ... his most recent book is\nThe end of work he's also the author of who needs the fed riding it Rick Flair markets on John bachelor this has been the

Cape Cod and that was a catastrophe September fifteenth twenty Eighteen a shark attack off Cape Cod\nThe second uh I have a profound worry but not Marshall a young man attacked off the California coast a south of Long Beach and I go now to someone who can help me understand these two attacks on two coasts\nAnd why there might be a changing pattern in great white shark attacks on people this is Chris Lowe ducks Chris Lowe he's director of the shark lab at California State University at Long Beach\nChris a very good evening to you and thank you for this these two attacks ICU commenting in both cases one in California and one in a Cape Cod so let's start with the mortal attack in Cape Cod nine Fifteen Eighteen they closed the beach accordingly\nBut why was a great white shark so close to the coastline and why was this particular man attacks because if I understand correctly comments he made great white sharks don't mean to attack people good evening to\nGetting and um yes this is this is a question that that's been kind of burdening scientists for a long time why the sharks occasionally bite people\nAnd in order to have that happen we have to have two things we have to have people in sharks and the water at the same time and place and figuring out what motivates those is really a challenge\nThe challenge it tells me that we need to discover some of the facts about these attacks the first attack Arthur met a chi or from bought the Boston area\nHe was attacked while swimming and the shark attacked him so brutally that when he was pulled out of the water has classical was exposed but the shark didn't stay around\nA there was a trail of blood according to the eye witness who pulled him out of the water and the sharks swam away so is it that the shark bit the wrong thing did the shock feel attacked do we know anything about what a shock why a shark attack some people and bypass as others\nWell I think we first have to get at why shirts might be at beaches that that people use and and in this particular case what's happened is the recovery of the gray seal population\nAnd and it's been pretty much all medals have shown pretty dramatic recovery since there are protections seventies or so it's really been recovery of the great so population and the gray seals using\nThose beaches as important liquor you habitat that was really the draw to bring in large adult white sharks to those areas to begin with\nOr I assume you know so it's ... it's it's the seals and Cape Cod which are gorgeous but they're yeah they're the bait and uh that brings them in\nExactly so we know based on tagging studies that white church Rome entire stretches of ocean they cover thousands of miles a year but their prey like like seals do\nUse land periodically what it does is it concentrates that pray in one general area whether that be off Cape Cod or off you know California off shore islands those are the draws that that bring the sharks back from sometimes thousands of miles of ocean migrations\nTo these areas where all their foods concentrate so think of it like you know being out on a on a hike or a cross country travel travel and and you come across at Costco\nAnd that's where all the food is concentrated in bulk and it's easy to buy everything you need well for white sharks that's kind of what these robberies or act like they're drawing them to these locations and they're great places for them to feed\nPeriods of time to the attack in and need is a pop a beach town near San Diego and on Sunday\nCounty this was September twenty nine twenty Eighteen Thirteen year old king have now on to the hospital was attacked by a great white shark you've done very careful work because the shark didn't stay around to identify what ... uh who what attack keen\nAnd you've used DNA how does it work Chris\nWell you know all living animals have DNA and their selves and when those cells slough off their body into the environment they become part of the environment and believe it or not in the ocean there's literally a stew of animals DNA out there\nSo you can take a sample of water [noise] um and you can actually find thousands of animals little pieces of their\nDNA that are specific to their species show me and I collaborate with a number of researchers have developed a technique where we can go out and take water samples and then filter that water down in probe\nThat's due of DNA from all these animals to determine whether something like a white shark has been present based on his left off DNA\nWe referred to that as environmental DNA\nSo using it very similar approach what I was able to do is swab teens wetsuit where he had been bitten and swab the troops marched with a ... Senate traded to the wet suit and then my geneticist colleague was able to go through and amplifying demonstrate that there was clearly white shirt DNA in\nEach one of those gashes in his ...\nDo you call it the DNA and uh this strikes me the like CSI white shark here are you\nCut is kind of is\nYou can you can scoop water out of the beach area in San Diego county and determine whether white shark has been there within hours within days because wait they use this area and a common place I learn from you\n... well that's the part we don't know we don't know how long that DNA can last in the water and how recently that sharks been there so in that case it sampling water when we're measuring what we call them by our mental DNA that's where the ... in the DNA comes from\nUm we don't know how long that DNA will last before it completely breaks down and we can no longer measure it so that's that's something that we're planning on doing next summer is to try to measure how long the white tricks DNA can remain in a particular before it's completely gone but in that case it a wet suit that was different\nBecause the shirts DNA had become trapped in the ... show in many ways that as a standard forensic\nTechniques that you it's been used in forensic labs all over the world for for decades now I'm Rene biologist you're kind of late to the party so we're just now starting to adapt some of these techniques for use in kind of figuring out who might have been involved in a shark bite\nThe I read from the reporting that the U.S has more unprovoked shark attacks than any other nation that was true in twenty Seventeen\nOr that nationwide we have a lot more than fifty and Florida has a lot of attacks is there a pattern here that's emerging Chris or is this is this just better data and or something like the shock lab um accumulating the data\nI think Southern California is a little bit different than what we see us get caught and the reason for that is the adults are showing up at those beaches primarily to feed on seals but in Southern California we really don't see a lot of seals on our beaches there around me off shore islands and that's typically where we see adult white shirts\nThe birth it's a live birth and they're about five feet long that's a big baby but there is no nursing so this isn't a matter of a mother bear protecting her cubs\nBut I learned from you that sharks are warm blooded like human beings and the young sharks sharks are not ready for the deep water is that why they hang around\nWell that's part of it so why church or or what we call warm bodied her into their ... and basically as long as they keep swimming they can keep their body warmer than the water now the babies are fairly small and they have all the same equipment to do that\nLike the adults the problem is their bodies are so small that we don't think they're very good at keeping the heat that they generate and therefore they act more like a cold buddy shark show during the summer one of the reasons why we think they're in so close to shore and\nSuch shallow water because the water's warmer there than it is further offshore the other reason is believe it or not females give birth to their young and they're completely on their own so they have to figure out everything on their own and they don't know what is it threat so one of the reasons why we think they're in such shallow water\nIs because that's a safe place for them there are fewer large predators and then the third reason is they have to figure out how to eat on the road and the most common thing we find in baby white shirt stomachs or sting rays which in Southern California carpet our sea floor\nSo this makes it easy abundant food source for them for a naive young shark like a baby watcher\nI also learned that they migrate from your area long the San Diego county to the south or at least they have here to for and you raise the issue of whether they're ... they're changing their pattern because of El Nino or El Nino or law Nino or is it climate change can we tell Chris\nWell we're we're still learning about that but so far we've learned that the young white sharks are temperature sensitive they don't like water too cold and went our water temperatures dipped below sixty degrees that seems to be a cue\nFor them to migrate south to warmer water softball hot during the winter um the fall and spring so little sharks return to Southern California\nBut what we noticed was during the stronger Nino that we had in two thousand Fifteen\nOur winter water temperatures and never gets below sixty five degrees and none of the shirt so we tax that year left a state so what that told us was that El Nino can completely change their migratory patterns\nAnd the other thing that we're learning is that as our oceans are warming we're starting to detect not just baby weight church further north but I Do white sharks are now being more commonly detected off Oregon Washington and even British Columbia\nAs the war as the water warm so great white sharks like warmer water or they can range into the deep cold correct\nThat's correct and but they can't spend a lot of time if those steps so typically they like water temperatures kind of um about sixty degrees up to maybe about\nSeventy degrees so for adults they're a little bit more temperature tolerant they can tolerate greater extremes in temperature but young ... have a very ... fairly\nTemperature range that they like\nSo but what we're seeing is as our global oceans warm those warmer temperatures are starting to occur at higher latitudes than we're kind of interested\nSo what we've been telling people is look you may live in a place where you've never had to experience what church before but the ocean is changing and you should keep an eye out because as the ocean warms we might expect white shirts through march further north\nI understand there's an experiment underway in your area San Diego county something called the clever bully this might turn into a mass production it's to warn of sharks to warn to stay away from sharks how does the clever but we work\nSo that clever bully uses sonar so ah basically it's using the sport fishing sonar ships you download fishing shown us that this sooner points out in by using in a series of these forwards facing sooner Louis you can basically create a video image using sound\nTo track objects that move through that so in our field so the idea there is you can have these ... and you can have a shark move through that stick or sonar field and you can identify that target and say that target\nYou know is the target of adults or that's a shark or you know that's an eight foot shirt no that's a sense that shirt so that technology has great promise it just doesn't cover a very large area and it's very expensive it requires a lot of power to\nTo power the shoulder so um it it could\nProvide some really interesting data now the question is the California coast is huge so the question is can we even cover enough for the California coast to make a you know technology like that affect us as a just simply a warning system to let us know when large church maybe within coastal waters\nYou put the first one uh south of the ... bow up here you know these things I Do not in Newport Beach and that ... gained a lot of attention has been affective so far is it warned anybody away from a great white shark\nOr not to my knowledge and again it's that's not my work that's that there's a company that right you know markets as product um you know we're very interested in their results but so far we haven't heard of any um so it will be very interesting to see what that technology turns out\nAnd even though they're covering up very small area it will be interesting to see how effective it is in in a death defying the difference between sharks and white sharks and leopard shark some of our non threatening species\nAnd then of course dolphins and ... and some of the other wildlife that occur along the beaches\nYou tag great white sharks a win fisherman bring them to and you follow them uh and that data you're accumulating now have you learned anything new from that that at in this changing pattern because of warming we have about a minute Chris\nSo over the last ten years we've managed to tag about a hundred and ten\nJuvenile white sharks and actually we've learned quite a bit about their migration patterns we've learned about what what cues may drive those migrations and right now we're learning about how the young ones find it a nursery beach and how much time they spend in that habitat but we still don't know what makes a good nursery habitat a good nursery\nSo we need to develop new tools and that's something we're working on now we're developing of Saddam's\nUnderwater tracking robots and and water sampler so we can measure for white shirt DNA well using drones so we're using a variety of technology to try to answer those questions so we can predict from year to year where my T shirt show up\nChris Lowe Dr Chris Lowe is the director of the shark lab at California State University Long

will address and soon enough but we begin with the aftermath of the so use MS ten crash\nThe two astronauts cosmonauts were rescued happily the investigation continues quality control is always an issue with Ross cause most so does this delay the launch scheduled because after all Congress has left us with only one way to and from I asked asked Bob a very good evening to\nWell John as it appears the Russians are confident they will not have to lay the next manned launch on the news which is scheduled to December ... and the reason they say that is they expect to be pinpointed what the issue is within a week of now that's what they said that\nThat that investigation is going to do and they say they want to do at least one unmanned large for the last flight but the truth is they have at least three so use launches scheduled before December already\nWhat is going to go from a French key on the air and space site um they're going to do another progress freighter in a week or so\nAnd then there's another a Russian military large we're using is so I use as well all within the period before December and even though those are all different variations of the solar use rocket launches people um the ... components that are were affected by the failure on the same\nAnd so they think those launches and combined with the investigation they will be very confident that the symbol launched go on I have every confidence that they're going to identify the specific problem that cause last week's launch pad yeah and they're going to fix\nThat whether they can identify what we know what it is whether they can fix the underlying culture that is allowing these failures that occurred greater frequency in the last few years I have great doubts\nI mean ... the culture that's causing this is that they've organized the space program as a single giant corporation controlled by the government it's basically a Soviet style top down system it has no natural process competition and that culture\nMeans that their industry has nothing to force to do good work except political pressure\nAnd under that situation there's a limit to how much they can fix this\nIt's kind of similar to with NASA NFL is there have been repeated Ga oh an inspector general reports over the last decade saying it's badly managed\nAnd natural agrees on this point at that point but then they actually fix it no that's just\nYou wait a few months or a year and you see another idea and she a report saying it's badly managed to same thing without competition you get this kind of problem\nSo the rocks cosmos are providing now the journey to and from my assassin does that mean we no longer need to entertain and unmanned I. S. S.\nIt looks that way yes and I think it makes sense that plan right now I mean if they get three ... launches on manned off before December\nAnd they pinpointed what the issue isn't they've done some corrected it you know check the latest so used to make sure they aren't the same problem I don't see any reason why December cannot launch they would have about a month leeway the soy use that they would come back on\nIts life or its warranty runs out in January say a little bit of play that I should add by the way to things about space walks one they're going to do the December space walk maybe in November to inspect the outside\nBut that so I use because that's the one with the drill hole in it that was caused an leak that's one and two the two astronauts that didn't get into space last week were trained to do all the maintenance off\nA space walks on I obsess and Russian say they want to launch them in the spring because they're trained to do space walks network needs to happen and so what we're looking at is not only will we not see a delay but the crew that just had this accident is going to probably be on a Russian a soul use very soon thereafter\nBob you have the excitement of first man as a review on behind the black or I'm upbeat because that's a high point I think of this review I first met what is your\nFirst man was a was a\nBiography written of Neil Armstrong that has been now turned into a movie first manned by Hollywood\nAnd a few weeks ago you might remember there was a ... fold because uh the star of that movie Ryan Gosling has Canadian implied in an interview that the achievement was that Neal Neal Armstrong didn't consider this un American achievement it was a global achievement he didn't view themselves as an American hero\nCollectively quoting here and and it was in ... contact with him mentioning that they left out the scene in which the astronaut plant the American flag on the road\nAnd there was a big kerfuffle line myself said that's really ridiculous this was an American achievement for the world the world had nothing to do with it other than it spurred us to us to do it\nUm and they got a lot of flak for it and bad publicity the directors said no no no I never intended to reduce the American\nPresence I just wanted to focus on Neil Armstrong's personal story well you know I decided I haven't seen the\nFilm so my criticisms will maybe a little unfair so as soon as it came out I made an effort to find time to watch it and my wife and I went to see it or earlier this week\nAnd I have a review on behind the block and titles first ... triple lot trivialize the lunar landing because even though they do include the American flag out on the moon and they do include they you know it's very clearly an American achievement and they make some comments there and they are about how\nThis is an American a triumph um there's no question that the movie\nCompletely ... uh eliminated the Cold War aspect of it the American triumph there of and in that sense it was so focused on Neil Armstrong's personal story\nHis personal in inner workings which I'm not sure I Believe in any way that they completely miss that greater epic tale which is one of the reasons the film falls flat\nAnd why it's not getting great word of mouth apparently the only reason I don't think it's getting good word of mouth is that they portray all the astronaut has decided this likeable I mean the Armstrong has particular scene is glum sulking and not to kill it an extrovert introverted\nHe also is portrayed as a jerk who really treats his wife and kids badly\nMy wife said Diane said I Want to ... I wanted to smack him upside the head and I kind of agree you know some of the ashes no question because they get where they had to go they had they had a ... or their families a lot of them\nAnd they therefore jerks I mean I just have interviewed a lot of astronauts they admitted but a lot of 'em really tried to make up for it and a lot of ways this film didn't give that impression it just showed Armstrong as a jerk and and why would anyone want to see a film about\nHappy they're not happy and projects are all done with minimal disruption in your home they create a template of your counter tops then remove the old and then stole your new counter tops and just one day one day quality tile countertops has a show room where the tire kitchens and bats\nOn display for you cabinets manatees sinks faucets backslash options of all kinds they're easy to find right off the highway sixty nine\nAfter St west Warwick ... eight to six Ninety seven hundred or visit quality tile R.

I gave a story with you I think last week about how they've also unveiled their production fills that lady for making these rockets on assembly line basis on a quick basis\nAnd uh so it looks to me like one twenty Nineteen rolls around they're going to be a\nI'm off to the races with lots of launches\nBob Wallace island was originally used I think as far back as the Nineteen forties I think that was one yes first test type before NASA before anything they just had a bunch of rockets then they fired him off into the ocean\nIt was part of the N. A. C. A. which was Nash is the ancestor organization and they used it for scout sub orbital sounding rocket tests for things like ... and rocket engines and so forth\nAnd it was an and they see gay facility and then ... doing those kinds of tests well eventually NASA couldn't afford to do it because the government agency they can't do it cheaply and so they shut down\nUm and it still exists or and so they want they've been trying to turn it into a commercial site and they've had some success now this is a big deal this\nIs ... and so going back to ... that's good for the area that is good for diversity and it's another space for it to ... that's going to get a commercial contracts that's why I'm excited about it Bob I didn't know it was comic\nThat it's coming it's come in and so twenty

in trench warfare and in competing barrage has nip this meeting folks lays out what you describe as a battle plan\nFresh battle plan what's new about what is he said to these generals that inspire them that they can that they can win the next battle\nWell obviously they're they're trying to work out well to do after you've had this um there was a series of Jim an offense since during the spring the final June offense and he's on the lawn doesn't do very well the allies counterattack on the Eighteenth of July\nUm and now on the twenty fourth of July ... commands together and try to work out what to do next primarily to maintain the initiative to keep the gym is on the black folks\nAnd at this point he has no inkling of what he's about to happen and how deep the rough to set into the gym and army I'm so really what he wants to do is keep pressure on the front six you'll and particularly ... on me all that's on the pressure not to key riled up sending the British\nUm [noise] ... they want to put pressure that was about maintaining pressure on the gym and all me getting key location and primarily maintaining the initiative\nTo Nick mentioned that to places that are going to be

personalities NASCAR vivid hey\nHey gets the commander the British expeditionary force however you emphasize that the British prime minister Lloyd George hates him why\nWell Lowell George I'm never really wants to fight on the western front he wants to find anywhere else pretty much the night because he thinks it's it's too hard the gyms are not going to be defeated primary he thinks Hayek is bullshit he thinks Hayek is a man who was\nA squandered the the lines of too many British soldiers so I'm low George's really consistently undermining hey I'm\n... and doesn't really want to give them any more men because he says that if he gives him the moment they will just become casualties so is this huge civil military disruption of fracture in Britain at this point a to a new commander in

what is their relationship a French generally ... and a French generally smoke\nWell obviously um fall she is a man who has been for many years committed to the offensive it's an idea in the French Army um wants to attack is it if you like more of an Eisenhower type they get 'em in terms of you know trying to\nEncourage his opponents keep them going give them brutal directions but um but that's it pay Titus commander in chief or French yummy um is primarily\nIndeed solely concerned with keeping his army going because by the summer of Ninety Nineteen the French all quite literally on their

Morris here and he's about to get into\nA war fought the German way against the Russians with their Austrian allies and they're going to use his carrier law that's an advantage the Germans have\nJeffrey you tell a wonderful story however the German troops are far more better trained ... better artillery better machine guns better generals and the Austrians and the Russians both who's armies will fall apart in the course of the years but there's a story that is just compelling to me Geoffrey all of us who\nEither wanted to read Greek or can read Greek or can identify with this man is shut a German soldier so shell shocked by his fight in the west that when he's transferred to the east to fight again against the Russians you observed in this\nSource material that he sits there staring at the ground reciting long passages of the odyssey and Greek is that a typical story of the shell shock on the front or is just to stand out among all the other sources\n[noise] well I got that anecdote from the memoirs of Harry Kessler and a Kessler observed that and\n... wrote that down and he said it was emblematic of the difference between the fighting on the west and in the eastern friends in Nineteen fourteen he said that ... the western front\nWas so much more industrialized so much more intense the concentration of of men machines artillery ... was it was so much more lethal down the Eastern Front\nWhere things were spread out quite a bit more the armies were less heavily armed and the author hunger and I was very deficient artillery the Russian Army uh was better than the Austrians but compared with the Germans quite efficient as well plus the spaces where am I just much bigger so you have fewer\nYou if you are men and guns per square mile or kilometer\nSo you the the concentration of fire was with a\nAbsolutely mind bending on the western front and and Kessler was ... was saying you know when they got replacements from the western front and when they moved divisions from the western front to the Eastern Front in Nineteen fourteen to bolster the uh to bolster the Austria Hungarian war effort\nThese guys that showed up where you know they had a much higher percentage of shell shocked guys than\nThan a German or Australia years they've been serving throughout um the Eastern Front but this explains\nWhy Annenberg and looting door\nThought that it made sense to try to win the war in the east not in the west and they were always disputing with most of the younger and then fucking high and about the focus of the war\nOr they ... north thought it was impossible to get on the western front because\nThe British and French were just two industrialized the uh the the the British industry and subsidies we're creating a you know incredibly a solid trench works lots of artillery lots of Shell's yes there is a shell shortage in the in the war but the correct this\nAnd then they become stronger and stronger throughout and in Bergen looting dark said we can't break through on the western front because these western allies are so well armed the Russians on the other hand\nWe can break through there because there's more space is more space for maneuver and the Russians are pathetically armed versus the the British and the French\nOr they were they were fairly well armed at the outset but then they're black hated throughout by the by the Germans in the in the Baltic who closed the Baltic ports in the Turks who joined the central powers\nAh they closed the the Black Sea ports are the Russians\nSo the Russians aren't able to get in any machinery and not able to get any artillery but not able to get any shells\nOr or or or bullets for the rifles in fact a throughout the war about one third of the troops in any given Russian unit have rifles two thirds attack without rifles and pick up rifles from\nAtlanta that was a reason for the Germans to launch the war in the first place I Believe I read you correctly they knew the Russians a bench Lee would be better armed and so they had to move now before it became impossible\nYeah and they probably and they and they didn't they didn't realize how just how badly they were on that they didn't realize it was as bad as it seemed\nAnd so in Nineteen fourteen Fifteen and then you know Nineteen sixteen Seventeen Eighteen is well a or a Hindu and and burger looting dark said look we have to seek decision\nOn the Eastern Front because the off the Russians are big but they're ramshackle we kicked the door and the whole thing will fall down whereas we can't punch through in the west once we take the Russians out and we are they conquer them\nAltogether or we force them to make a separate piece with us we can then focus everything on the western front or we can defeat the French in\nFridge Hynden burg and looting Dorothy is to work together and they will take over everything eventually and Seventeen and Eighteen but here they build an austere in eastern army of twelve course six more coming and they attacked the Russians and roll up enormous numbers of prisoners dead and ... are dead and wounded\nAnd killed in five hundred thousand they just roll right through the Russians and they want Conrad to work with them to attack from the south ... office\nYuri is Conrad because he won't eat ineffective and at this point is looting door thinking about taking over Conrad's army he will will eventually but he did he think at this early November\nWell they didn't the ... the Germans were were effectively taking it over in the sense that they were increasingly coming up with ideas and increasingly a compelling Conrad to execute those ideas going over his head to the emperor in Vienna he refused but\nThe problem the problem was is that you know you have the Germans on the left\nAnd the center and then you have the Austrians in the center and all the way down there right so if you're going to have a big operation where you try to roll up the enemy flank the Austrians really have to participate because the Austrian because the Russians are so numerous a and but it the the Austrian\nIs just ... whenever they attack their blown backed by the Russians\nAnd they and they lack the artillery they lack the infantry tactics\nTo actually launch an effective attack and get through the Russians so they make these half hearted effort to join these German offensives in the east but every time there stymied thrown back and then the Germans are left fighting alone without a flank in Austria Hungarian Army to assist them\nA sidebar to what's going on at the battle ... and the enormous casually numbers\nI just introduced me to what looks to be a fresh information about what happened to the Jews in the Austria Hungarian empire that by the Nineteen thirties Nineteen twenties Nineteen thirties they were scapegoating by such as the national socialists\nThe dislocation of the Jewish villages in ... is co tournament is with these offensive action the enormous numbers of armies marching through the blasting and the threat those Jews are what they are they they travel naturally to Vienna for support is that correct Jeff and that's where\nThe Jews have to live again having been driven out of their villages and they participate in the black market in Vienna\nYeah the the ... show was the most was the most densely settled part of the ... census settled by Jews uh there were three nationalities living there\nPolls Ukrainians and Jews but there was a a large a very large Jewish presidents and extended from Galicia northward into
