within\nThese last ... hours I follow the NBC's reporting Mel this is marketwatch forgive me ... reporting the Treasury Department again declined to label China a currency manipulator instead settling for a stern warning\nAbout recent slide and the value of the Chinese one or renminbi\nThe treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin was quoted a particular concern are China's lack of currency transparency and the recent weakness in its current same a down ten percent this year treasury went on to say that it estimated the direct intervention by the people's bank of China this year quote has been limited\nA garden we welcome our friend Alan tunnels and to comment on currency manipulation yes or no\nYou check card so Alan\nWas the treasury correct in not designating China a currency manipulator for the last six months\nAccording to the criteria established by the act of Congress that set up this process they actually were of just briefly there are three criteria that any country needs to meet in order to qualify for that scarlet letter\nThat scarlet letter of currency manipulator status and shining it's really just one in the last six months since the last such treasury report came out it runs a norm of\nBilateral trade surplus with the U.S no one can no one can tests but it's actually been a net seller of us that\nFor the last few months we just got the latest treasury data that goes through August actually yesterday [noise] and it's also it's also brought down its global current account surplus which is a broad measure of its trade surplus\nPretty considerably in the last few years or so again by by two of the three criteria China is in fact not manipulating\nI ask you garden because you've been keen on this story for some time or the president when a candidate and in transition accused China of currency manipulation was that accurate then is it accurate now\nIt ... it has not been accurate for at least a year and a half maybe two years maybe even more than that clearly China was a currency manipulator in other words\nIt was manipulating the value of its currency to obtain a train but trade benefits it did that\nUm by keeping the renminbi low but we also know hum as Alan just alluded to that they've actually been supporting their currency recently and the reason is as Alan points out is because they're worried about capital flight and it's a remedy is at a low value that encourages capital flight and so\nOver the last six months of the people's bank of China the central bank has actually been selling dollars in order to support the Rehman be\nYes the ... has fallen but it would have fallen a lot more but for the support from the Chinese central authorities\nAdd that to my own educated here on this sounds like if not manipulation certainly putting your thumb on the ... yeah they\nDo put their thumb on the scale John right it's not currency manipulation as defined in US law because to be a currency manipulator for purposes of this treasury designation\nYou've got to fool around with the value of your currency in order to obtain a trade benefits and they have not done that matter of fact they'd given a trade benefit to our exporters by keeping their currency artificially high\nAllen for those of us who don't practice macro economics the way Allen tunnel Senate reality check does why none of us walk is economics like Allen candlestick why why why does currency manipulation happened ... who does it who uses it and why\n... countries that rely heavily on exports for their growth like China or frequently tempted and often to carry through the policy of artificially depressing the value of their currencies which makes very good cheaper visa V. foreign competitors in their own market\nIn the U.S market and then third country markets and in fact over the last roughly Twenty years several countries have been designated by by the Treasury Department as a currency manipulator is um and certainly in this latest report various countries or or put on it\nOr will watch list given a so-called stern warning not to go too far down the road that they seem to be going on although no one's really sure no one's actually willing to make that accusation formally but\nIt has been used China as Gordon says certainly used it massively especially from the mid nineties to the uh well really to right before the global financial crisis but the situation has changed but was what's also changed dramatically is that its currency manipulation issue\nIn the age of Trump's trade policy no longer matters of the way it did ten years ago because the president has already imposed so many tariffs\nOn Chinese imports and is likely I think now to impose many many more so the importance of tariffs to counter currency manipulation as really shrunk\nI'm terribly disappointed Allen that we do not violently disagree on this issue we you know I I don't know how that happened that we actually have the same perspective\nLet's go to another issue where we might disagree okay and that is supply chains there's a lot of people out there Allen who say look you know the supply chains are stuck in China it will never ever change agree or disagree\nWait I Want to crowd in with the economists conventional wisdom from lousy economy ... oh gosh ... guys it's my job in life to read the economists I'm going to report what are better you to be John I enjoy and a great deal I had an alternative life as an English public school boy okay that's where I Am fine All right\nThis is written from the point of view of understanding the queen okay fine\nThe argument is that the supply chain in electronics specifically electronics is deeply in China deeply engaged in China that side of China was there it's it's a miracle happened ... with the explosion of\nCommercial and retail electronics for consumers and therefore\nIt is not credible at this point at this point they're cagey about this at this point to replace John however there is migration underway\nTo Vietnam and Indonesia those are the two countries the economists mentioned and that going forward as the supply chain altered you know devices you're getting smaller we're getting rid of chords are getting more mobile devices and less of the desktop so they\nAre the tablets and other electronics bigger the big box servers become little bitty boxer as\nIt is possible that China can be augmented with other countries but not yeah\nYou know John that's not an unreasonable view but the point I think the economists tends to gloss over is that you know first of all there are the terrorists that Trump is putting on and it's making life miserable for manufacturing and China but you know the more important story is that see jumping the Chinese ruler is making life miserable for foreign companies in China\nJay kale replace that old clunker Jay kale engineering also specializes in complete commercial rooftop systems from design to the doctor

my friend Gordon check garden there was a piece in Politico out foreign affairs [noise] by the executive\nEditor and it was a compilation of all that we know about the troubles in China centered around Xi Jinping the president for life\nAnd it gave a glimpse of where we are and where we could be moving at rationalizing textbook hated why China is failing why the disappointment\nAnd it's pointed to human nature and that drew me because that goes everywhere it's not just China human nature is when there's a dictatorship or an authoritarian Xi Jinping\nThere is an incentive to deceive\nBecause your job your family your ambition your dreams depend upon you giving information that is favorable to the success of the regime\nYou're no longer in a position or department or an enterprise in these vast things called that the state has composed the state operated enterprises you're no longer in a position to say\nThere's going to be a shortfall this quarter or we don't have adequate quality control or the failure here is because we have toxic managers who have to be educated\nYou don't do any of that anymore and what that does is it creates and the Communist Party and an enormous silence around she in which he gets no good information except from a handful of his lieutenants\nWho not even then John and the information is about who's against us because that's what they become good at worrying about\nWorrying about the man who's going to get them in the back what happened in late Soviet Union was it became brittle and paranoid that the description of a nightmare\nAnd there's history just say that that's where China's head [noise] there's a lot of history and much of it\nChinese history and much of that is history of the People's Republic because\nWhat we're seeing today in Beijing which you just described is absolutely correct that there is the silence that there is an inability to disagree inability to tell the truth to your superiors and so what's happened is he jumping is just not getting the information that he needs in order to make reasonable decisions\nThe same thing happened the mouths of dung in the late Nineteen fifties you ended up with something called the great leap forward which was an insane plan to start out with\nBut it was made even worse and the tragedy is that tens of millions of Chinese died\nThe impart not only because it's a ... mile was just a loony in terms of his policies\nBut also because he did not understand what was actually happening peasants were starving and at the same time he was told by those around him that the great leap forward his plan was actually working so we're seeing the same dynamic\nMaybe not with tens of millions of people dying now but clearly it's the same phenomena\nThe concern also is that in a deteriorating\nSecurity condition which is what you are when you're paranoid and there is no satisfaction right you know that no matter how many times you both the door they can get in another way your imagination takes over and a deteriorating security situation it becomes very attractive for the regime to lash out and find out of me\nOh certainly and many people speculate that right now so huge and brings in a place where he understands\nThat a couple of things are happening first of all he used insecure he does need to have a foreign enemy\nBut also in a general sense China is starting to perceive a closing window of opportunity\nBecause you have an economy which is not growing as advertised you also have a demography which is going to turn negative fairly soon edited environment that can no longer support the economic growth that we saw in the Nineteen eighties in Nineteen nineties\nSo clearly there is a time where Chinese leaders are starting to think\nThat they've got to accomplish what they're set out to do now or they're never going to be able to do it\nIn late dictatorship and this was the Soviet Union there is no succession plan impression F did not have a succession plan which is why stay security's stepped in and drop off made himself the boss she does not have a succession plan state security or the pale law will run China after she\nYes and that's the optimistic scenario the other scenario is just that uh the basically the party in the state dissolved and you have a period of uncertainty and turbulence and chaos and that has occurred in previous times in China's history so\nThat could occur as well but you're absolutely right Xi Jinping has no succession plan and because of the way that he's changed the Communist Party he's the institutionalized at gotten rid of the rules of succession he can't have a successor because if he does he's gone\nIn a late dictatorship the Soviet Union\nOf coup is less likely than indifference indifference there was eventually ... but it was because corporate chef raised expectations are at this point I Do not believe that she is vulnerable to a coup he is however suffering lies everybody is lying to\nAbsolutely and he's willing to everybody else\nGordon Chang the Daily Beast I'm John ...

Would get speculated about quite a bit okay speculate yeah yeah well it's a I mean it's\nIt's it's really fascinating to see such a quick pivot from from China it's of course as we talked about the last time when I was on we we saw a bit of this happened right in here in Newport we're having our ah international sea power symposium the head of the Chinese they'd be what's here and actually pull and actually pulled out and went home\nIt displeasure over the situation in the south China Sea with recall to to to Beijing\nSo that so that was sort of the origin of what we see having that we'll see happening in the Southeast Asia now and of course it seems like a China has had second thoughts as soon as the defense minister to this defense ministers conference between the United states and Ozzie on\nIn Singapore and uh\nSo it is I I'm not sure exactly uh who gets the upper hand the diplomatically but it's a it's a fascinating to watch\nJim I'm told that the Chinese believe regard a an article of faith especially for the Chinese military in the LA navy that the south China Seas are Chinese and that the U.S he's poaching\nAnd that just as we do not permit Russian or Chinese\nIn the Gulf of Mexico\nThey do not intend to a permit us ships or our allies in the south China Sea can they enforce that\n[noise] uh well ... well I guess I'll take the ... thing is the second thing I Would answer first I guess that's really where the rubber meets the road is do they have the assets do they have the ah the material the missiles or craft all that kind of stuff to actually enforce their claims\nIn the south China Sea the they interpret this as sovereign territory is seems to be the one coming out of Beijing for the past few years they talk about indisputable sovereignty meeting a monopoly of force that belongs to China in the waters the claim so\nWhether it has the votes to enforce that I guess remains to be seen as far as the historical person I mean it's it's in a sense it makes some sense I mean big powers have big powers like the United states like Russia or China like India in fact\nWhen they look offshore they do have a proprietary such towards those waters but at the same time if you look at what China is doing today in the south China Sea and these are the what the United States did in the Caribbean and the Gulf during the era of the Monroe Doctrine yes there

make the rules in Washington governing what happened in those expanses so it might be the same thing but it's an order of magnitude greater in an ambitious\nAnd to reinforce your point gym um it was just a couple of years ago when the Chinese sale within ten miles of an Alaskan Ayelet we didn't stop them um we didn't complain about it\nSo you know if the Russians are the Chinese wanted to say on the Gulf of Mexico our position would be yeah go right ahead um last because we believe in freedom of navigation and I think that you know the Chinese always say well would they could never sailed near Hawaii well we allow them to do that if they want to if they have the capability to\nIt's just that of course we don't like it but we don't stop them from it\nI mean we're with potentially the scene but they really are they were used to it\nJust a moment you have more get you back on the phone because I Want to hear we had to break up with their Gordon I ... I Want you to go over that point again that the Chinese aggression here that we're seeing is building gradually it has been building for every for many years and in the course of this conversation tonight I see that we've come to accept\nA certain claim a certain amount of claims and the Chinese where contending with them we are talking history but I think that's too far for more than just the United states I think they are European allies have accepted that the aggression in the south China Sea I'm even beginning to believe that parts of East Asia have accepted it\nWell I think parts of East Asia might have accepted it but no I mean we don't accept a Chinese territorial claims and that's why we had the Decatur um engaging the freedom of navigation operation a last month and that's because we do this we do this not only in the south China Sea but elsewhere\nAnd although you know we take the position that the United states will not arbitrator take a position on competing ...

it seemed like it was a while to get through a U.S China or us on China thing I Wonder one mano a mano so I think what which I think is a really really bad situation if it happens\nHowever we started we started to see the royal navy Britain's real David show up in the south China Sea the French the French are putting are mounting a presidents and talking about the way more uh Australia has been

and co host and we're very pleased to welcome the Hoover Institution cycle offline riding most recently at the national review and\nAll their distinguish publications about aggression by the Chinese\nOr leadership in Beijing the People's Republic of China aggression that appears just continuous\nWith the reputation that China gained as a diplomatic actor many years as remaining in the sidelines or emphasizing peaceful rise are seeking non conflict Michael a very good evening to you you cite several instances they're very well known now\nChina forcing a airlines to remove Taiwan from its Web sites or China challenging the U.S has to cater in the south China Sea or most recently you've written about China detaining up to the New York times tells us a million ... reeducation concentration camps\nThis new aggression does it come from one place Michael good evening to\nGood evening John well you know does it come from one place and in one way it does it comes from Xi Jinping the president of China no\nHe's obviously the beneficiary of years of policies that have strengthened China but in his five or six years in power or he has moved assertively and indeed in many cases aggressively to throw off the caution that China had traditionally practice or at least have practiced\nIn the past several decades towards the outside world and you're seeing a China that is unapologetic that is unwilling to compromise that is unwilling in many cases to negotiate a and in in fact what I think it's doing is beginning to push itself into a corner but it's not doing\nSo without causing a lot of pain and a lot of disruption abroad\nMichael um see jumping is very different from his predecessor Hu Jintao who was a consensus builder mild quite weak politically or see jumping is just apparently the polar opposite\nUm do you think see jumping is an aberration or is he the inevitable result of the evolution of Chinese communism\n[noise] well it's a great question you know the historian I'm always a hesitant according to\nTo make a a conclusion like that and and you know the easy ways to punt and say that that will see but in in some cases we really are at a turning point if she ... paying is able to successfully consolidate power and successfully pushed through the um the\nTypes of policies that he has been doing so far meaning they're not they're not reverse that it's hard to see China going going back a short of of course the type of collapsed scenario or severe weakening that both of us have talked extensively about\nOn the other hand if it turns out that he missed calculates that he creates a coalition of the willing so to speak that is opposing China if he blunders into a conflict that China's not prepared for then you can easily see a lot of this being unwound the and he and his\nApproach being disavowed by those who would replace him so in in some ways what he's fighting for I Would say is not just China's role in the global stage he's he's actually fighting for the future of China when he talks about the China Dream is he's done since coming into power\nWhen he talks about ... the great Chinese people what he's really talking about is this pathway and we are in the midst of that experiment right now\nYou know clearly you're seeing a pushback from the United states and from neighbors in from other countries\nAnd this is I think causing some political distress because we've had the ... way um incident the president have been a ... ... be recalled and disappeared I'm there have been other instances suggesting political distress at the top um infighting we don't know the full dimension of it\nUm but it seems that she jumping is fighting not only for the future of China but he seems to be also fighting as you suggested earlier to consolidate his political position in Beijing 'cause otherwise we wouldn't be seeing these symptoms come so soon after each other\nI think that's right um now one of the things that he's done assiduously since coming into power in late twenty twelve and probably before that when he was the Arab parent was to begin\nIsolating and eliminating a potential other sources are centers of power within a the top leadership of of the Chinese government\nUm so it's not that he did\nNot understand that he would cause antibodies so to speak to come to form and and try to either blunt what he's doing or or you know displace him and\nTake it over for themselves and he's been very successful in doing that with the military and doing it with\nMedia which was already controlled or in clamping down on civil society and the like but you are absolutely seeing signs of I'm I'm not unrest but\nDissatisfaction in China are there are a you know in the Soviet Union we have to use to have these ... underground publications in China they will\nCome pop up here and there on the Internet and then spread like wildfire there are extreme criticisms of him in the path that he's taking a you see a some concern in the top leadership as you mentioned of course the ... chief Chinese\nAre being disappeared this is this is a regime I don't know if I'd\nSay that the wheels are coming off I don't think it's it's at that level but it is is absolutely one where Xi Jinping is pushed so far so fast\nThat there is the beginnings of a push back against that the question is has he been successful enough in neutering potential other centers of power that he will be able to get through this\nYou mentioned the national review on line three hundred and fifty thousand Chinese students studying in America are they a problem Michael that is developing this escalation of aggression he's that turning those students into ... unhappy people are unhappy visitors to the United states\nWell obviously it's it's hard to you know you can't generalize about all three hundred and fifty thousand but what we can talk about John hard the\nUndeniable actions on the\nPart of the Chinese government to mobilize in some cases weaponized the students they've done it lessen the United states but they've done it in places like Australia and other countries where they form a very vocal interest blocks ah and they try to suppress the anti Chinese discussion or Chinese um\nLectures or Chinese events on\nCollege campuses uh they will go out as as large crowds trying to drown out anyone who is taking a critical stance of China they are in other element along with the Confucius Institute so that the state uses to try to portray\nOnly positive a\nPositive views of China now in the United states will we also know is that the government is very carefully watching them that there are in essence agent provocateurs tourists were sent to make sure that none of these students say things that we can do that themselves the students are saying things that can be construed as critical of China\nOr the sent a chill or into the ranks of those students and it it really cuts against everything that we say that well when they come here to this country they're going to experience academic freedom and intellectual freedom and therefore they'll go back and change China and the fact is is that they feel probably even more under observation and more under surveillance here\nWhen they're studying abroad than they do in China\nI don't think that they have been particularly effective in getting this message across now it may not matter because again the economy is so strong that voters are seeing it again in every direction so\nBut but I think it's political malpractice for the Republican to the touting the economy and their responsibility for it\nAt every turn the Democrats are guilty of this too I mean they they tend to get lost in their own storylines or what every story lines are created it defined for that by the press they tend to get lost in those things\nLike you and I've been talking about this from ... I Wish that the Republicans had been counting the economy and their role in creating this school every single day right up to the day of the election they have not done that\nKill I Am disappointed in most of the candidates but I still think that the American people are going to deliver them a better day on election day that most people think but it's not entirely because Republicans have been so great at their own messaging\nThe New York times reports that after Kavanaugh and these last weeks that there is evidence that the Republicans have gained because of the polarizing of the ... electorate over issues like capital and others in other words they're stronger in red states the Republicans and they were before\nAnd while the Democrats are stronger and blue states hardly anybody's left in the middle America except for maybe Elizabeth Warren wandering around trying to figure out what she is but the polarization means that both bases are fired up both places remember the story for year was that only the Democrats were focused\nRight yes and that was true and Republicans were so self satisfied after the twenty sixteen election that a lot of them and a lot of voters who are particularly passionate about politics just sort of kickback didn't watched what was unfolding\nWhich for them was pretty good especially economically but now John I think\nGiven the Kavanaugh situation what tickle debacle that was how horrifying that was just so many voters not just Republican base but independent the disaffected Democrats who voted for Trump at twenty sixteen\nThey took a look at this it said what the heck is going on here this is a good man this is a brilliant man who deserves to be on the Supreme Court elections have consequences in the country elected Trump Trump's prerogative is\nTo nominate he'd like to sit on the Supreme Court and unless they're Charles Manson that person deserved to be on the court so what is going on with the\n... years being level that this guy that got a lot of people across the board really bad it got that mobilize\nSo the question is whether or not that that energy and enthusiasm born out if the anchor of the way Kevin always treated whether that can carry three to election day I think largely a cat obviously I think if the bitter kept in the day after he was confirmed you would've fleet\nMay be a Republican landslide forget about a blue wave\nBut the timing of this is such I still think that it's close enough to the Kavanaugh spectacle that there will be enough Republican energy to mitigate any blue wave\nRight it looks like the blue wave is ah the blue a metaphor is no longer useful the times says\nThat in polling shows than in the rural areas the Republicans are granting straight and for the wave to be gigantic the Democrats have to do well not only in suburbia they already have cities knowing suburbia but also in the rural districts and that's not ...\nTime I want to divide this up the way up into house which political science says goes to the Democrats the party on on the out for the first term of a president and the Senate I've been surprised Monica as the Senate numbers have come in and we're getting likely voters now\nHow strong the Republicans are in red states very very strong and that it will be a credit to such as Joe I'm Mr Manchin senator mentioned if he holds West Virginia the Republicans are overwhelming in Missouri overwhelming in North Dakota\nOverwhelming in Nevada overwhelming in Tennessee or they might even be overwhelming an Arizona I Can't tell at this point but whatever that polarization dozens in suburbia it's certainly successful for the Senate candidates\nYes exactly in fact the Senate map has really tilted in the G of he's favor just sit in the last couple of weeks I always thought that the Republicans were going to hold the Senate\nAnd maybe pick up the seat hurts you now we're looking at I saw in the Dallas yesterday John that said that I sort of feeling we could pick up that\nSenate seat I don't think that's likely\nBut now they've got the average if the Republicans picking up about three or even four maybe five Senate seats\nWhich is entirely possible so Mitch McConnell did they made a comment about Obamacare and said look if if it turns out as we expected might where the where our party a number of seats in the Senate\nWe're going to take another step that repealing Obamacare which of course gets a little riled up all over again they were going to do and and and and go full charge to get this done when I went on social media especially where I saw the left going bananas over ...

launch abort system had recognized there was a problem with the booster we welcome and it totally jak who keeps the Russians space Web dot com it's a subscription site and it totally follows the ... Ross cost us extremely carefully and we're going to learn a lot in these coming days\nAbout to tell you it's remember we depend upon so he was completely until it if\nThere is an alternative\nCapsule to be launched from the United states completely to reach I assessed as a crew on board right now\nThere are due for rotation they might extend them there's also the possibility that the IOC says we'll be unmanned for some period in the future until he uses solved\nAnd it totally the author of Russia in space the past explained the future explored his book on rock cause most always need a new chapters and it's all you have very good evening to you I understand\nThat they've reached the crash site you're reporting on October eleventh what is emerge so far from the explanation from Ross cause most about the failure good evening to\nA fellow John um I think we're fortunate with a in a way in with this faith or because I Know many of the details became um a\nKind of clear all left immediately\nSo essentially on the VCR although launched you could see that\nUh that was one of the booster step out on the failed to a separate cleanly separated but uh it was kind of\nA little delay and of course in space business even a few seconds of delay a means a big trouble for the kids and when it's in fact now we have a ... in the data that second step by that I was a\n... bits in this empty boosts or\nOne of the four ... and the main stage which was still fight and then we're still working on getting the spacecraft to orbit\nAnd of course once it hits\nA that was a fatal blow to the operational a stage and as it is all the rockets are paid too much uh started going off course\nAh fortunately the flight control systems detect this at the weight that emergency escape for the ... and that's why they still can give interviews and uh basically to lift ... to us\nSo the abort system works David\n... and it totally I ... I read some place that um there was a failed signal that didn't work to give him a good separation and they were looking into um non technical reasons and said other people were investigating that implying\nThat maybe it was on purpose or sabotage or something do you know anything about that\nOh well we have I think much simpler and kind of a more reasonable explanation of this without a without going after the ... and stuff like that got Spiro says\nAh because I think first of all we know from the history of ... or like is a that was a very similar accident in Nineteen Ninety six when a that particular signal you mentioned did not reach the booster in time and that was no uh ... as well and those were found a\nFirm that investigation that was a damage to the sensor itself which could happen natural way just because of the assembly ... which is kind of a better than the ... the booster\nAnd if you're not careful enough to do it in that somebody you can\nVery easily or no damage that's the way to kind of delicate the structure and then it's a it's an actual mechanical or\nElements which needs to move during the ... and then it it sends the command for this special wealth doping on rockets and if it doesn't do that sometime in time with it\nYou can create big trouble for for that or get them that's I think exactly what's happening to the site\nAnd are we looking at protocols that needs to be change do you have a wonderful pictures on on your website Russian space Web of the assembly the preparation of a sudden these MS ten the failed craft or do they are they looking at the protocols right now for where how they miss this and quality control\n[noise] absolutely say look in the entire chain of procedures which led to this and say they get to a tell us exactly what was the source of fruit cause of this but they\nTell us that they do understand the process they do understand what happened and uh the only thing left they ... the kind of to establish this entire sort of very very deep rose cause which which caused that\nAnd I think that their way to close from they're confident that it can be a critic\nDavid I'm ... and it totally does NASA play any role and in this investigation and oversight given American astronaut ride on the soil used to what what does NASA do or do they just white decisions coming out of Russia\nI think in many cases like does they they kind of weight but they will obviously will have all that\nKept Nikola very porous which will come out from the investigation and they will definitely will be able to give give light them they will be able to kind of give feedback whether they feel confident enough to pull desktop out back on a you know and the next ah no launch was the crew\nAnd it totally there are there are demands for use and to ... to and from I asked asked to have you seen as scheduled changes in any fashion after this accident\nUm there was a slight\nChange which might take place because in fact to Iowa nuclear say might actually odds once the next launch a forward because uh because what's going on is there is right now the\nInternational Space station is under stuff there is only the people instead of six which has scheduled and that could which is up there right now ... and ... the soil which is they will use and not necessarily the spacecraft which is ... the station\nAnd sort of sorts of like a ... life both it's also has a sort of expiration date so he needs to come down the aisle actively saw him at least in December on January so what they see there are doing is still a lunch the next ...\nA little bit less so it will kind of a but he plays the one which was was not able to make up there and then as they will be able to relieve that Korea which is they're on board and but in the back uh was in a\nTimeframe or allow it required by the by the expectation date of ... which is that right now in orbit so it's a kind of a juggle of several missions says several um ah several lunches says the same time so the so I use that they might actually launch early as ... plans before\nDavid ... any chance they would make a decision to lead the space station without a crew and take the chance was on that what are you hearing about that\nUm that's encouraging kind of better consistent quality\nI'm adding legitimate employment to the the country as well as increasing the tax base reducing crime and related statement this ... this isn't a new category this has been around forever on people and using candidates for for thousands of years\nUm it's being more this past century where where it's been illegal um and now people are starting to to recognize the benefits of it and and especially the benefits of legalization in terms of um keeping it out of the hands of miners in Greece and the tax base making sure you've got that are consistent product\nSo we take our very proud to be a part of it and really congratulations to everyone who helped make it happen\nYes and I'm certain that take an update the new NAFTA to include a marijuana being a part in the United states has become an important part of the north American Trade Organization now what is the God when we spoke earlier in the year\nYou were building very large facilities because your aim as I recall it is to ... is to produce cannabis that can be used in edibles and in that bridge is is that correct\n[noise] um that's right we see a lot of growth coming from edibles and divergence but we'll be happy products across all the different particles depending on how people want to consume it\nWill be providing those kinds of products but really focused on on clean and organics were growing unreal soil we don't use any synthetic fertilizers or chemical pesticides so it's a cleaner healthier product that has a sharper chirping and flavors and profile\nUm that that consumers prefer now in terms of ... we were building those facility for still building them are Hamilton facility in Ontario\nWill be finished by the end of this calendar year and we'll start selling into medical market in January so we're actually not selling today in Canada yet we have sales in Europe in before we do in Canada um and then in cut back our facility\nWill be finished next summer but even before then as we start building each grow room will will start cultivating and harvesting so we expect to be expanding well started medical and Canada and Henry\nAnd then during next year will be expanding across more medical patients and the province by province in the recreational adults use market but we've actually made a lot a lot of progress since we last talked a we've purchased a company now in Poland temp Poland which has industrial base CBD oils and from there are selling into multiple countries across Europe\nWere investing in this business to actually take some of the technologies we've been developing in Canada or have licensed out of the U.S and we'll be expanding our product portfolio exactly\nInto edible as you mentioned and beverages\nBe on the oils they sell today and since we last talked we've also acquired a company in Jamaica or fifty percent of the company in Jamaica you can't have majority ownership there we've we've got forty nine percent and this is a fully vertically integrated company everything from cultivation\nTo extraction manufacturing in retail stores um we made an announcement last week that we've entered into a joint venture and Mexico which is one of the biggest markets in Latin America\nAnd we'll be exporting products from Poland from Canada and and from Jamaica into Mexico and then soon to be the rest of Latin America we're also investing and building out the sales and distribution and structure so really we're on track to build out our global brand\nAnd become the leading organic Canada's Brent I'm In the world\nI Want to ask about that the facility in Quebec that's twenty thousand square feet is that where the robots are right is that you're going to use robot arm so in ... you know it\nIn Hamilton it's it's a hundred and fifty thousand square feet twenty thousand is the indoor part I'm In valley feel just outside of a Montreal and come back that's actually one point one million square feet not twenty thousand so it's much much bigger and yes it will be largely automated\nWe thought we actually chose cut back because it has the lowest power rates in the country huh huh hum as well as some it's great\nThat so that's where the robot farmers will be and come back\nThat that's right so you don't have people and the girl rooms or which which has a number of benefits because it it's a lower risk of contaminants coming in Raj tends to happen when people are coming in and out and then on top of that because you got robots to lift up the tables you don't need walkways for people\nWhere are the stores to look for and and how are they how are they managed\nIt's going to take a bit of time I meet today you only have a couple dozen stores across the country um\nIt what you'll find is over the next month's them over the next year they'll be more and more retail stores opening up there'll be very specific only selling cannabis products with the exception of Nova Scotia where they're selling it in liquor stores as well\nUm but you if you're in Canada you can order online and have it delivered to your hotel um you need to sign for it and you to be of age which is basically Nineteen every province except for back you need to be Eighteen to purchase it and I'm In\nIn Ontario um there's a lot of American states a lot of big population um adjacent Ontario it won't be until next April you'll be able to find it in retail stores\nAnd come back for for states that are neighboring I'm back um they do have some stores now but I think over the next few months will be a lot more stores and there'll be better accessibility\nAnd the government is handling slower go\n... I understand you gotta start somewhere today's the start date so they're now going to build a the government is handling the the merchandise as wholesalers correct and then there are opportunities for private enterprise to sell it as retailers\nUm that's right so for the medical market which is being in place for some time I'm it's direct\nPatient directly to the producer through e commerce so we can sell to medical patients across the country but for recreational adult use um the the provincial government in each and every province is the wholesaler record so we sell to the province\nAnd then they go on and sell to retailers whether it's their own retailers like in the back and and and several other problems is or private retailers like Alberta or Ontario as of next April will have a private retail network\nUm the government will still be kind of in the middle there ensuring the right quality and and write control than excise taxes everything else are collected um and ah and also create a getting getting their wholesale markup as well\nThere I mean the the the promises when I'm from a financial standpoint as well as right hum reducing crime and making sure that that the tax basis is strong and and there's quality products out there\nThere's a getting as to the way the BBC is reporting this have you heard from your neighbors and Britain are they are have they expressed their envy because of what's going on in Canada\nI I Would say I would have heard from people across all countries in Europe and in fact in in the U.S as well and and South America everyone is looking to Canada\nI'm being the first kind of significant or G. seven country right to have legalized adults use 'em and want to make sure that candidate desert right and I think what you'll find as more and more country see the benefits\nUm in terms of providing\nUm basically helping people because I mean there's a lot of medical benefits to it but even if you compare to beverage alcohol I'm On the recreational side um it's also a healthier alternative and um and I think you'll see more and more countries looking at Canada as a role model and looking at how they could replicate it\nThe company is a has an unusual name on the ... on on the markets T.

R. I. 'cause the general Franz Joseph the eighty four year old\nWho ruled by avoiding all problems and yet the war is upon them jumping roads here that a mad catastrophe is the book the outbreak of World War one and the collapse of the hops Berg empire\nThere are plans general staff plans they've had maneuvers for years where they planned what will happen one more breaks out\nJeffrey there are two enemies that they must concern themselves within the other one is the Russians the great Russian Empire from the north the other is Serbia but ... is a minor threat\nTo Vienna marching on Serbia is a waste of time and money you emphasize that when the Germans made common cause\nWhen Berlin make common cause with the end they always believed that the Austrians would go to war with Russia that they would help the Germans whole Russia in the ease while Germany destroyed France and the British expeditionary force in the west before they came back and finished it but that\nThe Austrian didn't tell Germany about the Serbian few is that correct\nWell I mean the the book talks a great deal about this in the sense that more good the younger helmet for the younger the the German journalist actually even Conrad the Austrian journalist\nThat she had had intermittent staffed talks in the years before World War one they had a\nMeeting and ate in Nineteen eighty nine that meeting in Nineteen twelve where they talked about war plans but the warplanes were always very vaguely elaborated by both men for a couple of reasons for the Germans never trusted Austria Hungarian security arrangements\nAnd they were right not to because the book talks in fascinating detail about the ... affair of Nineteen Thirteen when a when the uh when when when one of the best and brightest and the author Hungarian general staff\nIs discovered to have been selling German an Oscar Hungarian war plans as well as you know ah information on Germany Austria Hungarian technology in fortress a provision arrangements and that sort of thing to the Russians\nAnd so the Germans always catch things close to the vet the Oscar Hungarians under Conrad also shared very little with the Germans Conrad actually had a rubber stamp on his desk and the general stop building that said not to be shared with the German general staff and he would stamp documents for that and the reason they did this because they both sides\nThe Germans and the Austrians want it as much freedom of of the newer as they could\nAnd so they didn't want to commit themselves or to definitely\nTo each other because they wanted to maintain flexibility the Germans because they were they were nursing their sleep and plan and they were planning to throw you know a nearly their entire army against the British expeditionary force in the French and the west and then only once they were beaten move everything back to the east they didn't want the Austrian saying\nHey you got to commit to leave that doesn't divisions are twenty divisions out east\nAnd the Austrians because they had this very flexible flexible in theory war plan\nWhere they would have a large echelon of troops that we didn't train for the for the Eastern Front they would have a ... a very small echelon of troops that were trained for the Serbian ... in the event of a two front war and they would have a floating reserve of a dozen divisions\nThat couldn't trained for either front and uh the Austrians didn't want to have to nail down that floating reserve\nThey you know because of German demand they wanted to have ultimate flexibility is it's so there was this very a dangerous vagueness about the arrangements between the Germans and the Oscar Hungarians both general staff saw that as being convenient but it would prove fatal in war time as you see in the book\nBecause basically what happens is that uh the war basically is triggered by the fashion that assassination in Sarajevo and\nUh the Austrians have an opportunity to mask everything against Serbia because so great is the international outrage this assassination I mean remember\nThese Bosnian Serb assassins killed\nThe crown prince of the Austria Hungarian empire in the streets of sorry he's were Bosnian Serbs it was assumed by virtually everyone that they had some kind of\nSerbian governments Serbian military connection this was telling the Austrians when they're all tomatoes are going to investigate improve up but in the meantime\nEverybody from St Petersburg crossed a London was horrified by the date so the trees actually had an opportunity to rule with everything into Serbia and crush the Serbs but they wait for the opportunity waste entire month\nThe whole month of July they were all literally on vacation they didn't even come back to the end of the plan this war that they had been wanting for years there most of that time they get around issues\nIt made him a month after the assassination\nIndignation has and the way everywhere and now from St Petersburg London instead of people thinking hey Austria has a right to invade certainly everybody's thinking hey Austrian better not invade Serbia\nAnd and Russia and France are saying don't invade Serbia because Serbia has friends\nSo at this point by the time the Austrians actually get around to going to war they no longer have the option of a one front war it's definitively going to be a two front war and yet and here's the madness of Conrad fun Hudson's or if he decides to direct the bulk of the army south against the serves\nAnd send only ... the other half of the army out to the Russians when in fact\nHe needs to be sending forty divisions to face the Russians and ate divisions down to face the Serbs but instead he sends twenty against the Serbs and um and a\nTwenty eight against the Russian and they're not nearly enough for the Russians\nAre going to build the strength of a hundred and Ninety six divisions\nThe three Army Corps that are sent against the Serbs or in the hands of poke tiara who is the rival of Conrad and post your and he's even less effective as a commander and more Jericho as a man searching for victories than Conrad\nAnd what they what they wind up doing is trying to cross the dream river\nTo press into the mountains and we learn from the first time and Jeffrey's book that the Austrian citizens are totally unaware of how to fight a war\nThey're barely trained and this is the first and best of the draftees\nThey don't have enough weapons is generally a Jeffrey said but they fight badly they bunch shop and charged with band not into what's your insulating fire and it's a disaster in the heat and they were beaten by their own tactics as I said that correctly Jeffrey\nYeah yes exactly and and and you're right this really hasn't been covered if you look at history the real world one\nUh the the odd drunk or invasion it's it's quite puzzling how they actually lost but no historian has really gone any detail and how that campaign was fought and how it turned and uh you know what happened was the the ... and as you said these were the best troops and the author and good are these with along service troops\nAnd my book by the way he concludes by saying really by the end of Nineteen fourteen it's game over because the train to army has been utterly annihilated and the train obviously been an island and they start getting
