outside\nAnd it has three refrigerant lines that go inside the building to these distribution boxes and then once we're inside we can have up to twelve different air handlers or different delivery

could always dry so now\nThat means the sun to become the south side of the fall day and you need to cool that top floor Sunnyside bedroom\nWell when you do that you're going to gather some of that sun's heat\nInto the refrigerant and then normally you just should send that down to outside it to be wasted on what we can do here is we can say no we can we we can use this energy to good effect\nAnd we can hate the north side groups well the final piece of this that makes this thing such a breakthrough in my opinion is we get one additional heat exchange off of this system right\nAnd that ... has refrigerant into it\nAnd we can use that waste heat that heat that we would've dumped outside to also heat the water for faucets [laughter] so this is now while all in on what everybody's

in the heart of Pennsylvania yeah it's a it's the work you're just spectacular so what's the last us like I mean obviously cat it's common standards sizes but you guys basically cut the parts and put them all together by hand and it was kind of supervise now passes away\nJust absolutely a we make cabinets at Clinton's ... to the ... of a niche there is no real standard size for us huh uh we make our own doors in drawers we make all of our cat in the tree whether it be European ... or traditional framed in ...\nI think a lot of folks don't realize how mass produced most kitchen cabinets or are in their ... and there's a lot of trade offs in that process that\nThat is true or we are would I like to call a local custom cutting to jump on steroids and we do some production minded work but we're also very close to them a lot of hands on work we do a lot of custom cabinet tree for any room of the house that a lot of other companies really don't want to touch\nAll right so let's say you're hearing this program you're thinking about redoing your kitchen you blank slate um how do you tell folks get started with that process\nUh basically we have a network of professional kitchen abet designers across the United states of America or they can go to our designers and they will talk to them about colors woods style anytime prairie traditional whatever it is and try to narrow down what their goal is for their project\nSo that's really the place to start once that's done we're the manufacturer we take those plans and create an order and build that exactly to their specifications what's unique about the kitchen that you don't hear the gyms townhouse will it's quite unique were using the transitional door style is actually the name of it\nAnd it's done in very precise equal sized panels that would be the maple white painted part of the kitchen a lot of the rest of the camera tree in the house is a rift ... which is one of the hottest woods going right now right in in the custom market\nWe have done some blue legroom kept the tree and we also did the all the vanities in the house\nSo it was very good design very easy for us to make it to fit right on and make it look like a the customer wanted so we're we're very proud of it looks fantastic\nYeah it looks it looks it looks really great so what are some of the mistakes that folks make you think when they start to plan a kitchen where people go wrong and then they were ready for many years well I guess\nYeah I think a lot of times um people tend to get caught up in trends are so they will pick something trendy and then they'll find themselves five ten years down the road still living in the same house with no plans to move there are thinking about doing it again yeah I think a lot of times people tend to uh

lawmakers in both parties don't believe that on Fox News Sunday Republican Senator Rand Paul\nI think it stretches credulity to believe that the crown prince wasn't involved in this and I think that's the way they're going to write this all democratic\nOn Mother Earth make their way into Texas Nevada Arizona and basically\nThe media is telling us we should encourage it and not let and let it occur like Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that she would welcome all the migrants from Central America all of them\nWell there's about thirty five million who live in Central America there's about a hundred and forty million in Mexico there's another two hundred million in South America polling has indicated given a choice\nSouth America and Central Americans and Mexicans somebody like two hundred million would come to America to hundred million what would that do to our government or welfare spending door schools draw hospitals do our presidents we wouldn't have a country anymore joined the million and want to come here\nAnd because the way the law is constituted that are the Democrats were not allow a change and takes ten Democrats and the Senate to do anything and they will permit it\nThey will permit that because if you're from other than Mexico GM other words from Central America and you may go to America there's a magic card that you have to read seeking refugee status and that begins a legal process it will take years\nIn the meantime you're inside of America waiting for a hearing there cannot take place we're not ...\nYeah old they have enough camps\nThey have enough judicial officers they have enough lawyers are not scaled for any of this to allow tens of thousands or millions to arrive at our border so far this year until October first which is what about two and a half weeks ago we have a hundred and Seventy five thousand migrants have come to America this year\nFrom a central and South America hundred and Seventy five thousand we don't have the judges the lawyers the courtrooms to hold hearings hundred and seven hundred Seventy five thousand when you have five to ten year backlogs of millions who adopted her jet\nAnd so the game being played by the Democrats is extremely serious if you're from Mexico here illegally you mean taken right back immediately if you're from Central America you have the right to hearing that goes on and on and on and never stops so uh I I'm interested to see\nWhen and if the media will change\nTheir coverage to provide objective information the damages caused by unbridled massive illegal migration from third world poverty driven criminals societies into America and what the impact that has in schools orphanages hospitals and the rest\nThere is no media coverage on what's happening in Nevada Arizona California taxes through new actually go through a legal migration ... there's no coverage it it doesn't exist the murders of rapes et cetera it does not exist remember\nThat nine of the ten most violent countries in the world or south of the U.S border sixteen of the twenty most violent the other foreign Africa and they're invading our country they don't have uniforms on but they're coming here in mass incentivized by our media by the Democratic party\nI sat in twenty sixteen the reason Trump shocked the world\nWas because of illegal immigration\nFederal judges and the economy\nRight now with Trump is our leader\nEverything is coming up roses it's unbelievable\nTrump has everyone from North Korea to Russia believing we're about to bust up every new treaty necessary to keep to get America back on the even track the trade imbalances are starting to flip he has an economy exceeding five percent GDP\nThe unemployment numbers so not just the ... the lowest they ever could be the or the

immigration the tank the twenty eight teams to favor the Democrats and the tank this president and twenty twenty now that's not the world that I live in maybe if you live in Connecticut a Las Vegas or Chicago\nOr California San Diego that's the world you live and you want more individuals here was a third grade education Eighteen to twenty eight years old with no marketable skills not able to speak the English you want maybe a few thousand more in your community\nPlease bring them according to the Democratic party\nBut that's not the word I live in Cincinnati, Ohio I don't think\nThose who think about these issues in Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego Tampa Denver Cincinnati I don't think we think about these issues in ways that the mainstream media can understand I must live in some alternative universe because according to CNN this is the issue\nOf unbridled migrants walking into America that will cause average Americans living in Wisconsin and Michigan the vote for the Democratic party if that's the case I live in some alternative universe that's not the world in which I live\nI'm Sorry and I wish there was some way through the magic wand\nThat we go to help the two or three hundred million Mexicans Central Americans and south Americans not living a great life that don't have the opportunities that you and I have we're only four percent of the world's population but every year legally through press says he's we've taken legally one point one million\nForeigners to come into America take the oath of office and become American citizens which is more than the

years from now that will never happen this is fundamentally changed our country does far and it's going to be much worse if in twenty Eighteen what in two weeks two weeks in two days the Democrats take the house and or the Senate\nIf that out if that happens the country we live in will cease to exist do we have the have the wherewithal to take in a hundred million people\nAre the schools coined in such a fashion or the hospitals ready to go\nOr other bridges the roads the expressway ready to accept a hundred million more people because the Democratic party says that's what's coming how is this possible that's the most violent places on earth is sending has largely young males\nTo come into America\nGot a Kevin jacks and coming up later and African American leader of great note there is no race or group of people more hurt by legal immigration than African American males especially young African American males they have figured out\nThat this is not benefit them at all doesn't benefit American business does it benefit American public education doesn't benefit the hospital systems that we have this benefit any part of our does it benefit our jobs economy absolutely not we

listen to the media you know they tell you is the worst human being on the planet help but the truth is\nHe's exceptionally gracious I've seen so many times helping people that never get the story told because he doesn't want the story told but he's always there to help whenever he can\nWhy is that because the media ought to be calling balls and strikes you know they ought to be saying well this is what's going right this is what's going wrong media worst Research Center ... well ... one of my buddies\n... every few months that the media coverage is Ninety two percent negative Ninety five percent negative the media is protected by the U.S constitution only business in America that gets constitutional protection the media should call balls and strikes a lot of good stuff a lot of bad so why does the media only report the bad enough the good\nThey only report the bad and the ministry of the Obama administration you would think that our economy is growing at four percent that we had more American working any other time\nIn our nation's history it conflated those to see Trump agenda is not what the mainstream media wants to talk about\nI here's a great example just last week I think it was a President Trump did an interview with least offer sixty minutes she interrupted him the five times during that interview to put that in comparison when Mr an interview with bronco bomb or a couple of years ago they interrupted him more times\nAnd they have their own agenda their agenda is to make the president look bad\nNot to give him the credit that he deserves for the successes that he said because they're no longer in the business reporting the news now in the business of making the news and that the big change over the last two decades\nLewandowski the president or the other night in Montana framed it as mobs versus jobs the only difference as the Edmond J and I think that's brilliant on his part because well look at Brett Kavanaugh all\nAlong about Dutch trucks that have a Trump sticker on getting burned I look at congressman getting shot I look at the Republican congressman Republican operatives getting beat up and getting stuck in the side with and\nI look at how you're confronted in airports in restaurants mobs versus jobs and do you think the average American I think forty percent of what the president forty percent oppose them there's twenty percent\nAnd back and forth do you think that the moniker of the president mobs versions jobs is going to stick\nCrime I think it will stick because look the American people see\nAnd hear what people like Eric Holder had to say very recently when they're down we kick them and we kick them in the head you know the the calls to violence by the leaders of the Democratic party whether it's a Maxine Waters or other is saying if you see them in a gas station if you see them in a restaurant you go after them you don't give them a break\nYou know that's not the way our country is supposed to be and I didn't support proper Obama but never ever ever did I ever remember Republicans or conservatives for that matter going after members of the previous administration when they're eating dinner at a restaurant we've now seen it with Sarah Huckabee Sanders we've seen with secretary Nielsen ... we've seen with senator\nTed Cruz we've seen what happened to Congressman Steve ... where he almost lost his life because the mob violence antifa is\nSo out of control there there you go on their desire is destruction it's not to make our country better this president has created I think\nOver for a million new jobs in the last Twenty one months and that's where we should be doing look even if you don't want\nThis president if you didn't want him to succeed you want him to succeed because you want our country and succeed and that's what the differences that Democrats I hate to say this and they hate this president more than they love their country\nOn the other issue the culturally acceptable didn't mean to fame and to make fun of and dismay or the president and the first lady you may recall about a week ago TI who's a rapper then I Will watch nonetheless I saw him and TMZ and I did a video in which a look alike millennia Trump\nWas stripping nude and in the oval office performing sex act in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure he might sell a lot of lot\nOf his songs and records not can you imagine three years ago if a country artist had depicted Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office and performing sex acts in the oval office what would the outcry from the media have been if it was Michelle Obama\n... it would be front page news for a week on and that wrap that the uh the country artist would have had his life probably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back to just again about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky\nAnd they asked her do you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was no it was appropriate because she was an adult he was the president of the United states leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's behavior\nCan you imagine for one second that was the the converse if Donald Trump had done that with during the media would be saying oh\nYeah they would give them an excuse right away and I'm sure the media was saying well she's an adult no big deal I mean the double standards amazing\nIt has always been that way but the American people have seen through it and as you've referenced as it relates to Brett bows out Ninety two percent\nOf the media coverage of this president is negative now I Would accept that if we were in the middle of twenty five percent unemployment a national crisis all over the place nobody working and the country moving in the wrong direction growing at point zero zero

take him down for what\nWell you know it was hanging by a thread two weeks ago and now he's on the court and I think the other issue I Want to get your perspective on this Kevin Jackson and the black sphere which is the what's happening now with the Honduran migrants\nComing through a Guatemala into Mexico there right now is three to five thousand strong and they're heading toward the Texas border this is a terrible event for the Democrats\nOver the next two weeks before the election they have the video and the pictures of thousands of migrants\nWhenever I watch MSNBC all I hear about is women and children then I see the video of these migrants coming to urban areas\nIn America and they're almost always young males and the young women tend to be raped or sexually molested the men are drug meals and I'm sure there's good family members among them and Kevin Jackson of you and your wife and your children were in a or in Honduras in a bill Cunningham and my wife and kids were in\nAnd we're in Honduras living the horrors of socialistic left wing military hunter regime\nThe first thing I Would want to do would be to get to America I understand that completely but along the process it gives billions of dollars damage Thirteen other gang bangers to provide a passage Everytime you go through some other drug infested area Mexico you got to pay\nHomage you got to pay either sex or money to even pass through and and live by the time you get to the northern part of Mexico according to sixty minutes about two months ago there was hundreds of dead bodies because some men did not want to participate and becoming drug meals to give drugs into America\nSome women were killed because they did not want to be ritual listed Lee raped on a regular basis this is a horrible journey I watch MSNBC this is about refugee status of desperate people I watch other news outlets and this is terrible Trump's going to send supposedly\nOur soldiers in the southern border to stop it and all of this is playing out during an election that the Democrats supposedly have in the bag because hundreds of millions of dollars up to a billion and it's been pumped into these campaign or buy a Tom Styron by Bloomberg and others\nIn order to uh to me are Republicans all over the country get get get me over the next two weeks ... how's this going to play out at like ... or early on November the sex\nBut Democrats have missed every find they no longer have their finger on the pulse of the American electorate people want our border protected and so they and they also get that this is fake news it's contrived it started as a hundred and sixty people now it's up to four thousand now\nAnd so what time did it the right thing he said Honduras these people show up you're losing your aid Mexico I guarantee he made the same call to the new president of Mexico and say look\nIf these people get where you were going to renegotiate our trade agreements we're going to look at the age that we're able to send you\nSome Mexico's deploying military on the southern border I just heard this literally today good\nSo Mexico's going at it on doors I bet you will send buses to say you got to you're going to get back to our country or else ... and ... with the ... how they're going to play out to Democrats again overplay their hand\nAnd they think this has some issue that's going to be the ... the you know the ... the division point with Americans in Americans overwhelmingly won our borders protect that we don't want these migrating horns to think that they could just come anytime they want so whether whether it's the economy effect\nWhether it's the Kavanaugh fact whether it's the bars of an investigation of the Russian they'll which we now see that that is completely been busted part because a judge Royce Lamberth who just said I don't understand how Cheryl Mills isn't in prison\nAnd Clinton and a bunch of others and then there's a conspiracy what the FBI so that's about to break that's going to be the big story this week and then you've got this yet again read a dirty Haitian of the whole border issue that Trump's going to send troops and say you're not going in you\nKnow in fact on doors you know Kevin Jackson it's bad for a hundred doors in Guatemala and Mexico\nThere's ten uh males generally males to America because it takes away the ability of Hondurans to reform their own government because the safety valve is there to send people to other countries and so it was left there are those who cannot function and do a brand new society is bad for those countries
