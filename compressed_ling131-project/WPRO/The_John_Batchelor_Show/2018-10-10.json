has a list of five potential candidates to replace US ambassador to the United nations Nikki Haley was stepping down at the end of the year reaction to the announcement from a top top administration official\nProfoundly nationalistic and is it is projecting its power for nationalistic reasons it requires control but it's access to resources and\nFood supply in a way which the United states has never had to do\nBecause the United states has had a ample domestic a mineral and agricultural resources whereas the ... does not so I see is literally knows that it's life is dependent on\nContinuing

mid ... century or so there was this great feeling of um\nInferiority which is now being ... a addressed and Chinese people flocked to a authoritarian leadership\nIn the knowledge that that was restoring prestige and tried to to China in a way which had not been seen since the brief a rise if you like of the doubt and produce a sushi or who died in Ninety nine hundred and eight\nGregory I want to apply this to where you are in Australia because Australia's economy has prospered these last decades on the Chinese demand need for resources but with the Chinese assertion of nationalism I Know that\nUh that Australia is taking note of the chat strategy that China's used in the south China Sea and it's looking at the coral sea has something to protect from Chinese encroachment is Australia swinging tours nationalism is Australia moving back\nTowards the commonwealth is it understanding that China is a nationalist bread and not a global is market\nIt's certainly a arouse the a lot more discussion than it did a China had made massive encroachment into the the the political structures in the unit in Australia\nAre literally buying off politicians form a new south Wales probably a Bob ... for example a bit became a lack of a Beijing and and so on and he was the foreign minister in India in Australia or just recently\nSo uh so yes there's a lot of concern about undo Chinese influence in Australia\nA and in China is buying up agricultural capabilities and lands and so on and have a ... a company's him and lands here so that they can really feed into the the Chinese food requirement\nOr as a result ... is now starting to import food from other parts of the world because it's exploiting the bulk of its Its Food stuffs to China\nOr this is not a healthy situation for the ... ah and but the but distributed being massively organize more than most countries in the world is a benign put six five percent ... so uh the the\nUrban voters tend to think are in short term and short term say they want what they want when they wanted a they don't necessarily think about this long to balance of the nation state\nBut that is starting to change again and it always changes when have ship is visited upon our country and although you say a stray fed will uh in the in recent decades because of the boom in exports to China in relative terms Australia's GDP ... has been growing\nHas been growing less rapidly than that of its neighbors they India uh which was marginally with this huge population was unimaginable a bigger than Australia or in a in GDP chips in Nineteen Seventy eight and there's now a massively bigger than Australia\nA China was a Chinese GDP in Nineteen Seventy eight was double Australia's now it's nine hundred and thirty percent bigger than Australia's or Indonesia was\nA had a in Seventy eight had a GDP of Fifteen Percent of strays now it has a GDP Seventy seven percent that of a stray so in relative terms the strangest productivity or an innovative qualities have declined dramatically and will and will continue to decline dramatically\nThat the the country had five a functioning oil refineries it now has not and it has something like a Fifteen day a supply of petroleum on hand\nYes it has massive underground oil and gas resources but it hasn't actually ... done much with them most of the ah the gas is for export it's a strange now the third largest gas exporter in the world of it is a lot of it's not going into the domestic\n... what what about the coral the geography let's look at geography here is the coral sea threatened by China is Australia ready to just respond we've got about a minute\nYeah astray as building in the navy and air force dramatically and sit in the China would not be able to make an incredible the Carl sea area I bet it is but it is making political inroads into New Guinea Solomon Islands and other South Pacific states want to walk to particular\nUh so astray has to respond to that a straight is still a much bigger aid diner in those areas that China but China is buying off individual politicians which is the key to it\nSays Canberra perceive the threat to the public educated self about the threat we see it clearly here in the east coast to the United states do they see it in the south coast of Australia\nAt no stranger is not yet perceiving the threat as in as dire times as as they should uh it is getting much more traction than it was a year ago but still not enough and the change of government actually didn't help because there was a a minister who is handling relations with the south Pacific States who\nWas dismissed from the new government because she had written a letter objecting to something the new prime ministers day so a stray was deprived of very a good resource in an ability to deal with the south Pacific\nIt can respond it it will need to do a lot more it is to be talking about a naval base in the ... area yeah so it's it's

... segment of the global business report brought to you by the republic of Azerbaijan from food to energy to a knowledge of the republic of Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea bass and is a region well worth exploring and\nI welcome my colleague ville whale and the Hoover Institution bill is area forty five seed pod cast for the Hoover Institution but we're going to ... him momentarily because he also writes a column and Forbes about these last weeks before the midterm election\nFollowing Kavanaugh bill a very good evening to you the anecdote being held in Washington is that Kavanaugh makes a difference for the Republican Party\nHowever I wait to see whether the facts support that especially in the polling\nThe one distinction that is made anecdotally is that the Republicans all of a sudden they're doing better in Senate races but there is no information that things have changed in the house how do you see the Kavanaugh embroiled Leo now after the storm has passed\nAnd what should the Republicans watch for in these next week if there is indeed a change of momentum good evening to you about\nJohn F. simply this Republican but Mitt overall for Republicans what we're talking Senate races not house races ... but Senate race and we do have to ask you about it if you want to understand said the Mets are already works favorably for Republicans and Democrats or play defense or a lot of defense in states that voted heavily for Donald Trump so here in the cabin up\nOf nation as a gift plain and simple by well first of all because I went for president but secondly charming you look in these states cabin up\nAn enormously important civic North Dakota for a second or the high camp\nDemocratic become the audio is in trouble before the vote a poll I saw North Dakota the other day as voters a related issue in this election Kavanaugh was number one issue a job more so than the economy and foreign policy immigration health care unit\nWas Calvin all plain and simple I kept voted against Kavanaugh probably because he's already done by ten points to see the water draining out of the bath tub with our race\nSo there's an example the effect next best example of this state that taught problematic for Republicans and that's the great state of Tennessee open seat were Bob Corker is retiring job with the race between Marsha Blackburn and a film brightest and the former Democratic governor of the state uh she has struggled widely in this race\nBut suddenly poll showed her up about eight points\nThere's only one explanation for the John and That's Kevin ... so then the next week or so let's watch are the plus a pulse dribble out in states like Nevada states like Arizona State like Wisconsin a state like Montana Jon Tester oh to get his cabinet or get a credit card but let's see what the cabin up ...\nAnd I think that the phrase to watch you know the election of cow bells\nJoe mansion voted for Kavanaugh he had to leave before hand people in West Virginia like him a lot so his voters may be hard to read but it sure looked like he was joining the parade bill is that going to influence Republican voters that mentioned came over\nSo that probably saved him in West Virginia\nDecent position that race to begin with John ... gave him a lead a bit is probably pretty much the Mets is raised with my job match you did something very clever he didn't come out in favor of cabin on silhouette actress Susan Collins right already made her pick\nThe question is Khaled said voted no catalogs she said she was going to vote no what would that should have done because then she would have been between a rocket to her place between having a police\nCars and how he just plays the voters West Virginia but look this is a state that Donald Trump carried by over forty points John this is a state that Donald Trump in ... I think five or six times it has to be the stadium visited the most John those states which Trump does not have property such as Florida New Jersey New York so\nWe had no choice but to really vote for a so again\nWorks very well for the Democrats or Republicans on the Senate side of things in this just underscores just voted this election job he bought her talking about this how things change from week to week we have this conversation a week ago about the United states about looks very different than a week later after you have a vote it looks\nDifferent and the Senate vote does that connect with the house vote are these separate unit versus bill\nSeparate unit versus share Republicans have a problem because Kevin I'll give it up and give and take it for it and he gave us where Republicans and the red states he take it away and the blue states where Democrats or Republicans are scrambling um I stayed in California particularly John where there are about seven or eight seats at the turn of\nEvents where Republicans are challenged and\nHere it probably is I have a problem because that cabinet and motivate the red state voters you also motivates women in the specially suburban districts and down in orange County California John these are states Republicans really have a problem but so Kevin are easy to say right now the cabinet insecure Republicans and set it it may cost Democrats may costs Republican House\nYeah so Democrats are doing well in the house before cab and also the puzzle here bill before we move on to Florida\nDid the Democrats calculate on Kavanaugh so badly um in in some fashion so badly inhibiting their Senate vote did they count on that or where they just playing this as it lays in other words they they played the hand that they were ...\nShot I I I don't know what to Democrats with picky throughout this process if they were doing audits long term strategy they would have looked at this is real I think my goodness we're putting about half a dozen of our senators and Justin untenable position so why fight this secondly John this little crafts really kind of lost her head admit\nI you know history will tell us when the weather the cabinet nominations really turned a lot of hope they charge what he gave his own throw the defense before the panel I think it may have turned when Michael Avon dot he got off the\nStormy Daniels' lawyer who tried it out the woman the college woman who has a ridiculous out today she's about Cabot oil gas you get gang rapes school and so forth and the ... the car they didn't have a good sense of a job to realize that you know we've got to distance ourselves from Abbott daddy\nAnd instead they pile and they haven't done the attack I'm just not sure how much long term strategic thinking that cock his head I think they were caught up in a moment so determined to bring them into the to the bigger picture\nFlorida Rick Scott the very popular successful governor is running against the long standing Senator Bill Nelson this is a non Kavanaugh story your report in for\n\nIt is a Florida is that instinct a couple of reasons first of all the early turnout has worked a heavily for Democrats in Miami Dade or what fascinates me about floor is two things but they really John that seems hard it's the environment in terms of its kept tested going on in the form of red algae and red tides and blue algae\nOr the governor blazes senator Senator Blanche the governor for this problem of Koreans are bad the question is who they take it out on and now we have something else coming into play and that hurricane politics as we speak or a hurricane is barreling down all the Florida Panhandle uh\nWatch senator Nelson watch Governor Scott just theme of the actions of it is a nobody would wish hurricane according to state but if there's ever such things which was stunning it's one of the Centers for reelection the governor's Chelsea et cetera they will bend over backwards to help the state\nBill the puzzle about Florida here is that this is more of the president's state than New York is he is very keen on the Florida vote that was a critical factor for his success is he is he a weapon here in the last weekend for ...\nAs Donald Trump likes to say being pro business is being pro worker because you need employers to have employees and so it's a very positive picture it's in fact I defy some liberal friends to show me anything that's not going right with the economy right now\nI'm On the storm clouds or announced in twenty Seventeen by all the magazines and newspapers I read you know me I've got the New York times or Washington Post the economists time magazine especially the national Review Online\nThe tariff war was who wants to destroy our economy and I think the market is now at sixteen thousand it didn't happen see why not\n[noise] well I think maybe it's because Trump's bark was worse than his bite you know I was there\nA a a week ago on Monday when Donald Trump pet is a Rose Garden\nCeremony announcing the candidate deal that was a big deal to have you know six months ago I think people like myself and and you were worried that we might not get a new NAFTA we will call it any ... any NAFTA any longer but this was a new NAFTA it's a new\nA free trade agreement for all North America which is a very positive thing for the whole region\nSo uh I think that the significance of this is not just that we've got this deal done with Mexico and Canada\nBut it sends a signal that Trump is like dominoes she's gonna bring do these bilateral deals he's going to do and what the UK if they ever get out of the new he's going to do one with European she's talking about a trade deal now with Korea and then of course the big one John as you know is the is the big stand off a that is coming against\nTry and write and that has not hurt a Steve because China is adamant that it will not change its business plan it's business plan is to violate the all the rules of the WTO to be a pirate and to have American ... economy and it will not change\nWell you know that's what they're saying but you know that China was not being reported in American media is how poorly the Chinese economy is doing I mean there's a\nThere's a panic and Beijing right now they're the sad part is down twenty two percent this year there's a lot of disinvestment in China they've got a lot of goods that China needs to sell goods to the United states right I mean they sell us a trillion dollars a year that's a big part of their economy\nAnd they're worried and I think at the other day\nYou know I don't know if it's going to be the end of the day is going to be you know a month from now six months ago two years from now but they are going to make some real concessions here because the truth as Trump is right about China China is you said there are pirates\nTheir steal the cheap they don't live by any of the agreements they promise you any business that tries to do business over in China you know you've you've sacrificed oftentimes the ownership your trade secrets your patents it's just a system we can't live with it's going to change in this question of how long it takes Beijing to come to the bargaining table I think it's going to be sooner rather than later\nThe supply chains team that's been the concern that if China and the U.S remain at loggerheads the supply chain is damaged you see any evidence of that moving around the country\nSure I mean that'll happen I mean look this is going to inflict some pain on the United states but mighty pain on China China needs to be able to sell goods and services to the United states they sell us five hundred billion dollars a year you put a twenty five percent tear up on that that's a hundred and twenty five billion dollars\nThat they would have to pay and and terrorists and you know as as a somewhat in the White House told me recently and wasn't Larry Kudlow but a high level officials said you know\nThis tit for tat you know we put tariffs on that and they put tariffs on us pretty soon China runs out of ammunition they're going to run out of bullets 'cause you know they we only buy a hundred ... we only saw a hundred and fifty billion to them they they sell a five hundred billion to us so I I look I Am optimistic that this is going to turn out but you never know I mean you know the ... the\nChinese better than I Do John and a lot of this is just saving face for Beijing and and president Z but you take that out of the equation\nYou know if it's just a very positive picture lower lower taxes lower regulations pro business pro America energy policies are the lowest unemployment rate you know since the Beatles were still playing together lowest black low as ...\nAnd our lowest Asian female unemployment rate you know that that's a pretty big deal when you get a better way to just see the story of my favorite story of all John in the wall Street Journal on Saturday they're buried on page aid for the biggest wage gains over the last year went to the lowest\nSkill the lowest income workers so this this really is a rising tide lifts all boats\nEnergy you've written books about energy right now the price of oil is going through eighty five dollars the trash talking to a hundred does that help the U.S because the energy sector has been our strength these last the last years of the Obama administration\nNow doesn't help it tell you I'm worried about it actually because\nYou're right we do produce a lot of energy and and then within two or three years we're going to be an exporter of energy but we're not there yet\nJohn and so when the price of oil goes up at the facts on the American producers\nAmerican family as an American motorists so it you know this ... probably stays high by the way I think it's temporary the United States I've been to Texas I've been to North Dakota I've been to Oklahoma I've been to West Virginia or producing so much ... unbelievable I I think this just further\nOr encourage our a domestic producers to in Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota and Alaska to produce even more energy which is which is going to be a good thing as we become more and more as Donald Trump would say he doesn't want to be energy and found any watch America to be energy dominant or not there yet but we're getting there\nThe election it's within four weeks you know very well the message of prosperity is clear we've gone through the details is America listings team\nYou know that's a good question or do we just take this prosperity for grafted um I don't know but I Will say this you know the Democrats are running on repealing the tax cut\n[laughter] you got to the looney tunes to be the tax cut is what has really provided the juice the economy and the for the Democrats to be running around the country saying we're going to raise your taxes John I don't think that's a winning message with the\nAmerican people the Kevin I'm I'm In Raleigh oh you watched it from across the country these last days the surprise to me this week this week\nRight now after the cabinet seconds Kavanaugh swearing in at the White House is that it's given the Republicans momentum uh do you see that as you across the country and does that does that compete with the prosperity message should we should we say that the Republicans have found a reason to vote\nYou know I think so well again you know you never know until you actually go out and vote but I'd throw the polls out the window job because I Lived through the two thousand sixty intellectually every always so uh you know show off target but I Do see that especially with Republican women who were kind of\nA show so about whether they won the vote of two thousand uh Eighteen and they saw the mistreatment of Calvin eye and they have sons and they have husbands and fathers and they think it's outrageous and you know I think it's been a net plus for the Republicans because the Democrats were already mad as hell or that you know\n... yeah and they already were\nFour percent in the third quarter we're going to get a an estimate right before the election you think it's going to be for\nIdeal for or slightly less than that but the average for the last half your will be four percent on the ...\nThat's a good number ... that's a very very I mean we used to say that job

I wrote it down here my theory of the Cold War as we win and they lose is that Donald Trump's opinion\nHe's a winner either went up through it All right uh that opinion was backed up by the efforts of the Reagan Administration to make the case why it is we're better than the Soviet\nThat is something that's been missing for\nSince the attack on New York and I've actually been missing since the first attack on the world trade\nCenter it has it has and and that is why\nI I I said in the book I said in why we fight I truly believe whatever happens in the next six is the president's President Trump's wall so speech will be one of the most historic speeches he gives as the forty fifth president\nBecause it's the language that we recall from the Nineteen fifties\nIt's full of the

way the speech and he says the only question before us today and I'm paraphrasing is whether we have the will to defend the values upon which our civilization is built and the fact that he gave that speech\nWay he did we ... the British Government wanted to have him in some fancy location downtown we said no the president and I'd states will give this speech next to the statue of the Warsaw Uprising where those brave\nOr polls came up from the sewers to fight the fascists that an occupied their country and\nBank fully the polish government agreed and that speech will be a historic

else that\nPredated that predated the collapse of Libya if you think about the fact so I just won a illustration that near the end of the administration those are very there was a speech the president gave a press conference where there was a overtones of ... where he said what difference is it\nWhat I call the threat do you remember that yeah so this is actually addressing candidate from what difference does it what I call the threat\nWas clearly in twenty eleven it made a big difference to the Obama administration because in twenty eleven before ISIS befall it'd be before the collapse of

now available in audio formats Apollo away the great success of December Nineteen sixty eight\nHowever he is also the author of universe and the mayor the story of Hubble and Hubble needs our attention now because there's trouble Hubble Bob a very good evening to you the trouble on a I'm a ... put it into the safe mode what is the nature of the problem\nThis is the ... this is the this is probably been the most systemic problem that has all this had since its launch after it was repaired\nUm the gyroscope that they used to keep the telescope oriented precisely um they have six on the space craft they have had three and reserved for the last few years to try to last they only need\nThree to make sure it's pointing accurately um and so the three three others have been you just put in reserve they're not running them to try to preserve than to last as long as possible so the three that were running a one failed\nAnd so uh they said um actually I should correct myself for the six gyros they had for that worked\nAnd they had one in reserve to no longer work so they had three good ones and water reserves so the\nThree gyros that were working one failed and so they decided will turn up the backup one and they turned it on and it wasn't running properly\nAnd so they turned it off again that leaves just stay with only two gyroscope se\nIt it can do research with even one gyroscope but it cannot point precisely in the same manner and produce the same kind of sharp images can do science but it can't do the sharp images that make it famous and so at the moment while they troubles shoot\nThe gyroscope that they hoped would work\nThey put the space craft into safe mode to try to preserve all the charter school while they figure out what the issue is [noise] um you know I wrote about the Hubble back in oh eight yeah and at the time I said it's the telescope that will not die I predicted then that\nCome the time when they want to de orbited the the ... they're going to send up a space of robot attached to it with engines to bring it down I was predicting\nDope they'll they'll send up a robot to fix it incentive into higher all up and keep it going the question is gyroscope stress ups have been the big problem they've replaced them all several times on shuttle missions they are moving part that failed with time and this has been the problem\nWas they might be able to get the telescope functioning for a period of time with one or two gyroscope so this is kind of similar to what they did with\n... sounds like a Kepler a replay handler yes\nIt's very similar and so they can do some research but with Hubble it's unlike capital capital was was a very small optical telescope design to look for very specific thing although it was a much larger or optical telescope design to as a general observatory for all astronauts do all kinds of research\nAnd it was designed to look at the whole sky up in space\nAnd if if they go to only one or two drivers they're gonna have to limit where it can look and it's going to limit it to its possibilities and it well\nI I I'm pretty sure the images will not be as sharp as they were before that once again they can do good science with such slightly fuzzy images stronger missed it that until ... launched with fuzzy images to the atmosphere but um we could be looking at a loss of a the only optical telescope of any we'll note in space\nAnd there is no optical telescope in the works to replace it ...\n... I I I I well I don't want to worry anymore right Huck stop worry when fresh fresh positive here Bob will come back to Hubble as we come back to curiosity as we come back to me are these are wonderful little robots and they need our attention so we'll come back we want to go to honoring Apollo ...\nThey're finally getting around to it Bob you've influence them\nOut and I think bill Anders more than anybody else\nIn the ... and ... influence than this is the the uh he was one of the three astronauts on Apollo away back in Nineteen sixty eight the first mission to go into orbit around the moon and as you point out I wrote a book or the first history of that mission genesis starve up all the way about America's great triumph too when the space race in the sixties\nUm what happened is\nWhen when bill Anders he was in charge of photography and he was in charge of basically putting together the maps that they would use his guidance navigation guidance as they were coming in and around the planet\nAnd he was in a very unique position he could recommend a lot of names to go on the on the maps to help astronauts are on this mission as well as future missions Apollo eleven to figure out where they wore and when they should do things and so he picked three ... a big craters\nI'm just on the other side of the moon as Borman level and Anders\nAnd uh you know what's the tradition there's there's the explorers get to name things while the international astronomical union that group of bought shirt\nI'm a stuffed shirt a live\nOn opposite sides in\nHis name's they refused to accept his name's back in the sixties and so what did he do he's been fighting them for years to try to get\nSome of the names that he and the other astronauts picked for the Apollo and the Apollo missions what happened this past weekend I was at an event in Chicago honoring the three astronaut they got together it was a big dinner at the museum of science and technology of fundraising for them they announced and\nI posted this on the Web page the day before with a picture um\nThat they have now named to craters which ... in view during the ... in the earth\nFamous earth rice picture the bill Anders took these two creators are in that image one a day named eight homeward that's actually an honorable woman but Borman was involved in those negotiations he didn't want to create a named after him\nBut a whole board that crater was the one he keyed on when he was navigating and firing engines and the other crater they named was Anders earth rise to the bigger crater in the earth rise image and that was to honor the earth rise image itself that he talk at a third or create a third feature\nOn the moon was officially named mounted Maryland this is a mountain that\nJim Lovell pick named it after his wife because it's a mountain that is a key landmark for the Apollo eleven landing\nAnd he named it on his own and they have finally officially recognized that this kind of a is a ... a a corrects the injustice of decades ago where they didn't name things as huge as the astronauts picked\nA the A R U is is a power game and they like to control the names of every Boulder in the universe they don't really have that right and eventually that's going to dissolve away people in space will use the names that these astronaut picked question\nBased exit Vandenberg why Bob what what do they need vinegar for\nWell they need to space what's Vandenberg stadium mother went to space sports but they need Vandenberg right now is because you really cannot do solo synchronous all these orbits around the polls from Kennedy\nShe was from a vast selection of books and magazines come one eighty eight six five seven read wine eight eight eight six five seven seven three two three\nA message from the national library service for the blind and physically handicapped\nWilliams is real estate present the real estate insider shows Sunday Morning I'm WPRI\nJoin host the robot Rhode Island most trusted advisor\nProvide you with up to date information on an ever changing industry real estate insiders has brought you buy a home loan investment bank the offices of ... and the rest of the past real estate insiders falls around ...

...\nUh each of them were captured in their own way where they all are where they all equal merit how how do you regard them now how can we great them\nWell David Gray I Would I Would regard as the sort of uh\nLeader of the bunch or he was a fighter pilot he was a very good one a prior to um the joined in a row flying before he was an army officer a he had the most experienced\nA veteran of the Indian Army as well as the joining the British Army\nAbsolutely and he was very well regarded by his men and he was an officer through and through\nWith German ... he was ...\nHe was flown with Germany was fluent in six languages or his nickname was when she ah which is essentially the Indian a version of teacher\nAnd Cecil blamed the young man\nShe's the blame was Nineteen or he was the youngest individual in his squadron also a very good pilot a but relatively inexperienced inch and brought down in September of Nineteen sixteen as well\nYes and see ... very handsome young men there photographs to accompany this and clearly there are Hollywood actors who will enjoy this part a deal especially 'cause you got to comb your hair very high ... high very high dialogue that square face talking about and cast ...\nYes Casper was probably of of the lot the least experienced pilot he was actually brought down on his very first mission over the western front um and he had come from Argentina to rejoin his country and in the fight\nAnd yet you tell stories because these men are gathered ed incoherent leave from combat across the experience none of them expect to survive let's tell the story of Jim Bennet he's flying the plane called the sun ... when he was captured by you vote how does that have\nSo to a gym is probably one of my favorite characters in this story because he later goes on to join now my nine and teach yards of escape that in World War to\nThe gym was shot down or actually Jim's engine and died while he was a an observer or tracking U boats over the north sea he came down on the water a U boat um came up from underneath literally underneath the plane they were captured ... went into the youth vote and then brought to the German\nThat's accented enough for a lifetime\nNo that is the gym lived about for life\nAnd we are the the old man Charles raft born a completely fluent in ... and British how did the Germans capture him\nWell uh uh Charles ... was a a noted flyer or he was responsible for several of a very successful bombing runs he was brought down and he was paraded by the Germans as a great prize or that they'd captured Charles rap born\nAnd he was subsequently sent to camps or an arrived it Holtzman and in a late Seventy\nYes Holtzman ... is the super cat that we're headed to a in a second war if you have a familiar with Steve McQueen criticism of his great escape\nThat was at camp that was built especially for the troublesome a skate part of the second war these are their superiors and Jim ... teaches escape tactics to the ... and ... as a representative of M. I. nine I did not know about him either until you wrote about it how does it work\nWell how it worked in this was one of the reasons I came to the story because I was reading about the history of eh my nine which was founded roughly in Nineteen thirty nine to teach the art of escape innovation or in the previous war a there was no such instruction there was no such a huge you weren't given supplies you were given compasses and math\nIn case you were shot down and so in World War two they started M. I. nine to help pilots who came down behind enemy lines\nAnd Jim Bennett who learned the art of escape in World War one was one of the lead lecturers going from air base to Arabic throughout the war and it was only until I got to a gym Bennett and read his lectures about what he did and Holtzman and ah then I came to the\nStore it occurs to me Neal and I I only speculate here that the reason the uh the escape techniques used in your book are so familiar and we see them in the great escape movie and I've read stories around the writing of that great escape movie is that Bennet is the link\nHe was teaching what you need the chemicals that camera or making friends with the camp a camp supernova ... numerous an act keeping lookouts it's all recognizable and it would have been Bennett that carries that string of knowledge into the second war\nYeah I mean it was not just then it it was a number of of of the world war one escape heroes a Bennett was probably one of a line of of of a dozen lectures but they were teaching\n'em the art of escape and they were teaching lessons that they learn and so they use the echoes in the stories and World War one and World War two\nUm and I will say that M. I. nine was remarkable organization in World War one roughly five hundred and Seventy a officers and enlisted ranks who find themselves behind enemy lines made it back to freedom in World War two those numbers amount to roughly thirty three\nThousand yes an important detail here at least in the first for what we're talking about it was incumbent upon the officers to attempt to escape at all times at that that was their orders when they were captured they were not pass if\nThey were not pass of 'em I mean there were there were a bunch there was a subset who were inveterate escaped escape is I mean you you just couldn't keep him down\nOr there were others who were told and knew that they should escape or to occupy the Germans are in preventing that up but the subset these escape artists were the ones who were were going after the walls at night and day for the moment they were kept\nAnd that's what we're addressing that subset who are supported by the whole camp all of the prisoners support them\nI've distracting keeping the guards away or supporting them with supplies everything but we're going to go to Holtzman didn't via some other camps where our heroes spend time in the book is the escape artist this is the greatest escape\nOf the of the great war of the first for one hundred years past abandoned daredevil pilots the greatest prison break the great war I'm John bachelor this is John ... or so [noise]\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nThat though I had a sinus headache for a few days but I had a master ... image of the brain and stroke\nAnd I was on my deathbed that was on a respirator in a coma for thirty five days and three months later I came home and the wheelchair double vision I had to learn to walk again to speak\nAgain why didn't want us to write the alphabet you know if I went out and did a little something might come home I'd be in bed now I'm up by lake five thirty in the morning and go to the gym I Do shopping I cook I energy all day I mean I feel great overall my whole outlook just feeling about my mental aspect everything everything is better\nFor a limited time used discount code John and we'll take thirty five percent off your first preferred sets of fruits and veggies and have them shipped to you free call eight hundred two four six eight seven five one that's one eight hundred\nTwo four six eight seven five what or go on line to balance of nature dot com and use this couch go John\nMakin lung association my painting ... original will be easier\nSaid than done for these guys for the wrong to attempt to keep harmful or if I\nCan wait [noise] finding the million man and then you get that could have been in effect on the fine print Cape ...\nDown to the I think [noise] the American lung association different than in the air raid hanging on the ... the thing is and use your how\nTournaments in the fight they tighten up or [noise] you get back to the minerals boom there can fish and fighting to protect\nThe everything they can go in and out ... years and they're finding that way\nWe are the shadow mental health is\nOn the Herald sun\nDr Joyce Berlin do the national alliance on mental illness says that families provide fifty percent of the care for people with mental illness\nAnd the families and the ones that you know taking ...\nDestruction of their habitat threatened literary [noise] the best way to protect wildlife is to protect the land where they live\nA humane society wildlife lamb from worked with private landowners to protect wildlife\nTo preserve natural habitats and establish permanent sanctuaries to learn more or to work with the humane society of wildlife lamb from coal eight hundred Seventy nine [noise] that's eight hundred seven to nine S.
