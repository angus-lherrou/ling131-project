she did some of the unwritten reporting to say yeah a Aaron Hernandez was gay or at least bisexual and ah this question about the motive as to why he killed old and Lloyd so she's got something to say today about all of\nThis morning Michele good morning thanks so much for having me on nice to have you how much of this from the Boston Globe was a surprise to you what I mean you must you know how to do a lot of it none of it\nI guess none of it and what it really is startling and I are is I seem to recall the Boston Globe gory aiding me for the exact same reporting ad that was happening live\nHow many years ago oh how many years ago or whether this was you know very soon after Odin Lloyd was shot in the back up and left in an industrial park\nYou know roughly a mile from Aaron Hernandez is home almost ... law enforcement sources were talking about our relationship he had had with a high school students\nAnd in fact one of the things that aren't did was when he was initially questioned about own murder I started moving some of his assets around and the bulk of his finances went into an account that\nA law enforcement sources for me was held by his long time ... somebody who very publicly posted\nAbout his life for ... and there's\nUm you know a boyfriend that here in the I think ... around that uh had photographs of I mean this is common knowledge and I think the most infuriating part of this series is the fact that you know they were sports reporter who openly\nAttacked me publicly attacked the inside of my reporting\nWas completely erroneous impossible and now the same newspapers writing a six part spotlight theories essentially just um I think you know picking up the thread of the reporting that I had years ago and writing with it and I think that's the part of it that's a little bit you know a disingenuous\nAlright well a ... ... ... ... what's the Boston Globe answer for that but I Want to know your original reporting\nWas not to kind of be diminished Sherman any way it was to show that I mean when they just it was it was to show that there might have been a motivation for why he killed over and looked at the may have been a connection own lawyer new things that his closet or a shadowy life that he was going to expose and maybe that's why he killed old and Lloyd speak to that\nSo I'm old Lloyd apparently had garnered some information about Aaron and there's a you know this is not somebody that was a fly by night relationship this is somebody that Aaron Hernandez very clearly cared about ... a lot ... a great deal this was obviously a relationship that starting\nHigh school and followed them all the way in the New England patriots so he cared about the person I think you know and ah oh Lloyd somehow got knowledge about the relationship and some are caused by officials believe it was because of that apartment a lot of bank when Massachusetts that his yeah they did not know about\nAnd uh apparently oh Lloyd according to Aaron Hadley will sort of derogatory remark\nAnd they were all out partying and over ... years ago I think the over here is is this girl as conversation and the next day or Lloyd it picked up and murder and if you recall\nIn he was supposed to have breakfast but Aaron and his girlfriend who was errands than a poster\nIt's actually Aaron Hernandez shot his mother in law in the box multiple times in order to maintain the sneaker\nAnd them so they see that goes to the heart of reporting why this is coming out and while you brought it out years ago that he had a gay relationship with a high school quarterback that was kept secret owned and Lloyd got wind of it and we believe Aaron Hernandez killed old and Lloyd because of that he was going to expose them and that would harm
