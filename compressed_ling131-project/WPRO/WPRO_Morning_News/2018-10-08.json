sold to force that a big developer of offshore wind farms are all around the world they like we're doing here in Rhode Island by the whole thing I understand about half a\nHalf a billion dollars let me get the latest the Jeff ... runs deepwater wind or he used to be in the Curie administration when this whole thing got off the ground and they built it and now the whole thing's going to be sold but he's going to stay on board Jeff you their morning\nHey good morning gene I gotta thank you for a lot every day that I have to not to introduce me so I guess like\nWell it's a classic place over here but I'm a Columbus Day to a couple a couple of different\nPackage Columbus they turn right that great Italian ... ... exactly\nAll school back in the valley falls Italian\nThere you go a Jeff this let me off the top that I haven't had time to restart just I'm just gonna give you my off the top memories of deep water would\nYou used to work together like a cheery this started off on the governor could Sherry all the planning things like that he's he was a big supporter gave us the okay was pushed through various administrations you actually got these things built in running off block island they generate electricity send it back to the mainland\nAre and you would now are big ab became a sizeable company because you have other projects in the wind\nSo to speak and now comes the news that the whole thing everything we've developed here in Rhode Island\nUh is going to be sold to the Danish and my understanding that correctly\nWhile you're partly correct gene I think what's going on here that the biggest company in the world does stuff has got to invest Rhode Island so they're they're going to set up shop here in Rhode Island it over a hour operation and we're going to merge with them and where they are in Providence we're going to grow our operation province\nBut I think it's a good day because it's not every day that accompany this big with uh uh this kind of leading position and their industry decides to come in to Rhode Island and it\nAll right let's just it's pretty simple understand they're going to buy for five hundred million dollars you're going to stay on board and they like what we're doing here and they're going to take your projects are your plans and expand upon them and these these guys are other world leaders so that's good for you I said everybody's making good\nWhere yeah they just kind of super charges our plans to build out this industry here in the United states that allows us to increase our our footprint near Rhode Island and hire more people locally allows us to accelerate our plans to invest in ... and things like that\nBut I think it's good I mean probably going to be one of the industry because of world leaders coming right here ...\nAll right I understand I I guess some people would say well how come the foreigners are going to control everything how come we're not keeping control of this as an American company why don't don't we see the value of the prophet and here how come how come nobody like GE or a ... months anybody didn't come in by why are we turning everything over to the foreign as\nWell you know we do have GE turbine spinning right off the blackout right now the company that made the trip on\nYou know we're the big competitive the global marketplace when you've got a big global company that's operating in Asia and Europe and all across America a that says you know we want to go and that by a company and get out Rhode Island and set up shop in Rhode Island I think we should welcome\nAll right well uh what we found other foreign entities the citizens bank used to be foreign owned and stop and shop and all the so it's not unusual particularly in a global world will be a global investments or said these guys are big deals over in Europe and elsewhere\nThey are so are the worst started in Denmark but there are publicly traded company in Europe they have over a thousand wind turbines operating in the ocean right now yeah mostly northern Europe but they're expanding Asia South America and we're going to be helping them run their us\nA North American operation right out of your product\nYou don't have to answer any secrets or anything do you want to disclose but how how long are these guys but in the wind how long did they know about it and whether they just waiting to get our turbines up and say okay we got to go well let's go and how long have they been talking to you\nWhat we've been competing with gene for a long time you know we've been competing with them here in the United states for\nSix or seven years uh and uh it was no secret that are that these are two companies that made a lot of sense to get together because our company deep water really knows how to get things that the United states we know how to get a permit I you know how to deal with local stakeholders\nWe know how to deal with the utilities locally all that sort of thing but they really know how to build things in the ocean okay so it really is taking the best of both\n... is a good day because it's not every day that a company that big a deal with a a kind of leading they and their industry decide to come to Rhode Island and\nJeff ... deepwater wind says this day aboard the ... the uh the new farm they are going to name this ...
