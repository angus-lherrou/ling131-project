O.\nThese twisted these warped pays unelectable and he's on the radio Saturday mornings at eleven AM pays ... the former congressional candidate retired army helicopter pilot here to take a look at politics pop culture than\nThen about Mm half of Americans are vitamin D deficient but but many people many scientists now thinking the ideal level is forty in many of us now think actually the ideal level is closer to fifty and if you use the cut off the fifty than Ninety seven percent of Americans are vitamin D deficient\nYou let me ask you this when when people start supplementing properly supplementing vitamin D was the product like purity products that five thousand I use per day what kind of a difference and they can make them feel better\nYeah that probably the first thing that they'll notice as an effect on their feelings of wellbeing and moved by wellbeing I just mean this feeling that\nYou know you want to live you know in some ways what's the point of going on for a month to month to month where you you know you get up and go is gone and you're you just don't really feel like doing anything you know you're not excited about anything anymore you your mood level is low and and that's one of the first thing that\nAnd the clues that we had a sort of interesting the clues we had to move are very similar to the close we had for heart healthy you're going to talk about that later but\nBut people who live the closer you live to the equator the better your mood the higher you live closer to the sun so the higher the out\nThe two that you live at the better your mood\nAnd mood improved in\nThe summertime so mood improved in the summertime and worse than in the wintertime now those were clues that vitamin D was somehow involved but just recently there have been a number of studies listen to this spot and the American Journal of geriatric psychiatry they looked at hundreds of people this is what they found they found that people with\nThe lowest vitamin D levels\nWere eleven time eleven times more likely to have a low mood and then professor Reinhold Veit at the University of Toronto actually did an intervention will study where he gave about three hundred patients four thousand units of vitamin D for a year or so\nAnd what stood out was their feelings of wellbeing and prove they're feeling of wanting to live life\nAnd they can feel a difference when they start to supplement Ropper language she takes about a month yeah All right let me let me get this special offer 'cause I'm watching the clock here purity has put together fantastic offer you got the vitamin D at the recommended dosage the five thousand I use per day\nYou've also asked them to combine it with their omega three fish oils and there's a reason for that I Want you to explain that the synergy you get they seemed to make each other even work better plus you're really excited about the fact that you talk to them into a pretty good for your pain for shipping the shipping deals pretty good\nYeah when I approached purity I said you know vitamin D needs again at the special form of vitamin K the expensive foreign vitamin K to it\nNeeds the boar on and I want it to be the patented bore on and it needs magnesium and it needs think and we'll talk about why that's important but then I said it also needs fish oil there to work together synergistic play\nAnd this is what I Want you to do I want you to give away a bottle of vitamin D a month's supply that sixty capsule\nAnd a bottle of the molecularly distilled ultra pure fish or I Want you to give it away for free and they kind of laughed and they said okay I Will do it and they asked me why and I said because in a month most people will feel the difference and they'll come back for more\nBut then I said you know I don't want any Nineteen Ninety five shipping and handling charge I don't want any fourteen Ninety five shipping and handling charge I don't want\nEven a nine Ninety five shipping and handling when you get less than five dollars they agreed to a shipping and handling charge you for Ninety five to four Ninety five you\nGet a free bottle of vitamin D a month's supply of the complete formula one you can't buy anywhere else in a month's supply of\nFish oil what are you going to lose right right what do you have\nTo lose and the reason the purity agree to do this is because the executives there now themselves have been on this formula and they themselves and know that you'll feel so much better after a month that you'll come back for\nMore it's one thing I like about the surety their old school they put their money where their mouth ... they do business the way companies used to do business you're in this country there are so doggone confident in their product they know after you've tried for a month you're going to come back you're going to become a repeat customers that's why they stand behind the free offer more from our gas doctor can now coming up at first I Want to talk to you

they go from being vitamin D deficient as you say or to becoming vitamin D sufficient how should they be sealing what should they see differently\nWell the first thing that you'll notice there's a feeling in your wellbeing and you're just thing clear but as time goes on if you'll notice differences in your gums and teeth and if you ask anybody who's taking this product and has taken it for several months just ask them about their fingernail\nAsk them what's that change with the difference than your fingernail now these are things you can experience through the now\nWhat does it does it do to your fingernails grow quicker\nThey become harder they become less critical really shiny or it's really a remarkable change in your finger now but it takes more than a month because it takes about six months for the fingernails to grow up [noise]\nBut these are things we can see and feel vitamin D. effects thirty six Oregon so wow I Can't feel what it's doing and you're paying ...\nA you know what it's doing for your blood pressure and you know or your prostate\nBut we don't have time to talk about these thirty six Oregon but what we're talking about is the immune system\nThe pancreas the heart\nBlood pressure muscle strength and brain activity prostate health breast health colon health bone marrow teeth and gums kidney lung retina skin stomach uterus I mean I could go on but again because activated vitamin D is a theory hormone\nIt can affect all these Oregon's because there's two thousand gene that it is the key to those teams\nAnd it depends upon which Oregon it is and which gene is involved so there's\nTwo thousand mechanism of action that's very important to understand because you know we'd been jaded with vitamin claims vitamin C. and vitamin either going to feel better you're going to do this you're going to\nIts cetera and so people find it hard to believe I mean the vitamin D only did one thing they'd find it easier to believe but they just have to remember the mechanism of action which is unique to any vitamin\nYou mentioned Colin health here in my family physician as a precautionary move put me on a pretty healthy dose of vitamin D what's the connection\nYeah well the reason you're gastroenterologist did that is because there's just a wealth of studies now that are coming out showing that coal and health and vitamin D levels are connected but pat they're the same studies about breast tell the same studies about prostate health\nThis is like an insurance policy ... you're not to not to take this and it's it's free [laughter] yeah and\nAnd the other thing I Want to say is you're listening in five years I don't want you to say I didn't know about this I was never told I mean five years from now I don't want you to turn around and say I didn't know about I Wish I would've known\nBecause you've been polled at right now you're being told you know you can't say you never you never knew about it 'cause I'm telling you right now it's involved for example in a number of places in the country if you walk into emergency room with anything that might be your heart you know what they do\nThey give you a hundred thousand units right off the bat first thing a hundred thousand years of vitamin D day and then they keep giving\nThem into a failure to question speaking of the cardiovascular system I Know you could probably talk for about thirty minutes on this but some of the information you're sitting here just fascinating what vitamin D does talk about its role in maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system\nAnd same clues we know that heart health is better the closer you lifted the equator we know heart health is better in the summer than the winter but just recently there have been a slew of studies out of the best universities in the world all connecting\nYour vitamin D level to your heart healthy ... there's a study for example out of Harvard by a friend of mine professor Edward given ichi and his conclusion was pretty stark here it is quote\nLow levels of vitamin D or associated with higher risk integrated man\nEven after controlling for known rest\nThat is even after they control for smoking high blood pressure high triglycerides diabetes all the things known to contribute even after they control for that\nThere was the wrong effect of vitamin D day\nSharing insights from the Bible or the writings of Mary Baker eddy ... says two questions and share how we can experience life full of exhausting love Julian satisfaction\nMy understanding and living a spiritual nature as God's perfect creation I'm\nI'm ready to politician and with us now to answer questions on the topic as how can I experience a satisfying life is Christian Science practitioner mark anger thanks for joining us today mark it's good to be here Rita well some thoughts to get us started sure\nYou know I think a simple idea we can start with this something that most people can relate to and that is simply that we feel are best we're most happy we're most satisfied\nWhen we're helping others rather than thinking about ourselves you know I I think we feel good because we are actually being who we really are we were made\nTo be you know unselfish loving kind generous and so forth\nYou know in the world the focus is too often on being materialistic and selfish and vengeful and greedy et cetera and that is just not satisfying so I think the first point is that\nSatisfaction has to do with an selfishness and love and giving however I Would say that you know we have to take this higher than just being a good person there has to be a spiritual element to our lives\nAnd it seems like the most satisfying quest is developing our relationship with our creator God are true father and mother which is the source of our love and goodness and on selfishness\nAnd that source never runs dry or get weary we can constantly draw on it\nYou know Christ Jesus certainly did he said I Can't up my own self do nothing and he also said I see not my own will but the will of the father which has sent me and I have found that to be very good advice for satisfaction\nAnd I think Jesus summed up the most satisfying life in what are known as the two great commandments love God with all your heart and soul in mind and strength and your neighbor as yourself\nAnd then he goes into great detail about how exactly we do this on a human level in\nHis sermon on the mount which is in the book of Matthew in the Bible chapters five six and seven and that can be anyone's guy so I think maybe that should get us started\nWell that's a great lead in here to our first question which is from a Lulu in Missouri and she writes early on I always thought having a husband children how good job where what was needed to experience a satisfying life\nBut now that I have all those things I can see that there's more dissatisfaction so what do we need for truly satisfying life\nWill I Would say Lulu now you know ah [laughter] you know and that's a step in the right direction um you see this kind of a experience that you're having is what causes us\nTo go to something higher it drives us to God it doesn't seem to matter how much good we have humanly\nWithout God without the real spiritual substance of life we will never be satisfied first of all it is God that his giving you all that good and it's helpful if we recognize that what you can do now\nIs use all those things as vehicles to a more satisfying life\nBy bringing got into the picture actually not only bring got into the picture but make sure your love of God is kept front and center in relation to everything that matters to you\nAs you develop your relationship to God you will find that you're able to love your family more do more for them do more with your job and you know I say this from experience and my wife and I have always found that if we make a priority of knowing and serving God in our lives\nIt is helped our relationship beyond what I can say we are faithful to God and we love each other more out of that and it gives each of us something to bring to the table rather than you know looking to each other for satisfaction\nSo feeling you're one this with God makes all your relationships better so how do we do this well with our spouses and our children we can develop more guys like qualities of love and kindness and patients and so forth which is the substance of your life\nUsing your job you can learn and expressed God like qualities of humility peacemaking goodness holiness helpful in us and so forth\nAnd that's the substance of that activity which satisfies so when I found that you know really no one or nothing on this earth can match the blessings and happiness and comfort in love and\nSatisfaction that come from God or divine love and the ... says blessed to be the lord who daily loaded with us with benefits even the God of our salvation and you know also I'll just share with you that in my marriage for example\nWhen I was uh thinking about marriage um even at that time in my life I was really wanting to put God first because I knew God had all the best for me\nAnd so I was praying about should I get married um how should I think about this is this really the best thing I can do\nAnd as I was praying about it I was reading the text book of Christian Science which helps explain the Bible it's science and health with key to the scriptures that Mary Baker eddy wrote in Iran across this a couple of sentences answered my question\nAnd so see what you think about this but it said be not in haste to take the vow until death do us part\nConsider its obligations that's responsibilities it's relations to your growth and tea or influence\nAnd other lives and that for me was the answer I felt like in this particular case at this particular time\nWith this particular woman that\nMarriage would actually be a a strength to my spiritual growth I Would grow through developing that relationship and working in it and I have to say I haven't been disappointed [laughter] on that score a there's a lot of growth that goes with learning to you know be with somebody\nAnd also I feel like it's helped me in my life to have more influence and do good for others and and both of us actually came to that agreement that we felt by by being married that we could\nDo more for others and and that's proved to be the case so I felt like you know just to give you an example that's just a way of taking it even higher\nI Love that mark it's such a practical answer really gives you some specific steps that you know we all can take this leads now onto our next question from I'm Dorothy in Boston and she writes\nWhat are some practices I can adopt to stay happy common I'm stressed each day I find that sometimes it feels like a roller coaster and I just want to stay in a war a free state of joy\nYeah that's good and Dorothy I say I've discovered this really does take discipline you know I found to get off the rollercoaster\nThis rollercoaster that you're talking about I think is something that we all have to deal with at some point and um I've found that the roller coaster actually comes from focusing on the world you know thinking like a worldly woman or man in a world of lacking competition and\nComparisons and pride\nStriving for self worth looking to others for validation and so forth\nAnd that keeps us on a rollercoaster with you know some days we have highs and some days we have loews\nAgain I feel first of all the desire to discover and express our spiritual self who we really are as God's Children find our connection or one this with God is what\nWill really steady us and bring that deep joy and satisfaction that we want to feel especially if we want to contribute more to the good of the world a piece of the world you know and help others\nI Know for me early on in my\nSpiritual growth in study in the in the scriptures and so forth I I was definitely on a roller coaster and\nUh I I discovered it and and uh what I what I discovered was that I Would study the Bible I Would pray and I would get to feeling really good and really hot and\nThen once I started feeling really good I saw it on the left my studies and my prayer behind you know I kinda is like almost like and I didn't need God so much because things were going so well but inevitably I'd always start you know heading back down the roller coaster and I I ... I went back to my books and my\nBut I also have a feeling that to a certain extent um conceding human perfectionism was the genuine strike to gain a little each day in the right direction\nAnd appreciate any thoughts you have to share about how we can feel satisfied with our daily activity on a day to day basis\nWell first of all let me just thank you for giving your life to the world in this way and I'll say from one fulltime practitioner to another welcome to the club of striving to stay focused and to do better [laughter]\nYou know again I find it takes much discipline to strive to be a disciple and he'll is Jesus taught us and yes focus is a big part of that discipline it's a constant challenge to maintain our thought free from\nThe distractions of the world so we can be the best healers so I Would say keep at it know that it is not a personal challenge to you you know in one of Mrs ... articles a called the new birth she writes this\nAs one grows into the man who are womanhood of Christianity one find so much lacking and so very much requisite to become holy Christ like that one set\nThe principle of Christianity is infinite it is indeed God and this infinite principle have infinite claims on man and these claims are divine not human and man's ability to meet them is from God\nFor being his likeness an image man must reflect the full dominion of spirit even at supremacy overseeing sickness and that\nSo you know just be grateful that you're in the work you're doing a great service to mankind through your dedication of prayer and just keep at it\nAnd remember that it was the religious leaders of Jesus' day the ... seem to lean towards human perfectionism because the letter of the law was more important to them than the spirit therefore they seemed to lack the love that Jesus had which healed and save people\nAnd this work takes great humility great love so cultivate that in yourself we also depend totally on the grace of God each new\nDe ... says in science and health what we most need is the prayer of fervent desire for growth in grace expressed in patients meet this love and good deeds so keep it up\nRight you know this next question is just very short and to the point they write how important is dedicated Bible study and prayer to finding satisfaction\nI Will say Bible study of prayer happens to be my method for finding what I feel has been lasting satisfaction and for me satisfaction means that I feel peaceful content you know not wanting anything more than what I have\nEven being willing to let go of everything in this world for a higher purpose if that's necessary you know which to me would be to bless others to glorify God I find a greater sense of gratitude comes with being satisfied also getting into your car for example to drive somewhere and being\nNaturally just grateful for it it brings out a greater sense of loved to loving your home the ...\nIn your life being so grateful for even your pet you know your cat or dog getting to spend time with them knowing that all this good is coming from God an infinite source of good\nAnd all the things on this earth or just symbols of the goodness of God so we don't need to hang on to any of it are we are you know grateful for the simple so good that is not what satisfies\nIf everything we have is gone tomorrow we have the love of God and the term abundant goodness of God with us and we will always have everything we need it's truly not the things in fact I'll just share something that happened to me one time I was a\nVisiting inmates in jail in the city jail and uh I was spending a few days a week there actually and you know talking with them about a spiritual things and helping them transform their lives and\nI loved it man I loved I loved giving that way even though you know it was a sacrifice to me because there are a lot of things I wasn't doing to do this but I I did love it and\nI went I remember one day and when you go into the help to visit somebody ah it's anything but homey you know you hear a door ... locked behind you and then you go into another area that door locks behind you and pretty soon you get to where you're going and\nI was sitting there waiting for an inmate to come and visit ah that I had called and um I had this overwhelming sense of just feeling at home it was amazing I mean it was just it wasn't just a thought or anything it was just uh I just felt\nSo at home and it was so astonishing to me that I\nI kind of looked around and I observed like where I was and they noticed I'm sitting in this little room with a cinder block wall that are painted shiny beige with Plexiglas windows\nAnd shiny tile floor you know the square grade tiles in a\nForest that lady that was sitting at a steel cable I mean it was anything by homey and yet I felt at home and I had to think it had to be because\nI ... I was feeling God I mean I was really praying to so that could help these people and I I feel that I was feeling the Christ which is the spirit of God right then and there and I felt at home so\nAgain it's it's not the the things it's it's what what are we thinking what are we doing\nWell marked that's all the questions we have time for the day but for anyone who has not heard the answer to that question they can go to Jesse stash online dot com and search how can I experienced a satisfying life here at the entire program\nThat saw program for this week\nIf you'd like to hear more sense no lunch programs you can subscribe to Jay is H online dot com\nThanks for being with us today on this edition of send to know what\nA week the production of the Christian Science center though ...

there are not a whole lot of units available are vacancy rate is so low so if you're lucky enough to find an apartment\nUm\nTo find it ... and with the rent that you can afford is really difficult so in Providence for example some of the one bedroom apartments that we're looking at are twelve Thirteen hundred dollars a month for a one bedroom apartment in the urban core\nUm and so what we really need to do is talk with\nOur legislators about putting in a permanent funding stream for housing and homeless services\nUm you know we have a housing bond that was approved by the voters right uh recently and that's really great but we can't keep doing it based on just bond right we need to find a permanent funding stream to create more housing\n[noise] okay if you're just joining us I'm even ... filling in for Deborah Gere oh who's running for state rep I Jamestown in Middletown and my guests this morning as ... the c._e._o. of crossroads Rhode Island so how is crossroads funded\n[noise] we are funded from a variety\nOf sources uh public as well as private um and we so we receive a probably a little over\nHalf of our funds from grants through federal and state government\nUm and then we receive I'm about Twenty one percent of our income is from rent on the properties that we own and about Seventeen percent comes from very generous Rhode islanders individuals' um foundations family and community foundations as well as corporations in Rhode Island supporting our work\nAnd um how long has trust her it's been around\nSo next year crossroads we'll be celebrating our one hundred and twenty fifth anniversary we were founded in Eighteen Ninety four as travelers aid helping travelers find their way and over the last century have moved into supporting homelessness and housing\nAnd how have you grown since then hundred and twenty five year Lincoln very donor yeah [laughter] um [noise] you know we started as a as a\nYou know a place to help those who were lost in the bus station and you know interestingly to a certain extent that's sort of what we still do we help people who are lost in their life and and need to get back on track\n'em but you do so much more though where a lot more sophisticated or and how we're doing that it's it's um [noise] we are using evidence based practices that we know work to address the root cause of the person or family's situation\nUm and it's not just\nGiving them a meal or letting them do their laundry or take a shower it's really at the core of what they need and that's a stable place to live which makes so much sense I mean you it just\nYou see evidence based and and I know we know that from the social service and\nAs to how to do it but it just makes sense think about what we do as families right somebody you step in and you try to help is there any chance that that's going to happen again are we going to go back to the triple decker is where the\nGrandparents were on the second floor and the parents were on the first floor and and that kind of family or taking care of each other I mean you can tell that's why I'm In my heart because that's how I grew up\nI don't think it would be the worst thing in the world I mean it's um you know housing works recently did a study and what they found was\nUm the number of housing units that are needed are really the multi family type housing unit so I'm trying to find the number I think it's I'm about thirty five hundred new units of housing\nEach year to meet the demand particularly from millennials and seniors and so we're talking about people that are older than us and people that are younger than us are really struggling to find a for double housing so\nThat wouldn't be the worst thing\nRight it just seems to me that it was just at\nThe model that just made sense especially when you have so many people from ethnic background you know I grew up obviously in a tally in household and I look at it and I say you know that's how my mother was able to go out to work that's how you know that was the first face when I saw when I came home and we have so many immigrants now coming into our state\nYou're kind of hope that that model goes back again but um it's just it's so funny we move so far away from that with all independence and what have you and it seems like it's a full circle part of it just I'm just my ideas of looking at it\nKaren what's the hardest part of the job at cross roads\n[noise] um the hardest part of my job is preparing for radio interviews [laughter] that's kidding\nI'm really the hardest part is um\nIs seeing the young children the babies and and our senior citizens sleeping on the floor and we literally have had that this past summer\nMore babies and children and families sleeping in our overflow room than than we have seen in past summer and it's it's just this incredibly frustrating feeling because we know what the solution is we know how to do the work\nBut we don't have\nAll of the resources we need to get them out of there and move them as quickly as we can to get into their own apartment\nSure I see even myself as the executive director of close to kids Rhode Island uh we do the clothing part of it for the kids in school and yet when the moms come in and Ninety nine percent of the time it's the moms when they come in they really need so much more so we try to talk to them about cross roads and the other agencies that are out there doing great work\nBecause people that are struggling in one area usually a struggling in multiple areas so um the collaboration between groups I think is just so important on to serve the individuals um let's take a break\nThese Christmas or here's your exclusive your weather forecast\nClouds in some somebody breaks today to hire fifty six mainly cloudy

and result in the morning and in the early afternoon type their fifty seven with WPRI was explicit vacuum other meteorologist the Travis\nAccuweather on the voice of southern New England news talk not seven of them and I am six thirty WPRI [noise]\n\nMorning and welcome to the cumulus community I haven't been on the news I agree and showing six thirty seven of them WPRI rosy joining us on our Sunday Morning as we\nLook into some of the ballot questions that will be on the ballot Israel head on to the polls are next month ago to focus on the question\nNumber three this is the a green economy and clean water bond so forty seven point three million dollars at a place to be placed on the ballot other series of environmental\nA related projects across the state the director of advocacy uh at the same debate is with this whole for him but he's been here in the past and joined us tofu welcome in good to have either thanks for having me like you for a for a for joining us here to talk again about question of three again forty seven million dollars\nUm it's a series of projects\nThat are being pushed a lot of this focuses on things like coastal resiliency clean water\nDredging and the problem it anybody who sees water fire you know how showed up to the river is down there are also water treatment facilities damn safety as well that that's an issue that's been out there are always worried about them heavy rain storms here a\nLot of damage to call back quite a lot of years in a long long out there to the people who built them so or the ... century until something bad happens becomes a real issue so no less well come in and uh how important is it that the Rhode islanders take a good look at this question and uh you would want them to vote to approve it next month\nWe we we we are encouraging overt island voters to vote yes it's very important to the state you know ... as you said it's ... it's a it's a package of of projects and initiatives that\nAre in total really represents a major investment in the quality of life of of Rhode Island and and uh as you know we were the islanders have a very strong sense of place\nAnd we as as much as we get down in our state sometimes we also are never honest when I say [laughter] and and ah one of the great a\nNational success stories is actually the reclamation Narragansett Bay you know just um Thirty years ago the problems river wasn't open sewer and and it is because Rhode islanders have chosen to\nSay yes to these ballot ballot questions or the wastewater treatment plants that keep the baby clean had been upgraded and and\nAnd uh now really protect the bay and and what was once and open sewers now place that's used extensively for\nFishing um community boating kayaking walking along the shore so what questions three does actually builds upon those clean water improvements in other improvements we made in our state and uh and and and uh it it's it's\nIt's the same time it also looks to the future and addresses issues that are um lead climate change\nThere were also a on the on the ballot as well we talked a little bit about some of the uh the economics as well or local recreation is on the ballot bike ways which we all love these ... these ... it's just a couple of miles away open space farmland and brown fields as well as the the really is a kind of a of a long laundry list of projects that that go into this or\nThat that go into the are going to the question here it's we we both do to approve won the forty seven million dollars when I'm voting on the separate project says it's just the one right all of these products roll them it's a package of ... what what what's the what's what stands out here again let's let's go down the ... some of the list here coastal resiliency and public access\nA and again this is all broken down five million dollars what what what would that focus\nSo close to ... in public access piece of this is directly related to climate change\nA we know for a fact that Cesar rising and in fact in the last century the seas have risen almost a foot here in Rhode Island alone [noise] and\nUh we also are indeed seeing more frequent and intense storm events more coastal erosion more flooding and so these great places that are the property of the public\nThe parks along the bay longer ways are now getting damage than or risk because these will continue to rise\nAnd I'm storms will continue to pound away at the coast\nSo I think the best example bill is India point park in Providence a it is a and I kind of ... love used by hundreds of thousands of people every year well if you go down to the a side of India point park that's closest to the Washington Bridge it's actually keeping in\nThat that part of um the city is actually you know cold dump and um it is caving in um high tides actually are now encroaching on to the ... the bike paths and walk waves at the edge of the part of the city of Providence needs some assistance to help 'em not only shore up\nThe that quarter of a neat point park but but maybe move the bike pass in what ways back away from where the tides now getting higher and the city might need to raise some of that land up so it can still be used by the public for\nYou know picnicking walking hiking fishing all those great things that people love to do it and you point park right and that's just one site on among dozens around there is today\nThis is just I mean this is a I mean to me or a time of investment the investment overall across for for climate that's going to be untold you know city cities around the country are taught at Boston New York I mean multibillion dollar projects or I mean I just I mean this is talk about a down payment or you know it's a down\nPayment you know just taking the long view um save debate is again going to support legislation that has been introduced in the journal assembly the last couple of years actually\nThe average a permanent dedicated funding for these kinds of projects and and ah we think there is going to be growing support in the assembly for\nUm for establishing that program I'm recalling the rivers and coastal adaptation find 'em every city in town needs help dealing with these problems overwhelming and they can't go it alone so an investment by state voters\nOr as you said a down payment on and on the future is very important\nAnd we're not the only ones obviously I'd miss penalties up and down the entire east coast are are are dealing with the this is well same thing uh in regards to ah see rise of the what what you're calling facility\nResilience here for the water treatment plants obviously we're all familiar with is the facility at fields point in fact there your neighbors over there right around but their numbers sewage treatment plants but but all of them very you know faced various\nChallenges by by high water just we're just a couple of years by the way out of separating the with the waste water that goes into the into the bay and that was that was\nAnd that massive massive project there's still another phase of that to go but so the state has their Nineteen wastewater treatment plant so a big case your listeners are wondering Everytime you flush a toilet goes somewhere to go somewhere and it goes down to waste were not forgotten plants are which are of course located right next to the bay\nAre right on the banks of rivers but because they treat our waist and then just charge you know if it goes much cleaner form into our waterways\nThose facilities because they are on the uh right at the water's edge\nAre at risk from flooding from storm events and things like that so uh everyone remembers the ...\nWill be remembered because the ... the ... plant is right next to the highway when they built the ah the permit breached well it I mean they were they were trucks that were flooded up to their uh ... what is it the cabs there and it's All right ...\nIf it's Hudson River swelled over Spanx it engulf the wastewater treatment plant right up the homeowners and businesses work had sewage backing up into their homes because of it and it was a real catastrophic event but work responded\n'em by I'm pulling together the funding I think some federal funding actually build a big new and flip from around the entire facility or well every wastewater treatment plant in Rhode Island all the the Eighteen other ones are are faced with similar challenges and things and um they don't you know this is\nMoney they probably had planned on spending ten years ago right but uh now here we are and ah you know east Providence has been flooded out there that they're all at risk and I'm so some infusion of funds as needed to help them actually secure and fortified them those ... we were treatment plant\nDon't think about it till it's a problem and I didn't really that's the way a lot of roads and bridges and other things going about it and go back into the way back machine you know when that happens\nThe flood there I mean that that I Ninety five from that little trickle of water I mean you'll see a drive in that I Ninety five of the airport connector could've been up to the medium there I was unprecedented in remarkable at all these flights as you say are along the water they all need to function they cannot not function other and I should say real problems\nAnd some of them um may overtime need to actually be relocated because they're too much in harm's way and I'm that'll cost a lot of them at all costs more money than building of arm around for sure\nIt is not going to be cheap or we'll see this water fire and and we've seen this now for many years those rivers that we moved all those years ago right the\nUh seven million dollars to dredge the or the Providence a river very important project right for for everything that goes on down there trying to get ... it's very very tough marine trafficking only the smallest boats accountable and you can get down there because the water gets so shallow down there\nPeople in that I like to get out they liked to go um hiking daylight peace and quiet and the open spaces that are protected around the state I'm really are entitled to our quality of life um farmland\n... which is also here on this is yeah\nThere was an investment and farmland protection you know we're ... we're a small state with not a lot of land and we have a growing food economy if you look at in cities towns\nUm suburbs everywhere you see farmers markets on the weekends selling local produce\nLocal farming is on the rise ... pressure to develop farmland and for other uses is also intense so by developed by purchasing the development rights to farms we can keep farms in the hands of farmer farming families and allow that land to be cultivated actually expand um the land it's because\nIt's a very difficult decision for families right if you you know farming is not easy and a lot of times you have to work fulltime job elsewhere [laughter] you know with the family certainly has to do it and the latest more valuable than what you're doing and in many cases\nRight that's right so it's still buying those development rights enables um that that prime agricultural land to stay prime agricultural land and again you think about the restaurants are in Rhode Island that are using locally grown produce now I mean it's remarkable think of all the people that work there that depend on those restaurants\nAnd those farms to make a living as a really big impact in the state\nRun feel developments we talked about that over the years they've the pay is always focused on that as well brown feels very important to put these though you know facilities back to work right into use especially some of the ... some of the some of the summer a city areas and not spread out as much as we do right foot them back to\nWork in Rhode Island has I think the state doesn't actually know how many contaminated sites have good I'm Glad we are facing the death of a revolution [laughter] ah\nBut but yes there are sites that um were contaminated way back when they need to be cleaned up in order to be used and if they're not cleaned up those lay follow and and ... which they oughta Rosemary happening right right\nThat's right so um uh there there are lots of federal dollars to be um leverage by state investments in uh the clean up the sites and their redevelopment as a mixed use as as homes as offices um\nAs community facilities so I'm just like the clean water portion of this but um\nYou know invest in investment of a dark and actually you know many more dollars of federal investment and also private development and so it's a great um again a small investment for big return\nI forgot to mention too on those clean water projects with for drinking water that's right beside you have to\nInfer wastewater treatment plants every dollar that Rhode Island commits to these projects um leverage is federal for for federal dollars so they're seven point nine million dollars in this green economy clean water bond for clean water projects we will\nYield about forty million dollars in federal support\nSo it's an environmental advocate and you've certainly been was are making the case for save the bay and they're against the pay for many years or are you happy what we're seeing is this is this uh this question a solid commitment to the environment is it on line of what other states are doing with our neighbors are doing here are we doing better than them tell us what you've\n... it's hard to compare I'm we're so focused on on a on the bay and and what we do have to say we're super focused on the road I direct for better or for worse of [laughter] I'm I'm I'm heartened by that\nLong supportive Rhode Island just these ballot question um I we never counter chickens but ... always said yes and said yes and that actually to um ballot questions that invest from Narragansett Bay\nAnd our waterways and reclamation of diesel dirty does too great track record and I think ... you know you just know how important is to worst states uh wellbeing\nQuestion number three you get on the ballot forty seven point three million dollars to various a green economy and clean water bonding here in Rhode Island so for him to work and people get more information on these various projects if you're interested in looking at all\nSure that they can go to yes on three All right the Facebook page that can also go to save me dot org\nGotcha you got to go back and talk about

A. N. G. so Facebook\nApple Amazon Netflix and Google that so they've\nRefer to as the fangs sought years but\nNow they're referring to\nAnd plus Microsoft so they've added that another all technology based stocks so when you look at those six stocks in earlier October before the correction\nSixty four percent of the growth of the U.S some peace five hundred\nWas related to those six company so six companies out of five hundred accounted for sixty four percent of the growth of the some ... five hundred\nSo people are looking at the index and say gee the next ... my portfolio is not following it or near it well if you weren't heavily invested in those six stocks that we're all high tech\nThan you wouldn't have have seen as big a rise in your portfolio and that is on the aggressive side if you're in all that technology\nNow when you look at it the corruption that we had early October it was those six that again cause that pulled back so they had a minor correction within the technology area\nBecause they were overheated this year they had grown way too much in a very short period of time so the market will quote unquote corrected meaning some people are saying wow I really made a boatload of money I'm going to take some profits off the table\nAnd then that that's going to drive other people to sell if the if the selling drives the market down or the costs of that stock down other people might get triggered for their cell orders so that goes out five or ten percent it might cause other people to trigger a south which drives that don't deeper\nAnd that's the kind of feeds on itself so when we look at what happened those six stocks drove up the market and they kind of cause that correction and then we'll see what happens as we go forward but we don't feel too strongly about buying into those six socks at this point because they're way over heated in our opinion\nSo as I mentioned a moment ago we always want to look at the fundamentals and if the fundamentals are so strong meaning is unemployment low\nOr people working you know is a things stable in the economy itself are retail purchasing numbers looking strong well those are fundamental issues so if the fundamentals are good\nWe anticipate that these quick corrections will again kind of recover now we don't never know how long that would be or how quickly that could be but the fundamentals are so strong\nAnd it's just the way that we look at our clients portfolios and where their position if that sounds interesting to you our number here is for one three three three eight thousand\nIf you save two hundred thousand or more of your retirement give us a call we would love to sit with you take you through our proprietary process or the mass Yemeni retirement road map\nAnd we will do a deep dive into your portfolio and show you exactly from a technical perspective where you are\nAnd of course we do our best to make that simple so that you understand it the feedback we get from our listeners is always has been wonderful it really has where people say wow I never knew so much about my investments until you showed me this report\nAnd I often hear well gee whiz my advisor never showed me that I'm not sure why but we think that's key and fundamental you need to know where you were to day before you can make good strong investment decisions going forward that number again is for one three three three eight thousand\nI Want to tie financial fundamentals with you Jeff to protect us from volatility the volatility we see on Wall street what is a fundamental you think we should start with\nWell the first fundamental is is to ensure that your assets are appropriately diversified now by diversified you know everybody here is that where it wasn't me well I mean methodically allocating assets across various classes you know you've got stocks mutual funds exchange traded funds\nAnd potentially some new disease which of course we prefer the fixed variety because the variables I just I'm not a fan of the fees tend to be high and I I just don't care for them and then perhaps some cash and are there any alternative investments that you should consider\nNow that applies to your entire asset Bayh's retirement accounts that just four one K. your stock portfolio if you have one outside of your retirement plan et cetera the goal is to build a mix of assets we're the behavior does not correlate\nAnd that is when the value of one asset classes down the value of another asset class hopefully is up or at a minimum set so one balances off the other\nYou know this use of non correlated assets\nIs designed to help level out those ups and downs in your the overall performance of your portfolio of assets\nWhile still producing a certain level of growth on the one hand and having a certain segment of your holdings in a protected position and that's the fundamental basis of how we structure clients portfolios back in\nThe number at NASA CNN says the it's ... for the euro won three three three eight thousand if you'd like to sit down let's get nasty and his team we know that following financial fundamental\nKey to protecting your retirement asset from stock

Y. jab helps people retire successfully at something he can help you with it you need that assistance jak today\nFor zero one three three three eight thousand or they show or attacking financial fundamentals help us put volatility and its proper place them retire but that Jeff what's next\nWell the next fundamental has to do with what's among the top one or two issues and usually it's it's the top every survey I've seen\nThat you know some heading towards retirement tend to worry about most and that is having enough income to last as long as they needed to laugh the fundamental is to ensure that you have some retirement income sources that are not tied to equity markets because we've seen how those equity markets can go down\nIf we just think back to two thousand eight and technically it started in October of seven and it dropped even though oh seven was positive for the year there was a major drop from October to December\nAnd then two thousand eight it was like thirty seven percent it kept going down until march of old nine but over nine itself\nWas positive so everybody skip so seven and nine but if you look at the S. and P. five hundred from October of a seven to march of old nine it lost two thirds of its value in Eighteen months\nSo it's very important not to have all of your money tied to a market that can be that brutal and unforgiving\nBecause your income is what you live on it's not just a pile of money yeah you can draw from a pile of money or cash some people way back in two thousand ... actually buried money you know because they were afraid of what was going to happen with computers and stuff\nBut that doesn't make a lot of sense and thankfully it didn't really cause or any type of major issues\nSo it's important that you have multiple sources of income for your retirement no most people will have Social Security\nA lucky few or might have a pension plan and then many people have their retirement plan at work whether it's four one K. for three four fifty seven or IRA accounts whether that's traditional or ... or you may have an investment portfolio outside of your retirement plan and if you do\nThat's awesome because now you're diversifying the tax ability of the income which is very important and then you might be a somebody that had rental property that son well over the years you know some people\nChoose to liquidate rental property when they get to retirement because they don't want to be tied to the property if it's been a challenge and others intend to hold those rental properties and use that as rental income\nAnd for them that can be the perfect strategy and then of course if you're going to have a safety position in the bag well you you should earn interest and thankfully finally you know interest rates are coming up and that and that's fine that's been great to see finally\nAnd then you know many um maybe not many but a fair number of our clients choose to continue to work\nNow they'll they'll quit the full time job they had to do something fun do something part time it gives them some socialization out there to to have friendships et cetera and it gives them a few extra bucks so it makes them feel better\nSo when you look at the bigger picture Social Security is an income source that does not tied to the equity markets that's important uh neither is the pension plan\nInterest bearing accounts income from from working also those are all in that category but many others retirement plans for one k.'s investment portfolios\nIRAs regardless of the time many of those are invested directly in the stock market so you may be overexposed and the stock market\nAnd the gas perhaps than in certain circumstances we should be finding other income sources that aren't tied to the equity markets true\nOh absolutely and you know you see it and all types of magazines financial magazines whether it's kept plunger or even the wall Street Journal we'll talk about securing your income that you need to cover your your fixed expenses at a minimum if not your lifestyle\nAs a minimum no the only exception with the lifestyle would be you don't need to have a secure monthly income for like travel expenses because your travel expenses you don't need to have that money coming in every month you just need to have access to the money when you're ready to take take the trip\nFunny ... years ago I had a couple that had come in and we hit agreed in their first meeting that they said they needed twenty five thousand from their assets okay great I put together a plan to come back to the next meeting and I said well you know our our numbers changed a little bit\nUm as well All right so instead of twenty five ... what do we need to bumped up to at least it's sixty thousand [laughter] and I was like well wait a minute how did we get from twenty five to six\nSo so one of the points was that he had four thousand for Gulf trip with his buddies every year\nAnd she wanted twelve thousand for travel for the two of them\nAnd and so I said well first let's take the travel out of the budget she bumps\nI'm tired of her chair Meg and really really tired of it and she was no you can't take the travel a lot of my budget as we'll we'll let me explain why was taking him out of the monthly budget I said let's say march comes along and you decide you want to go on your trip but you've only receive three months of your twelve thousand dollars\nCan you pay for your trip while the answer's no so it's not you don't want if you're going to spend twelve thousand for your trip you don't want a thousand a month to come in you just want to have access to twelve thousand when you're ready\nIt's a very simple way to look at things so\nWhen you look at structuring your income it's important to cover your base expenses but also certain lifestyle expenses so if you're eating out every month that kind of stuff you want that to be structured so in our opinion\nWe believe that fixed annuities can fit in that space and there are two different general categories\nThere are some that are really built just for um the protective side if you will where they can't go down at the stock market goes down\nUm and they're good for accumulation and then you can just withdraw as you feel you need to\nAnd then within certain restrictions on my dad because with they fix the newest one of the downsides\nIs that you generally are only allowed a percentage that you can withdraw each year now most of the plans\nAre ten percent that you can take out each year\nSome of them are at seven percent of very small number restricted to a five percent withdrawal\nNow in the context of a of an overall plan none of those are problematic because the other half of your portfolio is fully liquid and you have access to that money pretty much anytime you want it it just takes three or four days for us to sell things input and get the money put into your account\nSo it's very simple but a fix annuity or can be a very good way either for accumulation or the other category is for guaranteed retirement income and we do a fair amount of that type of planning\nBecause many of her clients and it seems more so or or a lady listeners are concerned about making sure that they get that income for the rest of their life and what what I hear most is I don't want to become a bag lady when I get older [laughter] and\nYou know I kind of laugh but it's a very serious thought that they have they're very they're that concerned about ensuring that they have an income that they can rely on for the rest of their life", "year": "2018", "show_name": "WPRO Morning News", "city": "Providence", "day": "28"}
