W. W. dot opportunity outlive dot org or you can look up your own neighborhood you can see 'em\nHow it compares to neighborhoods around you are we really think that this is a resource that uh we put together in collaboration with the Census Bureau\nYou've really documented how will really put the finger on how we've seen a decline in opportunity so to speak\nThat's right so if you take a very simple statistic the fraction of kids who grow up to earn more than their parents did that fraction was Ninety percent for kids born in Nineteen forty\nBut it fell over the next two generations so that kids are born in Nineteen eighty or in my generation have no more than a coin flip chance of earning more than their parents did it you know when they grow up in a similar age\nAnd so it's that hating American Dream that at a very high level motivate our work we're trying to understand why this has happened and what power you might be out there to help reverse it\nIn addition to uh you don't see how some people in some neighborhoods wind up going to prison more than others um and how moving to a better neighborhood earlier in in childhood could increase the child's income by thousands of dollars that's remarkable\nThat's right and I think that uh what's the key there is that while\nFamily background is unfortunately quite important in predicting outcomes for children in the country it's not something that ... them youthful\nIt are the across the country not just regions or city where kids from poor backgrounds seem to do relatively well but even with Amy city\nAlmost in every city across the country you can find areas where they're doing very well and of course unfortunately areas where kids are not doing that well\nAnd so we think that that local focus will be really helpful as we try to come to grips with is incredibly challenging problem you know I tell a story that are in from earlier work that my colleagues they showed that some cities have very different upward mobility rate than others so for instance in Minnesota Minneapolis\nHave very high rates of over mobility Atlanta has a very low rates of over ... ability to of course that's very interesting but going to the mayor of Atlanta and saying you know your rates of Oprah mobility aren't that high maybe you can be more like Minneapolis\nThat's just not very helpful\nBut saying here are neighborhoods in Atlanta where kids in fact do do pretty well what can we learn from those neighborhoods locally to help other neighborhoods where they are not doing as well we think that the more productive approach\nSo you you're already doing some conclusions here and obviously there'll be more to be drawn ... going forward\nAbsolutely this is an ongoing agenda and one of the reason that we put that that was together that we tried to put all these data out in the public domain you can look at it yourself you can download all the data from our website\nEssentially to crowdsource a lot of this research or you know we've done quite a bit of research any they'd already but there's so much more that we are not just haven't had time to get through yet but won't have time to get you there was more than enough working here for many many research teams and we're excited to see\nUh what great ideas are there is going to come up with these data\nAnd it's not just for policy wonks she'd go to this website opportunity outlets dot O.

be here\nAnd well I appreciate it the um we had an interesting conversation that couple of months ago when we were talking about a whole nother subject that you talked about the uh thought of some countries having had in a positive experience with decriminalization of drugs is a means to\nTry to get over stigma and tried to make it a less [noise]\nI don't know unless forbidden and maybe a more um that it's more available but I'm less of a burden on society tell us about that\n[noise] well see we have a terrible opioid crisis than we've we've all been impacted by friends or neighbors are family members who we've had this disease and and many of them have died more than\nFifteen hundred in the last few years in Rhode Island alone and and this is part of the nation and we've we've struggled to address it trying to get the appropriate treatment the medication is out there\nUm and get people in on those medications but those effort I really\nPale in comparison to what we as a nation are doing\nTo address addiction and have been doing\nWe put all our almost all of our eggs in one basket which is a big criminal justice system\nWe have outlawed the drugs than we have spent a lot of resources are arresting people and and uh but even behind bars and frankly that just doesn't work to address this problem now Portugal about Eighteen years ago that the ah that that something that seems a little\nIt's hard to imagine how the country to be any more polarized than currently as I Know that Donald Trump's election I twenty six pulling but that final nail in the coffin for polarization spot like this year what the Senate hearings and what\nThe ultimate outcome debt I suppose\nIs get both sides to digging their heels so not necessarily that would be kind of more polarized that hard to see a way out of what has become a weight is functional ...\nA complete dysfunctional mess that uh [noise] uh you know no one seems to have many solutions to to to this or that people are hardening on all sides\nThere isn't some of it has to do with the fact that we've elected people that are increasingly ideological and we just started have lost moderate\nIn our political ... even though there still are some moderate to read in the country but\nMore importantly we saw this probably starting in the late ... right in the last five or ten years it's really become important both sides yeah like a little degree of civility\nUnacceptable compromises wow and so it's noteworthy when somebody like Jeff Flake goes to the Senate for that I asked that we actually show each other respect because the default position is no longer do that and run there's no respect for authority at no requirement for acting like a normal person who would act on the other professionals around\nIt's really really difficult to make any kind of a\nYou know we often look to our political leaders to lead us toward better times and toured a solutions and so forth you think that the change in their shoes or will there be a change in this but do you think if there is will it come from the political arena or maybe from somewhere else\nIt's hard to now yesterday I went to Holland spoke she said that she thought that was rock bottom it leads to different says in the way that ... that comes out but I was offered trucked in her statement about\nEarly on the road that she was pretty ... democratic leader Dianne Feinstein aside and how to handle that so you know I feel like even the senator you're ecstatic awful I Can't believe that we got into this point\nTheir behavior and a lot of ways just as bad and so it might be the fact that voter cannot stand it anymore and the problem of course as they're not presented with all happy and opportunities that given two candidates is between and want to usually a Democrat won it usually Republican\nAnd go to people are quite different so voters don't necessarily have the best choices and sign up on\nDuring the best they can with one

just the law\nAnd over the last Eighteen or twenty months\nIn repeated instead of running at our child and I think that we have here are buying all could act that well read them because in a tunnel accents and really ensure that old though it out a lot of all that just are not representing our interests or don't have the ability but\nAt the same time I'm Wondering what do you see in terms of Republican women ... more um [noise] a hardening up positions or or are there any changes on that side of the\nWell it's really interesting is that Republican running that soldier that at all by Christian and I left but sometimes when Congress went on a running for office\nTheir numbers are falling for ... years ago the one thing that has closed as Republican run on our last yeah which is that they're not going to switch party affiliation or anything like that in my life my home which will that be up for that we see on the Democratic side bachelor party that race that\nCould really get the Democrats cabin or how much time\nWas like really that Republicans as well as on what approach democratic and the Republicans including one that was ... that they had to get out there and make
