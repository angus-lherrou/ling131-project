Republican Michael Farina in Princeton who said once and only once as he brought his own gun\nTo a city council meeting this was back in twenty Fifteen or twenty sixteen according to Farina who said the council convened immediately after he had made a trip to a gun range he doesn't need to carry a gun to meetings he said and he doesn't plan to bring one again in the future but\nHe said that anyone who wants to carry a gun into a council meeting should be able to do so providing that person has the proper permit he says it is his right\nCouncilman Michael cp disagrees he wrote a letter to the Providence Journal he says in part quote this type of situation presents a clear and present danger to the other eight council members\nAs well as all the members of the general public in attendance at the meeting he\nSays the speaks volumes about him this is Michael cp referring to the council president Michel Farina he says this speaks volumes about him and his judgment and lack of

years I've done it meaning the time that he's been on the council a Michael cp raising concerns\nHis letter to the Providence Journal about uh what would happen if Purina ever lost his cool at a council meetings um this all came to light as a result of a forum that was sponsored by the Cranston Harold that the Cranston library\nWith free and his comments about his gun prompted cp to write as ... write a letter to the Providence Journal so nevertheless it does raise the question\nAround Rhode Island have other members brought a gun to his city council meeting a or a town council meeting for that matter it appears that it is that you are allowed to do that if you actually have a concealed carry permit which Michael Farina says he does he has a than an avid\nUh a tender a in attendance at the shooting range and sometimes he likes to uh have a concealed carry permit because it makes it easy if he wants to stop and get a coffee cup of coffee on his way to the range or what have you\nBut a Michael's cp disagreeing that ah never for the gun be brought to a city council meeting so certainly raising some questions about gun safety where it's appropriate to have a gun\nBut nevertheless it does appear that if you have a concealed carry permit you are legally allowed it is you're right as Michael for in a search and the Providence Journal story today\nThat if you do have
