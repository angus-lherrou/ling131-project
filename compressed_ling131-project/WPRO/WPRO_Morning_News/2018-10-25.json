fortitude victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers joining us on the line to talk about it is John ... sports writer for the Boston Herald good morning John\nGood morning a lack of sleep for the last few weeks but it's well worth the red Sox with the way from where they can get another world series\nAnd absolutely big win last night the series shifts out to Los Angeles one of the big themes I think from last night John is that David Price pitched six innings and had a very good performance last night at Fenway Park\nWithout question I mean you look really good his last rites of can you use the once and he gave up deal runs that night last night to Ron Ron ... innings the last two games you become a big game picture something we were never\nPacked with before he'd always struggle in the postseason but he's been to a wider themselves over the last two stars but also the other big thing too is the red Sox ability to sport runs with two outs they support sixty eight run to the post season in a ... game thirty six of them\nCome with two outs and so far this theory ... nine which you also back the ... and ... was bored with two out last night and they started with that rally Christian ...\nAfter ... dot the rally going so they've just been quite great situational baseball ... pitching is coming together and open was wiped out you're pretty much a perfect one last night by the red Sox\nIt was a lower scoring game then ah we saw Tuesday night game one of the world series of Fenway Park in Boston I never the less the red Sox pulled off the when\nIt was a a cold night at Fenway Park in Boston John but nevertheless the Fenway Park was electric what else did the team do write a last night in game ... of the world series\nPretty much everything I moved from start to those you know we've been able to get off to an early lead which I think is good it takes the pressure off them a little bit but then the doctors took their first leaders theory\nClock never panic panic but that's on paper quite well and they were able to get a rerun rally going and have been a wedding uh defensively I think it where there's a big difference between these two teams we already have won\nWhen a big freeze was not able to handle a pop up would have been an out that that if a second chance it's a single and then also uh the controversial play where the umpire called the runner out it was overturned\nA favorite for you to get it first baseman stretch properly so you can make your case the Dodgers D Pence may cost them two or three runs on\nUm last night not so much for the overall the red Sox were very good to be and I think that's one I'm a that gets overlooked at some point because they've been so it's all year so I I'd say a big difference between these two teams is a beat them because the red Sox\nThey roll out there nine guys they like pretty much single position with a Dodger you may see Cody Belanger first base center field you know they will pay players in and out and I think if they lose a little bit of that\nYou don't get that continuity that the red Sox have and that's been a big fan she'll find the perfect game\nSo it's an off day today for the red Sox what will the team be doing a as they prepare for game three tomorrow night in Los Angeles\nThey're going to be why not ballet the whole baseball will boost to the other coast and also just studying up their location for\nOur games brief one potentially game biographers needed\nA workforce fellows gonna start game three because Nathan of all these pitched in the first two games with his

to what he said about the media yesterday\nI think the media has to be responsible that you know their job is to you know raise factual issues to get questions or a ferret out information that some people don't want to expose\n'em and they have to do it in a way that is or\nNot you know in suggesting violence I don't think they do generally I don't think uh you have your college would do that
