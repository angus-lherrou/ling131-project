anybody noticed all those other guys those up in a free thousand dollar bring only suit he's weren't for ... shoes or anything like that\nIt wasn't really or change from when he became mayor this I bring this practice or that sort of look the Mercedes had before he became mayor um you know\nHe was always a sort of um well dressed presented himself a you know very nicely throughout the time when

replaced the center who then replace Flanagan so it's been kind of a rocky road there for stability in the mayor's in the in the mayor's office what is the sense going forward that the council will

now\nAre kept the president thanks for joining morning\nWhitey what's this the city is going to pay six hundred thousand dollars to for students this to cover the cost of the last two weeks when we didn't have school bus service make this clear for me what is it\nSo the six hundred thousand dollars a that's in question was it started with the conversation regarding a no strike clause that the mayor had talked about direct press conferences and briefings or which we all agreed what's important language to have in\nA in a contract so that in the future if the if the bus drivers were to strike there would be some safeguard included\nUm show that we would be able to transport our students to and from school or we did learn on friday that first student is Patricia was petitioning the city for additional money\nUh again we made a lot a lot of news about this no strike was the amount was between two hundred and three hundred thousand dollars and then we learned the ask was around six hundred thousand dollars with that said\nThere was a contract before the city council um it's my understanding that it would be revenue neutral and the council is ... is being asked to consider that contract as draft\nAll right you got to make this simple more more simple for me okay I Know that they were out for two weeks there was no bus service ... ... am I paying them six hundred thousand dollars for the bus service that's correct see that I understand [laughter] ... there was no bus service the drivers were walking the city is still on the hook for six hundred thousand\nSo the again to contract that's before us is thirty seven million dollars that number we are being asked not to change\nSo in other words the mayor was okay with paying them to six hundred thousand that's correct because he says why I'm contractually obligated or to the right thing to do why\nNot contractually obligated but this was part of the negotiation to get the buses up and running again\nSo we were not no I'm In the back room when they put this all together it was listed more going to do this we're gonna get together will give them the four oh one K. slashed pension they want
