disgusted them yesterday first he wants to know why did we agree to pay for student the bus company six hundred thousand dollars overtime to compensate for the two weeks if they were out why what's this the city is going to pay six hundred thousand dollars to for students\nJust to cover the cost of the last two weeks when we didn't have school bus service make this clear for me what is it\nIt started with the conversation regarding a no strike clause that the mayor had\nTalked about direct press conferences and briefings or which we all agreed what's important language to have in\nA in a contract so that in the future if the if the bus drivers were to strike that would be some safeguard included\nUm so that we would be able to transport I was students to and from school or we did learn on friday that for a student is Patricia was petitioning the city for additional money uh\nWe made a lot a lot of news about this no strike was the amount was between two hundred and three hundred thousand dollars and then we learned the ask was around six hundred thousand dollars with that said there was a contract before the city council it's my understanding that it would be revenue neutral and the council is is being asked\nTo consider that contract as draft I\nSo there you go there there's a there's a thing on the table they're going to pay ... per student six hundred thousand dollars to compensate them for the two weeks they were out and be paid over a period of years but it's still money's money right sovereign to assist let me look at the paper when it gets on my desk will sue we deal with are not going to we're going to do this was part of the deal the ... the mayor worked out to end the strike\nNow while Ron Salvatore he's gotta fight going with a couple of uh two or three female council members they say he was nasty them he raised their voice over an issue they didn't like it\nUh this walking over that now this has got nothing to do with me too he wasn't inappropriate nothing harassing like that he raised his voice can you imagine that in politics the guy raising his voice\nSo when I was leaving city hall a councilman Ryan comfortable in custody on cops in Korea were outside of the building a I express my frustration to the to council members\nAre that they did not support a ... an initiative that I've been working on for several months now or in a while I was walking away from them I did elevated my voice uh I used the term shameful uh which I thought there action toward drawing the committee meeting to continue a matter that\nFrankly is important to the constituencies that they represent women and minorities are and then I learned yesterday that councilwoman Sabina macho it's put out a statement\nA very similar to councilwoman Ryan's uh which I find very ironic because white and her husband made very insensitive remarks towards a Italian Americans she accosted me in city hall I had to close the door we were\nHaving a celebration to celebrate Dominican independence I close the door and my office so that the patrons in city hall wouldn't Harry yelling at me and then she did the same thing to come from and not do cheat who's been suffering health issues for the last two years to the point where my chief of staff had to walk in that office to defuse the conversation because\nShe was disrupting the work flow of the council or the council staff\nAlright so these these women on the council they want him out okay you're going to get a new city council president sure at some point because they got the votes out him to oust him in the meantime he said I raise my voice at them over an issue was nothing to do with meat to hash tag nothing women harassment nothing like that they took exception to that\nThey they got that out they put press releases its politics okay you yell at him next time\nYou can yell at them next time he said the fact that that other one that she did make a crack about Italian Americans and appreciate that it's nothing more than ... going on at city hall all the time six fifty\n...

custody they missed that they screwed up so he's our problem now he moved to Providence\nAnd was only a matter of time before we found out where he lives because his pictures and all over the news and the neighborhood knows now he's in Washington park in fact they have protested outside the U.S house last night\nAnd then there was a stormy meeting what do we do about this guy to Providence police who want to keep peace first and foremost say we'll keep an eye on him don't worry we know where he is going to keep an eye on him leave it to the cops major the paintings on the line with me now he's a spokesperson for the problem is the big major\nMortgaging All right what do we do we got a twenty four seven watch on this guy or is it not quite that much telling me major what are we got\nNow is twenty four seven it is in fact there's detectors outside of his house now and we'll keep that up until we have to or or you know or we resolve the matter\nHow do we how do we resolve but I mean the overtime meters running public safety is that we know that's your top concern it's cost tens of thousands of dollars now I Know this is the mayor decision I'm not asking you do the accounting but you can understand how long can this go on what you're thinking\nWell it's for right now it's it's a only option so we'll see we'll sit down this morning rethink what we can do with this and but for now the neighborhoods safe\nAnd you know listen we got to keep him safe to you know you know so that it's better off that we have at least but I think\nThat there is no sympathy for him we understand that he was a terrible person a child rapist and the kidnapping he did what he did however the way we run things in this country he did his time he's out I Would expect at some point the ACLU to give you a challenge and again that's I Know that's more from the mayor to answer that but I Would have if you're you're in between a rock and a hard place\nThat's correct so right now we're going to do what we have to do and that's where it takes it takes us um you know the meeting last night it was hundreds of people that from the Washington talk uh area you know and they have really are legitimate concerns\nPeople I Know you if you looked on on the news you saw a lot of yelling screaming but there was no real acknowledges in that crowd the witches parents [noise] and just completely upset\nAbout you know what's going on in the neighborhood right so we'd have to do you have to do\nNow he registered with you because he has to by law but as far as disclosing his exact address he got grandfathered in because the ... uh was passed after his crimes and his trouble correct that there was some restrictions\nThat's correct I mean we only have I think there's basically only three restrictions on him that he has to do with us\nIf he moves you have to let us know within twenty four hours and you can't move within three hundred feet or the school\nOkay but apart from that he can come and go that's it and you're going to tell him when he comes and goes well we're going to keep an eye out okay when you say well you got a car parked out there and one top two cups of team and you don't have to tell me if he got on the cover of guys I mean that I'm not interested but you got you got your eye on them\nOr visible is to protect us\nAnd the sitting there watching him All right um I guess there's not much more to say other than you don't want anybody bothering him because there's certainly an urge to go out and you know walk this guy but that'd be the worst thing to do because then the other people get in trouble not the way it works\nYeah that's that's correct the these people are that were there was a very level headed people\nUh they they do what they can and what they can't do they looking for answers just like we are ... and in today's starting today let me sit down and we're going to try and figure out some alternatives or some options but right now this is the
