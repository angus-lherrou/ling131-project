further ... take a look at face value of what Gina Raimondo actually got forty percent the same number of Democrats that makes no sense you know when you when I spoke to my post because I was scratching my head about it you know he's done it a and looked at one islanders\nIt's skewed about eleven percent because in the past damage should be more like thirty seven thirty percent for a
