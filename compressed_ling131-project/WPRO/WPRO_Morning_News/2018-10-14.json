A. levels ... village where did you find when you met the people's is this is a genetic dietary what did you see\nWell I went there again this summer for the second time with translators photographers and it was easy to understand without studies without even though the town doctor there Dr ... has identified highly ironic gas it\nIs the very reason why these people in ... Hara exhibits such usefulness and by the way they have a lady there in her nineties without any aging spots in her skin perfect skin no wrinkles whatsoever\nPeople living into their eighties and nineties look a lot younger and it all became clear when we were there now they grow a lot of their own vegetables\nAnd foods right there near their homes and they have a lot of fresh foods and sometimes they have a little extra so they come down\nTo the vegetable market and bring their goods there to be sold\nSo we were there taking pictures and interviewing people win eighty three year old Mr ... she came driving in on his motorcycle to deliver his vegetables to the fruit markets pat where do we have in the United states eighty three year olds\nDriving their motorcycle down to the vegetable market we don't have it we followed him to his home Oreos up on a thirty foot ladder\nA trimming a tree he works in the fields about four to six hours a day and he introduced us to his neighbor who was nine years old without a wrinkle on his face neither of them use reading glasses\nAnd of course ah he works about six to eight hours out in the fields every day this was remarkable I almost felt had I was in some sort of a place where the dinosaurs are still living or something that was so remarkable these people just exhibit\nA youthful this a a flexibility in their joints certainly helpful mess that we just don't see everywhere else in fact it was so remarkable that the emperor of Japan actually has visited this village pictures were taken there you could see them all over the village there as they had posted him so this had stood out\nAnd of course Connie Chung uh ABC News twenty twenty had gone to visit there in the year two thousand this was originally on television you could see the actual pictures for yourself\nBut the ha revolution has come here path and of course we've had three years of use of ha but we could lose people in the science so they want to know what's real is this for real\nWell it's real for Tom who writes to us a pharmacist\nNow from Santa Cruz California Seventy years of age\nParticipating in the whole lie Iron Man contest in Kona, Hawaii this past year\nSeventy years old he said this new ha formula for the joint did a great job not certainly a pharmacist with no\nHere's John writing to me and saying you know at age fifty five boy when I tried ha I'm now back to playing full court basketball with a twenty year old and I've even begun to jog again these are the kinds of reports that we here\nLet me ask you a question here you mentioned the glucose I mean and there's another one out of that is pretty popular MSN how does this ... stack up against those other ones the other ones you have to take them for a while before you even see any results do\nAnd most of these are very positive dietary supplements they certainly have lots of benefits\nGlue costs may take quite a while to kick in MSN is a wonderful sulfur compounds and again it's an anti inflammatory as are many things like fish oil ... these are all wonderful\nBut they're not dealing with the origin of the problem the origin of the problem is the loss of cushioning and the joy and if we can just replaced it if we can find a way to get\nThat cushioning back that's what we call usefulness that's what we had when we were young here's David writing to me from New York twenty five years looking for something that would help support his lower back\nAnd of course he said I Can't believe it now he says I Can't thank you enough for this product people have tried all the alternatives they've searched everywhere else pat and they haven't heard of highly ironic gas it\nNow the reorder raids on aging sort of tell me that things aren't phenomenal the product works the study shows how but one of the customers and what are they telling you candidly what are they seen the bill ...\nIf the horses come back to the trough there must be good water there it's amazing to me how people say just keep sending death it's wonderful it changed my life here is Lorraine saying I Can't believe it but I'm able to run I Love it run five miles a day my skin nails are great\nTelling everybody about it these are on the line you can go see some of these comments purity products has it on line where people just log in and tell you these aren't edited in any way\nHere's Brent riding says no one that purity products made an outlandish claim about ha joined formula but three days after I started taking it I notice the difference this stuff really works it's your own personal discovery that's why purity product wants you to have this free bottle\nYou call nobody's got a how do you call that number they're going to send you a free bottle a full month supply you just kick in a few bucks for the shipping and your going to experience this for yourself\nAs you hear a gift stories of living go take the lead a trust you'll feel that's what you've dug in choosing to listen to this edition of sense would all watch\nHello I'm ready to politician with me now to talk about let God take the lead is Christian Science practitioner and teacher and Michelle ... thanks for joining us today thank you for asking me\nWell Michelle when we're making some small decisions in our day to day lives or a large decision that will impact us in a big way why is taking that sleet and letting him guide is a good thing to do\nWell read it I think it's because we generally want to be happy and successful and what we do\nTaking God's laid really means to yield to good the divine good that God is God is good\nSo letting infinite unlimited good lead means opening the better opportunities than perhaps a limited human will can come up with\nEven a well meaning human will has certain limitations who wants to take risks with happiness no one does\nYielding to God's learning to listen and follow rather than to push a personal agenda may cause one to stretch it may be work sometimes but at the end results are so worth it\nWell that sounds good but then for someone who isn't used to turning to God or this is new to them how they even begin to look to God for guidance\nWell it starts by becoming familiar with what God is as with anything you don't want to be led by something you don't trust so\nYou're really cultivating and understanding of what it means for God to be good and then cultivating good listening skills discerning skills just everyday activities to learn to lean on to trust to rest on good\nWhen you're doing it with the little things and one big questions and decisions come along it's not so tough\nAnd when I'm Talking about little things it's not so much that it's about asking God for stuff so much of that is becoming aware of God compelling us to see the good that's right before us\nYou began by expecting to be guided to a parking spot for example or to find your keys or to call a friend when it will bless them most of that kind of thing [noise]\nYou know it's not like God is sitting around somewhere waiting for us to ask\nBefore producing good for us when we talk about being guided by God letting God lead well God is an ever present guide always revealing good to us in every moment\nBut do we always see it do we always feel it maybe not that's where a focus shift can happen\nTo start by recognizing the presence of good around us God's guidance isn't always the writing on the wall kind of experience\nSometimes it is but it's not always like that many times we're just learning to trust the divine intuitions the good intuitions that come to us from God\nWhat Christian Science teachers are actually ever present angel messages have good\nThat we can discover right in our own thought\nSo then these angel messages messages from God you know how do we get them how do we hear them and how do we know that it's got talking to us\nChristian Science founder Mary Baker eddy explained that we can recognize these angels or thoughts coming to us by the love they create in our hearts\nShe wrote oh make you feel this touch it's not the class of hands nor loved person present it's more than this it is a spiritual ideas that lights your path\nIsn't that cool it is but really that live in the heart helps you know when you feel that love\nYou know that it's not just personal agenda it's not just a limited human will mixed in there is this really sweet short prayer and solemn sixty one I Love this prayer I lean on this prayer it's very short it says lead me to the rock that is higher than I\nAnd that's what yielding to God letting God take the lead is really like divine love is Iraq is\nA solid foundation that we can lean on that we can build on love is compelling us always to yield to good unlimited good more good to move beyond the limited scope of just a personal ego and what that is telling us is good for us\nI Love that because the idea that that love and that actually feeling of ... you get when you know it's got talking to you that does send us in the right direction now let's say though\nSomeone having a hard time and they're still struggling and they're not sure you know what direction to go to hinders us from hearing God\nWhile I Can't really speak for everyone I Know that when I feel pushed or polled with my own once and wishes I don't feel the love\nMaking human plans setting personal goals has rarely worked out well for me in the long term\nAnd often left me frustrated when things don't go the way I Would like them too it's not that the angels aren't there but it's like I'm shouting over them it's like I'm reaching reaching for something that I Want and not willing to trust that what God has\nIn store for me is really that good fat and good that I can lean on it that I can trust it that I can even want it if I Can't see it\nEventually usually circumstances require me to get to that quiet place so that peaceful listening place where I turn to God for spiritual direction so that I can move forward it it gets me out of the stock place of wondering what I should be doing you know or how\nI can hear God's speaking to me\nWell that makes me think that because we're God's delivered child I mean we're that spiritual image and likeness of God that then it's\nNatural for us to be quiet and listen to our father mother God loving direction that part of it\nExactly like a like any loving parent\nGod wants the best for us desires the best for us the best to us\nBy learning to or by trusting in learning to yield to that divine intention trusting in God's will is good for us it open so many more doors than just a personal pushing and pulling and demanding and hoping opens for us\nYeah I find it's better than I could have even my own my exactly exactly well do you have an example\nOn your own life that you can share where you really saw this is true\nAnd I probably am a hundred but I'm only going to give you one [laughter] I applied for a position one time that I really wanted I mean I really really wanted it and I wasn't taken\nI wouldn't say I was a turning to God for guidance because I really was\nIt was a good job and it would be a blessing to many people so I ... I felt guided to apply it was a good idea to do it but then I wasn't taken and I didn't see it at the time how much I had yet to learn about not pushing my own will to go faster or further than God was leading me at the moment\nBut even when I didn't get what I wanted God really was leading me\nAnd in fact leading me to apply several more times for the very same job\nEach time there was no\nAnd while it was disappointing each know compelled me to appreciate the good that was at hand and to learn to develop the opportunities that were before me\nI learned actually that Hi Ken bloom anywhere I can bloom anywhere that God plants me and that was really a good and healthy lesson to learn now the last time I applied I remember clearly asking God if I didn't even bother should I even try again\nAnd the intuition came to me than in following God's leading I should apply but that it was also safe to trust that God was leading others those whose job it is to decide if I get to do it or not\nAnd you know I never thought of that my focus has always been so narrow just on God guiding me and my really wanting to do it but that wasn't my decision God was leading me to apply and that was enough\nI felt the love and my heart I felt God's love for everyone in the decision making process I trusted them because I trust God to be guiding them so I applied and that time I was taken\nBut you know what I now know I actually would have been fine even if the answered been no because I could see God was taking the lead and every single point\nOf you know how late I was applying but somehow and ended up working out and I got in and I was able to attend and it was funny because that party that I felt led not to go to\nThe next day made national news\nIn the United states because the father of the sun who hosted this party was actually a public figure and people were caught drinking under age there\nAnd people's photos were were on line and I was so amazed at how protected I was from this situation so even that really small decision not to go to this party I mean it led to just\n... it was amazing how I was just guided through each step of every single decision that I had to make to get to where I needed to go in the long run\nAnd I was learning about my closeness to God my at one moment with God that all of us have and I was learning that it doesn't come and go it's actually permanent you know we're not praying to\nFeel close to God you know we're we're praying to know that we already are at one with God\nAnd we just have to trust God and again you know we don't have to just listen to God for the big things in life we can listen to God for the small things because all prayers significant and important\nYou know there's one time when I was in high school this was kind of before this all happened I was actually at a party\nAnd I was paying about is this somewhere that I Need to be do I stay here I wasn't drinking but other people were and they get together was fun you know at first and then people started to become more and more intoxicated and I was thinking okay well maybe\nMaybe it's time for me to step out you know maybe it's time for me to leave and in that moment of uncertain name because I didn't want to miss out on the fine and seeing people but I also wasn't sure if I should go home either\nI just wanted to step into the bathroom just to get this quiet place to kind of just listen because everything was so loud and I I felt so lead to just go find this this quiet place to just listen and um I walked in and\nThere was a a girl who actually was unconscious and her head was actually fully immersed in the toilet and\nWell I was able to kind of get her out and I got some friends to help me and we brought her to another room and she was breathing again and she was fine after that and she had the help she needed and her parents came to pick her up later on and\nShe came up to me at a sports event she said\nAlina heat you saved my life thank you so much thank you for being so alert to the situation and\nI of course gave her a hug but\nI thought it wasn't me that say ... God was right there protecting her too and God was the one that was doing all the work and I was so grateful that I I was led to listen and\nAnd that was a situation in a party where after that happened and after I made sure she was fine you know I felt led to leave and and that's okay\nAnd I was learning that were praying not to get closer to God but we're knowing our closest to God and showed me that God's guidance is not something that's out there that just graces us every once in awhile\nI reasons that if God is the divine mind which is another sending them for God and if I'm at one with God well then I met one with the divine mind just says we all are\nSo listening to God is only normal and natural for all of God's creation\nMelinda that's a wonderful example thanks so much for being with us today\nThank you so much Rita\nI've been speaking with ... Simpson from Washington DC\nMm Mm\n\nMm\n\n\nMm\n\nMm\nMm\n\n\nA or a\nA\n\nA\nA\n\n\nA that's a program for this week if you'd like to hear more sentinel watch programs you can subscribe to Jay say Charles ... called\nThanks for being with us today or they should they should upsetting to know watch\nA week the production of the Christian side said to them [noise]\nThis podcast is produced and copyrighted by the Christian Science publishing society\nMajor league baseball players were getting in on the action [noise]\nI'm Michael yeah I'm ...

alliance for public charter schools want you to know the facts about charter schools in one point six million students attend nearly five thousand charter schools and receive a free quality public education which sounds great to me honey will start the intimate process today already starting it mom but I could use some help\nFor more information does it the national alliance for public charter schools I visit WWW dot public charter is not working that's public charters dot org and get the facts and [noise]\n\nFrom the New England truck solution studio he's just talking I mean I Am six thirty WPRI\nCumulus station\n[noise] panhandle search saying good bye I'm Christopher cruise search and rescue teams continue to comb through the devastation rocked by hurricane Michael on the Florida Panhandle this week\nAt least Eighteen people were killed a number that is certain to rise power lines and trees are still laying in roadways in areas hit the hardest by the hurricane frustration\nRolling in Panama City with little if any access to food and water\nWhere everybody gets worried about surviving you know\nSome residents say they haven't seen or heard much from FEMA or any government official\nWe had heard anything about the right thing by a devastating about that you know\nI'm guessing that going to take a little while female administrator Brock Long pleading for patients ... anyone affected by the storm stating that it was one of the most powerful since the Eighteen fifty he says recovery will take time waiting to Panama City Florida\nWe do a chain analysis to figure out what happened and if there's a willingness to try again and commitment to\nAh the next step we start over again and what I say to people every day is all I really needed honesty because without us they have nothing to work with so few relapse and you're willing to talk about it and\nReally dig deep than we can try again and get people back on track so we never\nWe don't ever put people out for relapsing we just figure out how to intensify their plan so that they can get it right\nShort and do you do this all without um without funding I mean how do you pay for the medical aspect of what you're doing Amos house\nSo we're not license so we don't feel insurance but we have ... lots of different funding sources one of the things that we're really proud of is that we have a very diverse um funding streams so we have both individual donors\nAnd um special dancing corporate sponsors that we have an income from our businesses and we have government grants a and I'm\nReally excited to say we moved into a new building two and a half years ago which is a new twenty nine thousand square foot building that really offers dignity and respect and opportunity for people to get the services they need\nAnd just this week we met our million dollar and down the goal which was part of our campaign so we're really blessed and you know I think part of what we've learned is that if we deliver services and\nDeliver outcomes that are based on death practices and release really make a commitment to help people make those changes people are willing to invest\nIn us because we are really producing good outcomes\nIf you're just joining us I'm even men cue so filling in for Deborah Jarrod who's running for state rep Jamestown in Middletown my guess this morning is Eileen haze of Amos house Eileen do you take families as well it emits house\nSo we have to special programs we have a mother child reunification program and fatherhood program for men and women who have had their children taken for because of their addiction or incarceration\nAnd they're in ... in the process of unifying so we have a Thirteen families that live in our mother child program and ate fathers that are stepping up to the plate and gaining custody and visitation of their children and in addition to that we have\nHousing for about another twenty people um that our families we were about to finish the renovation of our old social services building to add for new family units and uh so we ... absolutely work with families but again people are on the path of recovery\nAnd reunification and then full custody of their children\nOh that's so terrific and I can tell you I'm at close to kids Rhode Island\nWe love to take care of those children and make sure that they go to school and then they pick out their clothes and and that they feel good and it just takes one more burden off of people ... if you're coming out of prison and you're trying to reunite if you're trying to be sober you tried to young while the right things you know there's a lot of stresses out I'm\nOn parents you know I I was having a conversation one day with a friend of mine who's never had children and she said to me I forget sometimes how hard it is to be a mother I said yeah even when your children are in their thirties it's still hot sometimes\nAnd the grandmother like I Am [laughter] to\nBe so um what's the hardest part of your job and Amos house\nLike I said earlier about the sort of the tragedies that we have to manage unfortunately I'm this opioid crisis has had a major impact on our community and we've had so many people that we love and family members that have lost\nFamily members to the opioid addiction crisis so\nThat's been very hard and it's really made us kind of reevaluate how we deliver services we're adding more and more services to support 'em the many men and women who are struggling with opioid addiction and unfortunately it's not even just opiate addiction anymore there's been a major increase of\nAh folks that are smoking crack cocaine that's also like laced with fat and all and they're dying as well as I were really concerned about that\nUm we have another program that we started two years ago that we're really proud of it's called a hand up and\nWe started in in response to a lot of conversation about people panhandle linked to support themselves and rather than criminalize them and move them off the corners we offered to program where we are providing day labor so we're basically we have a cleaning crew and we're cleaning up the neighborhoods were cleaning Broad Street and\nUm without even Huntington and only ... people get fifty dollars a day for cleaning and they get a chance to earn a little bit of\nMoney and feel good about their experience but more importantly they're getting connected to our social service staff and helping them get employment and housing and benefits and all the things that ultimately will get them off the street corner as well\nRight it just takes a village doesn't it it takes a village yes and that we're all here for radio every piece happens I\nI say all the time when I chaired the board of education and went into lots of classrooms around the state\nNobody sat around and saying gee when I grow up I Want to be a panhandler I'd rather do that then working honestly for a day or ... or something that you hear and some of these the crazy um tweets\nThat are going on these days yeah I'm about the issue that so near and dear to our hearts and uh that to me as one of the biggest problems that we have\nIs people not understanding of what happens\nUm do you find also when you reach out to the person as a as a day laborer they have their first positive interaction with a social service agency does that get them\nOh my goodness yeah is there so it's amazing I watched the crew when they leave in the morning and I see them when they come back in the other day at the end of the day and I'm listening to their conversation about how good they feel about having cleaned up the heart of the neighborhood that has been trashed and\nWhen we first started we were doing cleaning up Huntington ads and in the first week they collected ... two hundred bags of garbage hundred hyper ... that were thrown in in the bushes they're they cut down the bushes they beautify the area\nAnd they felt so proud of that and\nOnce you have that taste again and reminder of who you can be they then have the opportunity to go in to the workforce and ultimately that's what our goal is\nAnd I'm sure that's what drives the people that work as a famous house as well when you see that kind of\nReflection you can't hide I may have brightness and cheering this and and I are how people feel when they walk and they feel proud of themselves um [noise] let's take a break even man cue so filling in for Deborah Gere oh I guess this morning as Eileen Hayes CEO of Amos house more to talk about what we'll be right back\n[noise] Christmas tree was your weather forecast for\nGood deals sunshine forward to the hub to fifty dollars this afternoon and we'll start out cleared sites have been called one crew throughout the low down to forty three but a lot of cloud rep for tomorrow skillful showers are sixty four year old is she like your mother told me to ...\nI can almost from southern knowing what to do [noise]\n\nBy the time that we got up there is room filled with smoke the winter alone and drifted the snow up\nAgainst the side of my house blocking the song from my furnace I heard the smoke alarm going off at a friend's apartment without the kid is not harm my son would not be here today we had it not then for that carbon monoxide detector and they would come to school and not have their teacher and I grabbed my fire extinguisher and put on the\nFire gimmicks and technology that these products which are local retailer today\nDo you ever wonder what you do if you couldn't just which on the heat when it got Cold War start your car each morning or Ford toilet paper well for plenty of hardworking folks right here in our community these are everyday reality but when you get to the salvation army you help your neighbors and me when the battle to cry\nWant to join this fight for good please visit Salvation Army dot listen and kids dot org to make a donation that Salvation Army dot listening give dot org [noise]\nIf you're just joining us even make use of filling in for ... I guess this morning is I mean have the president and CEO of Amos house now Eileen um you've been there for a long time in teen years I'm doing amazing work and how has the client changed over the years\nWhen I first got there most of them men and women and families that we were serving food to were homeless and over the years we have seen a major increase in the number of folks that are just not making ends meet so we have\nMany people who are working poor and they're eating with us to supplement their income we've\nSeen um lots of different immigrant come group comes through um different a large part a percentage of\nA Latino men and women and families and also some people that have been using us for their meals for the last Eighteen years and I see some of the faces others so when we first got there the thing about our soup kitchen is that it's not based on economics it's based on\nUm hunger and you can walk in that door and not you know in a bit\nThe suit and eat or you can have nothing and eat and we don't ask for for income warehouse of hospitality we were founded by the sisters of\nMercy [laughter] that believed in so much like the Catholic Worker\nModel that we have to offer dignity and respect to people who were hungry\nOr that was a that was my next question is um how do you get to eat at payment Amos house you just walk and yet\nWe serve breakfast Monday through friday from seven to eight and lunch from eleven to twelve thirty and uh we have a full breakfast and a full lunch or six days a week a game of cells and a church does the service on Sundays and serves an afternoon meal so there's meals seven days a week last year we served a hundred and fifty one thousand meals out of our soup kitchen\nThe first ever firefighters memorial here\nThis is a nation if there was announced a couple of weeks ago down in ... and uh the executive director of the road on an association of fire chiefs are Ritchie says he's going to ... ...\nIt's good to see in the morning and thank you too thank you for coming in I appreciate it thank you for having us we've got quite a few things we can\nTalk about it it's hard to believe and thank you again for coming in and it it is hard to believe and I think he put it in um that there isn't a state firefighter\nMemorials that's a I mean and this year you would have thought it was something that was there so so this is this is the big story a couple of weeks ago what what's going on what was the thought behind it uh I think the hard work now continues to actually yeah it's kind of pay for it so that's\nActually what what we're in the face of doing right now is to raise a raise the money to do it and we're doing pretty well but but we've got all that we've got a long way to go up but just to bring up your point about how many\n... why we don't have a memorial or only one of about four states in the country that don't have a dedicated firefighters statewide memorial mhm so we recognize that fact quite a few years ago and it and then these are these past\nProbably Twenty years that we've been fighting to get that fire academy where it is a ... school property in eggs that are\nFinally got that achieved in these past maybe eight years and completed\nAnd we look at the front entrance and realize that is a perfect spot for state statewide firefighter memorial so we we try to work with the state of Rhode Island to allow us to do that there and basically that's that's our plan is to is to raise funds build it we we had the groundbreaking a couple of weeks ago\nAnd what we want to do at the end is turn it back over to the state as a gift and it will be a statewide firefighter memorial for\nAll firefighters in the state will they be volunteer career combination of where they can wear the fire academy can have graduation ceremonies and show that the new cadets or you know just what the the history is of the fire service and and what it means to be a fire in\nOne way to important to have a memorial and why do you think it took so long for it to happen with just one of those things as well I think they do our own thing in Rhode Island right [laughter] yeah I I don't\nThink there's any one reason is probably why would you know the same reason we didn't have our own fire academy until you know we pushed and pushed and and we got it you know a location for it and got to do\nUh I don't think there was any one reason why it wasn't there but we certainly were we think the right organization to take it pushes forward [noise] um but I think there's a lot of history and tradition and the fire service\nAnd uh we we wanted to see that there was a place to be able to bring our younger firefighters to see what the history is where who we should be memorializing who we should be thinking about that came before us in the fire service\nAnd there was actually one interesting thing about this memorial that we're doing just with the with the placement we actually had to tweak the placement on the on the site and it was a was a good idea by actually our president judge ... brown of the Hopkins fill in central Coventry fire districts and in a in common three\nThat we underneath the main part of the monument there's going to be a compass\nAnd we wanted that compass and and it will be that way we wanted that compass to show through north going right through the fire academy which will when you stand on the podium once that memorial is built\nYou'll be able to look through north going right through the fire academy and that's going to be a good point to to make for for the debts that are that are what would be going fully understand why it's true north important what is what we just we just feel like that they should know the direction that they are going in the fire service and that and that\nTraining and and learning the tradition of the fire service\nGoing through that building that they are you know especially if their cadets going through the fire academy how important that is to start off their career\n... absolutely I you know the fight the fire service you breathe a type of individual what what is the old line that people run away from troubles and the firefighters that they they run to the trouble right most of us when the fire breaks out we get out the fireman they run and fire women to if they run in and it\nSeems like it's inherent in those that they get into this [laughter] there's a ... certain jobs and that's one of them with with the first responders and the fire service or a lovely right\nWhat what is it maybe can describe a little bit of what the memorial it's it's going to look like again if there's going to be a kind of a of a circular designed here it is yeah and it said the only for for for reference to the economy is down off of a south county trail general area of the veterans cemetery on the side of it was so familiar with the less\nAs a direct it's a couple of miles then from going in next to the the veteran's cemetery is where the old lad school property was a huge piece of property it was a lot of buildings back there a lot of banks have been taken down as a as some open space but that's where the fire academy was built\nA and and that is the perfect spot for it right at the front entrance they they have a nice uh on on the public's eye we wanted it's important that the public be able to go to this memorial and not be fenced in behind where where all the uh\nThe training gets done so this is on the public side at the main entrance of the of the actual fire academy\nA building administrative building and so there's the parking lot right there and it's right across the street to the beautiful walk will go up okay that will have a you know\nPapers lined on either side where that can be purchased by people to to put names on to to be a memory of certain people but\nSo the eating them hopefully have come up with the design of the\nOf all that we have a committee or as you may remember we have a a couple of different organizations we have the round association of fire chief of our our AFC foundation or charitable foundation it's five oh one C. three and that's where that is what most of the building of the\nOf the fire academy is going through the the five oh one C. three so donations can be made a tax deductible to anybody that wants to be involved but anyway there's a there's an executive board that goes along with each of those organizations and we put\nTogether a committee or less like a design committee from each of those organizations a combination of both and we got together we uh we had raised seed money a couple of years ago about twenty five thousand dollars to start the project\nAnd we hired an architect and a A R G be out of out of Providence and they came up with that we get told them kind of what we wanted and they came up\nDesigns it's been you know upgraded or you know changed a couple of times and we've we've we did and it probably still will have a couple of weeks on in the process but enough so that we could have rendering or a couple of rendering that show what we wanted to look like\nAnd and you know to to go forward with what we have ... how much how much ultimately ... do you hope to raise and how much is a kind of all we do we think we're probably going to be in the area of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a that's where we're leaning we're not exactly sure right now\nWe're maybe halfway to that point I have to tell you if you've ever heard of the one hundred club of Rhode Island there are fantastic organization\nWhose sole existence is to help a fire and police first responders or they if if God Forbid a firefighter police officer gets killed in the line of duty\nWithin twenty four hours that group has a twenty five thousand dollar check in the hands of\nTheir family to help them through that immediate time of stress and whatever their expenses might be they this is the type of aid they get they also give 'em\nA scholarships to children of of fire and police officers and they help out the children of armed police officers who've lost their lives in the line of duty anyway that's the that's the one hundred club they're fantastic organization they stepped up to the plate big time with this firefighter memorial\nAnd don't and and committed\nFifty thousand dollars to this project which is amazing ... so that they are going to start it is yes right if everything goes well when do you hope to have it when you hope that we're hoping by summer of twenty Nineteen oh we we are breaking ... we had the groundbreaking couple of weeks ago and it will seriously you know the the shovels will be in the ground\nProbably within the next couple of weeks to get\nA to get some of this this base a\nConcrete worked on a ... put in and concrete work done so that it can settled throughout the winter\nAnd then in the spring we can go along with all the the flat work it's it's mostly a big landscaping project if you can other than the purchase of the monument itself you know the bronze pieces and the building of the the the missionary work to build walls\nAnd to kept them with the blue stone but it's it's a big landscaping project with the you know in in failing or you know a papers and and concrete and stamped concrete\nAnd a lot of flat flat areas and some steps so there's a it can be done relatively quickly ... sounds like something everybody's going to be quite proud of when it's I think that uh you know and it's very very proud of it yeah that's a little bit\nYou're

S. S. E. Y. Massey on money dot com\nToday Justin walking us through a checklist that he's made a seven items we need to be clear about to help determine if we are indeed getting the right financial advice for our own transition to retirement so we're up to number five what is that at the item\nOn the sexual we've touched on a little bit already you know you're following a written strategies or a plane that's put in place that is well thought out that's that's encompassing all the different retirement puzzle pieces that are out there but also have some flexibility to adjust\nWhat might change in the future or if there are unforeseen circumstances\nNow I'm Talking about something that that sets out the details and the substance strategies are you planning to implement\nTo get you to into retirement while working towards your goals all along the way\nNo with this type of written strategies can pull off the shelf will pull it up on the computer screen\nThis is a compass that can keep you on the right path in terms of the approaches that you use to help grow preserve and spend down the retirement resources that you have those assets where your income is et cetera essentially the pass I'm Talking about connects your retirement resources to your goals\nIssue to answer all the big financial questions about your income about tax efficiency about managing your retirement accounts about your different types of insurance and what you should or maybe don't need to have\nAnd then it should also handle wealth transfer it should handle cash flow your cash reserves you know that's one item to have the cash reserves so we see so many people that I think you're doing it wrong they only have five or ten thousand in the bank we feel that that's nowhere near enough\nFor cash reserves you know and it needs to be handled so all of those types of things are kind of tied up in a nice little package so that you know you can turn to it and say All right this is what we're doing and we know this is how things are going to unfold as we go forward this is how we're going to take our income as we move forward et cetera\nThat get you really do believe that having that actual formal strategy it makes a difference\nIt sure does so I mean it starts with all the analysis and that's that's a key point let's do the analysis let's determine what your risks level is and what your tolerance would be and then we build the playing around that\nAnd we have some interesting software now that I'm Will show us probabilities of you getting through your retirement years and we plug in what you currently have harass that's what your current level of expenses are what your income is going to change in the future we can plug all this them\nAnd we ask you what your life expectancy would be you know how old do you think you might live now I Know it's a weird question are you know the answer but we try to get people to consider that they may live up to age Ninety and then this software\nWill run up to ten thousand different variations to determine the probability of you reaching life expectancy with enough income\nAnd it's it's pretty cool and when we show people how we can just do some little tweaks to the investment strategy overall and end up with a much different outcome\nIt's great to to watch their face and and they see they look at it go up so yeah so we've got a pretty good plan there because we have a high probability of success no if you don't have a high probability of success well then we need to get to work and try to figure out how to tweak your plan\nTo get you to the higher probability\nJak we're talking about your ... today verifying if we're getting good financial advice for transitioning their retirement what's the next item\nThe six item on that checklist is to gauge whether you're getting skilled transparent service from the financial professional that you're working with\nThe way I see it financial professionals have to earn the right to advise you in guide you with your finances in your retirement\nWhen you trust me with your finances I Do that as an honor and privilege I Believe I earned the right to serve an advisor by treat you as I Would want myself to be treated and how I Want my finances to be treated with the most care\nWith transparency and honesty and integrity with all the skill resources and tools that we here at our from have at our disposal\nAnd for those folks that come in and meet with us and go through our proprietary process the mess and money retirement road map they get a chance to look at all of this and decide for themselves if we fit the bill for them\nSo that sounds of interest to you and you'd like to take advantage of our\nComplimentary offer for our complete process to do a full evaluation a first we start with your goals and do we think we can help you with the goals going forward\nThen we gather your statements we we do an in depth analysis we come back with the report we take you through the report noble there's a ton of information in it we make it simple and understandable and you will likely know more about your investments after that second\nAnd then you ever did at least that's the feedback that we get from our listeners when they come in and meet with us and go through our process and they can see where all too often they have way too much risk in their portfolio especially if they're in close proximity to retirement or worse if they're already in retirement\nBecause let's face it the market has been on an absolute wrong for the last like ten years so\nUm do category another ten years well theoretically it could but that that's kind of a gamble in my opinion to think that the market will continue to grow up like it has been for the last ten years and we want to take some strategies and bring those to the table that will help preserve those assets that you've earned over the last ten years\nJets from the client's perspective what exactly does it mean to have transparency from your financial professional\nSo it's about our team you're amassing associates I being up front so you know exactly what we're recommending and how we're recommending it it's about us being transparent and leaving no mystery about how we're being compensated because we lay that all out for our listeners\nWhen they come in because it's important for you to know that\nAnd it's about us being ethical and having integrity in every aspect of our dealings with your listeners\nAnd it's also about being readily accessible to you know I Do have a lot of daily meetings so we have a team here so if I Can't get back to one of our team members might get back to you and we we try to get back with everybody in the same day\nI I Will say we don't always get to do that because we are very busy but we are looking at trying to make sure that we return those calls as quickly as we can with the right information that you're looking to hear back\nYet glad you mentioned what you did there I Want to just clarify a little bit more they'll how exactly is the financial professional someone like you how you compensated\nSo some professionals such as investment advisor representatives are compensated by clients sued the fees that they charge so we are investment advisor represented so when we handle assets there is an advisory the that's charge what we hear from our from our listeners when they come in the ... with us\nIs they're amazed that we can bring so much to the table", "show_name": "WPRO Morning News", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day":
