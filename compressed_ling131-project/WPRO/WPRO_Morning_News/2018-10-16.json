had the former state senator Christmas Eli on the line he was the subject of a humble report there was also carrying the pro joke\nOn Sunday a Christie was in politics and then he got jammed up with bank fraud and went to prison for two years he came out that I paid my time and I have to make a living and judge Judy ... you kind of a break and made up of bail commissioner which is a kind of the first court officer you see\nA few involved in that kind of crime if the courts are closed and they they can't get in front of a judge to bail commission that comes out to the police police station and he arranged you or at least the initial appearance things like\nAnd then you pay cash for that uh and I think Chris says you know I just want to talk about my life and and uh why I think they deserve a second chance get money Christie their\n... ... ... hanging out it's actually coming up by the way I think it's ... to come on\nUm I Know these things can be embarrassing uh and redemption and second chances are part of the American way and I really do understand that and you did your time you got jammed up with banks and money and things like that you did two years and now you came out here's the thing you know you were in politics I Would say well Chris you probably can't go back in ...\nSix 'cause you're kind of betrayed the public's trust and I know you've paid your time you get jammed up with money may be bailed commissioner isn't the right thing but there are other things that you can do and we all wish you will your attorney you got your license back you were reinstated\nBut this thing with being kind of the bail commission of the first one code officer someone sees its not sitting well to state police the mayor\n... going to drop you so the tide is kind of against you and I think you have to understand how those people feel to it ... am I making is there anything that you would agree with me on\nDoing I I understand it's a perception issue right and a lot of it's maybe form of a substance but I think as judge will a father and judge the tell stated in the article is that you know and I started to go talk about this before the break was you know how people get rearrested than how people need second chances but I think\nBigger issue is we need to help these people get back on their feet and if you're constantly stepping on their back when they get out of out of prison\nHow is that going to happen if you don't make if you if you don't help these people out and I think the court my point is I think the court has done a great job we have programs such as veterans core drug court so we're constantly steep programs within the court system\nOf people getting second chance as we had justice reinvestment so we kind of all talked about this as a you know politicians that public policy people as court offices but ... what what message are we sending if we don't follow through with it and I understand people may be saying well jeez\nKnow you got a second chance he got his license back but when I got my license back I don't believe the Supreme Court said I had any exceptions to that I mean I'm a practicing attorney and I think that even with ... and I started to talk to you about some of my experiences I think you know it's a very humbling experience\nWell that I I don't doubt it and again I I I'm not against you and not bring not bringing it on to punish you I I have sympathy for your eye on and that's because the what do you feel sorry for him he cheated on me but I I'm just a second chance as part of of course listen is I'm a journalism right if you catch me making up a story\nA neck phoning up a story on the lose my job\nAnd then I probably should not come back and sit on the ethics of journalism committee\nBecause I lost that chance I that's what I'm saying\nLet me do that you could write a pitcher worries but you can't be on the committee you can't do that because of your circumstances so nobody is denying you a second chance maybe they could find you a job as a counselor you might be better talking to people who got jammed up or maybe you belong in some other area\nWell maybe you could do something else will be a law license but you have to ... the reality is maybe a policy does against you the state police are dropping you Cranston is going to drop you\nIt's got to be one after another so it's not working out Chris that's all I'm saying and again that's not against you this\nIs what I got to say I've been doing this for over a year I've been in this position over yeah I\nCan give you ... incidences where I Know some of these mayors or police chiefs knew that I was in that department for them to say a year later oh we didn't know he was there that's completely false okay\nBut that's a separate story that's separate and apart from the merits of your being there that's all I'm saying\nSo for them to say all of a sudden a year later you know and and I kind of cast that off and I'm I'm not going to get involved in this petty politics kind of it's an election in some crazy stuff goes on we all know that during the election yeah I'm I'm a private citizen now I'm not running for office\nCase to make now he was picking on Sheldon for belonging to bally's beach club and fled to said that they exclude blacks and Jews I don't know if that's in any policy that I could go read but practically perhaps you could several go go count the heads and you'll see Bailey speech club Sheldon shot back well this is coming from the guy belongs to the club so to watch a little bit but that's what they're\nTaking a I've never gone for a while it's going to clubs and that's not my that's not my universe than anybody you know like me like who is ever never been you know included or warmly welcomed by some of the fancier establishment in this state I think that you know we all know that feeling is like and we all know this class of people that do belong to those clubs\nAnd they don't encourage I think a lot of different kinds of people to join us clubs are particularly if you're not wealthy but a lot of other ways so you know you got to say to yourself this is again a fight between people who hang out with rich people on the beach and that's not most\nPeople on the beach but when I'm hanging out with all the rich people so again I don't think it's a it's a good use the time of the campaign when you really if you're really trying to win\nAnd I don't think people hold that against I mean tell belong to bally's beach club in fact he was once famously quoted as saying well this is all we have this\nAudio while you're picking on this this is all I Am an heritage well in the car and driver yeah tell us\nThe or the impediment is approaching ... which is all we have All right very good one to show up talking next week or ...\nTom pulled up those flights this is a little bit of exchange from uh from my debate with Sheldon Whitehouse and Bob Flanders on the

Washington is more of a citizen of that um that you know the use of Rhode Island and\nSo this is an and look he's a he's\n\nSaid his wife is the biggest shareholder bally's beach club and though that's not right to exclude blacks and Jews know Sheldon came back and said look you exaggerating bally's uh and I'm not going to apologize for the family I was born into play Sheldon Whitehouse\nAs we used to the for the belly speech club and you've been a few times on that it's a very exclusive places simply excuse keeps people out if some exclusive\nClub I don't think the ah my Republican opponent has car drives that at all the early uh and frankly as demand from the dunes club I'm not sure that this has much of a\nA strong argument for him but my point is I think this is the son fortunate discussion to be housing and we have stuff going on in Washington but is important we have health care programs with hundreds of thousands of Rhode islanders depend on that are under attack\nRight there you go uh I think to do is probably more inclusive than bally's but what I understand I've been to bally's I've been doing so much fun racist what was it the Groucho Marx that I
