these studies you sent your absolutely incredible\nAs you know I'm very into neutral picks the anti aging community has taken a keen interest in Korea teen specifically the cognitive benefits of Korea Team\nOh absolutely this is one of those areas where Korea Team really shy and you see what we need to understand is that your brain even though it's only two percent of your body's weight it utilizes twenty percent of your body is energy this is a very thirsty Oregon for\nEnergy and just like your muscles soak up decree it seemed like a sponge\nBecause this is a naturally occurring molecule in the body it passes right through the blood brain barrier\nYour brain or an soak it up like a sponge and it increases your Korea teen phosphate reserves in your brain some now in your brain you have more readily available resources to do was to recharge\nThose neuronal batteries to make more energy inside the brain so basically what do you notice well your memory is supported and pat scientists have done some amazing research here they found that people that take Korea teen its support their memory it actually helps the brain to utilize\nOxygen better it supports memory and people that are sleep deprived\nIt's been shown to help people add numbers quicker and for longer periods of time without mental fatigue get this study pat\nJust five days five days of eight grams of creativity and supported mental test subjects that we're getting rapid fire question scientists were asking him math questions and science questions over and over and over and they found the folks aren't creating didn't fatigues quickly\nMentally so this is amazing stuff it's like a turbo booster for your brain it's like a super charge you for your muscles are re chargers all your cellular battery so all of your cells tissues and organs have more readily available energy\nOr dark I loved that ever strong appeals to athletes and people want to get more reps in the gym maybe get some extra power and their workouts\nBut you're also saying there's a big push a nutritional community to encourage people in their forties fifties sixties seventies in even eighties to leverage the power of Korea Team to stay fit strong and healthy if you say\nKorea Tina's going mainstream you know I share the story with you before my mom who's in her late seventies now she's taking creating she works out a couple of days a week three days a week she goes to novelist does the free weights because she's got osteoporosis she wants to maintain her muscle mass and she wants to make her bones stronger and as you pointed out creating helps to do that\nAnd then the other three days during the week she'll go and she'll swim now she's not trying to get bigger stronger or anything like that but even at her age Korea teen has benefits\nOh yeah and what blows me away about that story 'cause you told me before is\nThat her medical doctor recommended routine for and that just goes to show\nHow much more mainstream this is it's called every strong and it supports the muscles that supports your power your strengths your speed if you're an athlete you're certainly going to love it\nBut even if you're not an athlete you notice the difference let's go to another study one more review study this out of the journal current aging science December of two thousand thirty and I thought this was very cool\n'cause the researchers looked at the body of research out there on creating and seniors without exercise they want to see what happens when seniors take Korea Tina and they don't\nExercise so I'm quoting here Korea ten supplementation without associated resistance training seems to enhance muscular strength power and insurance increase lean body mass for those that don't know what that is they're talking about muscle and improve the functional capacity of the elderly\nThey go on to talk about how it supports bone health as well and then they finished with this creating supplementation without training and the elderly\nCould potentially delay atrophy of muscle and unproven difference and strength so here again we see bottom line ... is very very effective it's gonna help you to feel stronger whether you exercise or not it supports your strength and power your brain health\nAnd on top of that it supports your bone health I mean ... when you think about it this almost sounds too good to be true right now you're a person that never heard about this and you're listening to us you would think this sounds too good to be true\nBut it is true hundreds and hundreds of human studies back up what we're talking about you're going to love the benefits you get with this ever strong formula\nThat's incredible let me remind everybody they can get a free bottom of the ever strong formula today plus the bonus bottle of be twelve energy melts\nJust by calling us at one eight hundred by eight zero eleven Seventy five you just pay for shipping that's one eight hundred five eight zero eleven Seventy five\nPastor that not only news the Bible is the Bible together it was a book that brings to light the key spiritual meaning of the scriptures\nWell on today's program I guess it's going to talk about this twenty four hour pastor and we hope that you will feel the love and care this past year as you listen to this edition and sent and I'll watch um\nWith me now is Keith ... the Christian Science practitioner and teach ya from Corpus Christi Texas I'm currently serving as the president of the ... the first to cry scientist in Boston, Massachusetts base of being with us today key on good to be here well\nWe're going to be talking about a twenty people out pasta\nAnd I just wanted to get the ball rolling by mentioning that here in the United kingdom and in other European countries we of course have many since the uh Christians and many other people equally devoted to different face such as Judaism and Islam Buddhism and into his him\nBut you know we'll have a large number of citizens who really don't think of themselves as ridiculous a tool or some of them are convinced that really is no God and no reason for religion while others pulled into that category of spiritual but not religious\nSo as someone who lives right that the hearts of America's Bible Belt how would you explain to such people the value of having a pasta you content to end your church and also the unique nature of the pasta in the church of Christ scientist\nOr those are two big questions I I guess first I can say you know whether people consider themselves to be religious or not you know believers in a higher power or not I've\nFound that most of them want to be healthy and and inspired about life and\nInspiration and health are caught the pastor of the church of Christ scientist provides so it really speaks to any individual anywhere of any faith or know face to old hearts are just wanting to be free and inspired and\nNow some of those listening the word pastor\nConjures up images of the kind of a religious person who shepherds congregation of people toward a more spiritual life\nBut the founder of the church of Christ scientist Mary Baker eddy ordained in impersonal pastor to minister to the needs of her church and she wrote in her book miscellaneous writings\nI hereby ordained the Bible and science and health with key to the scriptures to be here after the only pastor of the church of Christ scientists throughout our land and then other lands\nSo Christian Scientists recognize two books as their past or the Bible and science and health these passages from the books comprise the sermons that are read aloud at Christian Science worship services worldwide and our study throughout the week\nFor people who used to pass the preaching of particular salmon each Sunday reading to blows may seem limiting and lacking of inspiration what would you say to that case [noise]\nWell I found it Mary Baker eddy wrote true I have made the Bible in science and health with key to the scriptures the pastor for all the churches of the Christian Science\nTo nomination but that does not make it impossible for this pastor of ours to preach\nThe word of God is a powerful preacher and is not to spiritual to be practical or to transcendental to be heard and understood however this\nPast are not only ministers to those who attend services but two individuals who've never step foot inside the church or you know probably never think of themselves as religious it ministers privately to people all over the world is they read it inspires and he loves them\nWow so that makes this pasta the Bible in science and health valuable to anyone at any time\n[noise] and the value of having two books as a pastor is that they can be with you when the human touch can't you know you can hold them in your hands or read them on your phone you can memorize their statements and you can listen to the audio versions\nAnd they can be a just a mentor spiritual resource a timeless guide and as you said it's open twenty four seven and many find them to be a physician\nAgain that may be a very new concept to all this in this case so tell us about Mary Baker eddy who is not somebody that found the Christian Science but also the author of science and health\nAnd she was a just a lifelong student of the Bible and although the scriptures always took the lead in her life during the Eighteenth fifties and Eighteen sixties she experimented with different healing methods including homey up at the end the use of placebos\nDuring her research she discovered that drugs had no intrinsic power their own it was the human mind that empowers them and she felt there was something more something missing to the puzzle of healing\nAnd then she suffered a life threatening accident and as she lay on her bed reading accounts of Jesus healing she experienced a dramatic recovery and this swift healing center back into the Bible to discover the cause of the betterment and\nShe came to realize that although the human mind appeared to do marvelous things it was actually the cause of most pain and disease\nReal cures he found was in the spirit or mind of gone the genes as expressed are utilized and\nShe learned that both the human mind and body but Kim subordinate to gun laws regarding health when the spirit or mind have gone has lived and expressed\nPut into practice what she learned through prayer she healed people who've just a cute chronic and organic diseases\nShe taught others the healing named her system if even Christian Science and an Eighteen Seventy five she published science and fails to recognize it to be God's Gift of the world\nSo she ordained the Bible in science and health as the pastor the impersonal past her for her church\nBut not only doesn't care for their churches needs but anybody who's picking up these two books they they just feel guns love and care that powerful presence they feel the majesty of guns being in their lives\nOh that's beautiful and I mean that's a wonderful sense of a a pastor that I think I Would want to reach out to have I was in any kind of\nEat or wanting to understand something more about spiritual life so tell us a bit\nMore about how you have to love and an leaned on the pasta that you just described\nFrom an early age you know my my parents are both Christian Scientist so they they constantly everyday studied\nThe Bible and science and health through a Bible lessened the Christian Science church publishers and it's the same Bible lesson that is red in church services throughout the world\nAnd so they were constantly turning the Bible and science and health and that way and so that that was my example and so a an early age I went to the Christian Science Sunday school and her Bible stories and how they were relevant to my life\nHow they could enrich my being a ... and then I found that these two books they just they they became my friends and guides and constant physician they were just always there\nThat's great and uh so he says that you you had a good relationship with the pasta right from the get go\n[laughter] you know to me it's been just an automatic thing when I have a need I just turn to these books and whether it's a familiar passes I Know are sometimes I just open up randomly in and see where the inspiration leads because I found that it it's the spiritual ideas\nIn these books that moves salt in one salt moves that's when he is happening and what I mean by salt moving is just moving off of a materialistic or unlimited or selfish on base and I start to recognize this spiritual nature of what God has created us to be\nSo when you I'm sort of started hearing about this as as a child can you remember any specific experiences where\nYou felt the comfort of the past or ready felt that this pasta was communicating to you\nOh boy there's been just so many times [laughter] from physical healing I remember one time uh I was ... my twin brother and I we were playing little league baseball and um I was playing shortstop on this is\nThe biggest fastest guy was hitting the ball and he smacked a ball and hit the ground and took a band hopping hit me right I'm all\nAnd so I'm San during around and listen to figure eats you know a around the field as they're scoring runs on everybody else afterwards kept us oh you're going to have this black I made a lot of pain and stuff like that and when I got home and I I just my parents just kind of\nLove me and cared for me and just open up the Bible and started just reading just comforting passages and the next morning there was no black guy there was nothing it was just immediately dismissed\nAnd so it was just over and over again\nWhether it was a overcoming chicken pox just in a matter of twenty four hours or\nI'm just all sorts of things that kids get into when they're playing in the woods in Texas and the main thing was feeling on afraid that's to me that's what the pastor has brought me a feeling a sense that I'm not a victim I'm On afraid that I have dominion over my thought\nAnd that was in Nineteen eighty to ... and and as a I've been just continually open my thought up to ... it's a huge supply me what what is needed you know people call for prayer for help and it's been a daily rate and I get raises every year uh [laughter]\nI don't have a father and so it's just been just marvelous to see how that passage is Tom my fears to recognize that God does supply our needs\nMissing out the eighty needs and guiding us in our daily lives\nYou know whether it's relationships of financial health the answers their\nMm give you the spiritual idea that moves fault and when our thought moves that's when healing is happening because we we're also seeing more would uh spiritually true\nThat the harmony order the goodness that constitutes divine beating and seeing that is what is real and our experience right now\nSo as to the lower about that transition from being a musician on the road saying you'll get a two audiences to to becoming a Christian Science practitioner hitting people through through ...\nI mean it's a good question because we are talking about the twenty four hour pastor is and um when I was traveling on the road and we traveled to for\nTwo hundred shows a year for about ten years um and\nWe had road crew we had a quarter million dollars worth of equipment\nBut I also took with me everywhere I went this leather bagging in this leather bag it contained the Bible and science and health and different other a spiritual books but those Bible and the science and health where might just constant companion my pastor was with me everywhere and I would\nWake up about an hour earlier than\nThe other musicians in the road crew and I'd find a quiet\nPlace you know where I could turn on the lights and just kind of read and I and so I Would just try to be spiritually inspired you know everywhere we went\nAnd and after a while the road crew and the other musicians started to see that there was something to it\nThat there there was healing going on and every time there was a problem in their lives or a healing would take place at one time that one of our other guitar players had a daughter who's a was born and has a little hole in her heart and they they said the whole with not\nGrow together so they'd have to do surgery and so we waited for nine months\nAnd book they're done in Galveston children's hospital where they were going to do the surgery so we're on the road for nine months and every time we're about to eat a lunch or dinner a breakfast you know we'd all be sitting together and he and his guitar player he put a little picture of his little daughter uh open a can I start crying and so I Would start sharing\nIdeas that I was learning in the Bible and science and health so for nine months some sharing these these thoughts and these ideas just not pushing it just kind of trying to just lovingly be compassionate by\nSo nine months later we show up in Galveston and they do a test\nOr and they run the test and they find that the whole as actually disappeared little pinpoint and they have no idea how that took place but they said there's no surgery needed just wonderful to see you know gone healing powers through the pastor touching people around us\n... and that was oversee you'll stepping stone to find the deciding at some point that that was way you'll focus was going to be absolutely\nWow so you have the pasta you don't just see on a Sunday [laughter] full when you're in trouble it sounds like you go to your pasta every day and have a radio ongoing relationship\nThat's the comforting part never without my pastor\nThat so that they are there any final ideas\nYou would like to share all is a ... of the useful benefits of knowing God through the Bible in science and health\nOne of the competing things as a for many years I was single and you know thought about what I ever find a wife suitable for me [laughter]\nPicking guy and so after a while I finally just gave up and and I turn it over to go and say okay you know God it's your as can be your responsibility\nYou know in my mind just gonna walk in single blessed witness but they're always seem to be a little void and at that point it was just a materialistic selfish thinking when as soon as I\nTurned the pasture and found just comforting ideas of goodness and complete none of them that that disappeared and as soon as I felt complete spiritually that's when I met my wife [noise]\nMm well that's lovely and I'm One of the things that I just loved about this past uh over many is is is sometimes you can get very familiar with thoughts of\nWhat it sharing and yet the same thing that you've read over and over again one day it can just suddenly take on a whole new meaning and are not changing the truth that sharing that that just bring to light something really fresh and you and your own experience\nAnd uh it's an exhaustive all sorts of good isn't it\nOh it's great you know that there's a statements genesis they bring out this and they fear not for I Am with the and will bless the\nFear not neither be discouraged me strong in a good courage fear not be afraid of them for the lord thank God he it is that to go with the he will not fail the north for sake the\nKey thank you so much that's really a wonderfully uplifting and reassuring way too and it's been a joy\nI've been speaking with Keith ... the Christian Science teacher and practitioner from Corpus Christi Texas [noise]\nQuestions for some

to stop them at the border with Guatemala about two thousand Central American migrants ... or ... across the river that separates the two countries and reform their caravan in Mexico they say they will resume their journey to the United states\nThe respondents ended up being male uh mostly so again that was because of the efforts that we put in um we surprised with that number\nUp we would have wanted it to be higher of course um but when we first were getting the the responses from the online survey we went looking at closer to Fifteen Percent I'm so when we were able to jump to a little over thirty percent we were we were very excited about that\nSo that tells you a little bit about the value of going into the community as opposed to just trying to reach someone remotely so that's that's wonderful that you did that yeah\nYes okay go ahead sorry [laughter]\nSo um what else did you find about this survey that was interesting to\nSo what we learned again what are our purpose in doing the survey uh was two fold one to get a better sense of what Rhode Island is already understood a but then also we wanted to use that information to create our next public awareness campaign\nStrategies and so what we learned there were six recommendations that came out of the report a and what we learned was that a first\nWe needed to focus on improving Rhode islanders views on gender equality or so that when we\nLooked at the findings we saw that men with less formal education um had held onto views um that did it promote gender equality and so that was one of the recommendations\nThat like you're going to have a lot of recommendations that you can share with us um if you're joining us right now I'm Deborah Perry I'm sitting in for Deborah Giroux she'll be back after the November ... election remember devote\nA my guest is Lucy rails are from the Rhode Island coalition that gets domestic violence and we're discussing the results of the community attitudes assessment survey\nYes so let me ask you to share so we learned about improving views on ... um but we also um learned that um we needed to focus on countering perceptions of what\nThat domestic violence was a serious problem locally so we thought we were surprised that so many ... understood that domestic violence with an issue that they really still doesn't believe that it happened in their own communities\nAnd another recommendation was around changing perceptions of what constitutes abused so people were really clear about sexual violence physical violence but when it came to other forms of violence like control um isolation financially abuse\nAre they still weren't a hundred percent sure and if that was domestic violence or not was that surprising to you\nKnow when you have conversations in the community here um [noise] you know of folks making comments of that that reinforce some of those misperceptions and so it wasn't surprising um but uh it it gave us more information and again more focus as we think about\nUm our next our campaigns in future years\nSo this is really going to influence your your campaign\nDefinitely the other thing we learned was that um we needed to improve people's knowledge about domestic violence but also support them and increasing their comfort level in intervening when they know that domestic violence that's happening so we've heard a that\nA fifty percent of the respondents that identified as survivors said that no one\nUh supported them no one intervenes 'em and asked them how they could help them and so we know that people know that it's an issue they know that they should do something but they're not really sure exactly what they should be doing so that was another recommendation and then the last one I'm\nIs around focusing I'm helping to improve people's\nUnderstanding of that prevention is\nThat to preventing domestic violence and hope for prevention of domestic violence is possible and so so many people still believe that you know this is just inevitable that we're always going to have this issue and um as a coalition we've been focusing a lot on trying to\nI'm kind of stem the tide and changed attitudes that contribute to the ... problem of violence and really promote the fact that yes prevention is possible it doesn't have to be this way we can create a different world and um\nSo he keeps you keeps talking about the coalition what is the coalition who are just\nSo I Am a coalition against domestic violence um has is a leader in our state we have member agencies a five core member agencies that their primary purpose is on preventing into providing services\nFor victims of domestic violence and then we have a ... members which the YWCA as one of them on there helping us expand our reach 'em either by focusing on prevention or providing culturally specific programs\nOr to their organizations and our coalition does not provide direct services so we are out there a look really looking to do systems changed ... social norms change so our areas of work focus on that just said of advocacy communications prevention we have a task force of survivor is called sore that help us\nI'm an important all of our work around educating the public of what it means\nOr what domestic violence is and what it means to end it\nSo it sounds like you have a great coalition working towards on something that we as a society most definitely need to address definitely on you did mention the need to change perceptions of uh what ... ... his constituents abuse is what what is those misconceptions\nYes so I'm In the survey we asked questions about like is it abuse is a partner interferes with um someone's job um or prevents them from going to school and getting an education [noise] um\nIf they force them to a share their passwords for example is that if he does it do people have a right to privacy in relationships and I think in this age where technology\nUm and and the norms around technology have really shake changed um and so people are not really sure about like what a healthy boundaries you know do I have to be accessible do I have to share my account passwords\nWith my partner um and those are some of the um the misconceptions that we we were hearing\n'em in the community of and that we learned about in the survey um what do we do about ... views you know is that a real thing and how do we support people in figuring out how to establish healthy boundaries in their own relationship is it a real thing digital view it definitely is um and it's we we see a lot\nOf users using technology all the time whether it's GPS monitoring or whether it's been selling cameras that victims are not aware of in their home\nA controlling ... I'm not allowing the the victim to have their own privacy rights so controlling who they can take calls from a always harassing them via text messages demanding to know where they are who they are with\n'em so it's another tool technology is another tool for abuses to again exit exercise power and control over their over their partners\nI'm Deborah Terry I'm guest hosts for Deborah zero who's running for state rep districts Seventy four Middletown in Jamestown\nMy guess is Lucy ... from the coalition against domestic violets we'll be right back on amazing women to talk about how the coalition is using the survey to influence their upcoming campaigns right after this\nThanksgiving Christmas or or expose your weather forecasts showers\nAround this morning otherwise clubs give it away to some sun windy and cold or today temperatures of the highest point in your fifth inning and then clearing and cold and I go to thirty ... fifty three with W bureaus explosive accuweather a meteorologist evil\nAccuweather almost warrant for silver knowing where do\nYou work hard and you play hard and let's face it sometimes it hurts so stick it to the pain with the tiger bone pain relieving patch it's convenient to apply and the hydrogen technologies and tiger bombs proven pain relief right to your aches and pains\nIf it was safe and long lasting made from a blend of herbal ingredients tiger Obama's trusted pain relief for everyone so whatever your age or lifestyle roar back with tiger bone\nWorks where it hurts available\nAt stores everywhere [noise]\n\nAll right what your battery goes there everything can come to a stop to it which as well getting stranded stop bio why are we auto parts and get your battery tested re of George if you're if you're a battery does need to be replaced or widely auto parts can help you find the executive resort batteries that fits your car or truck at a guaranteed low price\nO'Reilly auto parts better ... better prices it reverse\n[noise] All right\nSo far [noise]\nBack to amazing woman I'm Deborah Perry sitting in for Deborah zero my guest is Lucy Rios the director of prevention and communications for the Rhode Island coalition against domestic violence she currently oversees the coalition's public awareness effort managers grant and provides technical\nTraining and assistant\nSo we've been talking about your new public awareness campaign which is based on the recommendations from the survey how would this\nCampaign implement these recommendations um\nWell we are really excited to launch this year's campaign again like I said that survey uh gave us clear direction about this six areas that we could work on and we decided as a coalition that\nUm and with our member agencies a that what the changing people's um knowledge about what constitutes abuse with the area that we wanted to focus for the next few years\nAnd so we took we partnered with um segments which is an advertising agency in the state of Rhode Island and we shared with them [noise] um some of the things that some of the findings have been sharing with all the view where folks um\nOur member agencies are in our coalition has been actively trying to again spread the word support people and I'm finding where where they are polling places are we just\nUm and we just want to just really a emphasize that how important it is this year to get folks out their voting\nGreen point it it's so very important yeah very good point I'm Lucy how about your final thoughts on this survey and how will it better educate Rhode Island is on domestic violence awareness\nYeah so final thoughts I think I'm again we are as a coalition staff of communications that an incredible job um and getting really clear about what is the message that we want to put out there\nUh and I'm hoping that this campaign will do what is intended to do which is his half people pause to educate themselves about what are those warning signs without those red flags and to be empowered to take action in\nSupporting whoever is going to that such\nThank you so much Lucy thank you for joining us\nAnd thank you to everyone listening for joining us uh I in keeping with Deborah zeroes tradition of ending with a quote and this one is from Marie Curie life is not easy for any of us but we must persevere and have confidence in ourselves\nWe must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing at whatever cost must be attained a\nCease gave Christmas Day cold weather center here's your exclusive your weather forecast showers\nAround this morning otherwise clubs give it away to some sun windy and cold or today temperatures at their highest point in your fifth inning and then clearing in cold at night down to thirty chili tomorrow southern clouds I'm fifty three for WPRI rose explosive accuweather a meteorologist divorce\nAccuweather on the voice of southern New England not enough of him and I am a sex or whether you are [noise]\n\nMoney wasn't could accumulate community on the ... Sochi sturdy enough of them to\nHear Oh thanks for joining us or as we head toward the election coming up there'll be a number of questions on the ballot all of them is the question number two this is a bond on higher education\nThis is going to be Seventy million dollar bond for the construction of new buildings and infrastructure of your eyes graduate school of oceanography a and also will have question about the road on a college\nAnd they find something school of education and human development coming up and say that number two of the program the president wrote on college ranks that shows is going to join us but in segment number one can use I made the trip from Kingston you know before the shepherd building you have to stay over and seek help when you make of like this from self doubted president to thank you for telling me that\nIt's great to be here and it's an easy drive I keep saying that it's nothing compared to the drugs are used to make in Montana [laughter]\nTrue enough but anyway nevertheless president is able to do is just like for you for coming in for ... years ago and we appreciate you hear a yes on a unquestioned to this is focusing on what's going on and there again so that the school of oceanography why is it for we'll focus on for for the sake of a program the the you arrived portion of this question\nOf why is it so important for the voters as you see it\nTo a set aside forty five million dollars for the school of oceanography that's a big investment or and what what what is the thought process and why we need to do the snow in Rhode Island for\nA venture the question is a very good question\nUh I I Would say all of Rhode Island can be proud of what happens with the Narragansett Bay campus of the University of Rhode Island it's obviously the home of the graduate school of oceanography a lot of programs from our college for environment and life sciences or talked down there all around marine biology and awkward culture for instance and\nAlso it's the home of ocean engineering all of those entities will benefit from\nA a yes on question to vote or the key things to keep in mind are\nOn the graduate school of oceanography is one of the world's premier oceanographic research Institute\nIt covers the entire globe it's work\nAnd it does so in ways that I think creates economic opportunity for many Rhode islanders keeps Rhode Island\nOr international news every time you see a hurricane forecast and they show the American model that was developed at the University of Rhode Island is continuously updated it's getting more and more accurate did a great job calling Michel ... and Florence that's just some of the things that go on there\nWhat forty five million will do for the Narragansett Bay campus in the graduate school of oceanography is very important it'll create a new ocean technology center\nWhich will be ... research and education around all aspects of technology that we can deploy and marine the environments it'll create a marine operations center to support the research that we do out in the oceans of the world\nAnd finally it'll create a new doc which is absolutely essential because in twenty Twenty one University of Rhode Island will be the home of a brand new one hundred and twenty five million dollar research vessel provided by the national Science Foundation\nThat will be one of the nation's leading a assets in ocean exploration and study for the next forty years\nAnd there's a lot is ... ... is it in need of investment it or against it I mean for a lot of ... a lot of people are very familiar with what goes on in Kingston I mean people visit the campus of they've gone to school they're graduates their kids go to school there maybe not quite as many uh go to the the big campus or is it is in need of of the the investment\nThere's the ... it's been it's been in many cases forty or fifty years or some of the structures uh that were put up down there to serve us all of the work that's done are often Narragansett Bay campus were completed\nUm the most recent addition we did was also funded by Rhode Island taxpayers we're abroad and that was the creation and building of the ocean science exploration center the ocean exploration center which\nAre still home to the inner space center and a in a lot of work we do but there are a lot of other facilities that are in desperate need of rehabilitation and repair and we don't have an ocean technology Research Center right now for graduate school of oceanography\nAt the Narragansett Bay campus and so it will create something entirely new we have facilities for the ship\nThe ... they work very well for the endeavor\nBut they're inadequate for the new ship because the new ship is much larger than the endeavor [laughter] it'd be pretty big when you go down every or to get a tourist [laughter] it it really is\nYou know it is important I mean the the school of oceanography I mean we are so many of us in Rhode Island we hang our hat it's on her license plates I mean we are the oceans\nSo I study of the ocean it's ... it's really critical at the university as it\nIs it's and it's critical to so so many aspects of the Rhode Island economy thing of our fisheries industry I think of our aquaculture industry uh think of all the marine traits that are located here in the industries around them that are located here in Rhode Island we've always been a stay focused on the ocean we've\nAlways been a state that has benefited from our access to the oceans and the terrific ports we have here are so much of our coastline is vulnerable in an era of increasing climate change ocean warming and sea level rise\nThat makes it very very important for Rhode Island I think to be among the world's leaders and understanding what's going to happen in the oceans how we can prepare for how we can make our coastlines more resilient\nIn the face of increasing likelihood of large major storms crashing into our shoreline how can we protect our fisheries how can we protect the ... culture industry that's doing so well here in this state all things those things mean more research more steady more education rate related to the ocean and to the coastline\nSo she you know you bring up the climate change and I mean that really stands out there's so much news today that is\nThat it's covered by would just watch this destructive hurricane and certainly the jury's out as to you know the relation between hurricanes and their frequency under strength but uh so so much important now is the climate and and this is going to help obviously toward what we're doing a lot of what's going on at the oceanography school is looking at it because ocean rises what this is all about\nOh yeah that's about to thinks it's about sea level rise an ocean warming those both of those things have profound affect what people need to understand\nThe ocean doesn't have to get much more than a degree are so warmer than it is currently on average now without having that if it does get that much warmer it'll have profound consequences we're already seeing it lobsters are moving north blue crabs are moving more\nWere how to you know a decade from now we may not be able to have lobsters in Rhode Island waters because the water will simply be too warm for them there'll be up further north\nThat's just one small aspect ... ocean warming means and ocean acidification as carbon dioxide is produced a lot of that as absorbed by the ocean that's a good thing in the sense that it's not in the atmosphere adding to global climate change\nBut it's in the ocean carbon dioxide in the ocean makes the ocean more acidic that's bad for a lot of marine life we need to understand all of that in great detail in order to know how we can deal with it\nAnd an study is as you put it is also very important to our economy as well a lot of people come here to study it a lot of people work there right what what are the some of the in the general sense how many people that have studying down there and how many people\nWill have for instance we'll have a we have about a hundred graduate students are working at the University of Rhode Island in the graduate school of oceanography at any one time and and some of the other programs that are down there we have hundreds of undergraduates make use of those facilities uh throughout the year\nUh we have a research staff of of of sixty or so scientists faculty members and research scientist who are there\nAre working in all of the laboratories onshore and then frequently uh at the uh in not just the endeavor but in many of the ships owned and operated by the United states of America whether they're at other institutions or here in Rhode Island\nWhat tradition traditionally voters have been uh been very generous in terms of the ballot initiatives most of them most of them make it through and I and certainly the university has benefited from that if\nYou said that this is happening in other places in the country with other another in other institutions you're preparing teachers your\nSame fact uh our co deans or they have not only engage with the teachers in Rhode Island principles and superintendents\nBut as I mentioned with folks all over the country who are doing this specifically related to a this video coaching and video analysis a school in New York City Hunter College is really on the front edge of this doing great work and we've\nSat down with their dean looked at their curriculum looked at their space in terms of how they'd actually works a but more and more schools around the country are using that as a strategy\nSo that a very early on you can have an environment instead instead of a student you're having to coordinate to go ... miles away to another school to get that experience and then try to monitor\nAnd mentoring coaching teaching train\nYou can do it right there in the facility and so that's what we're looking\nAt is really kind of bringing twenty Eighteen into the education or to the education process for teachers who wrote\nAn I Would even say this is a really a a twenty or twenty but they really are cutting it's really a a head right now and it's what the the very best teacher education programs in the country are doing for so we're very excited that we can do that here in Rhode Island\nWhich is traditionally the voters have been very supportive of of of really all of these that's what I learned I mean you know with with especially in regard to higher education I I think that the uh the residents and voter certainly see the value of supportive of both University of Rhode Island that big campus here in Providence and kinks but also wrote on college as well\nYeah you know I I just finished up my second year and as I get to go into my third year I'd I had been very impressed\nWith red Rhode islanders in general they've been very warm and inviting a certainly to me and my family but I certainly appreciate their law ongoing commitment to higher education as you pointed out many bonds over the past have been supported by\nA voters a and I certainly appreciate that people really see when when you have a well running\nHigher education institution that helps the economy it helps families it helps businesses in terms of talent acquisition and it's particularly important from Rhode Island college when you consider right now we're the only\nFour year institution in the state they can say that Seventy seven zero percent of our students stay right here in Rhode Island important innocent and how they get jobs to raise families and they support our economy so if you're a you're if you're investing in college are investing in Rhode Island\nAnd it's been a big issue for I mean so many people have talked about that issue of keeping keeping Rhode islanders in and ... and that's been part of the discussion with the the governor's program the college promise and there's been debate about that but one of the things that everyone can agree on is we need to keep more young people in Rhode Island right\nThat's right and I think we're doing it a better than most ah like which key to that is making sure that they're highly trained and highly prepared for the jobs are not not only the jobs that today but the jobs of the future and that's what we're working on it to college\nSo tell us how things are going on campus here another semester it's already been October already getting the frost sitting here you know before we know it will be rough nothing like it like we were told to do with the kids the kids say the same age we get a little bit older has pretty much shut right at the time really marches on doesn't know it it it\nDoes you know things have gone a very very well at the college you know this bond is a particular interest\nIt is right now ah and then we're going to be opening up a couple of other facilities or some of the renovation were doing but uh it is it time it's hard to believe we already had our our homecoming a couple of weekends ago and um yeah now where we're having a good time and and things are going well in college\nReally poor wrap it up really important you feel that the voters support question too and again the question for you what Ryan regard to the bay campus in the school of oceanography as well as the Feinstein school of education are very important to say to approve this\nOh I I think it's an incredibly important you know a one way to look at it is our children to state I Need to come first here and we all know the impact highly trained highly prepared teacher can have\nNot just in educating our children but in in terms of our children's future teachers have a huge impact and here we are talking about\nThe training of the majority of our teachers\nAre not just I wrote out of college but through this facility and this facility and the new technology and the new curriculum or touch every single teacher is going to be going out to Rhode Island college are going out to to the broader state so I think it's incredibly important and and what does certainly ask for your\nListeners to support question number\nTwo when his question number two again going on the ballot Seventy million dollars or investment University of Rhode Island in Rhode Island college for some centrist actually come and it's unclear everything's going well up there you know fit in his going well it's never easy\nOn a movie every day but we are doing doing some great work there and ah you know ... some people are beginning say Rick is on the rise\nRight now is very exciting work not just in the facility side but that we knew the curriculum or do we know the energy quickly becoming a first choice institution per Rhode islanders we're starting to see in the data\nAnd in fact we I'm a survey to all of our students went to orientation full Seventy six percent had rolled out of college first choice institution and that number seems to be on the rise I think a lot of our families are seeing the quality the value and the innovation this happened yet Rhode Island college and\nAnd they're taking a second look at it so excited about that\nIn in the ... graduations keep up the good work ethic so much for the president wrote on ... and Franks Sanchez who was a witness who else thank God ducks David Julie joined us presidents ...

he will pull the United states out of an arms control agreement with Russia because Russia is violating yet the president also complains that the agreement is keeping the U.S from developing new weapons correspondent Frederick like good news in Moscow this morning\nA lot of very senior Russian politicians\nThat have come out very early on a Sunday Morning and express their dismay at all of this I Want to review part of what the head of the federation councils foreign affairs committee Constantine called the chess a nuclear power what are the two participants in one of the fundamental agreements in the field of strategic stability unilaterally destroys it\nDespite efforts to stop them at the border of Guatemala and Mexico about two thousand Central American migrants have crossed the river separating the two countries and have reformed their mascara than in Mexico correspondent Patrick ... traveling with the caravan says the migrants are planning to resume their journey toward the United states\nUm she had retired first about three years before he did and we get that all set up and then ultimately he came and took care of his retirement and then the next meeting I walked into the conference room and I could just cut the tension with the nuts and I'm like whoa\nI Wonder what's going on here so I sat down and it's so what's going on\nAnd she just started you know what you know\nDo this on Monday I Do this on Tuesday the sun was this opera Thursday and friday she said I\nHad my whole retirement plan and now he wants me to change all that because he's retired now you need to tell him that he has to get a part time job\nSo you know I kind of looked outside for enough so you need to get a part time job for twenty hours a week and then they turn ... obviously you need to work the other twenty hours because you're seeing too much of each other and then you guys have to figure this out\nSo then they kind of took the edge off a little bit but it was just so funny or the way it happened but the point is when you go into retirement perhaps you should consider what's going to happen when your spouse retires later on and how you're going to adjust\nTo make that transition easier for them\nSo you can't just be thinking about what your activities or because you know you've been married for decades so all of a sudden your spouse in it I think that's a good thing that he wanted to spend time with his wife as opposed to you know spending is they fishing or something you know that he wanted to be with her so I thought that was a good sign but anyway it worked out and\nThey they both had to adjust a little bit and it all worked out so I'm familiar amassing associates I think if you save two hundred thousand or more of your retirement give us a buzz we'd love to have you in sit you down see see what your goals or see what your anticipation for your retirement see if we might be able to provide some value\nHelping you first determine where you are currently what your level of risk is currently especially if you were shaken up a little bit on that act Tobar ten drop you know and that week\nWe had a big drop of eight hundred plus plus five hundred plus the next day\nI mean yeah the market has some some recovery sense but it's important to get a good handle as to what your level of risk is so the number here for a one three three three eight thousand\nYeah once we start piecing together our lifestyle goals and retirement how do we proceed\nWell then we start putting together or you know price tag many ... financially would you need to support that lifestyle what are the expenses of those retirement goals some of your day to day expenses may decline or even disappear once you retire\nBut you'll still have the essential to cover you know those were housing transportation food health care not just the mores what\nProperty taxes insurance or in a condo you got home owner association fees and so on\nThen there are the the non essential you know what I call the fun stuff dining out travel you know given the charities\nYou know those things might actually go up at the beginning of your return the important thing is to understand what those expenses will be on a monthly basis especially those that cover the essentials so you can have a clear understanding\nWhere your retirement savings overall should um help to there is no magic number to save for retirement you know so we can't go to the old magic eight ball like when we were kids\nIt's still not going to help you in the general expectation and this is all over the board and I see lots of surveys not sure that I really agree with it because I just have a different perspective general expectation is to replace Seventy to Ninety percent\nOf your annual pre retirement income with your own savings and Social Security I met with the a couple recently that were very frugal very well paid had amassed\nA lot of money like over two million dollars they are telling me and they had their whole spreadsheet that they spend three thousand dollars a month\nNow there's to Social Security checks\nWill cover that so when you look at it I mean they're they're fine they will probably never\nOutlived their money they do not need to replace their income to Seventy or Ninety percent so that when I see everybody situation's different that's just one simple example of someone that just met with recently\nSo that is why it's so important to come in if you save two hundred thousand or more for your retirement\nSit down with us let us see what your goals are then we'll do a deep analysis come back at the second meeting show you what we see and if there are opportunities for improvement will point that out we will also point out the good things that we see with what you've done the spar\nAnd then you go from there after that second many ... pretty much decide do you think we can help you or are not\nPretty simple there's no pressure for that is a complementary meeting process that we take you through and it is a a trademark process it's the Massey on money retirement road map and you know we talked about that in the book that just came out a couple of months ago as well so our number here for a one three three three eight thousand we look forward to recall\nHaving up a little later in our program what does this month drop on Wall street mean for you and your retirement we asked David by one of America's favorite financial educator and he weighs in on that coming up and we do know saving money is one thing but what else can you do to

big drop in popular tax stock splitting impact will sell off in motion so what does this mean for you your finances and most importantly your retirement\nDavid by a well known financial educator is here to make sense of what's happening on Wall street and David been featured on Fox CBS CNBC the today show and Oprah\nDavid been out there teaching America about money for more than two decades he's nine time New York times best selling author of books including smart couples finish rich and smart women finish rich and today he's co founder of ag wealth management one of America's fastest growing our eye gaze\nDavid wealth and we are thrilled to have you with us today\nThanks for having me on the show so let's talk about that and eight hundred plus point drop or the Dow Jones we know that rarely happens due to just one event so set the stage for us here what sparked a sell off\n... well it's a handful of things first of all and so the question becomes all their ... going on and I'll give you an example\nThe first thing is that rate struggling and you even heard the president talked about this well let's break it down what does that mean when you hear rates are going up and that is raising rates\nThe fed the actually been raising rates really doubt but most recently the fed raises rates on the money that they can call that ... ... ... happened\nWhen those rates went up a couple of things happened first of all the cost of borrowing money goes right so you're going to borrow money for if you're going to refinance or if you're going to buy a car and finance that car\nOr you're going to use credit cards for that matter any where where's your are owing money the cost to borrow that money is now going on and that spoke\nSpokes market right because if you're well maybe people will buy the buy less home they'll refinance so they'll buy less cars are those shop is what it costs more to borrow money the markets kitsch boots that consumers will slow down on there and\nSo that's the first thing it's really been a story about the fed\nAnd rates going now we have to put down a little bit in the context because let's be honest rates have been really really really really low like you know we've had historically low rates for well over ten years\nAnd those historically lower rates the fed put in place after our great recession we're successful that's what got the economy going again and that's why we are right now enjoying what is the longest bull market in history so you have to put that in perspective um and\nThere are also some other things are happening that are influencing the stock market which of those rates have gone up the ten year treasury the rates have gone up on that right now and\nThat's the highest rates we've seen on your treasury didn't like seven years so that's also a very [noise] and then there's the fact that attack market hasn't weighed like right let me see if\nWe sell often tech stocks particularly tech stocks though I'm like Amazon and Facebook and that's not all related interests been some data breach\nWith companies like Amazon potentially data breach and these folks had a recent data breach soldiers so often these tech stocks but again making putting that in perspective it's\nBeen a tech stocks have been driving the market hire companies you know we called fang companies like Facebook and Amazon and Netflix and Google main tech companies have been actually on fire insurance growing in stocks and driving the market in fact they pulled down a little bit\nUm it's not that surprising it was probably about time to see ... and I think the third thing that we know is affecting the marketing is actually the global markets that trade wars\nAll this talk of trade war with China is having an impact and it's been really having an impact global the global markets have been really hurt the U.S economy it's just been on fire we have been absolutely rushing it we've had the stock market in the world um\nAnd so we you know us pulling back a little bit compared to what's happening abroad um there's really\nA lot less like abroad the global markets on emerging marked down we've just been doing great so I think it was time for us Marc maybe a little bit to an almost recognize things are slowing down globally\nPartially because of the fear of these trade wars with John\nDavid I Want to go back to those rising rate I Know that they can spell trouble for the overall economy but aren't higher interest rates are really good for retirees\nWill you know what\nYeah you're exactly right they are good for retirees especially retirees by the way it will pay down debt right which is something I've talked about for Twenty years the fastest way to\nTo reach retirement early is to pay your debt off so if you reached retirement and you don't have a mortgage you don't have a car\nAnd you're probably not using credit cards to borrow money if if you're doing one retirement and the good news about race going higher is that the rates on your money market and your checking account CDs\nAnd again treasuries are going higher and if the most retirees live off of the\nIncome that their retirement money produced\nSo the good news and I think are actually a lot of good news I think I think before you know we will see tenure treasuries 'em over three and a quarter to even three and a half percent and there's talk that\nThe tenure treasures could eventually get to four percent in the next Eighteen months and all of a sudden we have rates again that retirees will be able to look at it and go wow you know what that's pretty good I can I can live off of those those income checks and so I think it is\nFor retirees it can actually be a very positive\nWe're speaking today with nine time New York times best selling author David Box well known financial educator about the recent market dropped I Know people listening who are in are nearing retirement David they want to know is this the beginning of the market correction\n[noise] so I should pull my crystal ball right now [laughter] right it's funny 'cause because here's nobody knows right ... ... what I what what I Know and we've been talking about this\nMaybe you know I've done other interviews on um I Know that we're we've we've just had the greatest bull market of our lifetime I I Know that have you been in the markets even after the recession hit and even after the markets pulled down it's just stayed the course today more wealth than you've ever had\nAnd at the same standpoint the last two months I've been telling people don't get like don't now's not the time to get greedy now is not the time to get complacent\nSo it's very important if you are about to retire or you're already retired it's very important that you're not taking too much risk with your money because if you're in your fifties in the markets pullback you can't afford\nTo take the time to let the markets recover but if you're tired your\n... your comfort level with seeing your money drops significantly is going to be lower so it's really important I I just can't stress enough that when you're approaching retirement order or you're already retired that you talked with a financial adviser that you work with a financial wise or if that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "WPRO Morning News", "city": "Providence", "day": "21"}
