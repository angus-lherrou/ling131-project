we've seen an increase in regular mail ballots in fact I myself asked for a mail ballot this year I just like I said they've got a crazy for me and I wanted to make sure that I got it in on time\nAnd with emergency ballot so that a lot of different\nBalance is a little bit different yeah there's ... that's when you walk in and say I can't be there on election day I don't have the number off the top of my head for today based because we do um keep tabs on it you know basically every day uh those numbers are entered into the database system if people are people's mail ballot applications are entered by the city's in town\nWho did I mean the trend what have you seen as I\nKnow I mean like it is up I mean I've seen it up over the last three election cycles I\nThink people have discovered that you know they have very busy lives and a emergency mail ballots walking at the city and town all thing I'd\nLike about right now please out now is when I can do it is a very convenient thing which is why I have a tried to get early voting a established in our in our state or other excessively so far but hopefully if I get reelected I'll do it again next year\nWe'll know has a little controversial because of the candidates worked out to their advantage they makes you look at the when there will drive you you'll get your only thing we can count on you boom so there has been more of an effort on the candidate's part I think the generate interest in that and it seems to be working\nI think historically that has been the case I think now it's more regular people just saying oh I didn't know that I can just walk into the city or town hall or wow that's great I can do it when I Am able to vote not just on a specific date\nSo I think it's a combination of both people realizing that they can do this themselves as well as the candidates\nYou know getting out the vote which is of course with candidates do\nBut you know the original ... the original idea was well you really can't be here you're really going to be on a plane to want to go do that today it's an emergency it's turned into a de facto early voting which they have another state and you say we ought to just make it make it one one one complete clear thing here am I correct\n... absolutely I think to make it clear to people or you don't have to have an emergency you can just walk in and say I just can't be there on election day\nOr you can um you can just do that that way and it's also right now very paper\nA intensive process so we would we would basically be opening a polling location you would show your ID you would just go into you know the the ... they would they would check you went through the poll pads and\nThen you would be given a ballot and you yourself get to the ballot going into the machine so I think it would be an improvement\nWith is what is it is what it has become even though we called emergency you it's just a it's a you can go do and anybody can do in the ... it's the way it is now a though I was on vacation as you know brother news is never far away\nFrom the headlines I was reading about you you made some changes to the voter rolls and do you deleted a birth dates and the critics were saying oh you did that for a bad reason and you kept secret because you like things\nAre to be kept secret what's your response to that\nI think if you see my track record over the last four years you will see that that is absolutely not correct or just in terms of my the way I operate but also\nIn reality no we did not delete anything and we did not do anything stealth fully in fact uh what we've done is to waive people's\nUh the the concern around people's identity and identity theft in a digital age with a with the openness in government that we absolutely have to have\nA you know our laws were set up at a time when everything was paper\nAnd as we've computerized we haven't really taken a look back to say hey\nThis is still work so what I did basically was two years ago uh we came to realize that we were doing wholesale like if you came in and you pay twenty five dollars you would get a CD with the voter file that included people's full date of birth okay\nWhat's wrong what's wrong with that because we want to know if we me and my father\nI Know so here's the thing was the only thing we did was to take out if you're going today you get the the voter file except\nJust the the Europe or not the month and the and the day so that it's a little bit harder to do this thing where you can match the database with another database and suddenly I've stolen your identity\nI Know but I ... I understand you're saying it was for it to keep people's identity in in this age where people want to steal your but your critics are saying that makes it difficult to keep an eye and the integrity of the voter rolls and you didn't tell us we're doing now you listen politicians you put a put on a press release do you fix the crack of missteps or how we didn't find out about it\nNo we actually we actually did a sent a letter to the city and town all thirty nine cities and towns were formed a Mr block I Know at that time it a lot of noise about it but\nUm no it was not done at all ... it was not as a part of a of a governor governmental process so now\nMy next term I absolutely believe that we need to take a look at not just this piece of the law but also um all of the elections law and and and\nIn how we come back home\nBanding together\nFrom a community when you're in when someone expression have\nAnd violence doors you\nKnow\nAll of us one note of discord as Reverend Donny
