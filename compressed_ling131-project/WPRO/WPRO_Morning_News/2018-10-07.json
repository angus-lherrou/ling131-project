I Know that purity it's been a business now for\nWhat is it over Twenty years are going to stop reading from the better Business Bureau and people can get complimentary bottle of this green T. C. R. today we'll give that number out in a few minutes but first\nWhat does this she are seeing foreign second you designed this formula in a liquid soft you why do you like the liquid soft joke technology so much\nOkay first questions first it's called green tea CPR which is short for green tea\nKirk human and there is there a troll the big three ingredients that are in this product and meaningful protective amount the reason that it's in a liquid soft shell is that that allows for rapid and very complete absorption\nI'm not suggesting that there's anything wrong with tablets or capsules that contain powders because there isn't but when you have a fluids soft shell you just happen to get more quick break down of the capsule more rapid absorption and to some extent more complete absorption\nInto the intestines that means that your body utilize is more of the ingredients and the supplements so Greenpeace ER is green tea\nKirk human interest Vera trial and the reason for a liquid soft shell is it's just a superior dosage form especially for the three particular ingredient\nNow of course before we tell our listeners how they get their very own complementary\nBottle green tea see our show me that you wanted to buy this green tea plus the patented B. C. M. Ninety five per human plus there was very rich role I mean you spent close to probably least Seventy five dollars for all three bottles and store and yet today purity products is giving away\nFree bottle how are they able to do this\nWell you can consider it kind of a smart bat and what I mean by that first of all there are these big but they're also very strategic they know\nThat if a person who is listening will pick up the phone call in and get their free bottle and it really is free as free as and it doesn't cost you money if that person will try the product take it as recommended they're going to feel it\nAnd when they feel that they're going to say gee I Want this as part of my regular daily regimen so purity it's really betting beyond the free bottle they're betting that people will have a positive experience\nThat they'll say gosh I like this I Love the way I feel on green to UCR and they'll order more so from purity standpoint I have to say\nIsn't much of a risk it all\nCrucial that sort of want to get to the special on for more from my guest coming up in a minute there's an incredible free bottle offered today on surety products amazing new green tea she aren't super formula here's the deal\nPurity politics right now in fact the one of the first thousand callers today just before Ninety five for shipping which is one hundred percent refundable purity can rush you want to complimentary bottle of green tea she are formula for you to put to the chest you try and\nYou'd be the judge purity knows that once you've experienced the benefits of green tea CPR you're not going to want to miss a day of taking it and that's why they're willing to send you a free bottle today so call right now operators are standing\nBy one eight hundred for nine nine seven five zero five again that's one eight hundred for nine nine seven five zero five call now one eight hundred for nine nine seven five zero five\nGreen T.

C. R. it has to be the right extract we've got the right extract but the science is there for healthy weight management\nRight now Chris you see that with charities formula\nIt provides you with about three cups with green tea in each to capsules serving of these cutting edge liquids off ... so you know the green tea is concentrated benefits for energy for heart health for alertness in just too soft gel caps plus you get to Kirk human in the ... too so it's easy you call it\nYour daily short cut to better health explain this idea of a healthy short cut and explain some of the top benefits as well\nWell I mean you could for example drink three cops are good concentrated green tea each day\nEat at least one really rich curry made with a lot of tumor recruit and drink a couple of glasses or red wine you can do that every day most people will not do that every day but they still might want the benefits of\nThree of the biggest superstar protective health and Hansing nutrients on the entire planet\nSo when I call this a daily short cut I'm simply saying that\nYou can get in the capital in a good liquid soft gelatin capsule what you otherwise have to get by drinking a few cups of tea eating at least one large you know tumor Laden curry every day and drinking a couple of glasses of concentrated red wine\nAgain we're talking with Chris killing the medicine and murder now in this new green T. C. R. formula purity it's really about the research share it with some of your favorite studies in the headlines on the human that we didn't get to yet I Know this is one of your favorite ingredients for joint comfort and even for brain him\nI especially like\nThe liver protective heart protective and joint modifying properties of this stuff the liver is our greatest detoxify Oregon and we know that we're constantly bombarded by toxins in the environment in fact blood studies show the newborn babies contain too\nIndustrial pollutants in their blood at the time of birth so we need a functioning super healthy very strong liver\nIf you'll raising children if you are a child or if you just know and love what it means to be the cherished child of God as we all are\nThan there is something to you on this edition of sentinel watch [noise]\nI'm ready to politician with us now to talk about being parents did by God is Christian Science practitioner and teacher march twenty thanks for joining us today mark it's so good to be here\nWell as the father of two children I like to ask you what has Christian Science taught you about being a good parent\nYes that certainly is a loaded question and it's something I've thought about even when I was little I remember when I was growing up there were a few years where my parents couldn't take care of me\nBut that didn't preclude me feeling of fatherhood and motherhood of God you know knowing that God is our father God is our mother that's a beautiful concept\nBut it's so much more when it becomes just tangibly real and I remember when I was a little boy learning in the Christian Science Sunday school about how God as my father and mother there is a place in the Bible where it says it is he that has made us and not we ourselves\nWell that meant that even when I was living with other families are as a little boy\nI still felt very close to my divine parent to got to my father or mother and that was something that gave me strength and continue still to strengthen me knowing that you're constantly Parenthood oh you're never too old for that\nYeah and so then now appear yourself have you helped your own children get to know that father mother God that is always with them wherever they are\nYou know it's funny you think I Would really have a good handle on parenting but when I had my own kids I did feel kind of responsibility sometimes they have a responsibility to do it right and to be a good father just to\nMake sure everything went well for them I just learned this lesson even deeper that God is the only parent Mary Baker eddy the person who founded Christian Science she says in her book science and health with key to the scriptures\nShe says God has countless ideas and they all have one principal and parentage\nWell she refers to us as ideas of God\nWe're spiritual and that's where the idea concept comes from but she says we have one parent itch in other words it's only God who creates s and oh it was a joy as my children were growing up\nToo deep than my appreciation of God as each of the children's parents I Would have to step back\nAnd let God\nBe the parent sometimes here's a good example when my son was trying to decide on which college to go to and he had done very well in high school and so there were I think ten or eleven schools that he was considering\nAnd I knew the left and I had been traveling around to these different schools with him we were visiting the schools and talking to the different people in the um different departments have the schools and\nI have to tell you I definitely had ideas about what I saw was the best school farm that kind of thing and I'm sure it wasn't the secret to him which ones I thought were good he could probably tell but you know I Know that stepping back and letting God be his parent was what was needed\nAnd you know he had such a encouraging fresh view on how to pray about choosing the school and I could tell it was his parent God\nWho what's prompting this in him he didn't ask God to put him in a school where he'll be happy or where he'll do well his motive why us to be of use to God so his real question was as he prayed God would you put me in the place that is most useful to you\nWell that's way above just human opinion he was really putting his hands in his divine parents' hands and all of that certainly proved true\nI remember when I'm there was one particular school right at the end that we um visited and he told me yes I'm not sure exactly why but I Know this is the school I'm supposed to go to know all the rest of the schools that had visited seem really great too but this one he just really felt this is where he's going to go he went\nAnd you know how sometimes things in your life you know you make a decision and you think it's for one reason but it's for other reasons that you don't see yet and that's what the divine parent can do God's parenting has a much broader view than just a human parents\nHe went to this school and yes had a wonderful time did write in school and really loved it but you know he met a couple of people who we ended up helping through prayer one person who he literally saved her life through prayer\nAnd so I Would have never known that that was the place he was supposed to go but that was where his divine parents knew and from that point forward I'll tell you\nI won't have to learn the lesson again [laughter] I Know that it's the parenting of God that really is the best parenting and\nAs we as parents are parents to be are praying about how to help our kids it is so good to know that we can reflect the father of it that the motherhood of God\nYou know there's a place in in that book I mentioned science and health and it's always been so helpful to me on this subject Mary Baker eddy says in science man is the offspring of spirit\nThe beautiful good and pure constitute his ancestry his origin it's not like that of mortals and brood instinct nor does he pass through material conditions prior to reach intelligence spirit is his primitive and ultimate source of being God is his father\nAnd life is the law of his being well as parents\nTo recognize that God is the father and mother each of our children are there such springs and uh you know what's good about it is that\nThe father mother who was gone all ways with our children we may be miles from those kids are hearing the divine parent God\nMine spirit is always with and that now is my role in parenting we hope that\nWell [laughter] really helpful insights thanks so much for being with us today and sharing them\nI just love being here\nI've been speaking with more money a Christian Science practitioner a teacher from India Park New Mexico\n[noise]\nMust be now to continue our discussion of being ... by God is gene Hicks and from Brad sultan Georgia thanks for joining us today\nThank you read it the pleasure to be here and a privilege\nWell you know we've been hearing so much in the news about the plight of children who are either without parents are displaced from their parents due to various hardship so that was a Christian Scientist huh have you been praying about the situation\nI Know the Christian Science can enable all of us to know and feel God's healing love and present\nThinking of the children we hear about in the news I often pray for an enlarged understanding of home and who are true parent is which I have learned to be our father mother God I learned a good lesson about this many years ago when I was teaching a group of second graders\nThis class had thirty four students to students who lived with both of their parents\nOne lived with her mom who was the single parents the remaining thirty one were led by their parents to live with someone in the neighborhood who was unrelated to them sometimes there'd be four or five unrelated children living with a neighbor and sometimes as many as twelve children the\nParents would come once or twice a year to visit these children these parents were migrant workers who traveled up and down the east coast from Virginia to Texas they picked whatever was in season cotton peaches strawberries et cetera\nThis situation was so sad to me that each day on my forty minute drive home after school I found myself in tears I couldn't imagine being separated from parents are being herded like cattle it seemed to me that they were abandoned\nEach day regardless of tears I Would turn to the Christian Science pastor which consists of two books the Bible and science and help with key to the scriptures by Mary Baker eddy I went to these books for ... for\nHow letting go an understanding God as our two parent our father or mother\nThat is guarding guarding and nurturing each one of her little ones and that included both my son and myself\nGod had always been responsible for him and that because your son was the very image of God that he had always felt\nMother and father\nThat that had never been your responsibility that if you let go of that dream everyone with end that dream\nAlso released that just stood out to me to a point where I just spent some time cherishing that idea\nIt woke me up [laughter] I went oh my gosh here I've been holding on to all this stuff\nAnd it was never part of me my son or anyone this is the truth of\nBeing that God is our father or mother has always been our father or mother\nI hadn't seen my son in over Twenty years but that day as I went to my laptop computer\nA message from one of those on line places said tomorrow is my son's birthday well this ingestion tried to sneak in he doesn't care but immediately it was replaced by the angel message but it's an opportunity\nAnd I learned to be obedient to these angel messages so I sent an online birthday card was a sweet message\nThen I received that day an animated card with a country music same because he knew I loved country music and saying mom hope you have a wonderful birthday to our birthdays are about two weeks apart from that\nWe started an online conversation which turned into an opportunity to see him embrace him and have him say to me mom when I was in tears it's all okay it's all done we're together now\nI never thought I'd ever see my son again\nSoon I'd be dancing with him and his wedding than being there to welcome three beautiful grandsons and then as sweet little princess\nThis was proved to me from the Bible that God does return to us all the years\nThe locus of eating and the Bible quote and Michelle eat and plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your God that has dealt wondrous lay with you\nWell words can't even begin to say what this has meant to me\nAnd how learning and leaning on that sustaining and Senate and my father or mother God has continued in so many ways\nTo bring inspiration inhaling I Am so grateful for Christian Science\nFor Mary Baker eddy and for God our father or mother\nWell Kirsten thanks so

earthquake has shaken northwestern Haiti damaging homes that church end at least one hospital there are injuries and damage and local media reporter at least ten people have been killed\nUp we would have wanted it to be higher of course um but when we first were getting the the responses from the online survey we were looking at closer to Fifteen Percent I'm so when we were able to jump to a little over thirty percent we were we were very excited about that\nSo that tells you a little bit about the value of going into the community as opposed to just trying to reach someone remotely so that's that's wonderful that you did that\nYeah yes okay go ahead sorry [laughter]\nSo um what else did you find about this survey that was interesting to\nUm so what we learned again ... our our purpose in doing this survey uh was two fold one to get a better sense of what were the island is already understood a but then also we wanted to use that information to create our next public awareness campaign a strategies and so what we learned there were six wrecking\nPatients that came out of the report are and what we learned was that a first\nWe needed to focus on improving Rhode islanders views on gender equality or so that when we\nLooked at the findings we saw that men with less formal education um had held on to views um that did it promote gender equality and so that was one of the recommendations\nSay something like that like you're going to have a lot of recommendations that you can share with us um if you're joining us right now I'm Deborah Perry I'm sitting in for Deborah zero she'll be back after the November ... election remember devote\nA my guest is Lucy radios are from the Rhode Island coalition against Messick pilots and we're discussing the results of the community attitudes assessment survey\nYes so let me ask you to share so we learned about improving views on ... quality um but we also um learned that um we needed to focus on countering perceptions of what\nThat domestic violence was a serious problem locally so we thought we were surprised that so many ... understood that domestic violence was an issue that they really still doesn't believe that it happened in their own communities\nUm another recommendation was around changing perceptions of what constitutes abuse so people were really clear about sexual violence physical violence but when it came to other forms of violence like control um isolation financially abuse\nAre they still weren't a hundred percent sure and if that was domestic violence or not was that surprising to you\nKnow when you have conversations and the community here um [noise] you know of folks making kind of that that reinforce some of those misperceptions and so it wasn't surprising um but uh it it gave us more information and again more focus as we think about\nUm our ... our campaigns in future years\nSo this is really going to influence your your campaign\nDefinitely the other thing we learned was that um we needed to improve people's knowledge about domestic violence but also support them and increasing their comfort level in intervening when they know that domestic violence is happening so we heard a that\nA fifty percent of the respondents that identified as survivors\nSaid that no one uh supported them no one intervenes 'em and asked them how they could help them and so we know that people know that it's an issue they know that they should do something but they're not really sure exactly what they should be doing so that was another recommendation and then the last one I'm\nIs around focusing I'm helping to improve people's\nUnderstanding of that prevention is that to preventing domestic violence and hope for prevention of domestic violence is possible and says so many people still believe that\nYou know this is just inevitable that we're always going to have this issue and um as a coalition we've been focusing a lot on trying to I'm kinda send the tide and changed attitudes that contribute to the ... problem of violence and really promote the fact that yes prevention is possible it doesn't have to be this way we can create a different world\nAnd um so it keeps you keeps talking about the coalition what is the coalition who are just so I the coalition against domestic violence um has is a leader in our state we have member agencies a five core member agencies that their primary purpose is on preventing and providing services\nFor victims of domestic violence and then we have ... members which the YWCA is one of them are that are helping us expand our reach 'em either by focusing on prevention or providing culturally specific programs\nOr through their organizations and our coalition does not provide direct services so we are out there uh let me looking to do systems changed and so ... social norms change so our areas of work focus on the state of advocacy communications prevention we have a task\nForce of survivor is called sore that help us um and then from all of our work around educating the public of what it means uh what domestic violence is that what it means hand it\nSo it sounds like you have a great

Sochi dirty simply suggesting this is\nPart of your Sunday Morning we are talking renewable energy this morning and specifically solar energy here you've noticed a lot of these sprouting up over the last years these a\nVast solar farms number of them are above the spread around the region as major project is going on in western Princeton right now and the sun behind it as rode on a boost from in the world or a vice president of the firm's joined us to talk a little bit more about it was McGovern is with us used vice president there the southern sky\nRenewable energy from here in Rhode Island when she thank you so much for coming in were pressured thank my pleasure talking about who opportunity talking about solar energy and a ... a lot of these projects we we've seen\nOn on the landfills and things like that you get your big project is taking place right now is this the biggest one yet that southern scars working on in terms of uh especially almost a power plant for a solar energy right I mean it's a good way to describe it\nIn a state around it's the largest under construction right now for a solar farm it's a Twenty one point three\nMegawatts solar project which is fifty four thousand panels plus or minus but it is a very large scale project it in western grandson at a under construction right now will be on line in ... in two thousand Nineteen and the power is going to the city at five in\nThe ... going to the city of Providence we've really seen a lot of these are\nA lot of these so it's really kind of mushroom over the last ... what was that the list maybe ten years or so or is it or is it even less than that I mean all of a sudden you drive around if you drive up on all three Ninety five there and you notice all the ... there's piles up at the state central encourage Israel or at least portion of it or or or or do we still up there any way we seen these projects\nOr are they ... they are springing up absolutely Rhode Island governor Mondo\nHas uh an ambitious goal but that's a thousand megawatt by two thousand two thousand twenty which is a great goal and she's doing a great job between offshore wind in this newly issued R P with national ... megawatts she's she's really trying hard and\nAnd and where and where and when I find her and we're focusing on landfills and brown field you're in the state of Rhode Island we have\nA lymphoma Providence which is two point six megawatts and we have also a landfill in Johnston is just about format lots and then we have a a so if I'm On a brown field by uh the ts green airport in the airport connecting which many if\nYou have probably seen traveling to and from the airport so we're we're really really trying hard to develop and be purpose landfills and brown fields and bring into a better use such as renewable energy\nWell one of the things the the the that we've discussed here since you wrote on them being the smallest state and in your project to project or outside of Rhode Island but in terms of developing the solar fields actual actual amount of land is an issue writes as to where to I mean you need\nA lot of soul to to make this viable right it's not just five or six panels it's if this project in Christmas fifty thousand ...\nLand land that is a big challenge or an island especially pristine land it's so hard to find pristine Landrieu announced a lot of it is already taking and where we have our a\nFast growing economy right now so land in high demand not just for solar but just for commercial use in general so\nThe land that last right now or stuff it it's costly because of the huge demand and secondly it's it's rough terrain for the most part you know there's boulders rocks which which entails eyesight cough so it is a challenge\nRight but we do try to develop on landfills and brown the aisles and fortunately they just aren't enough land for the Robin Wright island to fill the state's energy needs for it\nBut almost seems like it sometimes but nevertheless is it has to do business all work the same way\n... little solar power on your calculator does except on just mega steroids that's pretty much the way with this whole thing works right or you don't have to have breakthroughs been made to help a store this on a cloudy day like for instance we're having a cloudy day right now so how does how does it all work and how old are you able to factor it in with the fact that we have no time\nAnd that we have plenty they sometimes with his New England\nA shame that the anti Bush on cloudy days and the sun does tears through throughout the day in and out in probably get twenty five to ... percent reduction on as opposed to a real sunny day or\nSo there still is production but we take all those weather pattern a into account or I don't put my engineer you say and do this calculation you predict what the production won't be there\nThe year so we we have that calculator and hide a solo work\nSo typically solar panels absorb light they produce electricity that electricity is direct current electricity on and on the the current ... national good only accepts alternate cards without the ambassador from the house side of the electricity from the ... goes into the ... in burger\nTransforms the direct kind of like fifty to alternate current electricity right which is known as a seat that acey electricity flows through a revenue gray meter that revenue re media reports those kill our national grid at the central has all the work\nPretty much the way it's almost like the difference your car battery produced a check and plugging into your wall outlet which you have to be a which is the alternating current there so uh you know these project or most of the power is going to some national grid or does it go in the case to the western ... dedicated to uh to to support\nGreat question though they this type of programs in Rhode Island right now that the governor\nHas supported one is virtual ... metering or or net metering which there are eligible off secret meeting customers deck and parts of the power from us off I'm like you said your Cranston so the ... that that Twenty one leg what project a city of Providence is the off taker for for that power\nNational grid is also a rigorous program where you build this whole system has to be you know five megawatt though last and national grid will purchase power\nOkay so so it can be sold in in both in both directions right and and you do the various with farms if he were solar so reforms they they go different places right to in in terms of putting the power of either to the grid or to a customer\nRight they can be virtually not on the same property as the customers so again another example is I on the airport can after they wrote ... megawatt that is private property not owned by the city of work but the city of work is eligible off taking any receiving that those electricity back is\nIs there a significant cost savings for the municipalities to get the ah get their energy that way obviously it's to change from DC day see that's the cost and obviously for a company there has to be a profit in there but it's a is there substance is their savings through going through sustainable\nThey're absolutely as I can tell you with all the ...\nI mean it's always free ride [laughter] it's up there working and we're not doing anything to write\nA great question absolutely I mean with our project that we have installed it's projected to save our partners of a seven Seventy five million dollars over the course of twenty five thirty years right and it's not just electricity savings also\nIf the town if that's all facilities in that town or city that particular means Pelosi pilot came in as well over the course of twenty five to Thirty years so it's too bad knee streams and then\nA third rising stream which I call a tight enough province has attract after deal really the best to you a city account can have\nThe town owns a landfill receive rent payments of the course of twenty five years they have electricity benefits or the ... pilot payment so for twenty five years they have three streams of revenue\nAnd surprising ... with the best deal roads [laughter] when you're in a great doubt the great job I I guess\nA forgive the lack of a term was solar but the sky's the limit in terms of this again I think the bigger issue was finding a place to put the solar solar panels I'm currently a ... is there any estimate how much do you how much solar is actually adding to the\nOf what the damage that a lot of people say is getting done that's the part you can't calculate and moving holds back from the old had it all in a climate Ross and maybe you could you could speak a little bit to that I mean do you know clearly renewables with the way the future right\nWhen I was definitely the way the future you're spot on and solar development tickle there is a along growing industry and there'll always be demand I Believe for solar power because one it's clean it's effective in a sustainable form of energy\nAnd absolute how how long has your for been around though and and how long have we have some of these projects I mean we're talking about something the less less than two years or so right\nRight we we ... we have projects we started in in two thousand twelve and vote heron island we started in two thousand Fifteen\nTo thousands of shows actually actually\nProgram yeah the program really really opened up into the Fifteen and that's that's when we started our ... open up an office in more ...\nIn terms of ... with the governor put a or a or at least the hope for number ... how important is to have something like that are in what we're in what we're what what what we're doing right now to her for the administration say we want to have this amount of power by this amount of time what what does that mean to somebody to to for like a switch from ...\nIt's very instrumental in ... again she's doing she's doing a great job without having you know her support with the legislation that was passed by the general\nAssembly and solar would not exist in the state and it didn't exist in the state and there wasn't much opportunity until till they pass legislation ... it's been a great opportunity and you know the mentioned they minutes Massachusetts in Massachusetts had a great example for solar across the nation so it's it's been really it's been really great\nYou know probably this is a ... and the bugs that next question in terms of what we're doing in Rhode Island folders ready to what's going on across the rest of the country I mean I Know that we'll get up in Rhode Island or is that we think that we're the beginning of the world for the country out there ... what are what are some of the other parts of the country or they are they dive you know in\nThe same way that we are here in Rhode Island\nYou know some some states don't have I think riling as is really a making a mark for itself and him are noble energy especially even with offshore wind or solar I mean ... again the government's doing a phenomenal job\nAnd if you look at a state like Florida the sunshine state you you don't see any solar and they just don't have the programs in place whereas Rhode Island has a programs in place and you're seeing as you mentioned your driving hunting Ninety five and seeing sold him everywhere and see it because what the government's doing\nOr maybe even swap nicknames that can give them the oceans due to social right so even though it's not too slowly sometimes because he already has quality while we're right quality while we're taking this\nWhere we used to get Mr there were innovations with the industry as well I mean the biggest thing when we were\nKids and I have a few years on you is that the cues to figure out what to do on cloudy days with solar and and and to get the batteries to be better to store power I mean as a renovations coming to to make solar more efficient and and really more more viable or the the fossil fuels\nRight battery storage is coming is not there yet it hasn't matured yet at least in the north East that hasn't but it's definitely it's definitely coming and I expect to see in next year's\nRight and that's that's been a big innovation is I'd absolutely have to address the voters she'll win or things expected to be complete in Christ and so that's going to be young well he won Nineteen to one course again so the early for like one a North Korean so they've got this coming August for a couple of months of good should we look for more for more projects in the future\nWere or really penetrating they're an island market and you know I mentioned quite a few communities that we're doing to the symbol awesome looking at others and you know thanks thanks to the governor and also the office of energy resources just really\nHaving the support behind ... ... ... you know\nI Need to find moral landfills right Marlene ... is funny it seemed like you run into all the time but when you in terms of developing there's not enough it seems they resent my route I'm running into the others the old landfills\nAnd and the other thing I mean we we cannot do it without Randy and support ... ... is an extremely helpful and a quarter of a noble and ya me about the up and went out\nFor help in the agency that it wouldn't be possible so it it's great not only have the government support but I also have drastically\nLet's let's hope that we have a lot a lot more sunny days together absolutely you for coming in as well so they do now see these solar farms popping up all over the place again Lindsey makeup and she's vice president southern sky renewables and as we think it's coming in or in green thank you for\nHelping

all was confirmed by a fifty to forty eight road at least ten people are dead following a magnitude five point nine earthquake that shook northwestern Haiti last night homes churches and at least one hospital have been damaged\nWhat might that impact be on your portfolio\nIf you save two hundred thousand or more for your retirement our number of years for one three three three a thousand easy enough to remember three three three thousand\nYou're not calling a one eight hundred who knows where number you're talking to local people right here in the ... state of Rhode Island\nAnd you are right Jeff talk about an easy number to remember you've had that number a long time now yeah very long time for\nZero one three three three eight thousand and the website if you'd like to learn a bit more about Jack and his team simply go too nasty and money dot com you mentioned you'd help people take a look at their mix in the airport\nLeo in your estimation yet what would an ideal next look like\nWell of course it is subjective to each a client that we're working with because everybody's situation is different\nYou know I Know that might sound cliche to our listeners a little bit but everybody really does have some little thing that is different from other people and so we always make sure that we Taylor what we do specifically so the couple that were working with or individual that we're working with the help them achieve their their financial goals for retirement\nSo that makes it really depends on the overall goal we look at timeline we look at overall makeup of the financial portfolio\nAnd then how comfortable is the person we're working with\nWith risk or you know the more conservative or more aggressive type or we're all day relative to the final workday so to speak with a ... you know go through that door of retirement you know expecting a whole life change there at that point\nSo the closer you get to retirement just in general you ought to become more and more conservative because at that point if you're say within five years of retirement\nAnd that's just a general rule of thumb that I use if you're within five years of retirement you really need to dial down your risk so that you don't give up money either just before retirement or worse right after retirement when you have started to draw from that\nInvestment bucket if you will and because that is the worst thing that could happen we call that the sequence of returns\nI'm simply put if you retire and the market tanks and you're drawing from that investment you're making that value go down even faster and then you have less than that bucket to recover with when the market ultimately comes back in the future\nSo it's so important to circle the wagons around your money as you get closer to retirement to avoid any big drops in the market because that to me is the worst thing that can happen to so there's a lot of different things that goes into building that portfolio what is most important is that\nYou have a manager that's that's actively managing your dollars so recently our team determined that in our portfolios we wanted to reduce our duration an average of maturity that I had discussed a short time ago\nOn most or portfolios are average maturity was running just three to four years so that's a very short window\nWell our team decided they wanted it even shorter so now our average maturity in our bonds and our portfolios is now just one and a quarter years and that drop was was hand but with only thirty basis points of a lower dividend output\nWhich is impressive and that's why working with a a very large money management firms like we do they their institutional money managers\nYou know they manage fifty five billion dollars directly another Thirteen plus billion under advisory which is where our from falls under\nThey have they have a wonderful track record which we can share with you when you come we don't put that out over the air but they do have a very good record working with their management style so we're very excited that we're we're hooked up with that management team\nSo if you have saved two hundred thousand or more for your retirement and you would like to have another professional opinion as to what's going on with your current holdings and what might happen in the future based on either rising interest rates or what if the market were to drop substantially again like it has\nA you know a number of times in the past our number here is for one three three three eight thousand that's a local number because we

protect your retirement savings against those what at that yeah what's the next what if that bring us some concern\nWell that would be what is Social Security benefits get reduced and the future you know that is not a very happy thought for anybody to think about\nWild Social Security's financial outlook\nHas certainly some uncertainty they're currently we can we predict the benefits may be lower than expected\nThe reduction in benefits can be contributing to what's called the worker to beneficiary ratio today which is only about three to one when compared to a ratio about Fifteen or sixteen to one in the early years of the program\nNo it was signed into being in Nineteen thirty five but it really didn't get implemented and started until around Nineteen thirty nine or so\nThe reason why we like to make the most of the benefits even if it turns out to be a little bit lower than expected is because it's guaranteed by the federal government and with that guaranteed income we like it to cover as much of our essential expenses you know those housing food transportation health care\nAs much of that is possible now this helps protect a retirement from a number of risk that we've touched on today\nSo how do we maximize our benefits then\nWell you know many American style retirement at age sixty two because it's the earliest stage they can start collecting Social Security benefit\nHowever this may not be the best course of action for everybody now you might be asking why not I want to enjoy my retirement as soon as possible well first Medicare the health coverage\nDoesn't become available to until your age sixty five now if you're one of the fortunate people that can leave work at sixty two and have your former employer pay that health care expense until sixty five well that's certainly in your favor but\nA lot of folks that don't have any health insurance you know that could cause some eight nine hundred thousand dollars a month for each person until eight sixty five well that's a big drawdown of assets that a lot of people really can't afford to do you know secondly\nYou know how much savings you really have set aside to general expectation is replaced and this is all over the the board here Megan as you know to replace Seventy to Ninety percent of your annual pre retirement income with your own savings into your Social Security benefits\nYou know are you ready to do that for two decades maybe more you know it and those kind of weird measurement upsets his before that you know when I'm preparing to do a seminar I Will look at the obituaries and just count the number of people that are each Ninety or above\nAnd when I did that just recently there were six people that were over the age of Ninety the eldest was Ninety seven so as a society we are absolutely living longer so you don't want to have what we call an ostrich point\nYou know sticking your head in the sand going okay that's not going to happen to me I'll be okay you want to have a well thought out plan so that you can build\nSome income that you can be assured of that will last for the rest of your life and we are able to do that with certain insurance based products\nNow those are assurances in guarantees are always backed up by the claims paying ability of that insurance companies so we always want to work with solid or you know financially solid companies\nSo though many people will take their benefit early most of us should probably consider waiting until your full retirement age which for most was the sixty six if you're born in Nineteen sixty year after its age sixty seven and if that makes sense for you and only the map will tell us that\nPotentially defer taking your benefit until late seventies now that does not work for everybody but it can be useful and helpful for some of the benefit of waiting beyond your full retirement age is that for each year that you defer you receive another eight percent\nSo if you end up if you're a full retirement age of sixty six you can get thirty two percent more money by waiting until late seventies now keep in mind you've left that benefit on the table for four years so you get a higher benefit sunny and Seventy ... there's a payback period for you to\nKind of catch up with the money you left on the table between eight sixty six in Seventy and that's why I say it's all about the math and we have the analysis tools that we do to show people what that might look like well\nNeedless to say trying to determine what I refer to as a sweet spot for you and if you were married for you and your spouse on Social Security is what makes the most sense for you are a number of years for one three three three eight thousand if you have questions about upcoming decisions on Social Security\nAnd because in if you haven't started your benefits yet that's the best time to do it you can undo your benefit if you haven't received twelve checks so maybe it's worth it even if you've been on it for just a short time\nTo see if maybe there was a better way of strategizing to ultimately put more money in your pocket between you and your spouse potential in our number here again is for one three three three eight thousand if you have questions about Social Security police costs will have one of our advisors chat with you to see if we might be able to help you\nGet the website if
