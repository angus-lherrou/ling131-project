I mean when the United states was founded on the fact of\nWhat as they say pilgrims\nLanded on playing rock but the Native Americans were already here so that land was taken from them from the beginning second about\nWashington gap once they took over the land and you decided to get in shields and go back overseas and get African American leader who will then everything else and bring them back over there to pick your cat okay then once you did that that\nI don't even agree with the fact that in turn down Confederate flag me pulling down Confederate flag or statues because like I have my children\nIs real good to have them up because any of us know that the north won the south laws\nAnd then Texas\nSouthern states didn't even want to let that blacks free\nLike it was all it said the some of the beginning we didn't find out until I Would\nNot generally pain but yet the gym in June of ...\nSorry the tone for June Eighteenth sixty five so my point being is this your dad wannabe Ali's walls you I Want to have yeah I Want to complain about the sanctuary city my whole question is um\nWhy come\nThe white man is not being in jail for a for\n... for Neil Young with these girls you know you've got all these men this for one and most of them are out in the joy them away but they're not being locked up for a certain crime and they feel like that's real nice for them to be able to do those things you have comments\nYour last you know ... and I'm like wow you about I'm\nGiven um well I appreciate you letting me finish on on the show even I'm doing but okay go ahead I'll let you finish but you may argues around the time being and\nOkay I mean I'm a I'm a cut it out and then you know a lot of times when I look at the the some of the incidents where people have been shot was not people\nI I Do kind of agree with the police I don't blame them because you should uh you know say you should have just you know adhered to what they were saying instead of you to do but still I mean I don't see no matter how you look at it no matter how you put it\nOut immigrants to a land that was never our than the first place\nNear around in the first like no no no good reason why they had no say I don't care to document the history wants to do with them around\nAnd respond okay I'm going to try to respond to you okay so I gave it a lot of time\nIf there was no you wouldn't\nKnow how to respond okay I'm going to try to respond to okay so I gave it a lot of time\nSo first of all you said something about the land was taken from the Indians that they were here first the only problem with that is there were Indians before those Indians and their Indians before those Indians and there's nobody living anywhere on planet earth today that didn't take it from someone else that someone was there originally\nThat's just what happens in life it's it's you can tell you it's unfortunate and shouldn't be that way but you need to know your history so even Indians took it from other Indians and in terms of the slave trade you also probably know this may be don't\nMany of the people who are involved in the slave trade were blacks were brought blacks over here I'm not saying was good it was obviously terrible to bring people here against their will but you do you have to put this in perspective\nThe time it was if slavery was absolutely awful and horrible but if it's one country that's trying to atone for that more maybe more than any other country in the world it's the United states of America we understood that that they can no ... no no no it's my turn now it's my turn\nAnd we understood I just had a black person that they are I mean the the overwhelming majority of Americans want the best for all their citizens they don't care about race in color and so on and the uh I don't I wasn't sure your last point I wanted to respond to it\nAh but then you say that the police when they do do some shooting I couldn't tell if you were trying to say that they ah they were not being responsible in some cases some times that does happen someone get shot never should have been shot and they they're they're good and bad policemen they're good and bad talk show host\nBut in general it you probably know the two most blacks are ah murders by blacks or by uh from other blacks and in the in many inner cities they want more police not fewer because they want to be protected I actually I'm going to keep going on so go ahead now you respond\nOkay and like I said no matter how you look at it the one thing I can say if I Can't say anything about\nSo called president I appreciate everything he's done because the out he had done what Air America dirty laundry is that everybody fleet their rights under the under the ... like if dart now that it out and being forecast that\nWould everybody would you got new that Republicans said forget this made\nBecause how he how and how he acts that whatever the case may be\nSnow cater to go the way it goes a long way\nBut I think a lot of ...\nLike a lot of my people y'all can get mad at this man I Want to let the one good thing that he did bring about in this country was air the fact that the racism and hatred in America alone it's horrible it's horrible\nWay way way way where so where ... where the race will see me with the lowest black unemployment rate maybe ever but we were exactly see racist I didn't I didn't catch that\nI'm not saying it like I said he aired the dirty laundry this country has been raised this for many many years but\nEverybody wants to ... I didn't know that now I may I have no not easy because I Know I didn't what\nRadio station ... because yeah very therapeutic expect blacks to beat to respond on here\nOne would expect anybody responded by the way I'm by the way you kept saying my people I saw him we're all Americans that we all live in you know read the same areas John Kennedy said we're all in\nFunded by the way I'm by the way you kept saying my people I thought we're all Americans that we all live in you know breed the same air is John Kennedy said we're all in this together ... ... people on your side and by your side I don't mean color I mean values in politics people on your side to have a group mentality I\nDon't see people that way I see people as individuals\nAnd I want you know I like people to share my value to wait wait wait wait wait no it's not your turn now I'm finishing so let's not talk over each other\nI Would be happy you may have heard me say this this week I'd be happy with nine a black women Supreme Court justices if they shared my point of view because I don't care about color and it looks like you do\nYou still there\nOh I think she hung up and if you didn't make me I certainly didn't I just wanted to know that maybe something happen here we dropped her but uh\nYou know it's just it's it's sad because the old you are there some reasons here yeah there are some people that still think Elvis Presley is alive so you can't account for that\nYou know there there there's always going to be knuckleheads out there but the overwhelming majority of Americans want what's best for everybody they live their lives they don't care about color did we make a mistake\nA long time ago we did we paid for that and try to make a difference in the ... and she's at our President Trump at least the showing how bad things are no I think the country's doing fantastically that's what we did last night\nOh how great the country is under President Trump's years there's some things he shouldn't say but you notice they'll charge him with stuff like he's a racist but then they can't name anything to prove these races right\nUm [noise] if it's very discouraging when you get calls like that might people I Love that phrase my people what do you mean then on your people you're the one that's caring about color I I don't care what color it will make knowledge something I noticed someone's black that lasts for about a I don't know attempt to the second and then I get to know them who they are\nBecause color tells you absolutely nothing about someone it tells you nothing\nI

mark\nYes Hi Mark I'm [noise]\nFlorida and Texas those two states or be to do all that the Democrats would really like to add to their progressive crown and I have to say\nThat I Am very concerned about the race on governor and senator and Florida and the rates the senator in Texas and I really haven't heard very much about it but um I get the feeling that it's not going to well in Florida I don't know about Texas but\nI don't know if you have any insight to what's going on there I Know that I'm\nA several hundred thousand people have migrated from Puerto Rico to Florida\nAfter that terrible hurricane last year and a the Democrats were in a very big hurry to get them registered to vote because they can vote or a ... in Florida I don't know what insight you have a what you heard about those two states and I had little to\nLive in Florida and I really can't have with them because they're they just do not want to talk about politics\nYeah and that's another topic I have down for ... you know if we'll get to it about what your relatives and friends think of you if you're on the conservative side of you still get to keep them\nBut I Do have inside in Texas I I think Cruz is going to win and I don't think there's any doubt about that the numbers seem to be showing that he's pulling away I think that's their fool's gold like he was for Republicans in Pennsylvania for the longest time although we finally won at\nFlorida as more problematic you're correct my and the numbers the numbers I saw a little while ago showed that\nUh we could be were behind in the governor's race the senatorial races is also if he so that'll depending on who turns out you're absolutely right and how many are illegal votes they can get from people outside of the country on the Democratic side\nBut you know I think we're starting to come back to the Senate I'm more worried about the house than I Am about the Senate\nI think we're going to offer as individual yeah go ahead\nNo I was going to say I'm concerned about that have to I don't know what the ... congressional\nUm situation is and I'm In you know in Florida or Texas but um I don't understand you know I also don't understand why the money when you look at the politicians\nIt's an tax if the governor's race won by the Democrats in Florida and he wants to do a lot of radical things and die as that gentleman a couple of callers ago said you know the states are they can do a lot of things they can do I'm a single payer\nHealth care and they can do a lot of things on their own um as an individual state and I don't understand why Democrats don't\nYou don't understand their for their own their own them being down there I just don't understand it and why are not the politicians including Democrats in that and and you know be trying to appeal to them\nYou mean Republicans well the answer is people just don't follow it that much and they don't understand it as I've been saying tonight it's very hard to explain to conservative and Republican position especially when the Democrats is much more emotional you know hope and change\n'em a woman's right to choose whatever phrase they use live livable wage these things are ... are on the surface if you don't explored they oh that sounds like a pretty good idea yeah or or equal pay for women have they have no idea the background that they're talking about not talking about the same job necessarily\nA and that would make sense for business too if they could get paying women less why they wouldn't have all women so a lot of leftist than liberal positions are defeated will but it takes a while to explain and you have to understand more so the answer your question is\nWhy do people vote to pay more taxes themselves many times they don't understand and the Democrats love hiding that anyway\nJust like now they they don't want to talk about that they really want to impeach the president Nancy Pelosi even said oh we're not going to talk about that now because they know\nThat I think the overwhelming majority of American people do not want to go through impeachment again I was wrong I was born with Bill Clinton and what happened you won reelection\nUm people there and people basically don't want to go through that and that's where the Democrats by the way overplay their hand with Kevin Oh I think even people who are not conservatives looked at that hearing saying wait a second that was really ugly that was really unfortunate what they did the gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes leads leaving that aside\nThey treated us some badly the American people tend to be very fair and and\nSo they are the Democrats have to hide that they want to raise taxes went to Congress by the way of announcing that he didn't want to raise taxes the last big time\nSo let me know what you think at uh eight six six Ninety red eye and we'll take your calls on legal immigration or anything else that you want to talk about but right now is your national forecast or video road lock\nEffect snow off Lake Ontario on portions of I Ninety will leave a light dusting of snow near Syracuse Rochester buffalo slick roads not expecting a lot of\nThey're actually in the ... yeah glad\nThe actual do Sylvia there was a reason for it which is a ... ah with with the slavery issue we want to make sure that they weren't taking advantage of in any way but of course if you pass\nA law ever every law by the way it is a phrase I've heard was a one term solution every problem was the one time a solution to something else\nSo you you mean well and you pass something and then people figure out how to take advantage oh I Would do the same thing by lived a say in Asia and the thing I could get my kids have American citizenship if they're just born here well I'm going to time my trip so that I have the baby now of course they could go wrong if the baby's late I guess very late\nWhat did they figure out how to take advantage of you are dumb laws\nThat that happens a lot let's go to a\nJeremiah speaking of fraud Jeremiah in Nashville or Jeremiah\nGetting runners mark Yes sir hey I'm your on your mark how're you doing well great\nI'm well I'm a recently had a\nHad a relationship um she got pregnant three weeks into the marriage um she's an illegal immigrant um she got pregnant um well I wanted to make sure that everything was okay we got married uh got married and then\nShe ... she left she's gone and it's the fast track\nGreen card now the way they have you ever heard of the way the act and I'm just not touching up from ...\nAnd it's the fast track to a green card now the way they have you ever heard of the way the act and I'm just not just touching up from what the previous a\nPrevious speaker was talking about um you know people don't know about this a whole lot um they don't know about the fact that you can come here\nIllegally have a have a you know get pregnant\nAnd then just totally disregard\nEverything and then live off the government um you can't get deported\nYou can't um you know all that I don't know if you've ever ... I I don't know if you've ever heard about anything like that but I just wanted to I wanted to share with the people 'cause man this is this is an issue I mean people come here all the time they they want to get married they want to get pregnant and then they want to\nJust stay here and and uh\nIt it's an amazing thing I'll I'll go on my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience I'm I'm having to live with it you know with a lawyer\n... everything I guess you don't ... you don't see her child then\nNo no um they do restraining orders\nI'm under the way they act as the women against violence um act um so if you come here and you charge somebody with with anything um you are here it's the fast track to a green card and\n... and you know um I Would probably I'll run out of time this week but I was going to have someone on talking about father's rights and what happens is the court system in in the family court so that just a total disaster let's go to a\nGeorge in Huntsville, Alabama Georgia Iran with mark\nMartin in March I keep hearing these wonderful term thrown around that I think our mainstream media has created and every once in a latch don't soup\nBut I think it's also a misnomer we do not have illegal immigration we haven't in Beijing going on these are not undocumented immigrants they're invaders from foreign countries and we're being invaded by the failures of the other catch\nNo you're right no argument there yeah\nIf there was any if it was their military doing it we would be returning fire why are we sitting here so complacent lay allowing this to happen this is absurd\nIt is absurd and that happens because there are people on the other side of having agenda they don't believe in borders they don't believe there's anything special about the United states of America yes in the United states they just see it differently than we do and they they want to fulfill their agenda that's what you're up against them\nPresident Trump was smart enough to make that his top issues not at least one of his top issues and the American people responded and I think they did it correctly let's go to a ... there's so many good calls here and let's go to Stan in while loosing Pennsylvania I'd probably miss that ups than Iran with mark\n[laughter] Oh thank you mark a great call you know you're got a great program there I really appreciate it I'm actually a Jersey in who's visiting here and so I'm a escaped your enemy territory for a while\nHopefully we can get ...\nOf their of God but um I was calling basically\nHope we can get ...\nOut of their uh God but um I was calling basically uh uh I guess illegal voting I Know where he heard something on the on the radio a while back about Clinton and the DNC and how they were taking busloads of people\nIllegals not only voting but bringing them into other states to vote in other states\nAnd it was like really absurd and are sick and um you know how to stop that [noise] and if you remember like during the uh what we were setting up governments here in Afghanistan or Iraq after the war is [noise] they were taking a people who are voting\nAnd dying their ... you know there are some purple you know you couldn't vote more than once\nAnd they're saying like if we could do that overseas why couldn't we do that here so we wouldn't have known not only illegals but people voting more than once and and uh you know disenfranchising other people's vote and uh\nBut you you you know the whole controversy over for a voter id at the other side had money doesn't want any part of voter id like that's the big crime to ask someone to yeah you are and let me see if you are who you say you are\nSo you're not committing voter fraud or voting illegal you know or being racist remain this you know how could you do that yet I by the way my position is different than most people I don't want people to vote unless they care enough to put some for some effort I'm worried about the people who voted don't know that much here where we get to vote on the same day voting right and all that kind of stuff\nThat that was the other thing I think it's also a about a like you said the voter id they make such a big gripe about how difficult it is and I'm saying you know well how about on election day when somebody goes into vote\nAnd you know you have to sign if you voted before you know they compare your signature and everything like that and while you're there voting wherever they just take your picture\nAnd start the process of creating a voter id then you're already there\nIt's not like you had to go someplace to you know to get a voter id you're already there so they take a picture of a person and\nSay you a digital camera you feed it into facial recognition say in a in a tri-state area\nAnd see if that per person pops up in another ward or district or state on the same day and you know like you said a digital camera you could chicken chicken see if they voted\nPreviously on that day and age but at the same time you could be starting a voter id form you know the ... you got the picture you do that you have their address\nAnd you know we have to fill out the card in a week or so you know or you go back and you bring to the id to them mail it to them\nAnd uh but at least should be able to compare because you have a photo of him\nTo see if they're voting in more than one place if they're registered more than one place\nWell there are two problems okay first the other side does it they want voted for ... thank you so often Emily I Know that do but there's another point that you didn't think of\nI don't know how your state but in California have you ever seen the people who work the polls I don't think they can handle something as complicated as taking pictures or they can't even find my name is the Pennsylvania yes or no no I'm originally you know I'm right right so you go in the ... who are you\nPictures or they can't even find my name is the topic of Pennsylvania or no no I'm originally you know I'm right right so you go in the ... who are you oh Martha that you go over to that table you're in the wrong place if they can't even figure it out\nAnd if I ever won in ... vision provisional ballot yeah it is scary so if you had it also gives them cameras to take the picture I don't think so but you have to stand\nYou ever selected ideas have put in that kind of work have a great evening\nI I I tell you one one thing I did have that went into vote one time it was a primary and uh they had a I asked him if I can have a right in ballot\nAlright\nAnd uh and he said oh yeah yeah you you can never write invalid I walked in there and it wouldn't take it\nAnd it was like I'm\nTotally amazed they say well you know what's going on and he said well [noise] oh oh you know you're a you're wanted vote Republican he goes uh or or Democrat\nI couldn't vote or they wouldn't let me do or writing ballot and I says well you said I could they says oh no you have to tell us before you go into the booth whether you want to write in ballots are not\nHis letter and you're happy a fleet owner in print\nDid you know that
