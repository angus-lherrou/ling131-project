Fifteen on the market then what happens then there's pushback from the retail is that's why the retailers don't want her to have the time this is why it is destined to fail\nYou're handing you believe you're handing something to the farmers and the corn states but it really doesn't fly without the mandate and he knows politically outside of Iowa you can't get any Fifteen mandate done right now\nYou can't\nI mean you might get Chuck Grassley on board [laughter] to help you vote for him [laughter] and he's a farmer himself so he [laughter] wait a minute\nHe's only trying to scratch grass leaves and back [laughter] [laughter] that's right you don't even I value saying Oh thank you know I met you I didn't even think about at MSNBC leaders are already tomorrow yeah is he dropped out trying round and round [laughter]\nSorry Mr Trump pointed in Maine do start that story for you but ah I just I mean I when I read it I'm thinking well this doesn't do anything in your yeah just the it's the ... Fifteen that has banned in the summer months um they do have the eight Fifteen out there there is some out there but as it is not\nIs not mandated well the the question is is that if the city's believe like Los Angeles or states like California who through the California air resources board\nI could see them coming in because you know a Houston and in Los Angeles compete\nOr for the number one ah a spot in terms of the smoggy as city or they don't want the eight Fifteen on the market they're not going to want to be Fifteen on the market which is an interesting position to be [laughter] they can blame Al Gore by the way for this this whole thing\nUm but the [laughter] in part\nBut the the problem is ultimately they won't want more smog they don't they\nOh do they don't they will try and I'm or could try and move way ahead of it even if they don't believe it's going to fly they would probably want to get ahead of it legally by going after the EPA or if the rule or\nExemption is but here's your here's a difference ... is president gonna come out tomorrow and say I'm doing this\nBecause of global warming why I don't know why you know you know you're at a level I Would do it as a rice helping the farmers right we're we're ... we're helping helping Chuck Grassley\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nBut they're not mandating that you buy Fifteen Percent while making it available where you could do it year round well there even though I don't I I I don't expect anyone to sell something when it's going to be promoted instantaneously\nIf it comes to fruition after tomorrow and you're going to see a bombarded all over the Internet all the newspapers\nIt ever was mandated number one that would be fury right or as especially from members of of of Congress but he's not doing it because of global warming he's doing it because he's he's doing it because of a\nWishing to to help the farmer right right which we said to begin with that's not how you run industry you know about Herman ... ten percent mandates to begin with because the president's made it clear ... you know he I think he would do a mandate mhm and have taxpayer subsidized had more just to help the

twelve years aren't we yeah yeah you never was or what this twelve years they made it\nAnd so so how do we solve it ... well the United nations special climate reports suggest a tax\nOn carbon dioxide admissions would be need to be as high as twenty seven thousand dollars per ton at the\nEnd of the century to effectively limit global warming ... that means you would have to have a two hundred and forty dollar per gallon tax\nOn gasoline in that year huh now should such a recommendation be adopted yeah in twenty thirty of the report says a carbon tax would need to be as high as\nFifty five hundred dollars that's the equivalent of forty nine dollars per gallon gas tax by twenty thirty well then\nThe experts we'll be right cars won't be on the Republican Party third day won't be anywhere

was called MTV leveled tribunal ethylene\nAn anti ... anti knocking right turns out it\nYeah it turns out it was a car Senate generally and put out into the air so they started replacing out with at all alcohol\nYou can't have two hundred prove alcohol it ... it absorbs moisture from the air soloist you're going to get is like maybe one Ninety five Ninety something like that so it's great for the farmers to increase the percentage of alcohol and the fuel bland however alcohol doesn't hold the same amount of energy\nRight for him as gasoline does your do your mileage fuel mileage so it's screwing the consumers ... doing\nYeah well look we we had no problem with the we we had no problem when we talked about this report with up and all four of the anti knocking capabilities that's not what a temper sent exists\nNo their temper said mandate existed initially for global warming right yeah we're number look we've not our problem is the fact that yeah it's great for the farmers will anything would be great if the government mandates that you must make something and the consumer must buy it it's always great for that industry to that kind of monopoly a great government dictates\nAll right you need to do this for the what's the reason well for global warming well what's the reason now to make sure you have a job mhm for video robot here's your forecast\nBecause he said and we were and and what a couple of stories said it was Great Britain because of Christopher steals involvement in it but some of our allies did not want us to\nRelease sitting there were a couple of other things that needed to go over so he was going to give it to the inspector general for further review now we were initially for the first day little dumbfounded go we couldn't understand why it was going to him\nAnd on the air this is going back ten or eleven days as you and I were discussing why were to go to the inspector general an off the subject was Doug that's the role of the inspector general is to do what is to investigate corruption there it's the you don't give it to the inspector general to say review this\nAnd tell me what I can release\nAnd what I can uh you know what I can ...\nYou you that for that you use\nYour a director of national intelligence your CIA director uh your your uh a secretary of state it was a former CIA director those are the people you would go to for the for for that maybe your national security director now but you know the secretary of defense\nThose are the people you would go to ... to ... to decide at least in my opinion whether you should declassify it or not and I say you're a secretary of state former CIA director because they claim that some allies\nOr didn't want some things to be released and our initial thing was wait a minute what are their allies no they don't know what's in their right how how do they know that the\nAnd we were initially puzzled when he said he was going to give it to ah the inspector General Michael Horowitz until we realized\nThey were they ... that it went whoa\nLook at this but yeah the conclusion we came to was that if you are looking if you're looking to get this to the inspector general the apartment of justice\nThen you're basically asking him to do an investigation and to issue a report they said that acts but they asked for an expedited process here from Mr Horwitz\nAnd the only reason you do that is because of the role of Michael Horowitz the inspector general's office in in the overall is to do what to look at possible fraud or misdeeds done within the ... of justice fraud ah around during your option and all of that\nWould be and if you think about it because I I'm thinking of a a a ... and in the room with the president and also or his chief of staff or Kelly as well looking at that and saying if you come out and make a conclusion or draw conclusion from this\nInformation by de classifying it and we see the on redacted information here\nIf we jumped to the conclusion well first of all\nThe executive branch is not really that there is no prosecutorial power there you would have to go through a the the department of justice itself but where would you start at the department of justice if you believe that people that are either they're in place or were there before\nCommitted a you know a crime possibly or there was fraud or corruption or any of those items that would be on a plate of the inspector general's office you would start with Michael Horowitz that's the only way because beyond that you're looking at just a political move that's all the way it would be played\nIt would be well the president saying this and that's not what we think if you take that off the out of the political arena and that's exactly what you do hear think about the fact that you're not sending it to the attorney general even that could be seen as a political move because he's an appointee\nBy the president right while our layers supposed to be a ton of us\nAnd you know ... or which\nIs someone that's been in place since\nBefore he was appointed by Obama he was appointed by Obama but more importantly ... that's that's a key to opening the door and ending the discussion about whether it's politically motivated more importantly\nOn top of that you add the fact of what the inspector general was designed to do in the ... report you might see\nFrom the inspector general's office when we went through the inspector general's report\nAh on the FBI there were a number of things in the uh the Hillary email investigation a number of things there that we found now\nIt you're taking this I guess otherwise mundane report and you're trying to basically build the narrative as to what was going on in this case\nOf the other report of at the FBI under the direction of a then director James Comey\nAnd what was going on and and how the Hillary email investigation or was handled into and then part late into the Russian investigation and all of that now when you have here by the way I think that's part of it to\nYou already have an existing report that covers part of the timeline in fact uh the most important part of the timeline that would be outlined in potentially in this classified are now de classified information\nSo now ... having already done the investigation on the FBI and how they handled the Hillary\nAnd all the ... the Hillary email investigation and then the Russia investigation now has all of that work done the legwork done there to possibly lend support to this new investigation um and it's I think interesting and I think very key\nThat the president turned it over to Horwitz and basically washed his hands up and for now\nAnd I think it's important to remember Giuliani has been saying that he believes the perjury happen that right you had somebody in the FBI verify because that's his charge okay and and again we're this is going on speculation by what\nPeople who claim they're familiar with the matter a believer in and he is a former prosecutor what he believes his that\nHe believes there is possible perjury in the fact that ah the Pfizer warrant and they're supporting documents with the Pfizer warned that they swore were intelligence when they were opposition research and when the when everything was a redacted excuse me on redacted\nWhen everything was opened up and declassified so everybody can see it\nBoth how they got the Pfizer warrant application the surrounding documents the three oh twos\nAnd the communications between the higher ups of the FBI that somebody in the administration said don't release this Mr President because if you release this it'll be viewed as political you solve with Adam Schiff said Adam Schiff said well he's only partially released in what they want to really solve it\nNope if you believe that you see the corruption and that's what we believed they believed 'cause you only give it to or which because you believe possible crimes have been committed ... either some being extremely wrong or crimes\nHad been committed and you give it to the inspector general because at that point he can come out with a complete report and not just use you know the the unwritten pact that evidence that you have but he can go look for anything he wants in the department of justice\nAnd get it to help build his case\nHe has access to the documents that the that the ... the oversight committee could not get from the FBI there is no process that stopped horror with from walking in and obtaining those documents that the the those oversight committees have been trying to get for a long time\nHe has direct access to all of that information\nI Want to read a parts of this from John Solomon that adds to all of this he goes the department of justice and the FBI have tried to thwart President Trump on releasing evidence suggesting that will harm national security make allies less willing to cooperate or even leave them vulnerable to accusations\nThat he's trying to obstruct the end of the Russia probe before you judge the arguments from the department of justice and the FBI which are similar to those offered\nTo stop the release of information another major episodes in American history from the bay of pigs to nine eleven consider or any does the the chapter on the house intelligence committee's report earlier this year on Russian interference\nIn the twenties sixteen presidential election until this past week the footnotes really had garnered no public intrigue in part because the U.S intelligence community blacked out the vast majority of its verbiage in the name of national security before the report could be made public\nFrom the heavy redacted arguments all one could tell us at the FBI general counsel\nJames Baker met with an unnamed person who provided some information in September of twenty sixteen about Russia email hacking and possible linked to the Trump campaign\nNot a reporter or policymaker would've bad at an eyelash over such a revelation than last Wednesday I broke this story John Solomon the Baker admitted to Congress in a non classified setting repeat in an unclassified setting\nUnclassified setting that he had met with the top lawyer at the firm representing the DNC and received allegations from the lawyer about Russia Trump and possible hacking\nIt was the same DNC along with the Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign that funded the unverified salacious dossier by the British intel operative Christopher Steele that became a central piece of evidence\nUsed to justify the FBI surveillance of the Trump campaign and the final days of the election he's been following this but what are you saying\nHere's another example again to the FBI and the department of justice these these things aren't top secret about national defense you know it's about ... their posture barriers otherwise Baker wouldn't have been saying it in a non classified

and I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety\nOr read I one of the things I've heard over the last couple of days especially from the left the legitimacy of the Supreme Court is now gone ... of course that's ... right\nAh it it it isn't I mean that's the ... when when you're laws for anything else to say that's that's what you say\nThe only other thing as I've said I let it was yesterday showing and I and I do believe this is something the Republicans need to work on and I said maybe I was nitpicking after Republicans were celebrating their victory but uh when I heard a Mitch McConnell afterwards being asked a question about conservative justices she even use the term conservative justice\nAnd I said look we need to as conservatives we need to take that out of it it's not conservative versus political on the Supreme Court it's originalist versus liberal that's what it is if you want to be accurate as to what is actually going on it's\nLiberals who wish to put on judges who passed legislation versus not conservatives who wish to pass conservative legislation\nIts original ... construction is also been they've been called but originally we want to stick to the original text of the constitution and say it's not our job to legislate now that may be a conservative idea\nBut saying liberal versus conservative justices gives you the indication but it's all political and it's not\nFrom the point of view of a conservative the kind of judge we want is one who will protect the constitution not change it changing the constitution is up to a or changing the law or the constitution is up to the legislature or\nAnd and even just just before we got to the cabinet nomination it was still the mall or investigation Trump illusion you and I I I can remember ah\nThe ah the was it the the the Thursday or the ... the Thursday or the friday when when Chuck Todd said you better not miss work tomorrow that had to be like what was\nThat ... right around Labor Day yeah it was the friday heading into Labor Day weekend and and that was because you know Mueller's going to let the investigation nobody's even talking about Russian collusion no it's not on anybody's radar it seems like that was\nTen years ago and that's how fast the the cycle has has moved you know what is on people's minds and so when I woke up yesterday I started thinking what are Democrats thinking the issue is what's the issue that they can go after Trump out what's the issue that will even grab Democrats right now to say oh\nYeah okay that's the issue you and I talked about the fact that the un coming out and saying OK it's time for our annual we're doomed to update because of global warming and we're thinking of the Democrat's gonna jump on that they've been jumping on that\nAnd that they've been jumping on that since the beginning of the Obama administration that and raised on a consistent basis\nAnd so I was looking at you earlier and saying I'm waiting for the race baiting to start some time by the end of the week because it's been their old standbys is what they've always use now even though at the same time the American people have said they don't care yeah we don't believe those are the top issues we don't believe race relations\nOr the top issue we believe we get along with each other really well are you folks in Washington may not and you people that belong to certain groups\nOr or you know or or may not but for the most part we get along and global warming well you haven't made your case to the vast majority of America let me go get a burger or it's I mean seriously that's words that but you know and we ... we actually stay to during the Obama\nAdministration I'll never forget it where we said are they doing this on purpose\nDo they actually think that if we don't talk about the issues of the day if we don't talk about the economy 'cause remember\nThe economy and never had three percent growth the entire time of the Obama administration and you and I would talk about this all the time saying there seems to be no interest in talking about making the economy better no it wasn't even in just a story that was being discussed\nAnd and they just went back to global warming and and race\nSo I really find it interesting as to as we are now just a little under a month from uh from election time that you know what's what's the Democrats issue what do they actually going to use besides impeachment if they think that's going to work which brings me to this article Wall Street journal\nBobby Jindal former a former governor of of ah Louisiana two thousand two thousand sixty\nTry some self restraint now I I like Bobby Jindal but this may be a little bit delusional [laughter] it was a straight [laughter] F\nA it's not certain the Democrats I'm just wondering parts of it because I actually started laughing during it or it's not certain but that's okay he's trying to be an optimist mhm uh I'm being a complete and total sitting here at this moment but I think justifiable\nI can justify it it's not certain the Democrats will retake the house but if they do they will likely ignore\nTheir leaders preferences and pushed to impeach President Trump or perhaps justice cabinet\nAnd the swap with Clinton their opposition's Democrats now lecture the nation that unseemly personal behavior makes the president unfit for office while Republicans and says his private morality has no impact on those whose public duties\nThis is more a than a interesting irony impeachment would undoubtedly energize Mr Trump's base\nAnd make these voters even more loyal to him as it did with Bill Clinton\nDemocrats have an alternative they can set aside the president of the Obama years when the party sought to enact the most extreme agenda it could pass and instead search for common ground with marginal Trump supporters\nDemocrats won't win over this most ardent Tea Party members they won't win over ... Christians or other committed supporters but a humble are more open approach could attract some of his peripheral supporters and weaken the resolve of his base\nDemocrats can support gay marriage without forcing small business owners to violate their words his religious beliefs and participate in the wedding ceremonies\nDefend abortion without opposing the sorts of restrictions common in Europe including waiting periods and bans on mid term abortions fight global warming without making obsolete many Americans livelihoods and lifestyles\nExpand access to health care without eliminating private insurance protect minority rights without condemning law enforcement promote the immigration while protecting the borders value multiculturalism without removing all mention of God or the tradition of from the public square and an act modest gun control measures without stopping Americans\nFrom hunting and defending themselves\nHave you lost me now it would be lost in me already on the ... yeah okay\n[noise] and that's not going to happen\nYeah I lost you when a while\nRight after we started laughing [laughter] ... [laughter] with all due respect to the governor no um you know a number one it's not going to happen no it isn't a [laughter] and not going to have a number two is also not going to happen and then it will never happen [laughter]\nUm no I'm\nWell it it can happen ... look we as we said this after twenty sixteen we said this one Democrat\nBecause I find this fascinating I I find the ... collection that the Democrats go through ... you know of and they've gone through it and if you were election cycles where they say\nOkay we we've we've got to reevaluate we we have to get outside of Washington and here are ... we we need to we need to go into the heartland and see how people are really thinking and they really said that's twenty sixteen we have to seriously reevaluated when they went in the complete opposite direction\nLead opposite yeah they'd gone more in saying now they've gone more authoritarian\nThey've gone more a dare I say using the F. word\nOr with the fascists mindset out there while claiming\nThat they are the anti fascists yeah that's the most interesting point though\nYeah um and and it's that's not going that's not going to change a where it was a couple of weeks ago when we basically kind of mind it out what would drive the ... the Democrats I'm Sorry the the far left liberals those that are really I mean then they're leading the party now\nI mean I think after the uh Kavanaugh's confirmation process we can we can say without a doubt that as part of the mainstream process now\nUm but nonetheless what would bring them back\nWhat would bring them back and bring them too because you know the ... which is by the way the most insane part of um I mean we can\nWe can giggle at at a governor ... you know a appeal if you will in the same way that we can discount Robert Redford\nA script and his message because I Would ask both of them\nBefore we talk about the same behavior of the left tell me what would drive them to come back from\nAs especially when they are they stuck and they can't get out of it it it just it's a never ending loop there into creating more victims because which was just not the cause\nOf it like this is this is what that's a great while yet read for once you leave the Trump is the cause of it from stop the cause of it he's the effect of it and and so tell me if you think that would change just to save for the sake of the argument know that Trump decided tomorrow to resign effective immediately\nAnd Mike Pence became president\nWould have a beautiful whom by our world that's where I'd everywhere would go back where being normal we couldn't invite Michael Moore onto the show when we would have a love fest right [noise]\nThat's right um well case yes right right he's sitting in your lap not mine [laughter] um\n[laughter] and\nSo we were going to be better chair I Want to make sure what are the only full but God was being there was Michael Moore phobic\nGo ahead yeah I don't know I'm saying is we're going to need better chairs so and you can take that how you want I really don't care how you take it so here's the here's the [laughter] adult I really really do\nWell our church well enough that simply said they don't have they they can't handle the stress okay you're not enjoying that\nThose which bed go without yeah oh yeah that's actually one of them is actually true it was an engineering so [laughter] that's that's what it was so here's the question if chase it\nBecame president in tomorrow do you think it would change no it would not\nIf John McCain were still alive and ran for president and one would have changed you know what they called John McCain would change yes he'd go back to being Hitler yes eight six six Ninety read I\nWould you prefer to read wrote king on your
