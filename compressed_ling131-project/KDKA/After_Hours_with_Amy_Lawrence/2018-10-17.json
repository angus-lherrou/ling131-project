during the night\nOf the people who announced could you pick one of them to sit down and have a cup of coffee with\nUh [noise] yeah I loved him a ... who Bernie Sanders\nI think it would be a great how would enjoy that I didn't do anything you would if he would let me call and if he was listening in\nAnd not you know not just a demagogue everything out I I like him his personality I don't want you to the leaves them but the\nIt would be a ... call do you\nKnow what Lindsey Graham said about you know what Lindsey Graham said about Bernie Sanders a little I always having storms I'm Bernie Sanders got married in a Soviet Union and some people think he never came back\n[laughter] as soon as\nI thought you know I was like dang Philip thanks for your call appreciate it\nOn your mark new program\nThank you so much I buy oh and here's someone's gonna and I think is going to ask me right away in Las Vegas you're on with mark\n... yeah I think that one I Would want to have coffee with is a Dena Titus\nNow she ran for governor here in Las ... only two hundred vote to show [noise] and she was a school teacher in the central woman\nAnd I I really do think that in the tide is could approve of all the dirty tricks and terrible things that Democrats are doing there's just no way and I predict she's going to switch party affiliations soon his pitch to election stuff is over\nBecause I'm sure she's appalled is a lot of those cars that it's just not acceptable and she was raised better than that I Know [noise] so yeah that was going to have coffee was selling Dina 'cause there's just no way in the world she could have proof of any of this okay\n... ... well except for one thing the I appreciate your call you didn't follow the rules the game was you had to pick someone running for president not that I Know her and I didn't know some of the other candidates running I certainly didn't know them well\nBut the the game was you had to pick someone who's running for president\nAnd say who you would sit down and have coffee with an eye or the other gentleman agreed me Bernie Sanders I that's I think he's a head right now so we got to hear your votes let us know what you think an eight six six Ninety red eye or right now you have your national forecast or video roadblock\nHighlights around the nation today persistent rain is expected for the next few days over Texas where excessive rain as possible in the central part of the state where three precipitation over the higher elevations of Arizona and New Mexico is expected to spread northward into the central Rockies\nTemperatures twenty to forty degrees below normal from the southern plains\nYou sit down to name a Republican you could sit down and don't count bloom or that you could sit down and have a cup of coffee with\nUh quite frankly very few and far between\nI Would say that a Lindsey Lindsey Graham strikes me as a very profound man he's a he's a really decent guy and he's he's got a heart and he's got he's got a mind and he's got a compassion for for the people of this country\nA ... he's a he's a Republican correct so yeah you know I I I I Would think that ideally he'd make a great pie minimum at minimum you'd make or break BP as opposed to a you know I mean look at Trump Trump is already wise you chose a tense\nAs the tea and it's it's great insurance stabbed a man like that behind you sew anything ever God Forbid goes dramatically raunchy cameras all you've got it you've got a man who could step into your shoes and probably do just as well as you\nWell you run your very articulate and you are blind challenge for a Republican you did very well so I appreciate your call and you have a great Dane thanks so much and let's go to ... ah yeah we have time right now Ken in needs that Hammond, Indiana\n[noise] yeah I wanted to speak to the question of of prosecuting Hillary Clinton [noise] um ... you don't win much ruin world or if you lose an election you out one or two choices you to leave the country or you go to jail or worse\nRight I mean one of the reasons we're a stable democracy is because there are certain political norms that we don't violate all remember on the set aside a lose lose the possibilities Democrats going through ten years of Donald Trump's tax returns\nAfter he leaves office or think back to the Bush administration [noise] lot of people both to enhanced interrogation was unlawful\nRight so so we don't I don't think we want to get into a pattern where the incoming administration prosecute the leader of the leaders of the ... the former administration ... other party because our our politics have become too hostile as it is we need to take a step back\nAnd understand that there are certain traditions that are critical all through our are having the stable democracy that we have and rule of law is only one of the\n... well that's an interesting point because you know a lot of people and the other side I think she shouldn't be above the law\nBut as you point out that she has a unique position of also having been the opposing candidate which of course doesn't explain what the what what was it what wait a second what the FBI and the Justice Department did with a soft coup trying to get rid of the incoming president so this is a very complicated situation and she may or may not ...\nThe Justice Department though but I'll give you one for the real story she my point after the civil war right the Confederate Sam ... committed treason could obviously committed treason yet we did not try to walk them up because it was more important than the rule of law that we come back together\nGood a good point can I you know I said you may not have heard me I said whoever talked me laugh I didn't quite say that but that's what I was thinking on this issue with Hillary a you made a good point that's a great point with the civil war I preach old who could you have coffee with\nOn the other side or a ... probably\nI Would probably lead toward a Ben Sasse\nUh-huh yeah he's a bright guy\nYeah he's he's things things are good you did you pass the test you did very well thanks so much\nHere I Am I Can't stay with Tucker cross that have you ever watch than Fox News got these people answering questions in the news that's kinda dumb but that's interesting because\nWho'd you get along with people the way it used to be with Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan you get along with people on the opposing party and and get away from the politics for a little while because you would least respected them speaking of respecting them let's go to live in Pittsburgh Lynn you're on with mark\nWell you know I had a rude awakening this morning\nI uh I woke up and my radio was still on and I heard right kissed Joe\nAnd has a dissertation on how I'm basically he can shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and and why you should be able to get away with it [noise] um\nBut as Hillary is concerned um I kinda signed on to the previous caller just right before me [noise] um if she really had broken the law and been found guilty then certainly she should be locked up um\nBut right just Joe\nThat sounded like a polluted twisted demonic land and\nWhen I hear people like him talking\nIt makes me wish that the Native Americans that this country that had bars on the shores of this country to keep his nasty lazy hateful ancestors out of this country\nAnd I would like to have coffee I wait on on the other side\nTheir side um\nThough I disagree with most of her politics um as a progressive myself that would be a Lisa Murkowski\nBecause that woman she's a she's a strong woman she's she's an example to to to women on my side ah\nNow that's a woman with some integrity and the character and strength ... and she's a bad ass\nWould you have said that if she voted for Kavanaugh's nomination\nNo I'm thinking about some of her actions over a period of time I remember when when uh there was a little sprayed with Trump and I'm a she says she wasn't going to live in fear of a tweet\nWow that really knocked me back I was really impressed with that so she showed that she's a she's a woman up strength\nAnd character and she's not going to be bullied by anybody on on either side so\nBefore I let you go who's your choice who is your choice of the Democratic nomination\nWell I haven't decided yet I Would like for some of the old you know the old timers to just step aside\nA here in my a state that we've we we have someone that a lotta people liking ah his name is Conor Lamb and I really like for you know you know what like for\nMore people like him the rides\nAnd I don't want to see Joe Biden Lonegan\nUm I think that he's had a history of saying some stupid things and and uh it\nI I Would not like to see him run again a he's a good guy but\nUm you know some of these people just need to step out of the way and a lot of new crop of progress it's a pump through\nYeah great point Lynn I appreciate your call a especially on the other side by the way saying talking about stepping aside so you get Nancy Pelosi in her seventies\nCliburn I think his third in line sending hires in his seventies their own there's nothing wrong with that except for ah she was saying a lot of people would like there was an article about ... times where it was about people stepping aside for the younger generation problem is in the house if you serve in the house\nAnd you don't share a committee you're just leave is not a very\nUh what can I say a interesting life to lead you know I mean is that I'd love to be a congressman viewpoint to me tomorrow that's not what I'm saying but uh compared to the other positions there\nBut the Democrats have that problem to let me know what you think's or asking to questions who is your choice to run against a President Trump and who could just sit down and have a cup of coffee with you guys a surprise me it just of all of that question but you're surprised me 'cause you're picking people on the other side\nThat you admired least could sit down and talk with so let me know what you think about that to Mark I'm sitting in on red already\nWith
