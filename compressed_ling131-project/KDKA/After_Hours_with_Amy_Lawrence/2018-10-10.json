of no a hundred and thirty miles an hour it's up to a category\nFor in fact the national Hurricane Center is saying it is now a hurricane that category for a hundred and thirty miles an hour they are that again do you look at the strength of this storm and and the history of the storm over the weekend\nOr the productions being anywhere from a one to two and then late in the weekend a more uh closer to a two and and pretty much everybody was calling that by Monday morning a change and they were saying that ... it has the potential of being a three and now it is up to officially a category ... hurricane or a hurricane Michael\nA it is a set to come ashore a as some time in the afternoon three or four pm there near Panama City ah Florida\nAnd officials again you just heard a ... one mayor and other officials had been basically saying the same thing throughout the day\nUh yesterday they were saying uh you should be aware that a first responders going to be limited and being able to get to you and in in many cases especially while the storm is at its strongest in that area will not be able to get to you so you may not have power you may be in a situation\nUh that uh you will not be able to again I get to any kind of a ... assistance\nOr four hours and so uh did his best to get out of the way of the storm as soon as possible uh get inland go somewhere where you will be

the the latest uh in the Indiana Senate brown versus a Donnelly a Donnelly not vote for a Kavanaugh\nAnd ... he was up by a by three at the end of August the Fox news poll nine twenty nine to ten to has Donnelly up by two well within the margin of error three point to a five percent\nOr and now they have there are three of a different candidates are in this race including the libertarian\nYeah so uh but right now it's forty three forty one or a ... you know Donnelly with the lead but uh again excuse me a yes Donnelly with the the lead the Democrats in there but then again that really you look at that that is another a dead heat that exist out there and then we go to Missouri\nAnd uh the uh latest Fox News poll nine twenty nine to tend to and that is a dead tied now that is before the actual vote took place\nAnd before colon speech and everything else so that's the kind of thing that we're looking for\nThe polls coming out or maybe here in the next couple of days or early next week and as we get closer to see the effect that that that has had there there are a ton of these races that are a statistical tie with even in the statistical tie\nDemocrats maybe up a point or two and a and so this is something that I'm sure as being very carefully watched\nAnd again when you go into and I were not pollsters you know we're not pollsters we can read them but I mean the methodology\nOf of each and every poll has different nuances and it it all depends on you know what the sample is do they interview more Democrats than actually are in a you know that normally vote in a particular race or not or did they over sample Republicans\nFight and and so you look at it but overall when you look at at the the generalized polls are a ton of the Senate races\nThat are extremely close and

did it yes they believe cabin on did at the evidence isn't there right never been there right yet that's what their state and because you don't agree with them\nBecause you say no I Believe in the

you know that you can easily just mess of Maxine Waters in the Hillary as the old guard\nBut the future of the party is this so if if Hillary is jumping out well and by the way Hillary's jumping on board as you mentioned because everybody else's because all she sees this as the future of the\nParty and she and she also believes it's the mainstream of yeah hardy it's ... saying it's okay to call to for instability because somebody believes and due process or presumption of innocence a preponderance of the evidence to decide somebody whether you believe somebody is guilty\nOr not you went from weeks ago people talking about John McCain and we need more civility to the official call for instability in just a matter of weeks I you believe in due process under the constitution you believe in uh the presumption of\nYou don't believe somebody just because they say at the evidence has to prove it in their story\nBut in their story should remain consistent you believe those kinds of things which are embedded in the constitution of the United states\nThan you are a rape enable us to get a rapist enable as what you are right and because you are no stability towards you that is their

Ninety a red eye coming up on the bottom of the hour\nMeteorologist Tom hale will join us on the latest on hurricane Michael which has been upgraded to over night and in fact in the last National Hurricane center advisory about an hour and a half ago to hurricane for\nYeah we'll get another one a little over a Ninety minutes from now and and see where that goes but certainly again I'm not much is changing in terms of the fact that this is a a life threatening storm or a major hurricane on its way\nTo uh Florida so uh we'll we'll talk to Tom here and just a few minutes and follow the story of course throughout the morning this morning and as well or the rest of the week as a Michael continues its path or through the south east and then back out over the Atlantic\nDid you see where a ... or send me Senator Tom cotton said that he believes Schumer's people leaked before and laughter really yeah use on with on Hugh Hewitt show yeah instead I Believe the Schumer political operation was behind this from the very beginning Mm\n[noise] well I mean if because that would it wouldn't be a totally unexpected ride it doesn't seem\nOut of the realm of possibilities because if you were Feinstein you you don't take it to the chairman Grassley you take a to Z sugar party let her right and and have him deal with it right for video robot here's your forecast\nFrom air force reserve and know a hurricane hunter aircraft indicate that the maximum sustained wins\nHave increased to near one hundred thirty miles an hour with higher just possible as Michael becomes a category for hurricane\nSomething that nobody can relate to and when you can't relate to something\nYou relate to what you can and what you can uh if somebody has been around since Nineteen eighty five [noise] that would be caked ... and and and Kate was quite a devastating storm a and at that point\nYou have to say to yourself well if you haven't been around for Kate you know what other things have come by well ah there's been very few October storms to begin with I'm this storm is in October storm ... he was an October storm\nOberstar and there was a a failure but a failure was a major all these are major storms but a failure was offshore and so it didn't have that kind of a an effect\nOn Florida and so right now if you're listening or if you have family and friends along that area you need to understand that that on Wednesday evening\nOne hundred mile an hour gusts are going to be common and that's after it's come onshore [noise]\nUm tomorrow evening because we're expecting a still a landfall sometime around three to four o'clock and that means that it'll speed up a little bit before it comes to shore yeah\nBuyouts gone gone to the north of twelve so\nAnd of course uh you know it's been pointed out time and time again not just the wins and ... and the destruction of property and and present danger to humans but but really the flooding in the storm surge here the water that comes along with a storm like this\nAh being a potentially life threatening and in fact that his life threatening and\nIs often deadly um and and that is something to be aware of it is not just the strength of the storm in terms of wins but also the water that it's going to deliver a both and storm surge and rainfall\nWell yeah you know remember the the ... in in the past it used to be lightning lightning was like the number one whether killer and you know wide lightning isn't the number one whether killer ... because we convinced everybody to go out in the lightning\nRight right [laughter] okay yeah indoors this lightning right\nYou know we've done a really lousy job at convincing people to use common sense when they're on the road\nAnd they're driving and and we had over thirty people in the Carolinas drowned because they decided they were going to be tougher and they knew what they were doing better than the people who are telling them to stay off the road right now and and\nAnd and so yeah a storm surge is usually felt along the coast and let's say maybe five to ten miles inland wherever there is a waterway that that water from the Gulf of Mexico can move its way and [noise]\nAnd so whether you're an Appalachian cola or you are in Panama City\nOr you're swinging around uh uh toward the coastline just south of Perry\nAnd the big band that you're looking at a a storm surge that's going to be easily nine feet ... could be less right can be up to nine feet or even Thirteen actually the weather service has got a plot at nine to Thirteen feet in that area\nFor those of us who have never witnessed that first and I just described the dynamics of a storm surge especially one with the potential of a nine to twelve feet or more as you mentioned\nThat because you know we've seen the recent video from the nominee in Indonesia and we know so we can see that kind of force in terms of a storm surge I mean one of the dynamics of that what I describe that to us what takes place during the storm\nYeah because I'm looking here I'm looking here like it at Panama City beach for example that's you know uh you're right there I mean there's no there's no barrier it's not one of the bays it's right there what is what is the fat how far I mean that goes in a pretty long way doesn't it\nOh yeah yeah when you go into the west bank or the East Bay um all the way up through um what they called dear point lake which is his Israeli an extension the northern extension of the north bay [noise] ah or the grand\nUh or the grand lagoon this entire area from the from the lower ... which is which is basically where the beach is uh the the bridge that goes over to the over to the beach right I'm an inland\nAll of that water rises\nUniformly pretty much it's kind of like turning the water on it's not like what you're seeing a smelling like salami it's turning the water on and watching your bad to fill and except in this particular case as the storm gets closer and the last uh\nHour and a half to two hours or so the bath tub still and so\nIn the Carolinas the the I don't know if it was the record but it started close to a New Bern North Carolina uh picked up a storm surge a that was at least ten feet I'm there may have been a higher storm surge\nA further around the point I'm that sticks out there if the Carolinas [noise] um\nBut this water just keeps rising and and as it starts to rise three feet six feet and so forth you need to be able to get to a place that's higher than the storm surge and that is really simple as a gift\nAnd this water is moving\nAnd and so the water has motion it can erode stuff [noise]\nUm when I say it's moving it it's it's normal current and it's moving because it's also got winds blowing it had a good speed and so you've got a certain amount of ah\nIt's not going to be moving as fast as a win because the surface tension the water's go slow that body down but it's still moving so [noise] ah the the place that I recall and I drove through this area a couple of times [noise]\nUm because it's just a beautiful ride in your ... you know if you've done this for German for each point the Appalachian coal a cute little town especially when you're coming across the bridge and they're looking at Appalachian ... down to the south and East Bay on the other side [noise] um\nThen you notice is you're looking off along the water all these nice homes but they're on stilts ... and they're they're all stilted easily at about ten feet [noise] um well Thirteen feet which still inundate those homes wow yeah\nThat's that that you know that that puts it in perspective for anyone who's gone to a beach and seen these houses in fact we stayed in one uh in in in Texas and the and the Galveston area over the summer and we've done that many times but if you've ever been to these are areas and you see these houses on these still\nUh you're right those the typically there are about ten feet high but add\nAnother three feet to that potentially and that means even on still\nYou're going to see destruction and flooding of those homes and that is very very powerful and and sobering frankly\nWell you've heard the terms high profile vehicles right okay well this is a house that's a high profile house and once you get past the stilts now you've got three feet of water going into a more solid structure and so that's going to be a lot easier to topple and destroy yeah\nSure and wildlife yeah great point of the higher center of gravity and yes I Am that situation which becomes a very destructive very easily on ... and so again a the timelines you were looking for the ice to come ashore sometime in the afternoon\nYes and and and right now it depends if it if it goes the speed that it's going right now and makes a nice even turn and doesn't increase speed when it makes the turn a little bit to the north north east\nThe north north east [noise] uh it wouldn't get there 'til six thirty eastern time um but if it picks up some speed\nOr even a couple of miles an hour goes from twelve to fourteen and so forth and we could anticipate the same coming out a little bit earlier than that around four o'clock and that's kind of what everybody's betting on right now\nThey're getting rain right now ... has just had the light and rain and in fact all of this is very light rain tropical rain starts off his little find drops in then increases from there [noise]\nUm and there's a couple of thunderstorms that are running anywhere from Appalachian coal up to Pensacola Beach to listen to the eye opener hey notice it's raining idiot real it's coming your way\nRight how far inland can we can we expect those hurricane force winds anything from Seventy five miles an hour and above a two to sustain a how far inland in and how long do you expect that to be the case\nAll right let's assume that it it comes ashore and we'll just simply call it where it is right now for all right forty five miles inland ... is what you would be looking at her and forty five miles inland would make those wins go to Panama City at least and possibly a little further out\nAnd it would take those wins back over to probably not to Perry but at least to St Mark's ... National Wildlife refuge area which is to the chest south or just slightly south east to Tallahassee\nBut now remember this this right now the location is a hundred and eighty miles to the south south west of Panama City\nOr a hundred and Seventy miles okay southwest of Appalachia cola hurt a tropical storm force winds thirty nine miles an hour and more ... are extending out right now as we speak a hundred and Seventy five miles from\nOh that's right I radio show dot com the red eye radio million mile club would not be possible without the support of our great sponsors including Petro stopping centers\nHow's lubricate or the ... the family of companies motel six the sink Christopher fond cats scale and cover electronics we applaud the individual truckers athletes who drive with care and keep our highways say a\nHigh end in Compton for over Thirty years known the America's most rent for music\nNow every week and watch me and my co host Jessica Rose as we didn't need the only weekly news show creative just joined us for all the breaking news affecting the trucking industry along with an awesome regularly for all the [noise]\nIn front of the dot com is the one front with them you're not going to want to have them be travel down the highway in tune in every week and watch the news channel my going through the front or dot com\n\n\nThe news on the hour sponsored by their works relief jailer hundreds of thousands or to do evacuated the Florida Panhandle not everyone is doing so\nIt remains a hurricane before a lot about it and watch them on television where today and see it out\nWith the latest on the strength of hurricane Michael CBS meteorologist David permits\nMichael is now about as serious as it gets it is a category for hurricane and it will make landfall as a category four likely with winds of a hundred and thirty miles an hour to put that in perspective\nThere has never been as long as we've recorded hurricanes or the Florida Panhandle a category for making landfall in the Florida Panhandle\nLandfall expected in a matter of hours their power of storm waters in West Texas for people still missing from an RV parks swept away by the raging flood waters Jeremy Baker with K.

or are in their weather center and uh they're getting ready to start their wall to wall coverage and they are twenty feet above sea level\nAnd now they're\nOptimistic that they won't see a storm surge um that will get up to the station right\nAnd they're also optimistic that the generators or continue the pound power generator or work in the station is fortified sufficient enough to handle this and we won't know that until a later this afternoon right um but obviously I'd tomorrow if we talk um maybe we'll see if we can get a phone call into them\nIn a mass after it is passed by right\nUm but I I think our prayers need to be with all the people who are up and down that coastline that are there because they realize that even though\nWise that even though the majority of people of of ... wait it out of a given area that there are still some people behind and while they're not going to be able to go out and do anything once the wins get up over forty miles an hour and they become tropical storm wins um\nBut that being said even though they're not going to be able to do anything\nWhen it's over with they're going to be in there in force I Know are surrounding a Panama City they've got I think six hundred staged power company people were going to swarm in there the governor of Florida\nHas called out I think it's fourteen hundred a National Guards uh guardsmen or guards folks ah [noise]\nAnd uh the same is true\n'em up and down the up and down the coast three states of of basically um declared a you know a disaster urgency\nRight in the ... let me let me just ask this because you did or you had predicted a before the last ah advisory that showed that went to a category of for you predicted that it would go up a couple of ... of a of of more miles per hour from a hundred and twenty five hundred and thirty and you hit it right\nYou expected to get any stronger or do seed weakening as it gets closer to shore\nAh no I don't see a weakening as gets closer to shore in this particular case um [noise] the the water hasn't been touched so we're looking at eighty five degree average water temperature\nUm the other thing that's going on is that unlike a lot of these storms where we've got a cold front that might come in from the continental United States bringing in a little bit drier air there is a cold front out there but it's it's moving through the Dallas area right now it's it's nowhere near\nThis and so uh in in terms of what we know in the United states and and then the mid west and so forth we call it the warm sector that's the area had a cold front\n... that warm sector is a couple of hundred miles long and they're in the heart of that warm sector they have all the fuel all the moisture and in the heat and heat in the water that's necessary so it won't it won't die down\nOr what ever it gains it will carry to shore and then once it hits the friction of the shore then it will start to degenerate a little bit so Tallahassee and could be seeing routine\nI'm eighty two maybe a little more than that ... mile an hour gusts with sustained winds of fifty miles an hour while Appalachian coal a and Panama City beach will have one hundred plus mile an hour winds as it's coming ashore [noise]\nUh this afternoon and and and they'll have periods where those gosh drop off to Seventy five miles an hour\nAs so yeah and this is this is a fascinating point um you you may not realize that savannah you know is way out on the on the coast here or north Brunswick in ... in Georgia coming out of Atlanta on sixteen [noise]\nUh savannah because of the wind field is going to have wins that are big gusting up to twenty five miles an hour with some isolated Gus tomorrow night up to fifty miles an hour\nAnd the entire coast from the Georgia toast up through the south Carolina and North Carolina coast um all of that area\nI'm potentially as far up as Morehead City um is going to feel the force of this storm on Thursday as it moves its way out of\nOut of a Florida and process Georgia across Valdosta and probably somewhere between savannah and I'd go to a south of making and eventually comes up across Florence\nYou had a young we're looking at I'm not going to the map right here and and a tropical storm warnings for all the Georgia coast and looks like about three quarters of the south Carolina coast and the rest of it as a tropical storm watch as you get it by South Carolina all the way through North Carolina almost all the way up to Virginia\nExactly exactly and I didn't even mentioned Virginia but Chad goes that far north and uh and so we can expect forty plus mile an hour forty five mile an hour winds all the way up that entire stretch on shore wins because this is a this would be a a nor'easter\nThat the Windsor gonna bring onshore flow and it's still relatively warm along there and whatever rain has dropped\nAnd rainfall figures for that particular area\nA are still pretty significant and I'm I'm\nWe're looking at the Florida Panhandle 'em and mid Atlantic and all the way up to New England one to three inches of rain and as for the Carolinas southern Virginia and Georgia three to six inches of rain with isolated amounts of eight inch rains wow\nWow uh and and\nThat causes life threatening flash flooding\nYes yes and as people often do not heed the warnings or ignore high water areas and believe that they can get through those areas that's where it becomes deadly\nYeah let me give you another one of those little analogy is like the bath tub analogy I gave earlier um you go to the grocery store and there's a gallon of water you pick it up and you go oh this is kind of heavy but it's cool [noise] well that gallon of water weighs about seven pounds I'm\nOK Now let's take a thousand gallons of water per minute rolling over a road which is not an unreasonable right amount of water going across some something even if we brought that down and have\nWe're we're still looking at you know thousands of pounds two three four thousand pounds it will be as if a\nA ... ton pickup truck we're at Rhodes level pounding on the road back and forth just kind of bulldozing it and so forth how do you know that there's a road under their\nYeah great point great point what often there are six\nIs on water seeks his own level so it's going to look nice and flat and smoothing all across it it's probably not going to be you know perfectly clear so you are not going to be able to see what's under it\nAnd and so just imagine all those containers of ... gallons of water on a giant entire Iowa the grocery store rolling across continuously every minute across the road what are the odds and it's going to tear up that road and you think you'd just being tired enough to make it through\nRight and and the fact that it doesn't uh it relatively speaking it doesn't take\nA high water or in order to move a vehicle I mean it did has that forces you read six inches ... so you're talking about uh you know again all these all these threats\nThat people cannot assess possibly assess properly or in that situation and again he those warnings are there's absolutely no reason to go through a high water or a a low area that has high water in these situations and heed the warnings of those local and state officials\nOfficials and the that that are there in Florida and those other states that will be dealing with Michael over the next twenty four thirty six forty eight hours I hear as we continue our conversation with Tom hill will do that next hour\nTom has been on a with us before
