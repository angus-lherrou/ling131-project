know late friday so they could take all day Thursday and all day friday\nA and I suspected that well while he may not allow multiple copies to be made again there's only one single copy\n'em that he could easily say well OK over the next couple of days we'll we'll take our time with it and it won't be the the one hour restriction a you know maybe a each of them can go into that room are either as a group or individual you're making you know take their time with\n'em and and they likely will do that but I'm I'm guessing they will do that either in one large group or or smaller groups even a in order to to see everything\nUh we had seen the story of late yesterday that the top FBI or a lawyer a James Baker offers explosive testimony on a normal handling of the Russia probe into the Trump

I mean it's going to go down to the high on hold forever but I I I Do\nBelieve that because the ah Republicans most likely want to abide by the rule that Democrats will do everything they can to claim\nFor example is Adam Schiff has done all along Adam Schiff firms and not on this but Adam ships and who will be talking about uh the whole a Russian collusion investigation coming up in the bomb shell or out of a of out of D.C or yesterday about the James Baker ... uh uh apparently\nTelling the house or the house uh uh I don't know which panel it was\nBut uh in in test closed door testimony yesterday telling them he talked to the Democrat the Democratic national committee's lawyers right before they got the warrant right and and and James Baker atop FBI official\nOr at that time which without question shows that politics played apart and he talked to them about\nWhat was going on me talk to the DNC lawyers about the Trump Russia collusion investigation that was going on which is at the ... the wrong thing to do right now you cannot nobody can defend that\nIn an investigation so it's getting to where you and I ask questions over a year and a half ago\nIs this where this is going and we ... you know what I'm saying is every question that we asked about where this where what might have happened here in what they might be investigating every single thing that we asked the question on\nHas come true it is all come out in a in a series of reports\nYou know if you look at it it ... or well at least it's it's there has been people the media has looked into those questions I guess we could say right\nUm that well first of all one of the first questions the big question really was there a potentially is there are we looking at possibly a gross abuse of power under the previous administration\nThat that uh a person or persons knowingly used false information to which is a the Giuliani pointed out\nYou know there's a there you have it there's your your your perjury\nUm but they they in soliciting for that or Pfizer court warrant\nAnd we'll get to that coming up falling off the top of the hour might point out Adam Schiff is though Adam Schiff\nHas claimed for the longest time that there is collusion their ... and since we can't see it he's able to claim that there's collusion and out of the feeling the Democrats do the same thing here claim that there is evidence yeah I Know in this because the Republicans won't release it so they won't release it or they know the Republicans won't release of because Republicans\nYou know a ... ... ... ah in the in the Senate want\nTo keep a this\nAffect that hey we can't be black but not every background check we do have every ... of of every judge we're not going to do that and so I Believe they'll use it to their advantage and may force the Republicans to release it here in the next couple of days I Believe that one\nIt's a couple of days I Believe that will be one of the tactics that we will see tomorrow I Wish you and I could finish the show here in the next twenty minutes and we could just repeat the ... the first two hours\nThe rest of the show go home get some sleep and then wake up at seven AM [laughter] so we can be up all day tomorrow because I really don't want to miss any of what's going to be going on but in the ...

G. being given all this ah on redacted information from the White House you you know that there's only one reason the inspector general\nExists that's to look and see if there's any kind of corruption or misdeeds\nStealing it in the department of justice accounting irregularities things it's like a pencils home things like that and just you know if you're new to the show what we've always talked about is the Democrats have said Trump polluted with Russians to hack the election mhm that was the initial charge or what have we all find out and we all know now nobody's debating it\nIs it was the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary campaign the paid a law firm ... within paid a opposition research firm fusion GPS who paid a former British spy who got dirt he says from people close you know Russians close to the Kremlin unverified\nThat they then\nTaught to use against Donald Trump to defeat his campaign and when that didn't work tried to destroy the legitimacy of the election and use that on verified information that they got from the Russians\nAre to get themselves a Pfizer warrant a secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign\nAnd what we're being told now is that somebody from the FBI met with the law firm who helped initiate the whole thing along with the DNC and the Hillary campaign right before the Pfizer warrant was issued and just weeks before the campaign yeah so hopefully that does I think that explains it all simply as you can explain it\nAnd a number of details coming about uh you know with the Solomon a report\nOr that broke on on Wednesday Wednesday evening and then of course you go back to the fact that a Bruce or or at the time a high ranking a an official at the department of justice his wife worked for fusion GPS\nSo there are connections all over the place to this\nAnd the pattern of behavior an activity that right now points in one direction\nAnd that's political motivation\nPlain and simple the question is what if any crimes were committed along the way eight six six Ninety read I\nWas told to exert [laughter]\nSix hundred [noise]\nCheck out all the latest news event tracking information jobs and pod cast at red eye radio show dot com that's red eye radio show dot com\nThere's no doubt increasing productivity and efficiency in the morning to you make sure you're illegal profit thought just compliant civil buying or operation\nGiven on me track dot com or red eye radio show dot com forward slash E.

House has already commented on it and says there's\nNo cooperation of any of the sexual assault allegations\nUm it's interesting because the book we get back here to the the story from the hill dot

basically the petition or to invoke a for cloture or that has happened that happened Wednesday late Wednesday by Senate majority leader ah they basically Thursday is a just a kind of a blank day although it will be about reviewing the documents\nAnd friday they will move forward or to move with a cloture vote the than closure for those that may not know is basically just ending the debate and discussion on it\nAnd and saying okay now it's ready for a vote so that vote would happen I'm assuming\nIf and they'll know the headcount there on the cloture vote will tell them you know with what the headcount is for the vote and I I doubt they're going to want to delay a much longer after that cloture vote if they get fifty or more\nWe've got a Christian Battle Creek Michigan Chris welcome you're on run I Radio Welcome to the show\n[noise] hey how are you good to [noise] ah\nI'm curious about and it's just something that went through my head is what do you uh what do you guys think about the idea that the whole reason\nThey held everything and that they've been doing what they've been doing and they laid the groundwork for in the hearings by claiming that he gets kinda partisan and attacking them is that they didn't think they were actually gonna be able to stop the confirmation of Kavanaugh\nSo what they've been doing is laying the groundwork to once he's elected and is on the Supreme Court from this point forward\nThere on a plane he's part is in and try and demand that he recused himself or abstain from any votes\nYou may have you with anything they want to but they if they don't they can do\nHe's the no it's not he's the only person that can recused himself\n[noise] okay yeah they can't scream that\nWell they did a great role your cell screaming all day long but don't get nowhere and get anywhere with it\nOkay 'cause I've heard lawyers you know try and\nNo sure that judges should recused himself oh yesterday on our well\nYou know when they lose the electoral vote than we should do away with the electoral college if they lose this then you know they we should do away with this process we should change the way that Supreme Court justices are seated and we should and it will be all about well we don't we didn't get our way so we should change the rules right\nAh and by the way that call happens already in the Supreme Court mhm yeah I Can't remember we've even there's been some cases were review even said some of the judges mhm should recused themselves or I Can't remember a specific one right ah right off the top of my head but I Know that we've talked about that in the past and I remember I Can't\nWait we're an appellate judge on a case yeah you know and before they were seen to down the it's got to the court after they were seated on the high court that's happened or they argued a case or something um then but but again that's up to them because if\nIt's or or are there for example they're arguing the case of deals with the law or you know with the company and their wife works for the company and writes for the ... at that point you have to recuse yourself\nBut to say as we've been we've we've heard for example well they can't he can't rule on anything that involves the Democrats because he's been partisan and he got angry at them and that's not going to hold any water\nYeah uh do you remember when the talk about ah you know his nomination this was back during the Gorsuch nomination process or the talk was well the the president should nominate his sister\nYou know and it was like OK let's [laughter] she would have to recuse herself from every case of that [laughter] well that company is indirectly working with my brother's company and and you know you you get the the the whole thing and and of course you know the fact that ah well she's part of his family but\nThe the\nThe process and you and I were having this discussion during the break there is a great deal of respect by everyone that seated on the court right now for the process\nNot that they make a decision that we always agree with in fact the uh well I can think of three that often make decisions we highly disagree with 'em or for sometimes with John Roberts [laughter] but we can talk about that\nBut the procedure on procedural issues all of the justice that justices that are seated right now on the high court have a great deal of respect for those procedures\nAnd how you move forward with the case or it is not it is not driven like the social media world up today at the Supreme Court in terms of procedure now the hearings often how these interesting comments that come out of him and questions that come out of him\nAnd then the media takes them and runs with I'm often out of context or they did that with Scalia\nUm but you know there's but but still in terms of the procedure there is a great deal of respect why each of those that are Steve Zahn\nRight now and you know but I I think can make a great point by saying the world of the Supreme Court or even the federal judges to begin with is not the social media world that I I'm I'm Glad you made that comparison that it's not the social media world that we live in\nFor example most people don't know that a former justice ...\nThe former Justice Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg were great great friends were great money to make that their ... their their family their families used to\nVacation together yes that's how tight they were you could not find two polar opposites so what you what you end up getting is a there is when you get up that high in a very very unique job\nThere is even even if we can sit here and and we have and said we don't believe that this person respects the constitution\nThat there is a camaraderie that exists for the process and if you were to ask the judges privately what they believe about the process of Kavanaugh is going through right now I bet you the majority of judges would say it's absolutely horrendous and should not be that way\nBecause they don't even to the door this is my point earlier about what I Believe and how the rule came about by the Senate in two thousand nine\nControlled by the Democrats that keeps this process of the background checks secret and the the content of the three oh two secret\nIs likely because of exactly what we're seeing right now and that is\nIf there's a if some content came out just imagine\nThat we never heard Dr Ford's name but the claim came out what they would do is look at that and go okay well is there anybody backing it up because the claim would be in the three oh to accept that they found that they couldn't find any anyone will first hand knowledge of the event\nOr the claims then they would say we couldn't find anything to corroborate well they know the Senate knew back then\nThat you take something like that a simple claim that cannot be backed up and it could be it could derail the entire process and that's exactly what we're looking at but\nHere's here's the point that nobody's talked about with all the federal judge ships out their forget about the Supreme Court just the federal judge ships out there\nThat background checks are done how many thousands of claims that are uncorroborated when you think about the federal federal judiciary out there and the process that they have to go through and the background checks that are done\nHow many thousands or tens of thousands of allegations are made that are on cooperated in order to defeat somebody\nAnd never get known to the public eye and the only reason this one did was because Dianne Feinstein said okay this is going to be the exception to the rule ... we would normally never do this this is against complete protocol what I'm doing complete rules the Senate complete protocol we don't do this but I'm doing this because\nThe end justifies the means in this case we cannot allow a five to four majority that is a more construction as well as journalists core and then learning\nOf this this rule now it puts it on and the prospect she knew that if she turned Feinstein if she turn this information over to the FBI the vet as a part of the official process it would've it would've been in the official three oh to report and you wouldn't hear about it\nWhen it would have never would have you know that's the ... when you think about that that's the whole point nobody would've ever known that this existed right her name would have never come out because everything would have been on ... ... we're not would not have been able to\nBeen cooperative and then at that point it died just like probably the thousands of other allegation and you know that have come out against other federal judges and Supreme Court justices\nThis is over the decades and that's that's it because you could you could start easily a smear campaigns simply with a claim now now what makes sense as to why\nFeinstein for her politically white worked to her end\nAnd and for her side at least up to this point why it was more important to leak to the media and certainly you could not take it to the FBI because if that were in the report of the three oh two we wouldn't hear about it now you know why Lindsey Graham was so enraged yep eight six six Ninety right I\nMary inside a grocery store shelves a good job of community\nProducts that keep the business running\nFor what they don't see is what the

D you know they accused or the Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack the election\nOkay remember that was the original a charge what we found out since that time was and nobody disputes but I'm going to tell you right now that the Democratic National Committee in Hillary\nClinton's campaign gave money to their law firm Perkins ... law firm ... who then gave the money to an opposition research firm called fusion GPS which then hired a former British spy\nChristopher Steele who then got information he claims from people Russians very close to the Kremlin\nWhich was unverified still to this day and verified in order\nTo uh destroy the reputation of Donald Trump during the campaign to hurt the election and when they couldn't do it\nTo destroy the legitimacy of his election after he was elected a lot of that information and that ... from what we know was the major source for getting the secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign\nAnd so now we know that right before that\nThe FBI lead counsel met with the law firm Perkins too we that really when you look at it they're the ones that started you know the ... the money started flowing from the DNC and the Hillary campaign [laughter] we got to the law firm\nThey were well the ones that were distributed to fusion GPS I mean they were you can look at them and say OK they were the lead organizers\nRight and I would counsel for the FBI do that I mean if you if you said an investigation was ongoing and looking into it and lead agents were there to question the the the I guess the principles of that law firm and others and that law firm\nThat would be you could just easily I guess\nA compartmentalize that as part of an investigative process\nWhy would why would the counsel for the FBI do\nAs they say well as well as he says to talk about the allegations of the Donald Trump Russia collusion or just weeks before the twenty sixteen election but it was\nLawyers meeting with lawyers right why why not an agent asking some questions of the attorneys no it was attorneys and attorneys meeting\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker while he was with the FBI or met during the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for ... the Democratic National Committee he's private law firm ... that's the term used by the DNC and Hillary's campaign to secretly pay research firm fusion GPS\nWho then paid Christopher Steele the former British spy to compile the dusty a of an cooperated raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed\nFor armed or by both testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation by Republicans on the house judiciary and government oversight committees the sources tell a John Solomon from the hill dot com\nIt means the FBI had good reason to suspect that dossier was connected to the ... main law firm and was the product of a democratic opposition research effort to defeat Trump yet failed to disclose that information to the size of court in October twenty sixteen\nThis is a bombshell that shows the real collusion was between the FBI and Donald Trump's opposition the DNC Hillary and the Trump hating British Intelligence officer\nTo hide the Jack the election rather than some conspiracy between ... and Trump a source told John Oliver\nBaker then was interviewed a Jim Baker was interviewed a by lawmakers behind closed doors yesterday sources declined to divulge the testimony others uh other than to say it confirmed other evidence about the contact between the ... law firm and\nThe FBI we've often stated that said I mean it's it's mind boggling when you think about it is a movie it's not a movie\nThis this could be twenty four yeah\nYou can do a capitalist season though you could do probably more seasons then law and order\nA couple of seasons of it because we've always broken down and since we've been on for such a long time I do believe that you know you could include us in the group that was first in asking so many of the important\nQuestions on this but when you think about it it was the Democrats that we're accusing Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack and or changed because of change then to hack\nAnd or to change the outcome of the election and then reality what you find out it was completely the opposite the people the party that was making the accusation they were the ones\nWho colluded with the Russians to get dirt on Trump and verified information still today\nAnd I'm On the way if it's on verified as far as I'm concerned this long the vast majority of it it's fall after ... after over two years right so\nAnd and and so they did it to destroy his campaign and when they couldn't do that it was to destroy the legitimacy of a lead shit presidential election in the United states\nAnd they tried to do it by taking that information that information and\nAnd just do well faking it as in halogen instead of opposition research\nTo the Pfizer court to spy on the Trump campaign exactly the accusations they and they don't make it against Trump yes they still make the say he's treasonous for Russian collusion right and when you look at it the actual Russian collusion was completely from the other party\nAnd all those things that I just brought up right now\nAll the way to the whole Pfizer court and you everybody knows it's true\nI don't know of anybody decide or or that as\nIt tried to even debated especially after the you know the work done by Sarah a quarter and Solomon and others at circle news or when you started seeing some of the documents that were that were coming out\nUm and what was going on the behavior of the previous administration I mean so many of these pieces of the puzzle that have come together in the last two years here's the problem with having something go on for so long where it is active because it is still active Mueller and his team are still\nAnd his team are still working which means it's still relevant even though right now on the left they've gone very quiet on it\nIt's that you have more time to shed light on the truth\nThat's a problem for anyone who may be guilty of doing anything illegal in this entire scenario\nWhat you think about it I Can't even apply to what's going on with the allegations against cabinet right\nThe longer that you go on and you look at the you know the allegations that have been made the story starts falling apart as more investigations go on as you've seen\nYou know with the ah the ah you know Evan Eddie's right a a thing and then you sit there and as time goes by and you see that it still remains you know a no cooperation for these particular stories right they they go nowhere mhm and\nSo the longer time that you do with whether it's you know you're you're able to find out more of the truth\nAnd like I said more of the truth of what we have seen it but the Democrats dead wood Stein Feinstein did\nPossible without the
