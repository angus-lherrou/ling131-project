the rhetoric has been heated in this\nCountry or for a long time yeah it's amplified now because social media exists so it seems like it's worse than ever remember when you use to personally insult a

the left has to use it because they don't have anything to argue they can't argue the substance of the issues we can there's no need for us\nTo do that they need to do it because\nThey're lost ...

doesn't matter from what we know or the FBI still hasn't said whether those were alive explosives or not in fact we know one of them was not the one cent to seeing it right you know that was not\nA but when you look at it when you\nLook at the reaction of the media to similar instances one and and those are the these are emblem sent to the politicians in power right now and two appointed

came out of people move ... you know people moved on and said OK yeah brought brought back memories we talked about it brought back memories of nine eleven\nAnd then we moved on a good looks like they caught the guy but now the charges officially filed last week during all the the\nUh uh\nCoverage of a you know the um the mail bomb scare ... were they treated the same by the media\nFor those were

mhm\nOne party on one story that shouldn't be related to them at all and you ignore the other story mhm\n\n[noise] yeah I mean it it was not it it it's as if okay yeah that happens fine I'm comes with the territory as Don Lemon right might say and that's it now it's a given that high profile individuals\nPoliticians in presidents are going to be a target of a number of attempts it's why the secret services in place\nOr for presidents and it's why most people even if they're not serving or the public there the even in the private sector or they're they have a high level very high level of security\nBut the point is is that the the media went all over when it works for when they believe that works for their side they stay on it for a long long time\nThey will it it it is the story but it doesn't work for them politically if it's the other way around if the other side is targeted and\nWe can send that reminder to a ... of what happened is the skull east and the attempted assassination of multiple Republicans that something ah Don Lemon at CNN apparently needs to be reminded of\nOh yeah I saw that yesterday that did come up yeah yeah and ... a a a toy box yeah I've got to you know to that one right\nWell the interesting thing is as they talk about the fact that hateful and spiteful about rhetoric and Ambien it up is what causes these murders and then that's exactly

do yes but the people know that but yes um but so no one at at MSNBC or CNN or any of the others are response now\nNo longer know just [noise] or you would have to come out and and then accused\nThem of of course being responsible for the attempted multiple assassination on that ball field on that day were ... I was shocked\n\nI ... if you say one side is responsible you have to say the other side to\n... there's no way to ignore that you can try to ignore that but you just look stupid doing\nYeah but I what I just I Love and ... is the fact that as they\nDenounce the fact that heated rhetoric causes people to commit murder [laughter] they just gave up where the wild and in sane and crazy accusation\nYeah well what Michael Moore say rabbit rabbit up so here you go that's response will wrap it up\nThat's ridiculous so ah so that would mean also that Twitter and Facebook and social media and I don't feel response have to go the right I don't have to go\nFree speech is the problem or anything that that\nAny of these individuals who are actually responsible for this\nAnything that they participate in this response right well know anybody that they disagree with right yeah well I mean\nI'm Talking about if if this person if if a left this is saying that your you know that that uh

right\nThat's what I if you were to ask me I don't agree with it but I think that's what will happen mhm [noise] yeah or or the ... or ... decides to say uh that the president can effectively change this through executive order that this would have to be an act of Congress to change this\nIt would have to well it would have to be I mean what would they say would have to be an act of Congress or would they have to be a ... another ...\nYeah I'm ... it's I guess\nBecause at that point now you're approaching interpretation a them essentially having to interpret\nAnd and the fine at the highest level the fourteenth amendment and and really outline who would applies to or whether or not it applies to the children of illegal daily ... and\nThen you'd have to go to the Nineteen fifty to a a part of the immigration naturalization act mhm they get section I Believe it's I'm just memory fourteen or one has renewed earlier that the word Congress said okay you know we the this is this is the law that Congress except the with the fourteenth amendment here\nAnd so you'd have to go back to Nineteen fifty two the justices to say OK did anybody even bring up the birthright citizenship that it didn't include it in any Congress purse or anybody who\nUh you know who who submitted this bill to Congress even bring that up because as far as we know that that wasn't an issue at that point why they did it more research has to be done as to why Congress did that\nIn Nineteen fifty two and what that specifically met\nOr if if ... were to decide to define who would applies to the uh the citizenship clause if they were to defined clearly in and decision I don't think there's going to happen but if they were to do that would that normal fi\nThat law from Nineteen fifty two\nIf it is if if the law says otherwise and the constitution the fourteenth amendment or the ... the fourteenth amendment is\nClearly defined it if the if the Supreme Court heard it and the Supreme Court said no here's what it says than the what Congress did in fifty two would be gone that's what I mean oh yeah yeah oh yeah the ... that ... that law also right that they could one one fell swoop\nAnd and that's the interpretation bunch means that there's much evening but you have to get past\nThat part and that is what I don't see happening no no I said earlier I don't ... I don't think they're going to get to to finding a very clearly what they based on interpretation who the ... look at us ship clause\nApplies doing who are looking at the gun lawsuits over the last ... probably a a you know two hundred and forty years of the country and and the two hundred and Thirty years before Congress irks me for the Supreme Court finally saw the second amendment as an individual rights ... it took that long right even though to me it was absolutely clear that it was an individual right\nMargaret irks me for the Supreme Court finally said the second amendment as an individual right right it took that long right even though to me was absolutely clear that it was an individual right\nAs it was to many of us because we knew what the founding fathers thought go back to the federalist papers and you could figure that out quite easily and do it wasn't defined for over two hundred and Thirty years ... eight six six Ninety road I\nGo with what I told ... ...

gives me anxiety\nLaura age Twenty one or land or Florida has never voted in high school I didn't even know or a vice president's name was Joe Biden at my high school classmates were Republicans they were very vocal about it especially during the whole Romney\nAnd Obama election I realized I didn't believe everything that they were saying then I Googled Republican versus Democrat I like kind of both kind enough that's why I'm an independent it wasn't until the Trump versus Hillary election that I realized how important it was to vote maybe they had to do with\nLike society at all [laughter] ... every maybe\nEvery one I was following was like go out to vote I was in college in Massachusetts I decided that I wasn't going to go to the long process run out of state student to register to vote either hectic schedule I just didn't have the time and energy\nIt's just not that important\nAlso I didn't know how my parents would feel about the whole thing because my brother does not bode either so it wasn't asked if they could help us out with the registration and mailing all the forms to us\nSo she doesn't want to get by with their parents with\nMy mom was a Republican and my dad as a Democrat\n[laughter] I Wonder if she's never bought a concert tickets on line [laughter] you know you asked yourself okay is there anything because millennials aren't stupid if they want to go to a concert or something oh man boom they pull up the up a boom boom boom boom they've got tickets\nOh voting oh no no mailing things gives me anxiety toward preview who rode law he's your forecast\nOr our interpretation is that are ruining is is that it applies to ah these individuals not these individuals and then it that could ah right there in fact a ... that Nineteen fifty two law a so an act of Congress can certainly be changed and\nOverruled by the court notified by the court also yeah so yeah ... ... you know if if if you if you had Congress come out today and and pass a law stayed in a lot you know that the Nineteen fifty two law was just\nAn you know is an assertion that that we believe in the fourteenth amendment but we as Congress do not believe that the fourteenth amendment\nCovered birthright citizenship that's up to the Supreme Court to decide because we don't clearly see it in the in in the text\nAnd we believe that you know and and you you pass this law and so we we you know we either we either pull that Nineteen fifty law out or we amend the Nineteen fifty law\nTo include the fact that we're not making a a a judgment on birthright citizenship because that and I I don't think you'll ever see Congress do that I'm saying they could do that for a and and then at that point\nThe the courts would say will Congress was looking for what we believe on this to begin with now we're never going to see\nWell uh and and then at that point the the courts would say will Congress was looking for what we believe on this to begin with now we're never going to see that that's a complete total hypothetical delusional [laughter]\nYou know delusional scenario because it's not going to happen but I'm saying they could do that but because ... in Nineteen fifty two said that many believe that the courts will use that in order to different safe now sorry I'm\nThe Supreme Court gave that opinion and Nineteen Eighteen Ninety eight even though it wasn't a precedent that was that it was an opinion the opinion lean that way Congress didn't object to it when they basically approved of the fourteenth amendment in the Nineteen fifty two law so sorry you don't have standing as the executive branch yeah they could do\nLower courts can do that in the higher courts might refused to hear it\nBut it has never been my my problem is\nAnd this is where you know occasionally we'll talk about the failure of the system I believe that we as a nation need to have when you have a a law\nThat clearly is and how it's been interpreted is not an amendment to the constitution which is clearly not being viewed by modern society as the\nMakers and the writers of that amendment and the people and the legislators that voted for that amendment back a hundred and fifty something years ago\nThat the Supreme Court does have to step in the times they did for they did with the second amendment that was two hundred and Thirty years yeah now a federal precedent not Supreme Court precedent but there was federal precedent in there that was said precedent to their the Supreme Court came in and said sorry\nUh owning a gun as an individual right yeah yeah yeah\nThank you Scott we appreciate it um I I because yeah that\nThe the\nArgument is often well it's been in place for so long this is what we've been doing up to this point that's really not a legal argument\nYou'll hear that if if they were to take this case if the if the let's just say this word fast tracked uh the the president issues the executive order it's challenging gets right up to the Supreme Court and ... and quick fashion or in the hearings you could you're going to talk you're going to hear the impact\nBut the impact remember is on would be on on on children that would be born to aliens and in in the future so it's not on it's not even the we're not even talking about the legal status of anyone who was born here up to this point\nTo a parents who were here illegally that's not going to apply that's not going there is not going to be any grandfather ring of\nA revoking the citizenship of someone who was born here up to this point it would be those children born in the future to illegal parents and that's who would apply to and there's a certain a behavior there\nThat this ... that is not immediately affected right uh we we often talk about the immediate effect like the travel ban\nWell you and I had to go back and scream toward temporary how many different times because the media was making it play out like we were shutting the doors for ever\nOr on people coming from certain parts of the world and and it was in you know again it was played out and it ended in a different in a different way out of the media but it's not going to it's not going to it wouldn't be the same in in consideration fear of what the impact\nIn a different in a different way the media but it's not going to it's not going to be it wouldn't be the same in in consideration fear of what the impact would be because the impact would be future\n... but I'm a I'm afraid what you're going to have is you're going to have judges look at this and say\nCongress has never challenged what they did in Nineteen fifty two they never said with Congress has never or there's never been a push to change the way in Congress the way that this law has been interpreted the only thing from the Supreme Court was the opinion that this was not a legal precedent\nThat was set that they believed it was an Eighteen Ninety eight and Congress has never fought that\nThere's never been a serious legal challenge it has been accepted that the interpretation has been there for a hundred and fifty years and you're going to have judges even construction is judges\nEven cabin on Gorsuch may look at it and say well there really hasn't been a fight over this the second amendment there's always been a fight over a fight going on constantly for that\nAnd constant president being set on that on birthright citizenship maybe not so much and they may look at it and say it's been this way for a hundred and fifty years it is a specific law about a specific type of behavior that we allow were gun rights could be every gun issue was a different issue in a different law in a different state\nAnd they might look at and say this is pretty clear that the interpretation\nWhether the author wanted or not but the interpretation taken an accepted by the country for a hundred and fifty years even if the author that was not what the author of the amendment thought it's been accepted all the way back not just recently that it should be changed the back in Nineteen Ninety eight that was their opinion of the Supreme Court\nAnd a lot of judges just don't want to touch it because they don't want to be the ones that change what they believe the country has come to a consensus of rightly or wrongly I'm just saying that's what\nThey would that's what I think where I think it's going to go ...\nAnd it's a shame because you know and these things will happen in in any uh you know any republic any constitutional republic where a law can be passed it will be vague and somebody will take an interpretation and it isn't challenged well\nAnd and that's that's what I Would say that the ... it doesn't matter what society it doesn't matter how new or old the challenges if it's a new challenge that's never it a new challenge means that no one has ever stepped up to travel\nI I agree I agree with you on that is why it took two hundred and Thirty years to get you know that guns are and you know you have an individual right to bear arms in this country\nYeah two hundred Ninety eight case would be different because you had parents who were here legally you didn't have the question of right what about the parents who aren't here\nRight legally but the opinion there was an opinion written which wasn't a precedent that ... made the claim that they are writing that after a court did which may be used and said okay that opinion was out there it's not legal precedent for but nobody ever ... challenge that and they were doing it at that time they were still allowing\nEven at that point you can be an illegal immigrant in this country and since it's been going on for ... it's not like it's stopped for a hundred years and then came back again magically\nMhm that's the problem right\nWell it hasn't been challenged ah so that's the question do we ignore it because it hasn't been challenged because nobody challenged it or not one sought to define that claws\nWell I I agree with you\nI don't fit or not one sought to define that claws well\nI I agree with you I Will leave without question you have\nSomebody on a ... a lot ah you when when you see that when if I was a judge and I'd say well look let me look at the original like looking at the federalist papers for the constitution you can't just look at the constitution and say well I'm gonna flip a coin\nAnd and see where it lands that's going to be my opinion you go back and you look at the first ... or the second amendment as many of the just as the justices did you say okay what's in the federalist papers what were the founding fathers thinking when it came to guns why did they want the second amendment what was it about and once you do that\nYou know that was the original intent and you\nKnow it it's it's easy to come to a decision I agree with you I think they should do that mhm because it isn't a it isn't a law that is written specifically there is no specific ... it it doesn't specify birthright citizenship\n\nIt doesn't state it's not this is what were you and I talked about before if it's clearly in there like in the second amendment [laughter] [laughter] but they still went back and look to do it it's not clearly in there mhm\nIt really does because the argument would be made then in this case coming from the other side\nWell if if [laughter] if\nYou need to maintain a

don't understand why some people are saying or client the birthright executive\nOrder provoked by Trump or the president is stupid because\n... voted clarify law ... my understanding why can't a president clarify what the actual author\nAnd the guy was talking about Jacob our intention in order to enforce the fact that the fourteenth amendment does not extend to bail ends or people vote for ... well\nThe the executive order does not necessarily a clarify the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment it may attempt to but then beyond that the court challenge ultimately if it got a SCOTUS it would be the job of ...\nTo interpret that would be the job of his ... it wouldn't be as job of his lawyers to defend it\nBut the secular border in a self uh is an executive order to change what the immigration\nA law is right now under birthright citizenship the explanation would be in the ... that his lawyers would give where he would try to make that point of clarify in the original author would be in the actual write\nIt down the actual court case so that could have branches interpretation of it is not the the final say now now and I have a very pointed out\nThe president could write the executive order and if there were no challenge\n[laughter] that's a fantasy but if there were no challenge than it would it would stand and it would be the law the land well yeah 'cause that was the question going on yesterday which I thought was a stupid question\nKind of president writing an executive order to change the law and and what did hold on well yeah sure he could write an executive order for him saying what type of mental ability challenges yeah then yeah but it's going to say there'll be an injunction\nAnd there'll be an injunction and the law will never ... could be a brilliant move by the president and or the attorneys or or the Justice Department\nMaybe some input her ideology here to say that\nYou know let's attempt to get this at at at least\nFor the president I I think it's it's a it's part of his his fight whether you want to put it just purely political or not it is part of the campaign promise from two thousand sixteen on controlling the borders and I think it's worthwhile fight and then we're with him on that on the spirit of it and thank you for the call but ultimately\nIt is going to be about uh you know getting it to the Supreme

exactly is the fact that\nWell he's not campaigning I could see if you're upset saying he's just campaigning for example when you've got Democrats\nWhen you when you when you got to Claire McCaskill tried to paint herself as a Republican fry just who happens to be running as a Democrat yes now that's something you should complain about because she's not telling you the truth right when you when you have now when you got many Democrats trying to portray themselves\nAs oh we're not part of those crazy Democrats on it I don't know where we're very very moderate they've gone back to that that you should be upset about when you campaign\nBut Trump as president this is what he's always campaigned on\nYou should be upset about when you campaign but Trump as president\nThis is what he's always campaigned on and one of the reasons one of the major reasons he's he got elected was illegal or immigration and immigration issues across the board so anything that he does well he's doing it just to\nAh just to the campaign before the midterms well on the caravan thing the only way you could make that point is if\nHe financed the caravan which I don't believe he did\nI I don't think so and therefore when this is happening he's doing what he believes he should do might help his campaign yeah but it's what he's always right on\nAnd if he's consistent in his opinion why would anybody it buddy be upset about it or call it strictly campaigning strictly campaigning is what the Democrats are doing trying to pretend they're Republicans ... right exactly that's a campaign in that you should be upset about\nScott animal companionship is one of the primary factors affecting our climate particularly in the United states where there are one hundred and sixty three million companion animals roughly one pet for every two Americans the highest number of any country in the world\nAdded to that I told you about an old old friend of mine who was saw here in the last month and\nWhen I last ask the question a few years ago how many cats and dogs do you have now she said seven cats and for dogs ... when I saw her recently I said\nHey how many catch you have now and she said well I have four dogs and said oh what I said what nine cats ten thirty three\nThirty three cats yes\nHer and her spouse actually put a extra room on the house so the cats can walk in and out to non heated room but that's where the cats can stay in congregate together well but thirty three that's three cases of cat food a day [laughter]\n[laughter] I I don't know it's it's bad name\nBut the study claims that human compulsion to seek out animal companionship is one of the primary factors affecting our climate by the way the two idiots overnight told you this was coming along time ago Jeff we'd go to this would be next\nResearchers at the University of Sydney in Australia claimed that those one hundred and sixty three million pads heavy detrimental impact on the environment from the food they consume too the waste that they produce\nIn the U.S there are more than one hundred and sixty three million dogs and cats that consume as a significant portion of their diet animal products and therefore potentially constitute a considerable dietary footprint\nThe study proclaims ... here the energy in animal derived product consumption of these pets in the United states is evaluated for the first time as are the environmental impacts from the animal products said to them including Finkel production\nThe problem isn't just the United states now\nOr the or just not the United states though the popularity of companion animals has grown worldwide Americans are the largest pet owners in the world I don't mean that means we're the fattest pet owners are we on more pets probably both\nBut tradition of pet ownership in the United states has considerable cost as pet ownership increases in some developing countries especially China and trends continue and pet food toward higher content and quality of meat globally\nPet ownership compound the environmental impacts of human dietary choices it continues\nThere's only one solution no more pets\n...\nReducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets that offer similar help that emotional benefits would considerably reduced those impact the study concludes\nOne of the things we're talking about is the fact getting rid of your dog and getting a rabbit because the dog eats meat and the rabbit ones or the or that jazz okay settles yes so so what do we do with the dog\nWe supposed to put the dog down or\nJust after this dog not get another one I never search for a cat ... I rescued one it rescued you let's be clear by the way you're not the only person that said that to me this week yeah I think we all know that\nAh [laughter] and the mango is a black cat\nBy the way you're not the only person that said that to me this week yeah I think we all know that\nAh [laughter] and a\nMango as a black cat just ... Halloween Halloween\nYou know the funny thing is ... I had I had a a bad few weeks ago and I had all the autumn stuff up already I had a a a smoke detector actually to smoke detector I thought it was a battery but smoke detector\nWent defective and it beeps after about ... oh yeah the toll is part of my house of course so I you know so it's like fourteen feet up but I got this incredible ladder widened base and everything else and\nSo I was like you know Tim Allen very excited to bring that ladder out and really test its capabilities right\nSo I get up there and realize okay this is in my I have a ... it's\nSort of an atrium it's my music studio ... where I got a little studio there piano all that stuff so but it's way up so I get up there take it off bring it down and realize it's not the battery so I order a new one on Amazon ... takes a couple of days so do I take down a ladder not leave the ladder believe it or leave it why take it out yeah so letters there for a couple of days\nAnd I noticed that the cat black cats keeps walking under the ladder\nFelt that if there's a lot so I figured it was all that stuff and I'm like ... should I be worried about yeah that's a good luck thoughts I never had before yeah uh but\nUh there's only one solution no more pets reducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets but offer similar helping emotional benefits would considerably reduced these impacts\nThe other choice researchers recommend is having your pets pets go vegetarian nope something that's not recommended by veterinarians are animal health and welfare experts concede that having some type of meat based protein is best\nFor your pets yes particular those for whose ancestors were carnivorous\nYeah I Can't get my cat to eat a carrot\nNo no\nI mean it's so uh are there you go the study of the researchers say isn't designed to dissuade animal lovers from taking in the maximum number of pets possible yeah it is yeah that's actually a point\nBut to encourage Americans to consume less meat so that's the point are it I see what they're saying keep your patch you go vegetarian\nI'm literally falling to stakes right now I'm going to you both of them today I might have to go by a third one just because this article is making me hungry for meat\n[noise]\nMy favorite one remember and this goes back ten years ago I think you and I ... the only been working together for a short time uh-huh remember the guy that came out that said that we need to get rid of all the cities in the United states right and we need to have cities no bigger than\nTwenty five thousand people ... and ... ... what was it was it over half of the people have to go\nYeah we don't want to go to I think was more than half we're gonna have to take them somewhere what do you do with him I don't know like we have to [laughter] what do you do with and who decides who goes and and I think it was one\nOf the of the probably the closing in at that time seven billion people we only have like one right so what do you do it to me\n[laughter] okay what's what's your plan I they are just going to be the weirdest lottery you guys ever heard of but here's how it works [laughter] are you committing suicide first yeah\nRight hey that'd be a cool psi phi movie right it's the end of the planet we're down to what ten years just some kind of doomsday whatever\nSuicide well it wouldn't be climate base 'cause that would just be well then you'd have Hollywood would never make a movie\nSay whatever climate suicide well it wouldn't be climate base because that would just be well then you'd have Hollywood would never make a movie where let's just say you know\nThe big chunks of ice just start falling out of the sky or that the water rises in Manhattan over a period of three hours and then freezes over the period of ten minutes that would just be a stupid movie\nOr it would be called the day after tomorrow um [laughter] so [laughter] that's not making about climate change this time and that whatever right\nBut if we could whittle it down to one billion people and then it would be over the ... you could make this a series over the period of years you know 'cause you got ten years or Fifteen Years to figure it out\nTo got to figure out how to deplete the population\n[laughter]\nI've ever met for [laughter] remember Star Trek did it remember how the the\nTwo forces are the two societies on the one planet right war with each other I and instead of going to war and they simply killed people on both sides okay we're going to kill a thousand people today you kill a thousand\nUm they like managed born then there was the other one remember all the people that were like plastered up against the wall hadn't the ... member that one yeah I don't they were they open the window and they're like all these faces on the wall like writing 'cause society had grown so much and I don't know how would they ever solve that problem yeah\nI don't remember that one of the one of the most interesting post apocalyptic type movies was children of men Clive Owen two thousand six uh haven't said was\nEssentially a the there was women could not give birth there was whatever happened in the apocalypse they no longer had the ability to give birth and then all the all of a sudden they came across this woman who was pregnant\nSo you had to they had to hide her because all governments would want\nYou know to a study this woman and then you know all of this and\nAnd they just wanted to protect her and her baby so she kind of went underground so they could protector but I mean that kinda gets into that area right of a population that basically is less than that not in in the crazy believe that the Democrats\nOr talking to the far out far left liberals are talking about\nAnd did in the past of depleting the population but just kind of a ... thing of okay there's only a billion we can only save a billion\nIssue of American tractor magazine to receive you're free to go to treasure dot
