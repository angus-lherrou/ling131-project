actually calling into a little story about my sister but ah I Want it to all of a you know on Facebook I've I've shutdown Facebook just because even if I had it with my friends and family only I still found\nIt is incredible what's going on out there and I I just uh you know ... cliched it is hard to even hear the story\nDon't don't give up maybe someday she'll come around uh she obviously got I'm fed yeah who generally and socialism in Europe and what's going on there if you ask most of your opinions I don't think many of them be happy with what's going on I don't know what she saw a but uh it's it's depressing hang in there my friend okay it'll it'll come around some time\nJust hang in there um I was just thinking of ah you know people are funny that way I worked at a at a station ... in uh Los Angeles as I said I don't want to say too much about it except for one of the hosts had a\n... we have this a gal on whose father was a famous I don't want to see what he did but it was it was pretty famous at us in this day\nAnd they didn't talk for a I don't know Twenty years or something and then um one day a host said to me you know mark a her father died and she didn't even know it\nAnd I had to tell her the news and she said a whole wow I never got a chance to say goodbye so they hadn't talked to her I think it was at least Twenty years and you think that\nFinally when he passed on but it was too late to say goodbye to him\nBecause she disowned him all those years for it ever personal reasons so one has to think that\nEventually you hope people come around before something serious happens and I always tell my students you can never tell someone you love enough that you love them because life is very short but when you hear the family stories a brother and sister daughter whenever that because of politics\nThey disown their parent or their brother who they know their whole life assuming there's nothing terrible going on in the relationship just over politics and you see that almost always on the on the left hand side\nVery discouraging but are brought up the topic because it does happen it is something that needs to be talked about like let's go to Amanda in Woodbridge, Virginia you're on with mark\nMarket's great to talk to you I'm I've been to a Republican and conservative my whole life and they went into the military right after high school and um it most of the people\nThat I met in the military where we care because they felt like the Republicans were the only one that would ever support\nA raise for you know the military pay that kind of you know just that okay well that's there for me and I'm\nSure that I'm not a time when I when I'm the first time you go for him about um\nI just remember listening to the radio and and just being like I Need to find someone that talking about this 'cause that's time I was driving a lot and and the spending a lot of time the car and you just want it to ... you know I found in therapy that radio and you\nKnow I haven't really talked about it with other people I tell people started asking me who you're going to vote for oh are you voting for them and it was like people started coming to me and pointing at me I wasn't I was pushing anything on them\nAnd five\nAnd when it came down to Trump it with like\nAnd pulling it out of me I wasn't I was pushing anything on them and\nUm and when it came down to trumpet with like for a lot of people around me it was the straw that broke the camel's back and they just walked away from their friends and relatives just stopping and my friend and I\nAnd they just how can you you know I used for someone who's\nJust you know terrible and I'm just like\nYou don't understand I get mad at Republicans for Twenty years for letting the media and the and the Democrats walk all over I mean this guy won't let anyone walk all over him\nAnd he's still a conservative say anything to make our country better and you know I still see people rallied against him and I'm just like wait a minute we're the greatest economy in that we in\nThe country's ever seen you know we have I mean do you see jobs for truck drivers or the five thousand dollar bonuses for someone who starts a job you know I mean\nFor construction jobs that are just they don't have enough people to do them and and you know these tech job that paid huge amount of money so it's like you know if you get the right degree you can get a great job if you if you don't have a degree you get to Dr driving a truck working construction and\nYou know everyone seems to be still upset and close the stand back and look at what's going on but you know I I had a friend telling me right to my face that I get so mad at you when I when I read the things you oppose that I just want to shoot you in the head and she laid a hand signal\nLegumes owning a gun at my cat and I I miss just so hurt by that and you know I I haven't talked to her and that was you know nine months ago and it just seems like a lot of my friends are just like what you know we can't be friends with demand that because she's like Donald Trump and I I just don't want to be around her anymore and\nIt it is hurtful and um yeah I had some time I just felt like I was the most hated person on the Internet because on top of all of this I'm a transgender woman so a lot of people in the right hated me for the trans up keep ... hated me because I like Donald Trump\nAnd you know my family a lot of people my family disliked me because I've transition and and also because I'm a Republican and then I have a chance to people that looked at me like how can you be a Republican if you're training she hates us and I'm just like not only does it you know and so it's like all these angles coming at me\nTelling me that I'm wrong for being so I Am and I don't think that anything worse than life people telling you they can't accept you for who you are\nAnd and it's it's just horrible well\nI feel your pain and I use the bill Clinton line but I can hear the sadness and you know my heart goes out to you know you can't imagine what you're going through a\nIt is it's tough enough of the challenges that the regular life holds for all of us let alone or when your friends or abandon you and maybe some family members to\nIt's pretty discouraging I think you need to find new friends you know people who at least will share your Republican views\nOr to begin with and I think you're going to find a not everyone but a lot more Republicans are tolerant despite the fact that we have this view that we're not tolerant people uh that you know we're racists bigots and home my phone is all this kinda stuff\nWhen we're not to just have to find the right people and and maybe it is that time to do that and maybe joined different organizations that maybe I ...\nI Know a volunteer work for a Jeff does I was running for Congress in my area against that Jerry Connelly and he\nStepped out of it is\nAnd work for a

there and there are other like minded people but you know in this world\nIf or when I ask people many good friends do you have in some people ... say non and some say one and some say to it's hard to find good people it's hard to find special people I just want you know you're not alone that way that we all have those kinds of challenges maybe not your particular challenges but we all have our own Lincoln I think that\nThere is someone I don't like I'll have to get to know them better\nUh it it's tough life is very challenging and and to be very stressful and it's hard hard enough now we have

do we ever win elections well I guess we're just finding the people that they won't talk to us and the friend is so we don't get you know the people on our side wouldn't do that so you don't know who they are let's go to well I don't know if we have time for one more call and wouldn't be that fair to you but I'll tell you this\n... is a new time in America and I got to admit it's discouraging when people get on the air and say I got to be careful what I say my neighbors ever knew my point of view if uh my uh friends ever really ... or the when they found out what my views were I was in big trouble\nI've been to a friend did I mean is this the McCarthy Era I remember McCarthy who is you know calling everybody communist and with whatever you thought of him it was unfortunately ruined a lot of careers\nIs that when it's come to an let me talk about myself you've probably heard me say this I Am a part time teacher and they don't know that I'm a talk show host let alone on national radio if they did they could figure out that I was probably a conservative talk show hosts are some liberals are most of them are not\nAmong many good you know what jeopardize being what what kind of America do we have in twenty eight teams when you can express your point of view that's what America was supposedly about All right let me know what you're saying but now you're national forecast for

left is already crazy and and so far out there let's see uh butch in Denver you're on with mark\nMark how're you doing well\nGood good hey I just wanted to follow up with something you would mentioned um Bruce Lee or a little while ago about a social media and the effect of it as having all the relationships friends family colleagues\nUm I've had experiences where I quit for his ... five years ago because I just couldn't take reading some of the things people were writing and you know it was opposing me but I thought I don't want to jump in here and\nAnd you know say something I'd like to regret or anything\nBut I Know people that don't even talk to me because it was revealed office work how I felt you know\nUh back when Obama was still president and it just I I think the damage social media has done it ... as far outweigh the good a with a lot of relationships you know\nI've started to go near the Russian first of all I got to say my older brother has never signed on in more than one way obviously and was always afraid about privacy issues and that kind of stuff he winds up being right or if\nAnd never signed on in more than one way obviously and was always afraid about privacy issues and that kinda stuff he winds up being right\nOr if I wasn't on the radio I probably wouldn't use faced with that much although I I got to be fair it is good you can reconnect with people when I was a teacher years ago they find me or you find out about someone's life is they just use it for that\nBut I've learned to like you said\nI've learned not to say much about politics and the ... when they know I'm a talk show host and if they know me already good luck they'll never leave your lawn it's their chance to you know trying to say all kinds of things that they can say if they can't get through on radio so people have no limitations there so I just about I got to control myself sometimes something against me so sad\nAnd I think I I'm going to comment on this but in general uh I Try to stay away from it I think the social media right\nAnd that does some good but the I like I said I don't even use Twitter hardly ever use Twitter anymore if I wasn't on the Rio there are a lot of things I wouldn't do including like I said Facebook\nSo I I think people should be cautious when the social media special we're finding out that they're you know so many things are hacked into finding out a lot of your information so I think in smart you said you have ... five years and I admire that\nTom in Port Angeles a Washington You're on was mark\nHello mark a a I Want to do a shout out to your Canadian color out she still listening I or I I listen to a lot of community radio up here where I'm at\nAnd she's right it was a it was pretty horrific the way that they you know all that up KBC CBS NBC or just regurgitate it everything\nThere is a bright spot and let the Canadians we're aware that the U.S electorate we're going to do it fast to not get the candidate that the media was trying to and us\nAnd that worked out in the end so all that horrific stuff that came off of a a ... and I'm a at a Charles Adler and uh and right and uh and and green a\nAll of that probably helped a jet Obama or get a Trump elected because it was kinda hurtful well we're coming down from Canada like that\nAnd uh but the reason I called was so we had already been told\nA for your Twenty years Thirty years that ah you know nobody was going to be able to fix the inner cities and you know the racial issues that we had to confront\nAnd a lot of people a lot of white people voted for President Obama and then when he got elected she ignored his mandate anywhere\nClear off on another Chang judge and things got worse so we were very very disappointed a you know the people that voted for the white people that voted for Obama will review review disappointed and it damaged the Democratic party for a long long time [noise] ...\nI think if they voted for him because they want to show they weren't prejudiced that was a mistake you know color should never be an issue but I'm sure some people did\nBut the fact is then he was a didn't disappoint me I knew he was I knew he was when he first came out I Am not to mention his personality in terms of dropping of billionaires and who's the rent revenue ... and ... you pretended that the you know they weren't as friends any more you can see who he is\nPersonality in terms of dropping a bill ... who is the rat Reverend Wright and pretended that the you know they weren't as friends any more you can see who he was\nYou get to know someone sometimes by a their character I admit people can pick on Trump that from the things he says and does so it's not foolproof but I knew he was far left he he really has got closer and closer to hide that for for half a second\nI'm no disappointment to me I I never expected much from him and that's what I'm saying the other side the left doesn't understand that we dislike him\nProbably as much as people dislike Trump all of them as a high bar I've got to admit that ah people who hate Trump really hate Trump let's go to Dave in gurney Illinois you're on with mark\nHey mark a I've got two observations and then a point to make um first of all you notice\nAll the calls that you have coming in [noise] it's always the liberals\nAnd Democrats that shut off the lines of cute communication when it comes to personal relationships that's well that's the observation and then also you had a caller who was touting that she was highly educated yeah she was highly educated but she was not\nHighly indoctrinated that was the problem with or liberal friends and then also when this country was founded almost two hundred and fifty years ago it was founded with the premise\nAnd the power of the individual not the state and isn't it funny how the left can sit there in cowed\nFor individual liberties but they don't like the founding of the country which specifically states that we have powers are as individuals and not not the state over us as individuals but they are fighting for their own demise\nWhen they fight against the founding of this country\nBoy you said that very very well and I by the way I don't I don't believe that the left believes in individual rights than their so far out there then you know they claim they're against fascism is example within ... but they're fascist themselves\nThen they you know when it's convenient there on the side of individual liberty but don't mistake that these people care about and what does this group think what does that group think\nOr they want more power for the federal government whereas we thinking as you said we want limited government and the government to stay out of our lives so I I don't think that's who they are although they pretend right to pretend to be the little guy and\nThey they care about my minorities and they cared about the basically for no they did they just care about getting in power and most of them many of them are really far left for the ...
