we we you know talked about the the the polls even for you know because we were getting the calls after Trump's victories and they said the polls were completely awful they weren't\nBecause the polls measured the popular vote not the electoral vote right and on the popular vote you had two or three that were dead on as to you know Hillary winning by what roughly two points I think it was ...\nAnd and so you know there are some polls that are that are dead on so people that say the polls are always wrong that is have wrong statement to make a lot of the polls are wrong and a lot of them the

both Democrats are trying to we use a lot of that in every well [laughter] it's it's not a quarter law it was a political court where people were put under oath and people were put under old under

and they just made it clear during the cabinet hearings we don't care we point out in a very passionate way as you can see I get passionate about this because I think it's very important to point out\nThat people say well you know it's it's offensive if you tell somebody they're not paid for it because they believe there are a patriot well know there are some standards of why you are a patriot there are some standards of why you are an American\nThey believe there are a patriot well know there are some standards\nOf why you are a patriot there are some standards of why you are an American I

you if you reject\nThe second amendment if you reject\nA due process under the law if you were jak the electoral college if you reject this that and and you wish to change all of it then you don't

you believe in America or just against the basic tenants of the constitution of the United states mhm well that's what America is\nYes that's that's it bomb you and\nWhat they're trying to say is a well it's like when they say no we believe in free speech will know you don't it's your side that says that if I use the the the wrong pronoun in California that there's a penalty ultimately of going to jail\nThat free speech oh no no no see your free speech as bigoted your freedom of religion as bigoted\nAnd and so no we we believe me we believe in negative you know this isn't about the fact that you know that you need to that you need not to point out in a very blunt manner [laughter] what the opposition is for and what they really stand for\nAnd the fact that you you know you can point out and you can tell people this is what's wrong with them\nAnd you can probably say yes this is negative campaigning because what they're doing is negative to this country mhm because they don't believe

so if you look at the big picture up there or the\nDemocrats that hate Trump now could they hate him any more\nThan they did or\nThe day before election day in twenty sixteen my answer would be yes because they did afterwards everything that went on for the you know the next year and a half\nDo they today is he is the\nAnger ... still there to motivate\nThe Democrats\nTo get out because remember there really is you know we talked about\nThis this president is up I every president just unique and every Republican president we forget because people will say nobody has ever been attacked like Donald Trump\nBefore we forget that Bush was called not see the only thing is a difference between a Bush and de Donald Trump is pushing never fought back so if you\nFight back then the rhetoric coming back and she was going to increase mhm but the rhetoric was still there was just as bad if you're\n... ... ... remember the protests doubted his ranch in Texas yeah in central Texas ... it was everything they were hanging I'm an effigy they read everything he was Hitler he was a ... and as Bill Maher said well\nYeah ah we called Bush and the and Romney and all those years\nThen he was Hitler he was a ... and as Bill Maher said well yeah we called Bush and the and Romney and all those you know yeah we called them Hitler but they really weren't but Trump is ... and they just move on and then there will be the next\nRepublican president that gets in and whether they decide to fight back whenever that is whether that's a wonderful wonderful Republican actually named Hitler runs one day ... like [laughter]\nIt really is it's it's totally unprecedented and it tells you where we were as a nation this is why I think we can't underestimate you know the the silent majority or whatever you want to call I don't think you can call this race and say\nYou know ... the houses definitely go to will go to the Democrats I don't make productions but there's this is this is anything but a normal election year because twenty sixteen wasn't and we've ramped it up ... and and the thing is as I mentioned\nEarlier the danger of Trump's exhaustion was that blown out of the water because of capital right right and is it is as it is it's not ...\nExhaustion was blown out of the water because of capital right right\nAnd is it is as it is it's not ... fire right on that I like how energize

Berkeley tennis I'm not on healthcare but on the border control\nThey would say no people should be able to come and go as they please\nBecause if I'm wrong well then the left needs to call me out on it and this was the other thing I Would I Would start doing that on debate stage I Would start doing that if you're the president if I'm if I'm the president go out there in and say that every route\nThey want they're promoting\nPeople being able to come and go as they please in and out of this country as they please say that over and over again and have the media fact check it for you\n\nBecause then you're going to need in order to fact check it you're going to need statements by people who are running for office or already in office on the left\n... ... ... and and this device I'd give the president as Mr President people already know what you think mhm forget about what have you ever you ever ordered writes everybody's asking you about the reporters continual ask you what you think\nYou've got to turn it around yes what America needs to know is not what you think that illegal immigration\nOr American things on illegal immigration you need to get an answer out of Democrats as to what they think so win or lose it's still going to be an issue or ... I mean what are lose the house into a ... it's still going to be an issue\nTake it to the Democrats mhm they force you to come clean about what you think should be done about illegal immigration you better come clean you've talked about it how many hundreds of times\nAnd the press is that you asked you questions over and over again or ten years really into the\nYou've had to come clean you've talked about it how many hundreds of times and the prices that you asked you questions over and over again or ten years really into the major discussion on really since I'm\nA Kennedy McCain yeah yeah since early ... when William was that was that two thousand eight two thousand no no no it was before ... it was two thousand gosh to know that was ...\nIt was before you came on board now is well we're doing the show became Kennedy was yeah we were in Arlington studios okay yeah I'll look it up [laughter] yeah I kept calling it scam nasty\nUm yes it was because it was two thousand eight\nIt was two thousand dollars was it was introduced in two thousand in May of two thousand five right before I started here okay is one of our personnel and and then then it would have been the following year or maybe later that year when it\nAfter it went away that McCain had to go to the um\nUh the uh he was at the conservative are convinced you and then and had to essentially they said he apologized or he had his mayor culpa but he didn't really you just said that uh he realized that the rest of America was not on board with\nA and it fell short of a ... eleven days after I started working with you so it's one of the first topics that you and I gather together on the air and that's why I say because I ... I was out here I was so low\nI remember going weeks on that and uh and I was so low and I was and so the the but this has been going on for a long long time if you think about it and I almost did this yesterday and talking about this\nMcCain Kennedy to day\nMight have a better chance than it did back then oh yeah given the makeup on on Capitol Hill that we have right now if you introduce that now I don't know if that's the case with this current president because I don't know that you would have the uh\nUh the the somebody on the left that would jump on board but I I think there was a much better chance that you would have support for it not from conservative so much but I think because of the makeup on Capitol Hill and there are fewer conservatives at least ... Kavanaugh [laughter]\nAnd then you you might have a more support for it but the problem is is that no one's asking them what they what they're trying to promote it\nBut but it's been over Thirteen Years that this has been a huge issue ... huge issue because that's really what kick started this whole thing over and so it's been Thirteen Years and still the Democrats the Republicans are not or the media have not been able to get the Democrats to admit this is the Democrat leadership and the Democrats in power in the party to admit\nThat they want open borders and that's what they want and if they don't want it then\nTell the American people what you will do what level of border enforcement will you passed as a piece of legislation and promised the American public you will uphold\nRight that's a fair question to ask\nAre you for open borders right just bluntly asked\nThat question and if the answer is well no then what level of enforcement\nBut think about Thirteen Years and you haven't been able to back a Democrat a major Democrat into the corner to make them either sweat or answer that question and then keep pounding them on that question as the opposition party over and over and over again\nBecause we need to know do they actually want comprehensive immigration reform of border enforced\nAnd over and over again because we need to know do they actually want comprehensive immigration reform or border enforcement or do they want to open borders we can come to any type of compromise or we don't know what they want right and do it and get it on eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\n[noise] ...

[noise]\nMy radio he is currently and I'm Gary magnified six six Ninety run I just reading here from CBS News out now this this is fake want to hear fake news yeah\nThis is this this this is what's wrong with the media today but they got the headline right but the first paragraph huh one winning ticket was apparently sold for the world record one point six million a\nMega millions China oh no no no\nNot a million and no ... and they had to write in the headline the headline was ride mega millions on record one point six billion dollar jackpot one apparent winning tickets in South Carolina\nAnd they had it right in the headline the headline was ride mega millions will record one point six billion dollar jackpot one apparent winning tickets in South Carolina Lindsey Graham has resigned apparently friend that started after winning out just [laughter] that would\nBe so funny if it were if it were him yeah uh well congratulations what does that person going to a group of people going through right now if they know you talk about freak out mode there there's someone wrote the story again you know because they\nThey did the series on a on a table rubble stories of people winning the lottery and just ended horribly\n'em and someone did the story here's why you know it would be a here's why it's a good thing if you don't win and they pointed out those cases that was a that were in those specials\nA you know people just I just well first of all do you can't tell anyone you tell you and your family word gets out even if you don't go public\nWhen our state first got the uh the lottery um and it was I think it was either I was six or seven million dollars and they want\nAnd but the they didn't keep quiet about it and the phone started ringing before cell phones are off the wall\nAnd they disconnected their phone the next day and left and you know because it it I'm sure it became crazy with relatives you didn't know you had and the whole thing\nUm and and that's\nThe real you know that's the real risk of it because\nThat's like we said the psychology is different because people look at it as well you didn't earn that money and it's a jealousy thing\nAnd they were trying to win the money and their little dream in their mind of them winning the money and you got it and you're there relative well wait a minute I Want or or just somebody that that you know and sometimes it's not not even people view you know\nSome of those stories about the just the you know and then God Bless all the non profits but\nNonprofits non stop knocking at your door you know and you want to give back I'm sure most people would but you can you can give you know I mean you could pretty much give all of that away if you fulfilled every request there would've been\nMuch more time and when I was younger me winning the lottery these days would be like what a hassle\n[laughter] well I Would say it'll it'll take a lot about it would change my life too much I I thought about that kind of money because after taxes uh it's going to\nBe somewhere around what five if you want it the one time payout it's somewhere around the third or thirty five percent you know of the overall price so one point six billion so pair that down to about a ... you know somewhere around five hundred and fifty sixty or or six hundred million dollars\nThat's a ton of money you're richer than Mitt Romney already\nYou went to bed poorer than than a Joe Biden and you woke up richer [laughter]\n\nYou know the story always goes there was one of the least rich guys and the Senate\nUm and and you woke up richer than a middle and end the whole thing is is that\nYou you ... what do you do\nI've always said like those really expensive cars really expensive sports cars you know if if I were you know the billionaire and I had that kind of money but still knowing myself where in the world would I drive that car I wouldn't be able to stop\nAnd park it anywhere you know what I mean I mean where\nAre you going to take that ... I wouldn't mind taking it out to Eddie gossip just plays the Texas ... anyway and putting it on the track a couple of times but I mean what are you going to do with the money I'm at the point is is that I Would be so paranoid all the time\nWith six hundred I mean instantly having six hundred million in the back it would it would a ... then there's the bit disturbed there's yeah there's nothing I'm I'm not saying I wouldn't want you know I [laughter] and I and obviously it would it would be a huge hassle mhm\nUh I like my life mhm I don't want to change mhm\nAnd I and I don't care what anybody says that kinda money changes your life I have a or that it changes the reaction that everybody has towards ... what is your life I have\nA a friend who a friend or family member who are ... at one time was working for a a multibillion\nUm and it is you know how we talk about the president fleets\nWell at one time was working for a a multibillion um and it is you know how we talk about the president sleeps four hours a day mhm and my family member told me that this person was the exact same way\nOnly because there's not enough time of the day we're talking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day\nAnd how my schedule was very busy [laughter] not a multi billionaire although ... at least one listener things we are um but but the point was is there's so much going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money\nUm but but still you've got so much going on managing your wealth is more than ... and I also have a fulltime job yes\nUh you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else to\nDo I couldn't trust anyone else to do that that would be the thing because you know people ... what would you do and I said ... I don't know I probably would I'd want to distance myself from the money and ... set up some kind of foundation mhm you know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kinda money you're not going to be able to keep your name private\nSo this ... it would be it would be hard to manage you can you can do that legally and in terms of you know claiming the prize\nBut\nIf you've got that kind of it's six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars someone's gonna notice eventually\nYeah exactly the the word your life your life is going to change managing the money because of a sudden you know I'd probably want to come up with some type of what I Would do I don't even know what the foundation but that means you've got to run the foundation so this jobs gone well I don't want to run my in laws there are laws about\nRaising the money away their laws about giving money to your it let's just say you wanted to take it you claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members well there are tax laws if you just write them a check and you got to pay the gift tax the giver has to pay the gift\nRight well my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job figuring out what to do even if you're not going to give it away that's what I'm going to be a full time job is going to be a huge hassle yeah and it's like oh this life I have is gone well I liked his life five right now it's like I said if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going yeah\nAll right let's play out of a less of a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older and like my like when I'm doing yeah I don't want to change my life I like my life\nWell yeah but you're you're not as secure as you could be well that's part of why I like my life yeah I I don't do I get to do challenging I get to do challenging things and I you know I I like everything that I get to do and so I'm\nI'm not saying that there wouldn't be a part of me that wouldn't be greatly excited about that mhm oh yeah no I don't know what I Would want to you know I think about it here's one of the worst one thing I think about the fact that this is one done thought that goes through a mind but it's still a thought oh we're talking about is is that if I Want one point six billion mhm\nBecause every day I mean I ... the average person out there and I still consider myself sort of average I don't you and I think alike it's not like we don't even think we're on the radio we do a radio job but it's like no it's just like any other title oh we've we've ever done ... really I mean it's not I never think that\nOutside of being and doing this I never really think I'm On the radio some when somebody comes up until today\nA little shocked we work in an older warehouse for those that don't know where you're I mean we really ... it's almost like we've come to work in a warehouse where the end of the show we grab our lunch pills and go on to it that's what the feeling is is like that in the last time I work third shift this is the only time I work third shift outside of being a machine\nSales and go home to ... that's what the feeling is is like that in the last time I work third shift this is the only time I work third shift\nOutside of being a machinist and so the mentality sort of the same for it so I but the the the thought and and so there are still you know challenges that I think of every day and what to do here and there and you know a a just and financial decisions and everything else that become a part of your life everything that you're doing in your business\nAnd personal life you've one point six billion all that goes away and always think to myself I don't know if I Want to get to the point where the only thing\nThat now is it in my way because I bought him one point six billion the only thing I'm thinking about his death [laughter] right then I got all these other things but I can think about it basically keep that the thinking of debt at a distance well all those challenges and problems are taken away and all of a sudden I'm going\nTo get all this money death [laughter] I was a you know I talked to one time about this uh there\nWas a a guy and I I'm I'm blanking out on his name but he ... he developed a game and he sold it ah I I I don't know I'll I'll have to look it up but anyway the guys told his game or the company that you know that surrounded the game\nFor two billion dollars and his take of that was a you know roughly\nLike one point eight so he became a billionaire you know overnight I obviously he was earning before that but then\nHe talked about one night he went on it wasn't a ranch just a series of tweets and he was talking about it was that this party and it was the first time I was in a room with other billionaires and I was talking to people that I had nothing in common with\nBut I did but then I talked to this girl who was there and she wasn't a billionaire so we talked to one girl who was a billionaire he's a single guy\nAnd he had nothing in common with her but here's the problem he talked with a girl who you know worked you know for a living had a job and was not a billionaire far from it he had nothing in common with her and it was ... I'm not trying to cry I'm just\nYou know I'm not I'm just saying it's a weird odd place to be in\nBecause I'm ... you know I'm not from money\nI'm new money but I don't fit in with these people and I don't fit in now with the people because you don't know what the motive is here's a here's the problem with being famously wealth or like the the the person in my family member\nWorks for you've got to put up I mean your security surrounding you all the time yeah that's the your famously wealthy so you have security detail we talked about this with the president the president has ... security detail that\nDid you know the studies have shown that almost two and a half million truck drivers in the U.S have one or more serious health problems such as obesity diabetes heart disease even sleep disorders and our truck drivers lack the same access to health that other Americans enjoy\nThe unfortunate result of these circumstances is that drivers are often unable to get treatment in the early stages of disease\nMinor illnesses become severe leading to hospitalization and disability the driver then may lose their CDL and become unable to work this creates a downward spiral that leads to
