right now when you think of ten years ago mhm\nWhen Obama was running for president ... wasn't it right about now right around this was in October remember he held it would've been no would have been the convention where\nYour conviction what our ... when he was at the stadium the football stadium in in in Denver and they had like ... it looked like\nHe was a you know the the the entire stage it was set up with these ... and everything else where he looked like like some Greek forum yes yes mhm and ... and people going crazy and and remembering his first term Evan Thomas from\nNewsweek at the time he's God blight yeah\nHe's he's a ... you'd always post partisan he's God like heath hovers over the rest of us he's the smartest person in the world to now ten years later\nOne of the

point because here's the thing is that\nAesthetic ally in inside the state it doesn't work but a work has no problem taking money from outside the state from the liberals you know who have been pouring money into the state or well into his coffers in order to be Ted Cruz than an effort to be Ted Cruz\nUm you know so you know he wants the liberal basically the liberals to are you guys stay outside of Texas\nLook we've got our liberal places in in Texas now there are plenty of the districts that are blue and counties that are blue including the county we broadcast\nFrom yeah but but here the the point is though the point is not who he would have\nGotten in addition if he would have got Obama ... but the fact is he knew he could reject Obama publicly yet but then the lines of an ongoing ideas into us core yeah doesn't care yeah Obama means nothing to know and you\nKnow that's that's exactly what I'm what I'm getting too\nIs that it does nothing for them and it only irritates someone who might be in the middle and tied right I mean it's it only works against that middle which might get you over the it actually\nIs the only thing that in this case especially that's going to get you over the top for the win but he knows by essentially denouncing\nAnd saying you know turning down the Obama endorsement that\nIt does not hurt his base right they don't care right we do a\nWhole because Obama's yesterday's news well\nListen I mean I'm liar Lanny Davis remember he was going to be the hero\nYou know so he was the hero with them over the point is and not the Lanny Davis is is a rock Obama but the point is is that there is a new hero for different reasons every day on the left and by the way that you're always going to be the demon tomorrow that's the way it works because you could be someone who is a fellow victim\nOf whatever right now but tomorrow you're going to be the oppressor this the person standing next to you will have a new reason to victim and will need a new oppressor and it's going to be\nYou here's here's but my my uh again I could be wrong but here's my here's my God\nThat liberal Democrats the ones that would vote for you know a better work here in the state of Texas right\nLook at I Can't believe it or to use the word they look at Obama and say he was a poster right he really said he was going to do all this stuff and he didn't do a damn thing right he just sat up there and he like being president but he really didn't believe and didn't push the leftist causes\nThat we believed in that he went from God to light to pose or in ten years\nOr by the beginning of his his\nInauguration to the end of his term as president of the United states that is how the modern day liberal looks at him\nThey look at him and they just say wow\nOkay also ate him anymore he's not to think about this is all Obama is not a president like him because you and I talked about is that you know by the by the time we got to the terms\nThat Obama would be the leader we ... also predicted it but I thought there was a great chance that Obama because there was nobody else in Feinstein you know or or or pillows she's getting old and you know Schumer is to New York and so it would still be Obama that would be the leader for a while of the Democratic party he's nothing anymore\nNow going back to the the tragic night here in Dallas in July or twenty sixteen when five police officers were killed by Michael Johnson and the hours that led up to that horrific night it was just a few a couple of hours before it started\nI was online uh I follow the local media on Facebook and one of the local TV stations was live Facebooking\nThe protestors because it was a protest march and was peaceful up until that point of course but\nThey were talking to the leaders of the protest associated with a there were a couple of different groups that were represented there are including black lives matter but the leaders of the protest the ones who were speaking\nThis was about six forty five PM in the ... that was the reason that the television station was life Facebooking this because there are broadcast the six PM broadcast news broadcasts was over so they went to live Facebook\nSo I'm watching it the thing I remember the most\nIs them saying what does Obama done for us to remember this was began or yeah twenty six ten months before the twenty sixteen election July twenty sixteen waters Hillary done for us nothing what did Obama do for us\nNothing and I thought to myself you know there because that was one of those\nUh cracks in the foundation if you will of the left although it had started happening before that for me\nIt was telling because you had young activists\nAnd the two that were speaking were African American was Obama done for us was Hillary done for us the left or the Democrats the Democratic party thinking they're going to get the when you don't get the win just because\nThey may agree with you at the moment\nThe protestors are carrying the party the party doesn't have direction because there's no one single cause no it's melting irrational right and it and it it always will be that's why the party has no direct line by right now that's what you get with identity\nPolitics yeah because there is no there is no there and I edited there is there is no general issue or goal\nThe issue or goal ... goal that they actually want because when you split everybody get when you when you continue to expand your pie of victims and therefore expand your pie of oppressors\nYou end up never being able to as a party having a particular political goal this is probably the closest you'll get to a political goal which is to defeat Kavanaugh yes if the\nActivists are are are going in multiple directions ... then then the party has led by them they're going to try and there was every direction and they have no direction at all except for abortion\nWrapping right now unite the Democrats right eight six six Ninety
