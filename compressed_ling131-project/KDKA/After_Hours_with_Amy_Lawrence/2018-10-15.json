what's happening let's go to a how 'bout that Curtis in Graham North Carolina Curtis you're on with mark\n[laughter] Hi [noise] okay [noise] well [noise] um [noise] I\nKind of agree with what that last caller saying about uh the much rhinos I'm destroying their base I'll tell you what though your civil war is actually the first civil war has been going on and says before the constitution even started even happened like you\nAre a headache for first about slavery and then [noise] when are still civil war got hot [noise] and they ended up losing them of course they were angry they set up the\nKKK and they've been all about inflaming all the people now and they were going to be the master's hand that's pretty much how they [noise] you don't have one benefit at a time until we're totally dependent and were so stupid will take the money and give up our freedom now [noise]\nIs there anything we can do about this will take a look at what John ... where are you familiar with this

happened before and then late fall again and he talks about the stages that go through up [noise] um I'm conquerors\nAnd then pioneers in the age of of commerce and the flu and stand up in ...\nYeah well you're right in the sense that in Rome and other empires and let alone countries countries come and go empires come and go you got to defend it you gotta fight hard for it and that's part of my message tonight\nIf you don't get out there and vote we're going to be in trouble let's go to Fred in Tallahassee, Florida Fred you're on with mark\nMark how are you for it real well how are you doing I'm doing good yeah the uh\nThe civility in our territory since the Obama administration has is known to pot oh\nNo he was big into why not go in and I started voting\nMob mob the first president I got a full load for unfortunately got impeach but and that was a real does spoil the\nOh my dad was a staunch conservative but him and law Giles was good buddies who wanted to go there and done all\nKinds of stuff ... you know you might be a different party and I have a few different ideas but you got alone and you know you can have a conversation without it turning into a ... it's not about politics and\nThat are expecting one thing and then they go vote and they don't they voted for kids you know growing up everybody's always like okay you're voted good account but it doesn't really count if you're not voting for something you don't really understand stuff\nThat's really all I Want it to me or now just to make sure everybody knows it be\nYou go in and sounds like you to go but I I'll say everybody else out there\nThe fact is I'm not one of those people that wants to make it easier for people to vote I think if you don't know enough about what's going on and you don't care enough to go out of your way the vote I have a feeling you're not one of my voters that you're going to do it based on emotions and feelings which is what the other side is anyway to begin with\nAs opposed to as our caller just said\nA knowing the facts and and knowing the issues and that's what can you don't have to agree with me but at least go in there and don't do based on emotion you you hate President Trump so much or he he's a man and you know we don't want to listen and so you're the woman I remember that was years ago maybe it is again\nThe vote for him because they don't share your philosophy or your principles of course there's another issue\nWhich is as a teacher part time teacher I can tell you this most students don't know our point of view what I often use is the minimum wage laws they'll say of course I Want my re uh want to get a raise or what do they call it also not just minimum wage livable wage I Love that one like it's a job of a business this may sound heartless\nA job of a business to give you a livable wage you know it's not\nIt's a job I teach economics java business to make a profit if they don't make a profit they won't be known you won't have any work or they won't hire you or the lay you off\nWell the lay you off when they won't hire your friends that have the job of a business they give you a livable wage and it's not the job of governments to decide what wage to give you\nThat's what the Soviet Union did not switch communism is that's what's socialism is and as most young people they've never heard the other side where does money come from I said that for years people do not know including adults not just young people young adults\nThat the government has no money to tone it just takes in ... from some group of people in the form of taxes and give it gives it the others when students here the snake I never heard that I never heard that before\nThe conservatives couldn't win it's a harder thing to explain\nA than just being emotional and say you know whatever livable wage pro choice global warming of course it changed the climate change when it gets very cold just see these catchy things they left and the Democrats are much better at that than conservatives are takes a while to explain\nWhy they shouldn't be a minimum wage if there is you you just can't raise that arbitrarily the government should do with some bureaucrats and do it\nIt takes a long time to explain capitalism why that's the best system ever created so far\nThis is tough to be on on our side it it takes a while and if you have a meeting against her oh good luck it's a wonder we win any elections is one of the President Trump won with all the things that against\nA and let's go to David in Greenwich uh let's see where that is in rented to New Jersey and sounds like\nHigh a David\nGood morning thanks for taking my phone call um I I guess mine are six quick points on that you know President Trump has hated for what he says\nAnd and I get it it's not for what he'd guys you know let's not forget in this country that on President Obama came in I didn't vote for him but I like them as charismatic the money in this country and you should know this uh from as you're teaching the money in this country dried up and it went back up on the shelf\nIronically it comes right back out again President Trump cannot force corporations to invest money or make things happen I mean he's a businessman he's a wheel or India or so he's hated for what he said\nNot what he died second I think the people in this country should understand that both the Democratic and Republican Party are are corporations\nJust like if you want to I wanted to start our own red eye radio corporation political party we could do it too so when they take it so personally\nThinking this is us and this is that it's not an us and them to corporations and the you know that's that's how I lift it myself again I think to vote in this country you should have to pass a fifty question test and at least get a Seventy five\nSo you know how to vote why you're voting where you're voting what parties coming\nAt it as far as the civil war in this country at a friend of mine told me when I Lived in South Carolina once I mentioned the civil war and he says it wasn't the civil war it was a war of northern aggression because there was nothing ... well we are in the ... civil war right now and with regards to this next election I Can't see\nIt not getting more ugly than it was I personally predict there's going to be a red wave\nCome along this time in Congress and that's because of the Kavanaugh hearings themselves a and you know I'm I'm just match the question it's it's a it's a screw in question but if somebody turned around tomorrow and said I don't mean Bob the bus drivers are taking the bathroom break at a fast food restaurant and he says\nMr Schumer Mr or or ... or or a list or selling so expose themselves to be in the bathroom do they get a hearing from that do they not get a hearing I\nMean isn't that ridiculous I understand what happened with the cabinet\nThen what happened with the cabin on air and but uh this country's out of control but doesn't straighten out a there could be a civil war where the national guard protect our borders and if nothing else anyone living at listening out there or should understand that\nYou know there are countries out there that are that are against us that don't like us and they want to sit down and they want us down in the dirt and this is going back fifty years and a hundred years we leave our guard down and we start carrying Marshalls apart internally\nSomeone's going to make a move on us trend I appreciate you taking my culture\nAbsolutely no the you know you're pretty articulate about it the only I don't agree with you for sure is a I don't I don't want to give a test to see because uh just because you're going to answer questions I guess your test would include questions about government and so on\nBecause I've seen very bright people who don't have wisdom just because I have a master's ... of a doctor but I Know people doctors at just because they have a degree\nDoesn't make them very wise\nSo I don't think I Want to test for voting\nI Do want to make sure we had a caller about the integrity of the voting system that isn't real big trouble\nBut I certainly don't want to test for voting but I I I Know I certainly won't don't want to make it easier like you can a motor voting rights you can or voting the day of the election things you know or or voting even three months before things happen right that was a problem in Florida I think you know where\nWhere people had voted and they didn't get to see what happened the next few weeks\nI Want to be a reasonable effort I don't want to go out of my way to make a difficult\nBut there are people who die I remember in El Salvador they saw it on line and they were bullets being shot at them obviously and bloody some of them to vote and then they held up I don't know ... I Can't even think what color was the ... whenever they were using to signify that they voted\nWe we don't take that seriously enough so I don't want to make it easy for the people here he sounds like I'm contradict myself to make it easier the people on a reform to vote the\nSame token you can of voting and of course a test of course that was has a bad history in terms of the south\nTerms of trying to keep the blacks from voting and others so that that's not my idea or not you know but I certainly don't want to make it so easy that they go through the DMV and vote well go to the DMV the department of eagles that's\nThat's a chore too so yeah I've got a story later weekly here at\nThe Generation Z I'm giving away they're not voting because the this is great they got their ballots I guess maybe ... through the Internet or whatever but they don't know where to get postage stamps that's that's the true story they don't kind of get postage stamps\nAnd I bet you there on the other side so maybe there was something to be on the caller was talking about let's go to John in Denver, Colorado John you're on with mark\n[noise] hey mark [noise] ah I don't agree that the American civil war the vast majority of Americans today first syllable upstanding people were very where I live\nIn the region Trump got elected stated that the American public are disappointed I mean a a legislator\nA what got elected because he was an outsider and the because he's a businessman and then the money that his business\n[noise] he's very uh food and he knows when he's in a bad deal and he [noise] I think what a great job with foreign policy I I I really admired him that he puts the mirror\nThat he puts the ... the first a lot of recognizing the international court systems up when you get the influences in our world\nA like a little bit not either do to reverse they ... they're still powerful and wealthy and ethnic group they can they want to control the world they don't want to talk of the country they don't want them there they don't want a constitution\nThey slowly are currently in a way of life as a fringe no pledge of allegiance and across\nThe girls are invaded in ... that's ... ... you know tolerance is uh what else a\nWould you prefer to read wrote king on your smartphone will scroll down version is also available at road king dot com simply click on view digital version or current issue\nTo listen on your smartphone or Bluetooth connected headset or speakers just activate by clicking on the speaker I gone for any story and voila just start list\nListening wrote ... dot com era currently here for the St Christopher truckers relief fund if you could help a truck driver get back to work make their pile of bills less daunting give them one less worry wouldn't you every year thousands of truckers lose their jobs homes and more when a medical problem causes financial hardships but\nWith your donation to the same Christopher truckers relief fund you can help get them and their families back on the road donate today at truckers fun data work that's truckers funded dot org give today at truckers fund dot org [noise]\n... from a studio [laughter] [noise] hey this where\nThe CBS News on the hour sponsored by the recruiter\n...

you that well we've been doing the last couple of hours [noise] we've been trying to talk about the civil war between the left and the right and that's what I think has been occurring here for the last couple of years that I think it's the second civil\nWar and you've been reacting to that on line I mean a through your calls\nBut first of all let's get it straight if you don't already know what the left liberals Democrats whatever you want to call them will do anything and everything to when they have no limits and they have no guard rails as to what is acceptable this isn't even\nThe era of Ronald Reagan where he can be friends with ... speaker Tip O'Neill I mentioned this last hour and have a drink with him at night\nAnd President Reagan will ask what had happened with all the vitriol during the day and the ... Neal way was the speaker of the house at the time you said that for daytime does that night we're way past that and you saw Senator Graham talking about that that these were his friends\nThat he he was saying all those things about because of what they've done their search for\nPower and oh yeah\nProbably now you can't even have a drink at night because look what it may have done to judge Kevin uh\nIt has become an all out war anything as I said and everything goes now lying as commonplace as with when I mentioned this with Harry Reid claiming Romney didn't pay any taxes someone as friends or someone told them that wasn't true and he was a cold on that he said well it would work didn't it\nBy the way she her own and has suggested Kevin I did not deserve did you catch this he did not deserve due process because of his outcomes driven conservative legal philosophy\nThat is very clear again if you're on the right you don't deserve the process of being a a a proven guilty just the accusation is not so she may not have been politically motivated forward but you used her you and your masters in deception used her\nThis is all just crazy and I I Love what Graham said he's going to get to the bottom of it suggesting that someone then Feinstein's officer wanna Ford's attorneys may have been responsible for strategically delaying the league deploying to lead to harm Kavanaugh's chances\nAre it's just amazing as he said those actually Senator Hatch so this the goalpost moving never stops\nAnd here's my summation and then we'll take your calls the only force is the way you and your cronies conducted the circus\nAnd maybe the ... to cross the ACLU the American civil liberties union yeah right they chimed in because they too are left to screw up before they our civil liberties group and so they came out against his nomination and I quote\nAnd he said he was born and records deeply concerned about allegations raised in recent weeks has made a rare exception to his longstanding policy and voted to oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh they passed a resolution stating they oppose the confirmation of judge Kevin of the Supreme Court there aren't credible allegations\nThis is the ACLU allegations that judge Kevin O's engage the serious misconduct you mean like Bill Clinton did you see anything then that have not fanatical investigated by the Senate what would it be advocates adequate seven FBI checks eight nine what does it Dr Ford's credible testimony subsequent allegations of sexual misconduct\nYou mean the great thing that even the times wouldn't publish the an adequate investigation maybe they can investigate better and judge Kavanaugh's testament to the leaders of the doubt about it is a fitness to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court\nAnd this is not a decision take lightly we cannot remain silent under these extraordinary circumstances about a lifetime appointment of hardest core to the land I'm trying to shorten it the standards for such an appointment on the burden is on the nominee the burden on the nominee to prove that something that happened how exactly does one do that\nThe burden is not met as long as they're unresolved questions regarding the credible allegations of sexual assaults assault get it on resolved allegations so if they can never resolve it which they can't because there is no cooperation than while I can never be confirmed\nAnd it goes on and on I I don't want to make your two depressed but there it is again based\nThere does again based on allegations I Want to know I just want to know where in the past the ACLU watching someone convicted because of allegations\nBut this is what the Democrats and the left have no soul there is no place to go with all of this except down on the other and the loss of a piece of American tell me what you think of all of this application of the Simpson of innocence and the self righteousness of those on the left\nAnd the fool's on our side and if you agree with me that we're about ... in the middle of a second civil war [noise]\nEight six six Ninety red eye or the same number eight six six NATO seven thirty three thirty nine

I I think that ah I've heard all the way too much of rehashing of the last you know a couple of months of political he said she said and all the other nonsense [noise] one saying that the folks that listen to your show could do to help\nPut the ball over the line so to speak for whoever candidate that you want to support\nIs to actually get off your ... and go out and volunteer to sit at the polls on election day and Greek voters or what we found time and time again I've been doing this since Barry Goldwater ran for office years ago\nOr is that if you have a friendly face at the polls if you have people going to the polls that are still kind of on the fence of where they're going to go you get a seven to twelve percent push\nAt those particular polling places where you have these friendly faces now it won't do any good if you got to curb margin that's all grumpy and you know wants to get in fights with everybody but the thing is is you just have a nice pleasant person there\nUh I always set up a little card table with a bowl of candy a couple of smiley balloons and you know say hello to the kids that come out with their parents\nAnd you can make a significant difference in your community both on the down ticket people and on the main ones like I'm going to be out there for a Dean Heller a starting here in Reno or on the twentieth of October or we start early voting I [noise]\nI I think that uh everybody else if they would take a few days often participate at the polls they could really make a difference you\nKnow you you make some good points that they that personal touch I've run for office of course in California last ah Republicans don't usually win in California\nBut um that personal touch makes a difference because they've done polls and and I've seen it in the audience is where they ask people have you ever met a candidate and they almost all say they never have and when they meet someone and you had a great point and they're reasonable in decent that's how you can get a vote\nA ... Republicans used to be very good at doing that and then they went over to consultants and TV and I think we went astray in some ways let's go to April in New York City Hi April you're on with mark on the road I radio\nHi [noise] um I wanted to comment you said you wanted to hear a comment about where they were going through a civil war and I believe that there's a difference the civil war I think we are going to throw something similar to that\nSomething similar to that but on the civil war both sides are very boisterous and we're willing to fight to the death for what they believed in what's\nHappening now with the media and entertainment and the and the young people\nThere and they don't they only hearing one side we're not organized conservatism not organized because when nice guys we believe in being in a civil\nBut this is not the time to be that way because the kids are watching and the nature of young people as they want to be on the winning side they don't even know we exist where all the young kids in ... in school or in the high schools in the colleges the minute they have a conservative view\nThey screen that oh how can any person as a young person is in college\nBe strong enough to stand up against this title wave and the media and the entertainment um people the ... of the songwriters of singers\nEveryone seems and is appearing\nTo be liberal so all these young people they say well you know this is what we're supposed to be with a good side\nThey think they're on the good site and they're being brainwashed they don't even know they're being brainwashed and we're letting this happen I feel as conservative we should be getting organized which should not be you know throwing rocks and and cocktails through windows like some of the antifa is you know group dies\nBut we're not serving our records were being too quiet and I don't think every groan American\nThat's a conservative is going to be able to go against the tide of these termites\nOf little liberals who just following the tide they want to be happy they want to go one friend invites the other friend\nI'm going here and we're going to protest we're going to go down I'm In New York city when President Trump comes in there's like ... a protest is but I Would not go down there because I'm afraid of getting beat up and I might be the only one there\nWas a different point of view we're being like um\nBullied to just keep quiet and Chuck Schumer\nOh and and what's his name Cuomo what he just said lately that President Trump he's trying to get all ... or any violence that goes on he's organizing his people to be violent there was something that happened on a metropolitan club I think they said\nNo no no\nDid you hear what Cuomo said I couldn't believe it he's he's a President Trump this is the way the the Republicans handle things he got them organized to do that he set them up on purpose\nTo go after the ... the set them up\nPresent jumping you know but the kids here this and they believe that it's very serious because it reminds me my husband watches on TV the History Channel and my son watches and he's twenty Twenty one and they show how Hitler isolated the young people got 'em to summer camp they were separated from their parents\nThey only heard what Hitler was saying and telling them you are strong we are good we will defeat and the kids are cheering smiling faces\nThey don't know what they that they're being the hearing propaganda and we're letting it happen I feel very bad 'cause if I knew there was something going on\nAnd I wouldn't be the only one there and the police would be there to protect and make the children see that there's two ways of thinking but I don't think they know and we're letting it happen because they're trying to be polite\nBut they're they're gathering all the young people with the media and ... Taylor Swift and all these other singers Madonna I mean they're not thinking in schools are not teaching them to think independently in college if they don't think with the crowd\nThink what the crowd there'll be just watched what do you think did you did it I don't think it's fair because that civil war the two sides fighting equally\nYeah we wish you consider to be more passionate that's the first thing I Want to say you you Adam teasing you obviously you a very good well here's some I have some optimism forty but you're basically right you may not have heard me say this is it's not a

Hi Tom hello\nGood evening or so it was a good morning sir actually I'm from Rochester, Minnesota rooting for them and what I did that rough I Apologize Minnesota no\nI'm a I'm fifty five years old I voted for Ronald Reagan my first time I could vote my father was a die hard democratic ... party member the Democratic party in the Nineteen eighties was the party of the working man and out is bad it has been hijacked by the ultra liberal left\nAnd I am any Nashville trade union\nAnd I'm told devoted democratic and I just okay okay okay [noise] also like my uncle was a job that Governor Jerry Brown as press secretary back in the seventies\nAnd I'll jump Governor Brown is the governor of California now and I just I look at California and it's like wow this place is just it's\nIt's just crazy and the Democratic party is just so evil and visceral and all the republic ... yeah we do have a few of those but for the most part they're pretty down to earth diesel people\nAnd I think Trump\nHas been the best thing that's happened to us politics and all\nI have a bunch of liberal friends in the ... what did you vote for a spot I voted libertarian that way and get that argument they will come after me but I did vote for Trump I think he did a great job [noise] uh it was so funny Hillary thought you had the lecture in the bag and\nI remember I was working in late ... the place and I came into my supervised officer big Hillary supporter and ... you know what Don I said it's over your girl last\nAnd I looked at the Capitol hearings this week I I've been working in a solar site and make it a Minnesota and I was coming back from work and Rush Limbaugh had the hearings I live and I listen to it I just\nI Can't believe the crap that he wants or Mr Calvin all they just they just\nCharacter assassination and some and here's another thing I think back to a judge Bork when he tried to get on the Supreme Court and that guy from Massachusetts called Ted Kennedy just oh the proverbial barked at him and I just go crazy\nWhen it's minors involved what ... what do you do with what they do all the ... and by the way he had no record so that's like that's like all the\n... el ... here sir\n... Mike ... that's ... ... ... you brought up a lot of great points look\nWho does a new program that Obama certainly encourage the law was passed the where the Florida a shooter murder\nA man a program where they didn't want to go on high school kids on the records of high school students even if they got in trouble which is one of the I think I'm thirty five thirty six incidents I don't even remember\nWhere they would have found that he had a problem but there's a program to make sure that people can live their lives and not let you know ... or something here or something there get in a way of them being successful\nHe had nothing even this I suggested in who knows what really happened even if he was part of it in some way these high school kids as you were talking about these were minors and what about us thirty some odd years where is his bank account\nOf all the puts stuffy did well he wasn't a now that if you just look as you said about the spirit of the law of the literature law\nHe really wasn't guilty of anything but it didn't matter what\nNo matter what the Democrats were up to they were just trying to stall has to make sure he didn't get on the Supreme Court they had this feeling that maybe if they won the Senate which are not going to do more you know they could make some difference in who the nominee was I don't think that's going to happen\nSo they were asked to destroy it didn't matter who trip pressing Trump would've appointed they would have been out to get him that's why it's such a hypocritical monstrosity to watch the super ... such a bunch of ... there was Blumenthal I don't think I mentioned in tonight\nHe said at one point that a lie telling one lie could disqualify you yet he pulled lies about his service\nIn in the military it's well known is just want to talk about that answer and I ... do you ever feel you're living on another planet I often feel that way I watch what goes on but it wasn't really about the spirit of the letter in the law it was about ...\nAnd that's why the ... it was hills for months or weeks whenever it was\nA you got to know what's going on and that's why in the they don't care if they destroy your body it's all about power and Lindsey Graham at at the best it's all about winning any since about cutting out the you know what a and these were his friends but no it's it's ... it's reached new lows that's wife knows just joining us I mentioned the first hour\nThan we have a new civil war going on yeah with soft civil war not\n... it's a it's it's really a fight for the soul of this country let me know what you think let's go to mark\nIn Fort Joni California and mark you're on was marked\nBy mark I won't forget your name that's for sure I Want to learn about Christine court yeah\nI wanted to talk about Christine forward that Brett Kavanaugh I'm a I'm a former sheriff's investigator or about marijuana interdiction here for a while and a pristine Ford is was doing a lot of things during her testimony that the suspects do when they want to cover up their crime and cover up their life\nShe's a psychologist or the little girl's voice racing Meehan collection at the end of this that the\nThat the virus technique body language shrinking her head down toward her shoulders about sitting up straight out looking people and the guy white you know always that up for gays those are\nThings that suspect do when they're trying to get away with something I think ms forward as a liar I don't know what happened to that room and don't care because there is no physical evidence can have\nIn this country we presume innocence skills can be proven and there was no guilt proven toward Brett Kavanaugh it any way shape or form\nAnd that makes missiles toward a liar and that's that's really what she is in California we have a move but put for twenty three counties that have declared that want to separate Cal Oregon port there all day and the liars here are in charge of government\nOr they're in charge of every aspect of our politics and unless we fight nothing's ever gonna get better [noise]\n\nWell I certainly agree with your and a lot of people said this about fighting back\nBecause otherwise we're going to lose the country I mean what made this country special is is it risks now left takes it over ... good luck\nSo Marty couldn't remind him forget you know you use expressed it very well let's go to well here's a good point let's go to Troy in Nashville Iran with mark [noise]\nI have um I uh I've got a little theory you know we've we've got these kids and you know there what ten twelve Fifteen Years old before they're released\nOff\nAre you There God can you hear me yeah now I can go ahead\nOkay um so I was saying you know kids to you when they start getting to the age of of even slightly paying attention to what's going on in the world they're twelve Fifteen Years old\nSo these kids started paying attention and\nFor the last eight years as someone that would have been ...\nSays all this Obama stuff you know no winners and losers in field day nowadays kids are twenty twenty five thirty years old and all they know it was Obama so now I've got a twenty two year old daughter and a twenty year old daughter and they are both\nHave drawn from one of them refused to sit down and talk with me at all the other one I got to sit down and and\nTalk with her and I showed her some facts kind of changed or a little bit and then and then I've got my ten year old that loves Trump and he goes to school and all the kids in his class\nThey they're Trump supporter so this generation that's coming that wasn't raised up in a bomber um years I completed my ten year old knows more about politics than my twenty and twenty two year old daughter too\nYou know and and I think that uh these kids when they grew up you know and basically and the Obama years\nSo we've got this generation that we've got another generation that's coming up that uh is gonna be hopefully the generation that saves us you know so I just wanted to to you know kind of let you know about that or you know it's a generation gap that I see with my own kids from\nYou you got to get rid of your two older ones just\nTell me about it you know and and that's been you know the other thing about the cabin on and you've got this a huge silent majority\n[noise] um that ... year they're they're they're afraid you talked about fighting and that's what the Democrats and the the liberals are doing I think I'm In the silent majority is you know they're afraid\nTo say anything like that guy you know earlier said that uh he voted libertarian you know instead of just coming out and saying hey I voted for Trump you notice it scare and you've got a small group of people who were scared or in the majority and I think this ...\nAnd uh all the spin on it is really going to show at the polls with the we've got a huge silent majority I'm you know so\nWell I think they ... yeah yeah no I I think you're right how are you guys are move me a little bit you know I came on pessimistic about losing the house\nI don't know just listening to an end by the way you try you also made a very good point\nWhich is and I said this before\nWho the president is it makes a difference who the people young people grow up with that is what they hear and that's what they learn right that's why during the Obama administration to get a lot of young people only hears that side and now with Trump although we have the media against this which hurts a lot\nBut if they see the economy's doing well and their lives are improving the lives of their parents that starts to influence them in more people like that was in his own microcosm in his family\nThe ten year old is a Trump supporter and the ones who grew up with the Obama you can't even talk to them\nI Know that feeling [laughter] I Would have my own house so I Can't be hard on him let's go to a ... in Fresno, California Iran with mark [noise]\nHey how are you sir [noise] yeah I think\nOriginal argue that it was whether there was\nAd civil war going on [noise]\n[noise] yep [noise]\nYeah no um it is going on
