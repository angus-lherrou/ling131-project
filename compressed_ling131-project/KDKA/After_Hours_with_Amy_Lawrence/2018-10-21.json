dot com oh did you check them out when you have a chance to have some great information there on the Web site\nToday I Want to welcome Sherry granted here back to the show Sherry it's great to have you back in the studio with us Thanks Chris afraid to be here you know share he's been on the show a number of times or for those that may not remember Sherrie is a nationally recognized nutritionist\nAnd alternative health advisor she's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional athletes she's also written several books on health and nutrition\nAnd Sherry last time you're on the show we were talking about seaweed and about a new natural supplement called title greens yes which comes from ...\nYes it is called title greens and it is from oceanic naturals and what it is it's a multi nutrients seaweed bland and it is sixty times more potent\nThan any land based vegetable and what I Love about it is it addresses so many of the health problems that people are facing today because they just are not getting the nutrients they need were literally dying from our diets\nIn fact the center for Disease Control ... a fact sheet\nThat indicates that poor nutrition and lack of exercise or the number to cause of death in this country and at the rate we're going if we keep us up it'll be number one very than\nIt is it's sad but you know we're we're we're not in a situation where we are starving\nNow unfortunately the foods that were eating or not as nutrient dense as they used to be for example vegetables back in the Nineteen sixties okay they were fifty percent more nutritious than they are today because there were more nutrients in the soil\nEven if you're trying to eat a healthy diet trying to get those fruits and vegetables you still may not be getting the nutrients\nExactly yes that's very true and then when you add the synthetic fertilizers and pesticides you've got a recipe for a lot of malnutrition the city and disease but you know the good news is there's a lotta nutritional benefits from the sea and that's what we're learning about and that's the title\nGreen so they are really exciting I mean there there are some remarkable discoveries now coming from the ocean\nYes even the FDA the food and Drug Administration they publish articles that suggested many treasures from the sea will actually give us a medical answers that we are looking for for example the scientists are examining the metabolites\nTo articles that suggested many treasures from the sea will actually give us a medical answers that we are looking for for example the scientists are examining the metabolites of single celled plankton which the national Cancer Institute tests have shown to have cancer fighting potential it's amazing research in those areas in high gear and labs all across the United states\nAnd and I want to get into this a little bit but but maybe just to set this thing up against what are some of the symptoms that you know their body is not getting the right kinds of nutrients well\nAll sorts of illnesses and diseases they have pain in the body pain in the muscles pain in the joints they find that they're still lacking energy um food cravings eczema allergies digestive problems lackluster hair dry skin brittle nails those are also a sign\nAnd you know the bottom line is you just don't feel good but you can't put your finger on why\nYeah and I think there's a lot of people in that situation\nAnd they just think it's part of aging and this is what I'm going to have to deal with which drives me crazy I'm like no it doesn't have to be that way and what I Want our listeners to understand is that a gene isn't about the breaking down of our bodies at all it's more about how the body repairs itself your body wants to heal itself it wants to repair itself\nAnd if you give your body what it needs it will do that\nMhm so what about seaweed why is this kind of the key\nWell first of all titled greens has a blend of seaweed that are the most nutrient dense vegetables on on a lot of different ... right yeah there's over twelve thousand ... and the other reason that seaweed is so unique is that it's sixty times more potent\nThan any land based vegetables see we have more phytochemicals the word means plant chemicals in these plant compounds are\nAnd building ourselves these phytochemicals really do play an important role in the biology of ourselves okay in fact these phytochemicals there are so powerful that they and able seaweed entitle greens to grow at a rate of one to two feet per day without a route\nThat that's amazing so more anti accidents more minerals more amino acids lip it's trace minerals\nEnzymes we need enzymes today just their food especially as we get older I'm plants they're all like a gym slavery noise Polly females many of which are not even found in land based plants\nAnd we're talking about the minerals like calcium ten times more in the way then in a glass of milk um sodium magnesium which keeps the muscles relax potassium iodine iron and zinc\nAnd then of course of vitamins like vitamin a B. one be to be six knives and vitamin C ... than a gas it and folic acid I mean there's even trace amounts of vitamin B. twelve that you cannot get from any land based plants I mean the list goes on and on\nAnd you know I it'd be great if we can just go out and drink the water in the ocean but you can't do that now but what we can do is consumed those powerful vegetables that are in the seat in the form of seaweed Chrissy we have all the nutrients that are required\nBy human beings to live so in other words if you ain't nothing else but seaweed you can sustain a very healthy life\nOh really yeah it sounds like a great solution here before we go on I

point but the reality is I'm I'm Still standing I I still wake up every morning what's the big deal here I mean hasn't the government figured out that there is some level of vitamin C. that you need to have in order to be healthy\nWhen you're talking about the government and nutrition and health recommendations\nBoy they get like a deem minus because they're already a for vitamin C is sixty milligrams sixty military ... inadequate the RDA for vitamin C. was determines so you don't die from ... but sixty milligrams of vitamin C. is like partially water and your grass so it's not quite brown\nAnd see what I mean and that's the problem with our bodies is that we're not getting the vitamin C. we need and you need vitamin C. the writer mouse and the right form in order to get yourself\nA high level health light and why is that so critical do why is getting enough fight them and see so\nAnd the right form in order to get yourself into a high level house of light and why is that is so critical do why is getting enough fight 'em and see so critical while just to recap number one in your body doesn't make it\nToo is that if you're not getting the right amount of it which

cold water okay and each serving is Fifteen hundred milligrams of vitamin C.\nOkay and it has twenty two different sources of vitamin C. which is very very important for your body what's the benefit of having those twenty two different sources or the benefit is is is that your body recognizes these from nature\nAnd there's there's a number of different sources from nature there's rose hips broccoli\nTo certain type of cherry called an asteroid cherry lemons lines gray for with the super see twenty two I've tried to duplicate what's in nature and I put it into one form I see okay well speaking English can we can we make some yeah a lot of Troy right here yeah okay\nAll right now why why a powder instead of let's say a a pill or a capsule or something like ... vitamin C. it's it's necessary to get it in your system not just in your blood but down to the tissues [laughter] so when you put a powder and you put water in it it activates it absorbs quickly this is the best way to

keep the inside of the blood vessels\nStrong and if you look at most of the problems people are having collapsed arteries strokes ... in their body yeah vitamin C. makes what's called college in

CBS Radio or their Perry Capital your affiliates [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nHi\nThis is Alan looser of the public square today we've got to broadcast titles election special twenty eight [noise] we wanted to start with a listener response that we received this week a rub you got that response which you don't you we received an email\nAnd it came from a supporter of the roundtable the public square in I voters dot com\nAnd the this listener wrote I have a good friend a mature Christian who is turned off by both political parties and told me he is not going to vote\nI countered with all the Christian reasons he should vote but to no avail he challenged me to show them one scripture that tells him to vote for the best out there and forgive the shortcomings of the other candidates\nSo I ask you to help if you can watch scriptures support the act of voting for the best out there\nWhat a wonderful question and what a wonderful letters so thanks to everybody that's involved with being willing to talk out loud\nAnd express their concerns and their issues and their problems in their challenges and Rob thanks for bringing that to us so we've got kind of an ideal situation this is really what a listener asked us to help with this is a real listener response but it's hypothetical enough that I think we can conduct the conversation\nWithout a fence a now some people may get offended because the ideas that we're going to bring forward may contradict what you're comfortable with what you believe that what you hold to er which are very competent to defend\nBut the intention here isn't personal we don't even know this person's name so please understand we're going to try to answer the very same question that all of us have asked endless times\nAh and and the most Christians do in fact asked what's the use of voting especially when you're picking between two evils aren't so does that kind of match up the question everybody agrees we've got the right question on the table yes sure okay\nAnd I think you'd be happy to tell you that he loved it even more when he couldn't do it [noise] it it he missed it so much it was such a pain in his life in such a constant reminder [noise]\nUm so I remember talking which are costing about this as well and and I think we both reflected back on Dr Schaefer comments now it's never fun how to vote when we don't like the choices and there are lots of options I Will tell you that I've been involved in pack activities\nWhere we've actually done a project called not on top campaigns where we actually didn't like the candidates at the top of the ticket\nAnd so we ran a protest movement to encourage people to not vote for the top of the ticket I that's that's a civic action that's sending a strong message but we showed up and voted voted the rest of the ticket because there's always issues whether it's a local tax\nOr local ballot renewable ... something that's important to be there it's important to show up\nAnd they're not all awful racist they're not all terrible choices so the idea of sitting at home skipping a race is a valid point and there are sometimes people have to\nOne of the things we do is analyze the numbers and one thing I always enjoy looking at after the fact is taking a look at\nWho voted for this race who didn't vote for that race how do those numbers compare if you have a couple of statewide races and this year we will it'll be interesting to look at key states and see\nHow many people voted for governor compared to how many people voted for the United States Senate and then compare with the parties\nAnd see how it all plays out because there's a lot of intricacies\nTo go into that and you have to digest that after the fact so\nIt's okay to skip some races and and Rob you have an interesting point that we want to make sure we got you brought this to us earlier and on the idea of that whole one vote concept you got another new illustration that I think is really important in Pennsylvania in Pennsylvania um there's a gentleman named John Spiderman and he is on the ballot\n... that I think is really important in Pennsylvania\nIn Pennsylvania um there's a gentleman named John ...\nAnd he is on the ballot in Pennsylvania you run for lieutenant governor in the primary separate from the governor so he ran separate he was elected in the primary to now be on the ballot or in the governor's race of Pennsylvania but if you rewind the tape back to two thousand five word of John federal income from\nWell he is the mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania he won the mayor's race him Braddock, Pennsylvania and two thousand and five by one vote by one vote\nThat's how he wants Thirteen Years later after serving as mayor he is now in the ballot in in a poll say I know it doesn't matter to after election day but poll say he's going to be the lieutenant governor of the state of Pennsylvania so people say one vote doesn't matter where you can point to one example where it's propelled the career of one politician\nAnd you have hundreds of examples over the last ten years yeah one voter a handful of votes or less than five percent of the votes have changed dramatically races for everything the whole after the U.S Congress\nYeah and one Midwestern state over fifty races in two thousand Eighteen alone was decided by one vote are tied or fifty races in one election cycle and he said I was in two thousand Eighteen was that primaries yes okay yes [noise]\nSo we know these things matter we know that there are important and we know that\nWe don't always have the best choices ah but the question becomes\nA every year they they they come at you and this is the most important election in our lifetime and and you say that you know what\n... where we passed that you're at the public square every election is the most important election that's in front of us because it's the election that's in front of us for some of us it may be the last election we ever have the privilege to participate in it you never know that and\nThe election that's in front of us is the most important one because we can't do a thing about the one that's coming tomorrow\nWe can't do a thing about the one that happened in the past so it is an important election\nAnd to understand the privilege in the right to vote that we've been given by the founders of this country is I think to grow in a much deeper appreciation of respect\nFor you see the concept of the consent of the governed which does flow from the book of genesis through for Samuel chapter eight and all the way out in the words of the declaration of independence\nI'm not saying the declaration of independence is inspired not saying that it's given by God\nI'm saying that it reflects the very discussions in principle some concepts of the consent of the governor which come from the God of the Hebrew republic from the creator of the universe\nWho constantly established consent as the mechanism of civil government the creator gave mankind the right to civil government and the right of free moral agency\nAnd so we've had the right of the consent of the government literally exercise and and modeled out force in the Old Testament Thomas Paine picked up on this and common sense\nAnd talked about this concept of consent\nAnd the power of government coming back to the consent of the people so that a constitutional form of government based on what we the people\nWas far superior to the divine right of kings and this is we fought a revolution over this friends this is the basis of why we exist and to think today is the founders could hear this conversation\nI got to tell you I don't think they would be kind to us\nI think they would be very upset to think of the price that was paid in their generation alone let alone all the generations that followed presuming that we would consider government important enough\nTo be involved now\nLet alone all the generations that followed presuming that we would consider\nGovernment important enough to be involved now here's the bottom line on this idea of we don't have great choices then why are you running for office\nYeah we would love to see more people step forward and say I want to make that sacrifice I Want to make that commitment and that's not an easy commitment to make but if you don't like the choices that are there maybe it's time to uh get out of the boat get outside the comfort zone doesn't\nMean you have to run for the U.S house the next day you can start with something in\nA state wide or local Dave is this fair to say it seems like that question is unique to to a certain strain of Christianity I don't hear 'em progressive asking a question like that I think they recognize the importance of voting\nUm I I feel like this is unique to to a certain type of Christian\nThat's a fascinating question Allan is a very appropriate question because there are some theological strains of teaching in practice that do lend themselves\nTo a notion of the material versus anti material what would Dr Schaefer used to call the upper story lower story to not get involved because it's dirty it's ugly it's evil\nThere is a a genuine isn't that there's also a theological strain of eschatology that sometimes keeps Christian people from getting involved because they say what's the use the world coming to an end anyhow\nAnd you know why should I bother with all of this I just want to do what God wants me to do and that's to help people here are the words of Christ and become believers and I don't have time for anything else those things are are are valid those there there are theological premises that Dr where we stand in regards to world view\nAnd you are quite right that progressives have a very different point of view and I think it'd be it'd be good to talk about that\nI'm In just a minute but before we get to the progressive point of view let's just take a second\nAnd ask ourselves so is this election big enough to bother with I mean nobody is running for president so is it really important enough and Rob I'm gonna ask you a voters what do you see on on the ballot that's that's actually a worth getting out there and being concerned about\nAll of it my answer's gonna be all of it 'cause I asked people to question do you love your neighbor if you love your neighbor don't you cares and civil authority over ... over your neighbor don't care what issues are passing when I look at this election and twenty Eighteen\nYou have races from the United States Senate down to you're gonna have city council races depending where you live many states have ballot issues\nThat are extremely important for people to be involved in and I voters dot com is a place that where you can do your homework where you can share with others so that they get the facts and information\nVoting as a responsibility it is something we're blessed to be able to do but showing up at the polls and saying yes I did my civic duty when you had no clue who you're voting for a while you are voting or what any of it meant\nThat's being irresponsible with the gift we've been given\nSo we're heard in all fifty states is there any state or so sleepy that there's not enough fourth on the ballot we're going to Rob in your opinion\nNo not at all and I can ask all of our team that voters dot com ths\nThe build all the spreadsheets did hold the data base over ten thousand Canada there there are some things in every state every person in the country well it's a guarantee every person in the country will be voting for a member of Congress you know every U.S House race is up into one Eighteen and there's much more than that\nIn almost every state talk show hosts across the country of had us on to talk about I voters dot com and we even took suggestions one said to us last election cycle he said I'd love to be able to go on there and see the most watched\nHouse races and Senate races without putting an address thing 'cause I don't know an address in that state I don't want to take\nElection cycle we said I'd love to be able to go on there and see the most watched\nHouse races and Senate races without putting an address thing 'cause I don't know an address in that state I don't want to take\nI said okay and we have that up there now the Senate races the key and I say Senate races the key and I'd see house races you can do all the research this 'cause on election night there's a lot of junkies out there that will be watching those returns come in and you can do your homework ahead of time\nAnd Enron people may not realize that we have information out there on the ballot ashes these there's some crazy about issues\nThat people need to decide on this election cycle and we provide the pro and con from them checked his perspective\nMy biggest beef unbalanced issues as the false marketing is miss miss labeling of the concept or the or an an unfair description on TV commercials where it's just a flat outline Ohio is a big huge example for that\nAt ... we're going to get into that Allen I think we've got to get to a break but let's let's go ahead and turned out to ballot issues now don't turn away your radio say I don't have any ballot issues right now 'cause there's some things here that apply to every state in the nation and remember this\nSaint ... you know watch read this carefully\nSo you know people who were convicted of ah of ah doing drugs or selling drugs whatever their fences will be reduced to data misdemeanor okay and then it says this will not affect those convicted of murder rape\nOr child molestation it does not say however\nUh anything about other violent crime so I'm saying so so actually if you are convicted of\nAttempted rape attempted murder assault and battery kidnapping ... you can get your if introduced by twenty five percent for you I hate to stop us right here but we do have to take a break and we'll pick this conversation right back up on the other side of the breaking sixty bits tunes right here to help us with [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nYesterday I think it's important that we understand in the midst of this election cycle with everyone telling us how desperately important this is [noise] is still based [noise]\nMy wife and I commented the other night ... says this is I think she's so she said thank God we can turn off the only thing we can get away from the television\nCommercials from all of these negative ads and watch baseball where people of every color and every size can be batting champions and ... and and home run king Zen\nAnd pitch a hundred mile fast balls and people of every size shape and dimension or in the stands cheering for their team and the politics of it doesn't matter doesn't it feel good to have some things that we can be for\nThat's positive\nAnd we don't have to hate each other for and I thought you know what that's really well said thank God for baseball and in a sad way it used to be that we felt the same way about America that we felt about baseball that's why we talk about baseball hotdogs apple pies and Chevrolet not unintended advertisement\nBut the idea that there were some things that brought us together they were bringing the things that brought us apart and our civil government used to be one of those things that we did was such pride and it was always bigger than ourselves I think it's a fair question to ask how did we get so far divided\nBut for the time being watched baseball\nRobbie watching yes well yes and I will say I'm watching one of the reasons I'm watching as a buddy of mine worked home plate in game one of the ... so\n... I Would have been like they don't do trip over all the names of drama [laughter] you'd think you could try to get us an interview with him for the pine [laughter]\nAll right so when all else fails turn off all cable news and turned to baseball okay let's go back to Ohio is your wife your team still in it those of us in Ohio are kind of depressed about baseball heck I'm not in Ohio but I don't care I'll take any of those\nFour teams I'm just a game I just come on come on out to these the littlest guy in the world and he's a National League batting champion for like three years in a row there's hope for any of us [laughter]\nYou gotta love based I don't know that if they're back to Ohio issue one there are some things that we've got to clean up on that now we've got to get to the I used to I Want to get to an all huffy and post article about that issue\nYou gotta love based I don't know that are still back to Ohio issue one there's some things that we ought to clean up on that and then we've got to get to the ... I Want to get to an ... Huffington Post article about that issue\nIssue one is driving me crazy because probably in the last Thirty years why is the one that's the most deceptive that I've\nI mean we've we've dealt with a lot of ballot issues over the area for a long time now this one is six so frustrating lane deceptive because the proponents of saying that they're one goal is to reduce prison population\nThey they specifically say they want to provide a pathway for the release for non violent offenders\nBut the bottom line is when all the advertising goes away and you're left with the language in your constitution and there was a full paragraph in issue one that allows violent offenders to reduce their own sentence mandatory if they meet certain\nEducational programming criteria they can shrink their own sentence without the parole boards up to twenty five percent\nNo concern for victims so if you're if you've been convicted of aggravated are sent human trafficking aggravated assault kidnapping criminal possession of chemical weapons as a whole long list of violent felonies\nThat you can reduce your own sentence things are not getting rid of\nNon violent offenders from our prison population and what's more frustrating if you've got Newt Gingrich\nPairing up with Van Jones\nOn this issue saying and and churches and passers endorsing this engine that terrible set of a paragraph that will be amended end to the high cost efficient very hard to get rid of once it's there\nFor you brought up Newt Gingrich so let's let's go there for a minute a Newt Gingrich's out campaigning for Ohio issue one um I I have to honestly ask whether the former speaker has read the language it's six pages and I have to imagine\nThat if he was speaker of the Ohio house of representatives the first question he would ask is why do I want six pages in my constitution as opposed to having six pages with the legislature can debated\nTweak it fixed it experiment with let's see how it works and then make sure that it's working right in regards to justice because these are human lives we're talking about\nDavid if he's listening he should go to a paragraph see it's only nine lines that would probably taken three minutes to read it\nWell here we are or we can go to the author of this who wrote a of this ballot issue who wrote in the Huffington Post talking about the fact that the campaigners were sort of faced with an idea of not doing this and half steps so they went with the six page massive leap\nInto ill logic and and and basically\nI committed I think the first offense that you can't do when you're in the law making process the first thing you don't do is to place your idea in the wrong place to start with in other words you have a statutory proposal keep it in the statute don't jump to the constitution\nConstitution should be for general principles statutes are where you fix unintended consequences or misunderstandings and language anyone going to about issue if it's complex if it's a policy issue they're putting into a constitution we should have the just say no philosophy\nWill Steven Johnson grove one of the co writers of this initiative is quoted in the Huffington Post saying the core of this thing is one single idea it's trying to shrink the prison population if that's your goal you can't do it in half steps\nWell wait a minute how is one single ballot issue ever going to shrink the prison population unless you either decriminalize something or just let people out of jail because the whole concept of law is it's a response to what happens when people break the law right at what point in time to constitutional amendments stop people breaking\nThe concept of law is it's a response to what happens when people break the law right at what point in time to constitutional amendments stop people breaking the law because if you really truly want to stop people going to prison get people to stop breaking the law\nMhm so what they're saying is that the way they're going to do this by reducing drug laws so that they're no longer crimes then be honest about it but every time the opponents say this will make Ohio's loss more relaxed in regards to drug use these other guys say oh no it won't but I mean they're saying it with their own words and\nYou have to look at the people that are behind the proposed amendment as well and Dave you're exactly right when you speak of the drug laws becoming more lenient and the question I Would have for former Speaker Gingrich as it did he realize and understand that George Soros the people he speak ill of often\nAre the ones that are funding this amendment it's their idea with the goal because they state it clearly on the Ohio organizing collaborative website they stated clearly with the goal\nTo impact other candidate elections across the state of Ohio also thinking about the other person behind this Mark Zuckerberg how does this play\nWhen you think of Facebook and the control ... has of that when it comes to advertisements both for and against issue one how will do is be reporter than campaign spending for all the money they put out\nIn favor of the proposal and then the the reports that people get this isn't traditional media here this isn't like you get a report saying your ad aired\nOn this radio station at this time and we know that because so many people heard it this is totally different they're going to tell you that so many people saw the ad but did they seem to know what they have a vested interest in this passing so how can they be trusted this just blows up the traditional markets a network\nThat's the other side of the coin on the deception the wrong because you've got Facebook mark soccer birth own product\nCan micro target individuals who received services from Facebook so he can determine who gets the messages to turn out the vote so it's not just coming out to vote yes on one from their perspective\nThat's coming out to vote and getting voter turnout for certain candidates they don't even have to blanket target the whole state they can Mike our target certain races\nWhat we've got in Ohio for the whole nation to watches what started as a little campfire that's now are raging forest fire on a ballot issue that's dragged in Mark Zuckerberg George Soros Newt Gingrich Van Jones\nAnd progressive leaders from all over the world that are looking at how to implement this fire and create a movement if you will across the country\nBut they've run into some problems here uh Mr Johnson grove who was quoted in the Huffington Post Erica we've been talking about it he says this about issue on and Ohio if I had to give advice to other progressive campaigners I tell them to hope they get lucky\nThe public square the broadcast service at

and by the way AAA dot com slash radio\nTo the president Ronald Reagan and president Richard Nixon library\nJust uh I was actually re watching a video that we shot a yesterday early this morning just kind of going over some stuff and just such a great presentation if you get a chance to listen to him and Marie to on that video but if you're really into this sort of thing and I just found it fascinating\nAnd I've always been a fan of Richard Nixon who I've I've got a really short changed because of all Watergate debacle thing and and I think he was a great statesman and I think he was a good president\nAnd I think you know as in time history will show that especially if it were that he didn't foreign policy I mean you know you look at President Trump and how he's handled certain things you know with\n... and then you think you might think yourself boy if Nixon was just around the kind of give him a few pointers well you could really kinda polish him up a little bit and I think that Mr Trump will be the total package and that that brings me to this point\nYou know I I get so frustrated about all of the drama and the stuff that is this happening in our headlines every day and it it it angers me because what it does it takes away from the real discussion of this midterm election and you know yesterday\nA Raj him was was here and doing his show and we had a chance to get caught up after and he was working on some promos for next week's show they're going to have the folks from Bethel bakery a delicious bakery I might have been a big fan of theirs for a long time of\nCourse and the camera and you hear him talk about um all the time\nBut Raj is just a fan of business and you know community and and then he's always been interested in politics he is the head of the Republican Party in Allegheny county\nAnd and my big beef about this election is that people are so misinformed as far as what the issues are and and whether you like President Trump or not the country has never been in better shape I mean it really hasn't and Raj and I did a little video yesterday and he was talking about\nEither news you know the energy grid ah jobs the opioid crisis is law enforcement public education health care\nAnd you know one of the things that him and I both were talking about yesterday how is it that Republicans have gotten this brand that they don't back union labor\nI see I I I totally disagree with that I have many friends who are members of the Republican Party who love with the Keystone mount lakes regional council of carpenters or doing you know you've got a beaver county Republican majority as far as the commissioners you got Dan camp San Diego I'm going to be doing some videos of them and the next couple of weeks [noise]\nWho are really all for what's happening at that shell petrochemical plant in which thousands of union workers are their labor intensive jobs back to a corporation Keystone melt lakes regional council the carpenters Pennsylvania chemicals\nI mean this is this is just\nLudicrous to think that people really know the issue so I Want to ask you if I were to say that you were having a cup of coffee somewhere you're favored died or at a McDonald's or whatever and I said do you have a Joe hey Jane hey Sallie hate him what are the issues\nAnd and I like to focus on them today about this midterm election and you know this redistricting and the seventeenth\nHas really kind of money in the water is a little bit in my opinion and it's going to make it an uphill battle for Keith Rothfus in look I think Conor Lamb I'm sure it's going to be around for a long time okay young guy marine veteran we salute them for his service all of that stuff\nBut you know you keep hearing all of these things about you know elections you know Second Amendment pro gun pro life is that what have you you know seniors trying to uh you know they're trying to take your Social Security Medicare is going to go away listen\nYou you got to focus on really if you want to have a society and you want it to be around more than three hundred years longer than the Roman empire which we are approaching that significant year I mean if the Roman empire fell we can fall\nIt's we need to get back to building things in this country I mean and and and this president is trying so hard to renegotiate all of these deals oh these deals especially with China that quietly came in and look kudos to them\nThey show on opening and they took it folks they jumped right in there and snatched it okay but I Would love to see great brands responsible for hundreds of thousands of jobs like Wal Mart\nBecause they have the brains the smarts and that Sam Walton blueprint which is incredible you know I was in the bay and Walmart ... love that store just walking around the other day thinking about Sam Walton in ... I'm probably the only person that does is sort of thing\nAnd you know I conversation years ago with my friend ... who is in the business of you know merchandising and all of this different stuff about him visiting their world headquarters and\nIf somebody tells them they heard me talking about this or if he's listening 'cause he's up usually early he'd probably say I don't even remember no now I remember I don't forget stuff like that because you cannot look away at a great Brannon success story like Wal Mart you can't\nI mean it it it's phenomenal but I Would like to see them start building their own things televisions baby cribs a high chairs car seats whatever and put a label on it\nAnd bring little manufacturing plants into communities and start doing things like that and I guarantee they could sell it at a cost\nThey hire more jobs which they ... if it wasn't for Walmart little communities and people\nStart doing things like that and I guarantee you they could show that cost\nThey hire more jobs which they ... if it wasn't for Walmart moved communities and people always say well they kind of came and took over main street no ministry was gone for the most part there wouldve been no jobs nobody would have had a job but a lot of people would have been able to afford to do certain things you know celebrate various holidays by for their family do things\nAll of that stuff okay is so important who we are but we need to start making things in this country again and unless we start doing that we're doomed\nOr do look these police officers that I saw a couple of hours ago were in their eating a sandwich on their break I thought to myself\nYou can't pay these people enough you can't I mean do you understand what we're dealing with out in the world today if you know you're listening to this in the comfort of your home\nYou don't really have a clue you don't have a clue how dangerous it is out there but when I'm at home at night you know locked in my house in that great little community that I live in which really for the most part kind of like ... it's a really save great little town\nI don't even have a concept of how dangerous it is out there\nBut it is but you know it would make their job a whole lot better if we could put more people to work so they put in their eight hours at work they put in their eight hours at home and they put it in their eight hours of sleep and you know what in a perfect world life would be pretty good\nAnd if you go back to when people were working in the steel industry US Steel over a quarter of a million employees at one time I think that number is like twenty six thousand now\nPeople want to work went home went to bed that's it said that she was she was telling you about\nThen went to work these are the issues that matter you're going to put your ego aside you gotta look at your kids your grandkids the community you live in forget about looking at it as a Republican or Democrat right now this president and the people in Congress whether they be Republican or not and in the Senate it's working\nShow I Want to talk to you about those issues a lot of talk to you about why you need to really think you're going to do before you cast your ballot because you're casting\nIt not just for yourself but for future generations in their jobs show for the next twenty five years ... gay radio\nNothing hurts my mom\nThat she showed anyway [noise] [noise] ... she'd always say you do what you need to do to take care of yourself\nBut she thought that that\nShe had to do it on her own [noise] ... ... we were trained to help others\nBut their strength and finding healthy yourself too\nWe're in this together or even the toughest of us might not know where to go to get a little support", "year": "2018", "show_name": "After Hours with Amy Lawrence", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "21"}
