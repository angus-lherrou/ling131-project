prison McCain I'm really glad you're with us today because they were going to be talking about an issue that of each and every one of us in the stress\nAnd believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ...\nAnd Dr ... there's going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects the daily stress has on our bodies for those you that may not know Dr Parikh is he is a nationally recognized authority unnatural\nAn alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional ... athletes and it continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nAnd thanks for it's great to be with you know\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nA while you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure and so\nThe waste stress affects the body as this I'm going to persons under stress the body transpose as a stress into tension and\nYour muscles end up contract and everyone feels that and they're in the upper back in ... right and the doctor I'm more concerned about\nThe muscles that you don't feel that she has the muscles didn't artery up and the mother's heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive\nTract ... these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties and I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients\nThat is completely handle the body in terms of stress okay according to the research that I've been involved with this as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\n... museum for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people do you know they just don't sleep well you wake up tired your body hurts more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and I still frozen fibromyalgia\nAnd cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture\nAnd it has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplement or how many in Athens you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith Kelsey um being something to do with stress season calcium for building bones well\nYes okay yeah it does build your teeth but he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nOh yeah okay yeah and it does build your teeth but he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart and your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually dies\nWow this is all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to us from the bones themselves\n... absorb it back from the bones if neither\nThat's right and I say and what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of a ball\nAnd it's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of front and die intrusion\nYep okay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nFor sure just drink milk just drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right\nAnd second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really because things like pastures Asian irradiated um the calcium as leads from the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the house would start driving later but these things don't absorb and the body it's time for a couple\nOf reasons one uh when you take a let's say on antacid that had the ... like a dumb [noise]\nFirst of all calcium does not absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but see what happens when you take a Tom isn't antacid [laughter] oh okay so you're in if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is that being absorbed in\nMy seat because it has to be in a in an acid environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called ... ...\n... formula is natural\nAnd the differences is that\nThe powder and what happens if you put it in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it down so it's in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbs in your system wow\nSo that's ...\nYeah because when calcium and easy Myrna liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWow that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says the fans absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder well\nIt comes down to absorption one in a way to tell if you're not observing calcium is take a look at what drugs they're taking\nAre you on high blood pressure medication do you need something for your kidneys or you aren't pain medications you need sleeping pills because the calcium and especially the main either being absorbed ... you're not going to suffer from all these things\nMy comment formula does absorb incredibly in the body the thing is is that when you take my comment formula but not like well well I feel better I have thousands of people right if the doctor pain 'cause I Can't believe it thirty minutes after I took a counter\nThe pain in my wrist one way or I was able to sleep for the first time an IRS mean this is really

wonderful green treat Pennsylvania location of intercom communications until three this afternoon to a more about that a little bit and we're going to get to the big story of the week and just a moment but before we uh Les shut the gloves and go toe to toe let's just relax for a moment and breathe deep right and talk about\nHalloween you know you heard that report during CBS Radio news I mean it has become a billion dollar plus industry\nSo I'm In Coons market last night during the little video work uh for the great MTC family to promote you know Halloween such a seven seven thirty you know a long day yesterday doing stuff with the home office and out and about taking care of the\nWonderful folks at ... market and you know standing in front of this wall of candy all of this different stuff you know that we grew up with three musketeers and Snickers and kick cat\nIn Mars, Bars and just the Milky way's I mean things that are just really mean a lot to me and I know you probably pass this stuff every day hopefully it becomes market near you and you don't really think twice or other that hey you know my wife or my husband or somebody reminded me I've got to grab you\nKnow a bag of the family ... fund size or whatever you know just to make sure that we have something for trick or treat some talking to a friend or early this week we're taking your drive and we were just you know chitchat and about stuff and I should you know I remember as a kid you'd get a pill a stack\nAnd you would literally be out until eleven o'clock at night I mean you would come home\nDinner you know round for thirty five o'clock and about this time of year now we're going to be falling back with the clocks a week from today but you know ... ...\nAround for thirty five o'clock and about this time of year now we're going to be falling back with the clocks a week from today but you know it's ... it's fall so you know the days are getting shorter so no matter the weather no matter the situation you know lots of energy when you're a young person\nAnd I think I went trick or treating until I was in the ninth or tenth grade something like that we really kind of went a long time why because we didn't get this stuff\nYou know throughout the year I mean it was a big deal I mean you are really out there looking for a treasure I mean my kids I mean there's always stuff like that in the cupboard and they always had a treat you know all of them I mean they never had to say hey can you pick me up a candy bar 'cause there was always something of house right just another\nIncidence a incident of a of our kids today are are are spoiled no doubt about it right but that's what you do because you love your kids\nBut anyway so I'm looking at all this stuff last night and I'm just thinking I Hope children appreciate this stuff as much as I did as a kid and you know for years I used to handed out literally by the truckloads and that's not so much the case anymore\nCan when did all of this start you know I I I've been\nRacking my brain since this story first started developing I this this past week it was a blur I mean we were Marcellus Shale insight on Wednesday that out on a trope Thursday it's just been very fast paced week but I was plugging into a lot of this stuff throughout the week and you know doing a lot of stuff on social media\n[noise] and I just kept saying to myself why did this really start because honestly I don't remember a presidential election until after Watergate to wear a lot of this stuff became common I mean we had the Gary Hart scandal obviously Bill Clinton went through his share\n... and you know one thing about Iraq Obama\nAnd I don't think that he needed to go out to where he said on that limb I never had anybody indicted in my minister ration but I mean it's so we are but when you see someone like him\nWho's a quintessential politician who nothing really who really nothing went wrong during his eight years in office I mean it was bland but it was safe it was good and he did an excellent job\nAnd I mean sometimes boring is good okay but when you see him taking shots like that that just goes to show you where we are today but I Do agree with the president that the media is going to try to use this and he believed they already have for political gain\nAnd and and why this is so sad\nAnd we're going to talk about there's more than nine o'clock hour we have this first hour of open talk then we'll be back at nine AM today and I really would love to hear from you about this because I've been really chomping at the bit could not wait to get in here I just could not wait to get in here today to talk to you about this because it's frustrating to me [noise]\nEverybody's missing the point this man if it is proven that he is the one\nSeizure say ... I mean there's there's something obviously seriously wrong with him and you you want to get them to help that he needs but I mean go back to you know share hands share hand Lee Harvey Oswald David ... I mean ... ... people do\nSqueaky from they do things that you and I can't understand because they're just not wired right and mental illness is a major problem in our country today there's no doubt\nBut I don't want any of you to think that this really was perpetrated because of the president's comments I mean I just think he was fixated and locked in on something and it just proves there's such a divide in this country and I'm telling you the president\nWill try I think to back away but I think this story is going to become one of the major parts of the mid term\nIt's going to be more hate speak and it shouldn't be that way we live in a better country than that\nWe are so divided right now that absolutely paralyzes me with frustration trying to think what are we going to do\nTo bring both sides together listen I'm telling you every great country nation superpower worldwide whenever they met their Waterloo\nI just together listen I'm telling you every great country nation superpower worldwide whenever they met their Waterloo and the polio was one of them obviously it was the great divide you can't have so many people were ripping each other apart like this\nWhether you're a Democrat or Republican you've got to stand up and go look\nAt the time we get back to the business of what we're supposed to do and democracy create a better place for people to live\nA chick six street nine one ten twenty dollar bank instant access can give it a dot com checked me in the right on the middle of the best deal in town which are the Cleveland and say hello to Susie Susie\nRob how are you this morning I Am good welcome ... well thank\nYou I'm Glad I got a chance again 'cause I Want to cause you to him when you were doing the um that we love with the about Bruno San Latino but I wanted to speak to you about all these bombs being sent all over the country hello\nYeah I'm here go ahead yeah and I just think is the sound of the times and somebody had to be done about this well I mean\nI mean here's the thing I mean something will be done about it\nBut I mean I think was but it goes to give you an idea Suzie we live in troubling times and this is talk yeah we do these are the people living within our borders and you know we have the situation was going on in Mexico which I don't think the way he's going to be the answer to any of that but what I'm saying is we need to rally around each other now more than ever\nMore than ever more than ever yard so right so right about that and and the that that is a bold as it is you know why it reminded me of the Unabomber you know what the ... the mama building and things like that it's it's home alone terrorism none of that one of the moms to post office\nYou're getting it through the mail you know they have to end the at the end the Sixers everybody they have to keep a lid on all the information that they have to try to drop this kid has got to stop\n... how you couldn't ... with Julie how does it stop though what do you do I mean I think we're too far off the ledge\n[noise] yeah I I think we've gotten to too far off of not recognizing things and treating it like it's like um it it gets to be just so much in the news okay and it'll be dealt with no no no no this is Scott and it can be terrorism on a home front claws global whatever you want to call it\nI mean they're just saying well he was getting it done whoever is as anti moms knows what they're doing and I think it is obvious because it's got through the system without even exploding think about that\nI Know I Know they don't\nGet a handle on as rough I mean he you know I mean it it it just simply sign at a time it's not the first\nTime but ... is usually the problem is people have been watching the government's fight with each other\nFor decades now she no sooner or later something like this was going to happen I mean there's such forget about how they've tried to ties to the president's comments\nVarious hatred for the president in this country tour of people say horrible things about this man and who he is I mean there's no respect for the commander in chief anymore in this country so are you really shocked by any of his\nUm well what I'm Talking about it that they have no respect for the United states limit what mayor and thanks thanks for\nThat ... you understand that you know with the statue of liberty and all I mean we don't mind for me what John Lennon something going wrong about the border and I thought about this okay we can't we're not saying that you can't come here like we have to stop you at the border we get a check who you are you not\nThis okay we can't we're not saying that you can't come here\nLike we have to stop you let the border we got to check who you are not going to make the next building a wall because isn't there I think that chairman of them coming here already in there and they're just a button and from that will want to stop them we're gonna we'll pull up is ... and that shows and say no you can't go and come across\nOn saying this Rob yeah he we we have a mixture of everything in this country and it's it's just a global but we have to stop them at all borders not give Mexico we have to stop this from getting in to our system the way they have and I said document who you are what you're doing here\nAnd if it's something that the the it's not if they have to deal with send them back to what you have to put them in a way it is that a I'm a military up that they said they have I'm thinking in terms of that because my son is a marine\nI for one you know that we have to do something and ah you know and the thing that they're than about to but have effectively let us say that they're getting that and he even danger to did you hear what happened on air force one and things like that every ... every day it's every day [noise]\nSo what is that what is your thinking on this 'cause I Know that your thoughts\nOn my my thinking is that it is it's both sides and all of the ... the arguing I mean there are shutting the country down a path of destruction but this man is in fact the man who was sending these pipe bombs\nHe's not wired he was looking for an excuse it could have been every anything I mean it's like the tragedy of two people shot and then a parking lot of the supermarket chain 'em right away you're going to listen and find out or a black church before that I mean we live in a world of hatred today because he actually then\nWe have left all of this ugliness run rare but to the point now we don't know we're reaching across the aisle or shaking someone's head or bracing somewhat as trivial as this sounds we have lost sight of even knowing our neighbors\nThat's how bad of the country we live in today and a lot of a right to do was all over the years of our economy spiraling out of control and letting the beginnings of main street America erode to where\nThe manufacturing plants that people worked out for generations have been taken away from us and to me no one should be shocked this this was it was just coming this was coming for years and is finally coming to ahead now it's that simple\n[noise] yeah yeah it is really a belly is I'm a ... like you're saying it's it's every day\nIt's not just one blip on the screen saying okay we're going to deal with this that that the other and this has gotten on a scale where like you say even your neighbor is that that you're looking and saying well I was making everybody on added should it really really should\nAnd you've got some great media outlets out there unlike unlike others I'm a huge fan of CNN\nFox all of them ABC NBC CBS there Sunday Morning magazine shows this story I wouldn't add a whole lot to it\n... would be the story but it wouldn't be the only story\nAnd I would get back out on the campaign trail and I'd follow these politicians these women and men Republicans and Democrats and I get in the grill and I'd say look what are you going to do if you remain in office or what are you going to do if you get in office to create a\nBetter economy and to make it more corporate America friendly for manufacturing what are you going to do to help the resources that made this country great steel coal nuclear energy\nWhat are you gonna do and if they don't have an answer I Would make it a point to they don't have an answer\nIf every politician out there on the stump right now I don't care if it's this governor's race the one in Ohio US Senate race if we do not\nForce the issue here shame on us because we are going to let a golden opportunity slip right through our fingers\nAnd it just can't be it can't be we can't let it happen\nBecause we may never get an opportunity like the job growth do we have right now to actually take it to the next level and these politicians are the ones who can do it\nBut if we focus on all of this negative it's never going to get better in America it's\nOnes who can do it but if we focus on all of this negative\nIt's never going to get better in America it's not and we have nobody to blame but ourselves All right next to a point breeze your Joanne Joanne Hi how are you Ron I Am good\nYou know I don't know why we can't call this as it is and and make this president like making [noise] but\n[noise] you know some say he needs to stop this because we have a lot of unhinged people I'd and hits people out here and this is a lot of what's going on he needs to stop this nonsense\nThis is America we're looking like idiots and falls in and what is wrong I don't care what you say and people say we hate this man\nI don't like his the way his policies are he keeps so much nonsense up there people are just so unhappy and it only takes a little bit to the\nTo make them move forward you know and so that's like you say well that continue to want to say we hate this man no we don't we don't many of us don't like his policies this is the uh the United states we cannot have someone continue to be doing in and talking in three o'clock in the morning and one o'clock\nOr sending out these these these awful a a [noise] a tax you know and just keep people on ads this just does not make sense
