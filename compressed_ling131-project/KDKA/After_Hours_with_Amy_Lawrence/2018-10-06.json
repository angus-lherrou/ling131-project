active phone call at the time he may not have gotten the alert but otherwise there's no way to opt out of the alerts and Warner CBS News New York\nNew York times investigation is casting doubt on President Trump's claims she's a self made billionaire\nI got a very very small loan from my father many years ago I built into a massive empire as I said my father back that law\nMr Trump has said that loan was for one million dollars but according to a New York times investigation the president was given or inherited the equivalent of at least four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father was real estate empire\nMuch of his wealth came from what the times called who may have seen by the Trump family including\nSetting up a sham corporation to disguise gifts from their parents\nAnd creating a strategy to undervalue real estate holdings on tax returns the times estimates the Trump family avoided paying at least five hundred and fifty million dollars in gift and inheritance taxes\nPaying just over fifty million instead in a tweet President Trump's slammed the times for doing a quote very old boring and often told his piece on me President Trump has previously boasted of taking advantage of tax laws without breaking them\nI have really ugly use those laws tax investigators in New York state are now reviewing the allegations Kenneth Greg CBS News\nNew York it's not a good time to answer the phones on Capitol Hill Haley bird at the Weekly Standard knows why Hillary joins me on the line Haley has been an onslaught of cause to Congress what's going on and just so busy or the phone lines\nSo a lot of officers keep track of how many calls they get a per week usually depending on the topics that Congress has addressing so in the Senate right now predictably you have a lot of calls to key senators about a judge Kavanaugh and uh it's it's just a lot of activism going on that\nIt it's questionable how effective it is but my colleague Tony ... and I recently wrote a story about a transfer calling and patch through college which is another form of advocacy that different groups use\nIts it's widespread on Capitol Hill and so some of these are also coming through this week\nIs that a new tactic can you explain the\nSo it's not new it's been around for a few years but a few staffers told us\nA call in general have gone up since Trump was elected and had health care\nWhich was really a tense time on Capitol Hill with a lot of activists I'm so a lot of these issues this so that sort of advocacy has become more widespread staffers take issue with it because they say that it doesn't represent constituent fairly\nUh because you know basically advocacy groups are recruiting constituents and then passing them through to their congressmen if they agree with them on a subject\nCan you give me a sense of how inundated Congress is right now with these calls and do you have a an idea of how well they're keeping up\nSo it's sort of tough to say because a lot of this data is a public I've heard from some staffers that it's very similar to health care which was just a very hectic time it's but putting a number on it it's really difficult\nAnd usually it's I I assume low level staffers are taking these these phone calls at first\nSo these are like twenty two to twenty four year olds most of them who take these phone calls I'm which can be stressful for them because you know you'd have Susan Collins his office saying that a lot of their female staffers have been threatened with rape and things like that and in light of the Capitol hearing\nIn light of the Capitol hearing a lot of violent threats do happen on these phone calls and the staffers or just have to keep up the professional demeanor um when when speaking to these constituents and it depends on what they are actually uh the colors are living in the state or not\nUm because senators don't really take into account if it's an out of state color because they want to cater to the people who actually live where they represent\nWhat you're seeing a more organized attempt at at these daily lose use of phone calls\nSure and one thing that we noticed in reporting this story is but it really happens for a lot of leash political issues like I said net neutrality\nUm appropriations bills where basically an organization will like I tell them telemarketer situation happens where they will call up a constituent and say\nHey how you feel about duck you think that these immigrants should stay here um what do you think and then the person on the other end of the line will say something usually they're confused\nI'm at which point the telemarketer will pass them through the to their member of Congress\nA and confusion I Would say is one of the key give away its for congressional staffers here because the constituent on the other end of the wind doesn't really know what's happening a lot of the time\nAll they know is that they were called the the conversation oftentimes goes a little bit like hello and and the staff are on the other side is high you've reached the ... the congressman's office um do you need anything and then the constituent says no you called me and so that sort of ... that sort of confusion\nReally gives the way to staffers that this is not as authentic as it with like like the advocacy groups would like for them to think it is um other times you know the constituents actually just outright say you know I was told to tell you this\nAnd I actually think that uh one one staffer told me that they had gotten a call one of these pass through calls whereas a constituent had been told to tell them to oppose tax cuts back in the winter\nUp and the constituents said you know they told me to tell you I don't like tax cuts that I you sort of like tax cut so there's it there is some room for error and these calls\nTrial by fire trial by phone from Capitol Hill Weekly Standard reporter hilly bird or we can run and

prison McKay and I'm really glad you're with us today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affects each and every one of us and that stress and believe it\nOr not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael Pincus and Dr bank is just going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those that may not know Dr ... he is a nationally recognized authority unnatural an alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional ... athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr biggest thanks so much for being with us today\nAnd thanks for it's great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\n[laughter] you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure and so the waste stress affects the body is this I'm On a person's under stress\nThe body transpose is a stress into tension and\nYour muscles end up contract and everyone feels that in there in the upper back in ... right and the doctor I'm more concerned about\nThe muscles that you don't feel such as the muscles didn't arteries that go up and the mother's heart is a giant myself do right and the muscles\nIn and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties yet I Want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients\nThat is completely handle the body in terms of stress okay according to the research that I've been involved with this as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nCounting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people do you know they just don't sleep when you wake up tired your body hurts more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon he gets sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and I feel for roses and fibromyalgia\nAnd cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture and it has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet\nIf someone's taking in their diet or how many calcium supplements or how many in Athens you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith Kelsey um being something to do with stress season calcium for building bones\nWell yes okay yeah and it does build your teeth but he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart and your brain your kitten easier Oregon's and your body shutdown actually died\nWow this one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to us from the bones themselves ...\nAbsorb it back from the bones if neither\nThat's right I see and what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis writes in which has a weakening of a ball\nAnd that's due to the bunny deriving the calcium from the bones instead of\n... yeah okay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nFor sure just drink milk just drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right\nAnd second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really because things like pastures Asian foods are irradiated um the calcium as leach from the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the house would start driving later but these things don't absorb and the body\nIn a time for a couple of reasons\nOne when you take a let's say on antacid that had the ... like a first of all calcium does not absorbed in the body unless it's an an acidic environment but to see what happens when you take a Tom\nIsn't antacid so okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself has that been absorbed\nI see because it has to be in a in an answer an environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called ... formula\nBut comics formula is natural and the differences is that the powder and what happens if you put it in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it down so it's in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbs into your system\nWow so that solves the problem that\nWell yeah because when calcium and easy Myrna liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWell that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says I sensed absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder well\nIt comes down to absorption one of the ways to tell if you're not observing calcium is take a look at what drugs they're taking\nAre you on high blood pressure medication\nDo you need something for your kidneys or you aren't pain medications you need sleeping pills because the calcium and especially the need is being absorbed ... you're not going to suffer from all these things my comment formula says absorb incredibly in the body the thing is is that what do you take my comment formula but not like well well I feel better\nI have thousands of people right if the doctor pain 'cause I Can't believe it thirty minutes after it took to counter\nThe pain in my wrist one way or I was able to sleep for the first time in years I mean this is really amazing\nI Want to

central talking travel a new now are we will have some open talk then but then again at one o'clock we kick back into a weekend magazine it is I get well naturally of course the Weiner wellness center\nAnd then we wrap up with ah the Rogers show but I Want to get right to it you know [noise]\nNot didn't want to make this thing political but you know we didn't throw the first punch those of us who've been saying this is a this Kavanaugh thing it's been more of a destruction as far as our democracy is concerned\nThe procedural vote one in favor of cabinet and we all we're talking about that yesterday as I was filling in for Mardi Griffin\nAnd fifty one forty nine to vote Joe Manchin the Democrat a you know from west by God Virginia and Susan Collins Republican we're really taking it on the chin pretty much for them saying yes Murkowski as well but more so for for mansion who said he was undecided and being a Democrat didn't help him but you know I think he's\nWanting to wanting to make democracy and and the wheels keep rolling in turning in the right direction so kudos to him but\nHere's the thing you know I just have to get your thoughts on this and and and and there's a couple of ways I'm looking at this this morning that big boat coming up later today\nBut here's the thing you know I don't really want to make this political but that they have and here's a good example when asked yesterday who would run against Susan Collins the former national uh security advisor president Brock Obama they very capable Susan Rice said she would\nWell that's kind of like a political jab if you will wouldn't you think\nBut now if you really want to counter punch and I hope that they do it in a very discreet but to the point kind of way but don't you know go crazy on on how they respond by talking politically if you want to know how this you're going to help the president\n... right right okay hello yeah I mean you\nYeah I mean I'm I'm saying I'm you know trade schools you know like a lot of high school to really\nUnderstanding and a lot of you all gentlemen and you know men and women don't want to go into a being a lawyer or a doctor or whatever they want a trade that they are going to be good at it and this is something that a lot of high school kept really adopted or been doing that\nSo I think that will be a good idea but it it\nIs they're taken awhile to get some system school system in some states to realize that somehow\nYeah yeah so where do you think about this whole mess\nUh with Kevin all yeah being passive [noise] I I think it's wrong um the kids alone to Supreme Court is a lifetime position first of all you know and once you do that a little bit his feelings about women\n[noise] um he has the power with the you know with boats his way you know against when he was right and things like that that that will be progressive for women and I believe I Believe he did they say that woman I gave her kudos for coming out like that because he had to see it that guy is we\nSee in the air but I think it did not understand what that what's momma that way that caused a lot of women all goes it got to be easy to gauge his everyday\nThat they're afraid because no one will believe\nAnd I'm proud of her doing that and the FBI said investigated they didn't find anything yeah they found something but even if they hadn't passed or he would have gotten in any way he would have gotten next one that the staff at the belief that drum pass\nMhm about when I was really feel like that but I Do\nWell that's okay I mean that's good human knows from your heart or you feel that's that's\nYeah yeah I mean I I'm saying that you know who puts his mindset now I don't know I mean you get up there and Ellen under oath and you're lying as well Kavanaugh daddy died under oath about what he athlete in\nSo that that we have to look forward to on the court I mean you remember that black man does on Supreme Court forget his name but they interviewed a woman chief or was that there now and she said that he had sexually harassed her no one that nobody believed that it happened\nTo him a cornerstone eggs right about ... ... ... you know and so for me all the interviews and people are saying they think they're not saying them just to pass the time of day it actually happens to these women and it's happening all across the country\nAll over the world and that women are being left at that fact\nThat's that you know women had to write for the fight for an equal pay for equal a job you know you'll hang job you should get equal pay\n'em that it's going to turn back bangs I Believe you know I I guess failed deflate means and then the woman the woman is on the court they interviewed her about her history and everything like that this woman is very accomplished in a way she fought for four women\nOn the Supreme Court and like I said well people may not lose sight of the fact that it's a lifetime thing is that\nThe only way that you we could retire or you'll dying and and um being on the Supreme Court he has he has the power within a few years both as a voting for Trump to sway things and bring things back\nFor women that have been already been fought for and I just I just think it's a bit more than it's ever going to do he lied under oath it when they did not lose sight of that\nI'm not saying he's that same math day but if he had told the truth and and not in past that he would have been it you\nKnow like ... and I'm really disgusted with it\nOkay fair enough right Suzanne come off your walk in and have a great day let's go to a mount Washington and say good morning to Ted Ted hey welcome to get a get radio you're doing but\nWe're going on wrong I'd go man oh man living I'm ready to drive there you go\nA little quick are under ... mouth was going to get in you know but it's going to cost Republicans when it comes to the women vote you're pretty much going to be too [laughter] when it comes to the drawing a backfire on the Republican\nAs far as Trump um I'll bring the one thing you're you're not saying ... decided to drop\nOut right and we're in trouble runs they're going to be independent there's going to split the vote and you're going to get a Democrat president saying they mean what happened to a Bill Clinton that's how you got and thanks for Ross Perot and I think it might be Michael Bloomberg might run up to independence\nThat might be enough to rear its way vote so\nYou know I haven't I haven't heard about Michael Bloomberg in a while that's kinda interesting\nYeah I think he may lead to pay attention to what's going to run as an independent because that's the thing about Trump he got a lot of independent votes if you could fly for a little bit of that he came when ... you're gonna have to and it's going to have to have to work so\nThat more than just jobs for in the lobby their like tax cut because it went to the top one percent not to the little guy even though this guy said he's a champion of the little guy\nAlso health care um die as a problem especially in Pennsylvania what high marks and you can see fighting a lot of the usa says all worried about that\nSo there's a lot on the plate with a job and everything else and also the minimal wage yes that's a nationwide issue I mean the president should have raised a memorial to last summer the rave was George W. Bush\nShowed that will be issued if it's not addressed\nIs far wider east coast new ways to win\nWell that's why I said he has to do anything and I mean we even be desperate if he asked me\nWhy was that for doing that debate I thought that debate was a disgrace spice you buy a game show host I think what he was you know when he was supposed to be to monitor you went out alone when he's talking about the Catholic Church in a lot of other issues that why you need a real journal is not an entertainer when you want to have serious debates\nUh so I thought it was a disgrace for Pennsylvania and when it came to a governor debates that should never have\nWhat do you think happened to Alex ... which flip the switch or make it okay it's time but then he would just go on these start asking what was the what was it because maybe he's so structure on the game show that he had an open Mike and he took advantage of it I mean I've never heard any and I've moderated those\nNever heard anybody do what he did\n... when you have a game show host an entertainer as there has been the monitor what the ... that's what you get ... when it comes to the debate\nOr you know as as America we have to take the bait seriously because the fix all of us and you're able to have a game show host Michael Savage journalists you know someone that as a real question some liquid fuels after it had nothing to do with our state\nI don't care what happened in California you know it you know so I mean I I just thought it was a disservice ... says the Pennsylvania ... never been you know selected and I'm like I say well without Wagner\nHe had some rain the what the president thinks he's found like a real desperate guy\nAnd to me when you're there for like that and I have NO PLAN you don't lose really didn't push wolf that much\nFamily fortune when he talked about and\nAnd to me that is an issue but the one thing about ... is our level in politics and say hey look we're going to get your full more capable of on keep all kinds of its share of the you know you certainly by exam and and kill the average the Harrisburg were going to get the same thing all the time\n[noise] I don't think anybody really would have a chance against a governor wants to be quite Frank with you I I I think the guy just\nKept his you know self below the radar the entire time and just plows forward and it hasn't made many ways so I and being that this is still such a heavily democratic state especially on the other side of the state I don't think anybody would have given him a run\n... Wagner you'll always fair for why already running you know ... that's the one thing about it anytime you've not far off if you want to know the motivation by body wanted to go why won't be president you know\nWagner really have to clarify why he gets you know we've thought about war but those things matter and if you're going to run for office people got to you know you got to hear your electric wires does\nNot have them All right let them read them I Want to lose\nLet me let me get through this little break I have to take to get to the news with Ted I always love hearing from your great input called again okay\nAll right buddy\nListen we got a Kevin and Jerry and Matt we're going to get to all we've got like a half hour left an open talk than we are shift gears in begin the six o'clock hour with a new piece of programming that will be here every weekend titled legal legal is you're going to love what they do as far as the laws concern hope you'll stay tuned for that and stay with is the rest of the day all the way until three o'clock this afternoon good morning\nMeg line band or land man\nOn my own time when you're on your end of this for mills mall [noise]\nI've worked in the pet industry for over Thirty years ago and should tell you my ... in federal make your life center and here's why\nWith my New Year's service we work together to find the proper breathe which was nice of you and your family best often find that people don't always realize all the ... using the right three such a size temperament and allergies I always have a great selection of puppies available for you at my store from ... to St Bernard\nBut we don't have their special Britain our store I was like my breeders\nDo I have a longstanding relationship with the find your special but then all of our puppies are metric virtually all shot somewhere measure up to date or publisher microchips in every three or help wanted as a perfect time to make your life\n\nI'm a Nineteen eighty two I was a senior in high school in center I had more things don't worry about and and what I was doing and and that's I that's a female inappropriate I'm Sorry but I didn't ... didn't tied down and then had five guys with me I'm Sorry that you don't happen\nBut I don't drink either I'm allergic to alcohol\nWell it's it's definitely been a very trying time for our country and I think for us to move forward we're going to have to find a way to really put this to rest is sooner than later I mean it's a central it really is hey I appreciate the call thanks well what\nAbout what I said to begin the program nobody wants to say anything about that president can really turn this into a win win might some could say once this is done his best week in office to date\nAnd how is it that you're going to be able to spend the fact that the job numbers are the best they've been since December of Nineteen sixty nine is just came out yesterday\nSo he uses that and obviously this confirmation if it gets done and he's spreads the the message is going to be an eerie on Wednesday I mean you have to think that he's feeling pretty good right now and when you think the caller investigation for the most part has kind of quieted down quite a bit\nA collusion that's quieted down\nI'm quite a bit so I don't know I think things are kind of looking up for our president eight six six three down one ten twenty dollar bank instant access can carry radio dot com protect men the right on the line best deal in town let's go to a man on the north side going yeah how are you\nAh you think this was a great way for him I'm surprised um because um [noise]\nAll of the flip flops he had to do to keep a pill limit that investigation\nI mean they're ... they're finding that Kavanaugh was reaching out to people to try to ah keep them from yeah talking about things that it happened before even came up before you and I even knew about it\nUm but nobody you know no one was able to interview people who had information weren't able to to be interviewed even\nA ... neither here nor there I mean he ... got to get on it's spring court but I don't think women are going to forget what happened because everyone either had experiences are new people who had experiences\nAnd most people did not come forth and and and they're sitting on this stuff and they're angry [laughter]\nUm so that didn't go well and the fact that all of the financial stuff about Trump came out and uh all the tax evasion and everything [noise] uh I don't think this was a good week for him I think you know there's going to be some concern that um\nThat his family members as they come to be coming up against the courts in ways that I don't even know if they knew like here's a sister who's the judge and and you know she may or may not have even known where her money was coming from and that there was tax evasion\nThe whole family was you know is getting money that was done in the ... the way um I mean people who knew from like people who Trump knew that he would he did dishonest things\nAnd always have but\nI don't think I you know maybe maybe\nI'm just an optimist about people I don't think the whole family knew\nEverything that they maybe they did because they loan the money to get them out of Iraq over and over but but it may have been financial\nYou know here I Am making apologies for the rest of the family it may have been financial people that that that worked on all those fans action center says we'll find here we're gonna [noise] you know do this or whatever I don't know\n[noise] um so I don't think this was a good week for him\nWell one thing I think we'll know where he goes with this you have to win this whole thing gets done today and if he starts using it on the campaign trail I think one of the reasons is because they kind of fire the first shot by a former national security advisor president rock Obama Susan Rice thing I Will challenge Susan Collins and twenty twenty\nBut uh you
