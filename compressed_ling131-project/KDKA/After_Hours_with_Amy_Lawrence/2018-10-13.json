S. is on the ground in Pyongyang and it was very evident um in that moment that they were controlling what was happening\nThe narrative and uh the logistics\nYet at the end of it bumper comes out saying we're farther down the road repairs\nBrown to for potential second summit between the president and and chairman Kim so obviously they feel like a they made some garbage on this\nThey did make some yard edge in terms of continuing us North Korea discussions on at the end of August\nAnd beginning of September ... trip to North Korea was canceled we thought that it looks like the two countries weren't really interacting anymore well now at least discussion seem to be back on track\n'em and North Korea did agree a pump has had to allow some inspectors into one of their nuclear test

five dollars off tomorrow sleep dot com\nSource and here's where you'll have funny you can\nWell ... how many ... acids you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress season calcium for building bones\nWell yes okay yeah it does build your teeth but he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart and your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually dies\nWow it's all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to is from the bones and south\n... absorb it back from the bones if neither\nThat's right and I say and what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of a ball\nAnd it's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from dying tradition yep\nOkay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you'd think that would be really easy\nTo be sure just drink milk and just drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right\nAnd second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really because things like pastures Asian irradiated um the calcium as leach from the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the house which started driving a car but these things don't absorb and the body it's time\nFor a couple of reasons one uh when you take a let's say an antacid that had the ... like a first of all calcium does that absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but see what happens when you take a Tom is an antacid\nSo okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is that being absorbed\nIn icy because it has to be in a in an answer an environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called but count max formula\nQuite combat formula is natural\nAnd the differences is that\nThe powder and what happens is you put it in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it down so it's in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbs into your system\nWow so that's ...\nYeah because ... calcium and magnesium earn a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWow that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says I sensed absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to absorption one of the ways to tell if you're not observing calcium is take a look at what drugs are you're taking\nAre you on high blood pressure medication do you need something for your kidneys or you want pain medications you need sleeping pills because the calcium and especially the easiest being absorbed ... you're not going to suffer from all these things\nMy comment formula says absorb incredibly in the body the thing is is that what do you take my comment formula but not like well well I feel better I have thousands of people right in the ...
