President Trump has talked about coming to Pittsburgh and come into your synagogue in the aftermath of this do you want him to calm [noise]\nThroughout the president of the United states is always love some um\nSome citizen he's my president is certainly welcome\nIn a way we talked about this yesterday by the way the good or any of these anchors to find their definition of hate right uh you know that's what it comes down to is that\nUm the as as if it's one sided ... when they call the president you know a hateful\nAnd they talk about the divisiveness or in the moments we mean moments after such a tragedy they themselves are being divisive\nBeen in a while I don't know I don't I I think a lot of them are driven by by their debt own definition of hate that's what I mean\n\nThere that's on full display is it not\nBecause define hate for me\nBut you just hate all the time somebody define because I don't know what I remember we change the definition of boards all the time mhm so I don't know what the definition of the word hate is now from the the mainstream media what's what's what's the definition\nMhm well and I think that that right now it it is clear attempt to position time and time again\nThis president uh Republicans a and they've been doing it for I don't know how many years now as people who are evil and and filled with hay\n\nBut did it from from from day one with this president\nYou know if we can't get through with the uh ... with the Russian collusion thing will just move on to just hey I'll wake advantage of ... in order to do when when you when you

point I Believe that a lot of the mainstream media uh come from this at a sec\nFrom a secular point of view ... you notice when they talk to somebody like the rabbi [noise]\nOh that's a very good thing that there's no debate going on and I like wouldn't even want to have this discussion no black to them I Believe it's blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah but when you invite the president right it's like you're not giving you the answer I Want you know well what what about the president when is the president invited the will of course the president ... ... why would you even ask that question\nSteve because the problem is is that the liberal media\nAnd liberals in general it doesn't help them to separate the two the rabbi making the point that this is not political right that that this kind of hatred is is\nIn all of us so the point being is that it can be there can be a a number of different motives and it it's not about the American political landscape it's not\nIt's about somebody who has evil in their heart that wants to take the lives of others we're not talking about someone who is\nUh just shouting at people we're not talking about someone who just decided that they were going to show up on the on the steps of the synagogue and and protest against people of the Jewish faith\nThis person decided to go in and take multiple lives\nTrump's fall must

then stepping back on a we didn't do that and we ... we didn't say he committed or he's directly responsible\nWhat are you saying that\nRight\nBecause if you're if you're trying to make the point\nThat anything that Trump has said and I don't know a trumpet set about Jews that would be viewed as negative all I Know is that when it comes\nTo the Jewish faith\nTell me a bigger supporter of Israel than Donald Trump\nI haven't\nGosh how far do we have to go back and look ... look when you when you go to the un I'll play the audio coming up here I'll find it didn't get a chance to play yesterday but I'm from Alan Dershowitz he goes right after the Democrats for having such a cozy relationship with Louis Farrakhan right\nAnd that's okay that's\nJust come right fleet lead glossed over from ... exactly it's from from from Obama Clinton and as if it doesn't exist and that's why I brought up earlier that if you're going to bring politics into it you've got you cannot without being biased and and this is where\nOr when we look at the media we say you want to see the bias there it is right there how come they're not asking a former President Obama\nUh when we look at the media we say you want to see the bias there it is right there how come they're not asking a former President Obama\nShould stay away from Pittsburgh why isn't that being said\nWell because he look listen to the description\nAh adjust\nReal simple from ... both Farrah Khan formerly known as Louis acts as an American religious leader\nBlack nationalist activist and social commentator that's how he's described they'll tell you that he's a an activist that's the word they use have you're listening to the things he said\n\nHe doesn't have hate in his heart\n\nAnd and it no that's fine meeting with Farrah Khan is fine Trump is the proper hairs are again\nOne of the most well known or a\nJewish attorneys in America Alan Dershowitz there can't be any tolerance we have to have zero tolerance President Obama meets with Farrah Khan shame on him President Clinton since the same platform was Farrah Khan shame on him Keith Ellison joins would Farrah Khan valid Farrah Khan is one of the greatest purveyor of anti Semitic eight\nJust because he's black doesn't give them a pass on anti Semitism and any liberal who has any positive association with Farrah Khan is part of the problem not part of the solution right that's completely lost and CNN\nBut you're going to say\nBecause if you're going to say what has what has Trump said that sounds like somebody\nWho has Trump met with on a high level who is anti Semitic\nWell some people that because that's that's crap some people there are some people that listen to the show that I guarantee I don't agree with their philosophy\n\nSome people support you because some people listen to you does not mean that you have universal agreement on them or doesn't mean\nThat you can find a ... as it happened to you you find somebody who comes

being that an incoming president colluded with the Russians to hack the election mhm and they hounded that\nYear in and year out you know it's ah when when you look at it and we just to you know talked about you know the whole lock her up thing with Hillary Clinton and how the Democrats have jumped on that same see how in civil he is this is how radical they are their same lock her up lock her ... and we just explain why\nBut we had right earlier that to have the analysis of the Democrats running on health care increase wages and getting rid of government corruption ... white admitted they only what's the what is the only government corruption that we know of\nWhat is the the the biggest ally looked into the living room\nOf government corruption many people believe it's that Hillary absolutely broke the law and was not prosecuted because of it it's ... it's the entire Russian collusion\nAs we're learning more it's the allegation from the Democrats over and over again that this president ... or you know a a as in their own words are committed treason because he colluded with the Russians to hack\nThe election that it was changed the outcome of the election and what have we learned in that time in that time we ... we have learned it is the opposite that it was the Democrats and the Hillary campaign\nThat actually paid money to a law firm that funneled that money to an

I I just think that it's\nIt's something where they they're on full display or by the way they don't believe they're wrong for doing it you know she she made this comparison to ISIS and made this absurd statement because she believes she's right\nNot because she's trying to get attention not because of anything else\nShe believes it was the right thing to say and that people agree with her on it then it's responsible to say that she believes in fact it's her responsibility to point out what is clearly\nBlatantly falls but she thinks it's right\nLooking here at some of the polling from Rasmussen which might affect the election next week more voters now commend President Trump for his economic leadership butter less impressed by his performance when it comes to foreign affairs that's good news\nThe next week more voters now commend President Trump for his economic leadership butter less impressed by his performance when it comes to foreign affairs that's good news though for Republicans facing election with voters said Trump and the economy are the big issues the latest rash but some reports\nNational television and online survey finds at fifty one percent of likely us voters give the president good or excellent marks for handling the economy thirty three percent still write his performance in this area as poor\nTrump's economic positive to continue to rise from thirty nine percent in August of last year now to a a fifty one percent forty nine percent gave his economic ... gave his economic uh a performance\nGood or excellent marks for months ago when it comes to foreign policy forty five percent of voters said Trump is doing a good or excellent job down slightly from forty seven percent in June forty four percent consider his performance poor bought\nThe cab yet here just six percent right national security as our top voting issue right so it's really not an issue that's a point that I was going to make our said as long as\nWe're not we're as long as we're not at a war you know new a new war people don't care right uh the we see a a survey this is what does this here the president's job approval rating\nHas been in the high forties uh for most days in recent months speaking at a higher fifty one percent two weeks ago Trump's approval is tracking higher than President Obama's at this stage in the presidency on the Rasmussen poll\nPredictably eighty eight percent of Republicans saying Trump is doing a good or excellent job of handling the economy but only Nineteen percent of Democrats agree well eighty percent of the G O P voters give positive remarks the president and his handling of foreign policy Seventy seven percent of the Democrats say he is doing a poor job\nAmong voters not affiliated with either major party fifty one percent said Trump is doing a good or excellent job\nOn the economy but only forty three percent feel that way on a foreign policy the older the voter the more strongly they approve\nOf the president's job performance when it comes to both the economy and foreign policy while black unemployment is at a historic low blacks are much more critical of the president's economic performance than whites and other minority voters blacks are similarly unimpressed by the handling of his foreign policy\nEconomic and consumer confidence already is at near record highs is moving up again in the latest Rasmussen consumer spending update now that's interesting to say that when it comes to economic things because I saw Rasmussen uh that uh he released a few hours ago the president's latest job approval rating\nAnd here's what he writes Trump approvals today back at fifty percent black voter approval at record high\nWell\nSo we're talking about the economic and inform but overall they say Trump's black approval right now I'm at a record\nHigh yeah well and and I I think right now you're seeing again everyday people this this is the question as it is with every election what is what is what are the American people thinking right but\nBut but really we're not talking about real things we're not talking about I mean in part on the positive side as the last caller pointed out\nYou know he focuses on the winning which which I I Would assume we didn't get to ask them but I Would assume it would include the economy things that are going on the positive things that are going on with the economy but but really it's it's not about that what drives the election right now if you think about it\nBecause there were conservatives before Kavanaugh\nIt's not about that what drives the election right now if you think about it because there were conservatives before Kavanaugh\nThere were conservatives that clearly recognized the positives and the economy but they're still never truckers they're still right now maybe going to sit on the sidelines for a while\nA number of them can't quantify it but let's just I think it's safe to say there were a number of that right so there's that that part of the Republican Party that after Kavanaugh looked at it and said I'm OK the game has changed\nNow it really is about building this wall around the constitution as I've been saying\nIt is about protecting the things that are very real and we can have our inhouse discussions on what to do here what to do their terror of no terrorists by the way we're the original tariffs babies\nAll of that can be discussed internally no problem we can have those very real debate on very real issues with no issues going forward because right now\nThe the the game has to be the end game must be protecting the constitution because the process is being ... it was it was all but shredded\nIn terms of the confirmation process uh Brett Kavanaugh ah they were given way too much leeway but guess what ultimately it works\nI think to the benefit I don't know if it will actually show that in the house of if it will mean a win for the Republicans in the house but it showed enough to bring the Republican Party together like I've\nNever seen it in a one thing I just want to bring up here 'cause we're talking about the different uh you know challenges out there you're talking about you know never Trump or\nWhatever you know maybe staying at home and I was thinking of a local story here you heard that the Dallas Morning news endorsed a better or ... and they claim you know you hear other the conservative the conservative Dallas Morning news or conservative Dallas Morning news and the conservative Dallas Morning news yeah there's no way that you can be a conservative\nAnd support ... or work number Ted Cruz no no you're not a conservative and I started thinking when I saw that story to begin with\nHow many think about this in the media there seems to be what Jennifer Rubin for example I'm a Republican conservative no you're not\nYou're not a Republican conservative she's she's a liberal or a Max Boot who is the the form in fact could talk ... former conservative\nColumnist to see the picture of him with Stormy Daniels and the other day yeah like it's like wait a minute\n[laughter] yeah nice conserve your Stormy Daniels and he posted a picture of\nA him with Stormy Daniels like proudly on on uh on on a a a Twitter and which is like it was most bizarre thing in the world and and you look at other you know you look at a a a um a Bill Kristol mhm ah who just has lost it you see John Case it\nOr who just you know completely have shown that they're not conservatives but you've got in in the media you have a a lot of different people who are claiming that they're conservatives and they're speaking for the conservative movement but they're not conservatives anymore and I don't mean because they're not supporting Trump\n\nOr I'm Talking about there any allergy has actually changed who they support actually changes ... you can sit there and say maybe I don't like Donald ... I don't like Donald Trump but I don't like the fact that Cruz now is with Donald Trump and so I'm not going to vote for it to say you're voting for federal roared because\nBecause the ... the Ted Cruz and conservativism has failed you\nHow is with Donald Trump and so I'm not going to vote for it to say you're voting for ... because because the ... the Ted Cruz and conservativism has failed you is the most bizarre thing on the planet you could possibly say it makes no critical thinking sense at all you're not a conservative why\nBecause as a conservative ... what is the most important thing and let's go to the late Andrew Breitbart who before he died was on our show\nAnd we asked him you know why should people vote for Romney back in twenty twelve mhm Supreme Court you know if Trump was done if Trump was done today I'd be happy\nI was I said that to a friend over the weekend or because they were like okay but but but the work's not even he's not able to get work done because then I said no he's he's got a lot done I said but but imagine even the tax cuts didn't get done\nI'd like to imagine that 'cause now I'm paying more in taxes let me let me a method that ... would you please [laughter] um [laughter]\nBut imagine that you know there were a number of things and and imagine even that the economy ... weren't growing as fast or a ... and they will be happy ... there are a number of things here and again we don't\nIt's not the we never cheer the endgame you and I are ... the race is never finished because\nThere are so many things to do\nBut it's what we're looking at

president has been criticized you know that uh well he uh after you know the the uh mail bomb scare and the uh the temple mass murders\nThat you know he went on to you know continue with you know what politicians do which is coming up to the terms you go after you know your your political opponents\nAnd you go after them for the call I just was laughing yesterday that the media was talking about the fact that you know the president still device if he goes after his political opponents\nOr we need unity\nEvery president calls for unity zero presidents presidents get unity go out to go any further ribs it never happened\nEvery president calls for unity every person calls for unity and then they go out and they do what\nThey express what they believe and they're roughly half the people agree and half the people disagree as soon as you have an opinion you have created a divisive atmosphere how stupid are we\n\nHow stupid is the media\nWorld they're not stupid there they believe that it gets to their advantage but every politician calls for unity and as soon as you open your mouth and say here's what I'm going to do a significant portion of the population disagrees with you [laughter] it is impossible\nFor a politician to create unity in a country\nCan we move on now\nAre we going to are we going to continue living as fairy tale world well the president should promote ... polish Houston but bring everybody together let's stop that on social media we're not going to bring everybody together it's not going to happen\nThat's not that's not how society right on the voting because they because they exist right and that's not how was it a society is is the only way that you can judge that value in the private\nSector it's very simple and I talked to a company today and I said well what's what's been going on you know with you guys what we had to hire three thousand people in the last year alone that's huge and I said I said wow that's\nIt's a it's a it's a problem but it's a good problem to have in growth right the growing economy over the last year to Eighteen months has been so stellar for them that they've had to hire three thousand people\nSee we always talk about the the employee and well they are but we need to protect the job no we need to protect capitalism capitalism will create the jobs the expansion of well there's we're the value was and that\nDoesn't capitalism doesn't care the color of your skin where you came from\nOr anything else it's about what you can do every day when you show up and you actually produce not simply because you exist\nBut because everyone else around you put a value on you\nReality for me and I think it was I've often said to my best learning experience back when I was young when I was younger we had to crawl across the living room on the shed carbon him to change the television channel and then got shocked when we did it [laughter] ah\nA crawl across the living room and the shed carpeting to change the television channel and then got shocked when we did it [laughter]\nAh everybody didn't make the team in little league they cut in little league right and I was a real small wimpy and scrawny kid

America that that he'd come up with a he's talking about the fact that they should have come up with because he's talking about ... proposed Republican pledge on on on healthcare you and I talked about this long time ago that the Republicans\nIn an attempt to fix what's bad is not acceptable step towards a better future and then he goes on to the Republican accomplishments and they go to the accomplishments [noise] you know including eliminating the Obamacare individual mandate\nUh the uh uh six billion new to fight opioid epidemic the past the right to try legislation passed historic VA mission\nOr the Trump Administration providing more affordable health care options for Americans through association health care plans in short term limited to ration plans so they go through that there's ten different ones there then they say the Republican promises for additional improvements\nIf the American people reelect Republicans majority in the house and Senate we pledge to enact a series of practical in specific changes based on what works in the public and private sectors to build a better healthcare system the system will keep people healthy and provide effective treatments and economic security for those who get sick\nThese legislative changes will and they go to the pre existing condition which really goes back to the block grant right\nWe do we do so by committing the resources necessary for states to try new approaches like high risk pools and reinsurance so everyone regardless of medical history has access to affordable insurance but again it goes to the states\nThe states make a decision as to what they wish to do right and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs by requiring additional transparency and accountability across the entire prescription drugs supply chain\nA lower premiums for individuals and small businesses by eliminating the health insurance tax\nReducing Washington's mandates that limit choices that drive up costs for insurance strengthen Medicare by protecting Medicare part D patients from excessive out of pocket costs maximize medical innovation they go through that but basically go through all the things that they should that they should actually do this has been a failure the Republican Party completely\nThere is something that probably Ryan should should have been talking about on a consistent basis there should have been a marketing plan for this with massive television ads leading up to the election that if you will like this is this is our plan this is our contract ... and Newt Gingrich bringing it out and this is two days ago it's too late\nOh yeah yeah ... it's not going to work uh now we're inside of a week first of all it's because a Newt Gingrich is is only going to ... no one is going to uh pay attention to Newt except for the choir\nUm because that's who he's preaching to but you're right with a ... Paul Ryan at the beginning of this year\nWe talked about twenty sixteen all of the we're going to do away with was Obamacare we're going to do away with Obamacare we will do away with Obamacare and then by the time they got there the sentiment by the rank and file a changed and it was like okay well we'll do away with the\nSome of the Obama Care and then they finally got to\nThe individual mandate which of course then undid the funding mechanism\nAnd then forced them eventually will force them\nTo pay for it in another way premiums going up all of the ... which is exactly what we're seeing and we we talked about that disconnect between twenty sixteen and the end of last year\nNow you have this this whole\nConnect between twenty sixteen and the end of last year\nNow you have this this whole new cycle and and whole new opportunity to essentially launch\nThe new plan based on what you do about the public sentiment and they do know what then why wouldn't you do that to say if you give us if if if if we are in charge this is what we want to do and go at a point by point as Newt Gingrich to\nAn end and it should have been it should've been Ryan and the president yeah this is what we're going to do look it isn't done yet and you promote the daylights out of it yet I because it's one of the top issues that Americans care of\nWhat because here's what I Would say too is that there's nothing wrong with saying look the the Senate by the American people is is shifting on health care and this this is where the sentiment of the American people is right now this is what they're telling us this is what they want this is the plan we believe will work\nYou don't necessarily have to go back and apologize for not getting it done because the American people don't care that you didn't get it done but what you do have to do what you are charged with now is because you know you break it you pay for it\nWhat you're going to have to do now is put together a plan a very realistic plan and put it in front of the American people but that's that's not happening I mean Newt Gingrich is one thing the party didn't have well any desire to do\nThe Newt Gingrich wrote it because you saw this was a failure of the Republican I and we said this by the way we got criticism we got criticism we got criticism when we said they're not repealing Obamacare right stop saying it we ... we got criticism and guess what we were right they weren't repealing Obamacare but they were just they were what were they were doing was really what\nThe mandate but the actual benefits stayed which means somebody has to pay for it which was taxpayer money through the back and an increase in premiums but you didn't solve any of the problems right\nAnd so you should have focused on solving the problems immediately there should have been the president and and and this is why we have said that we know that people loved the rhetoric but it's about the winning and it's about getting things\nIt's about getting things done more to the way that we wish to get things done so we don't end up with a Medicare for all so we don't have a monopoly running our health care system of government monopoly running our healthcare system\nAnd this is what the Republicans were supposed to be fighting for and they did not do this they did not do it and we criticized President Trump from the very beginning for not taking a stand on repealing Obamacare but just saying well just sent me whatever and I'll sign right\nBecause the president has shown that when he sticks by something\nLike the corporate and individual tax cuts and he keeps promoting it any kids fighting you know a lot of people have been told us the last couple of weeks\nIt was like about the president that he's fight fight fight fight fight fight fight the fight has to be more than just rhetorical mhm you've got to take the hardy shoes\nAnd one of the hardest issues out there is health care\nWell and and I I've heard the point made by pundits that well you know there are things that ... that he clearly understands that are within his wheelhouse like taxes because he's a businessman but you can not that you want to oversimplify healthcare but what are the main concerns\nThe number one thing that this president did as candidate was too\nOver simplify healthcare but one of the main concerns\nThe number one thing that this president did a candidate was to what we do have knowledge well acknowledge the problem right I mean overall yeah but I did but\nThat's one of the problems deregulation uh know divulging what the problem is with health care regulations part of the ... well yes regulation is the is the problem you have the\nRight now the burden on employers and hospitals that's the problem you have I mean how many different items but you don't even have to get that involved\nThis president easily could point at it and say there are too many the cost of health care going up\nAs a result of I don't know an aging society or something like that is one thing that's not something the government\nIs necessarily going to be able to curb what they can do is get in front of the regulation and that regulation right now is choking in hospitals it's choking employers and as a result who was it that pays\nThe American people in premiums and so\nYou ... and ... and ... and and when he got out and and payments to insurance companies house and and and the the president pointing that out house that's not too difficult you know I've seen those pundits make that case before\nThat well that really wasn't and his we'll have so he was leaving that up to other people know recognizing the the unnecessary skyrocketing costs of health care is well within this will happen\nUntil unless in his mind he believes in Medicare for\nAll right well and then that case he's going to have to start talking about it yeah because otherwise you're not going to get anything done\nBecause if that's what you thought then you should have brought that up already mhm but\nThis is just this is a failure of Republicans on the administration for not you know if if they if they lose the house that is one of the reasons oh yeah no doubt it because they ... they said okay let's just ignore held let's pretend we got rid of Obamacare when we really did mhm is that was to cry and then the president finally had to admit no well no we did\nGet rid of all the bottom of care but I mean but that's ... by the way that's part of the the you know you're not talking about people not wanting bait that's part of the problem that we had with the right amount we said look he didn't get rid of Obamacare yes I did yes he did no we didn't know and people would argue with us why because they just wanted to believe what they wanted to believe in the facts didn't matter in that\nBecause the heavy costs is coming from the regulation that is still in place the hospitals and employers\nAnd by what the you know those those policies and plans have to cover and who pays that we do\nIf he were a trucking industry professional then you need to be in the know and there's no one more in the nose and the readers of fleet
