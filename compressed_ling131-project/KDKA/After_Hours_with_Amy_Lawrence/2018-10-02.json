are any of the Harvard cabs Harris survey this is from uh the daily water dot com or I tried the harbor caps Harris survey\nUh found that when people are told that the tree name witnesses do not cooperate the accusation\nIssues of Christine Blasey Ford opinions shifted decisively in Kavanaugh's favor\n...\nA as a\nThey reported on Monday posed by you God and Reuters found\nThat people largely believe what benefits they're affiliated party more than two thirds of Democrats believe that sexual allegations against Kavanaugh while roughly the same percentage of Republicans do not\nOverall you guys have found that forty one percent belief for thirty five percent believe Kavanaugh Reuters found forty two percent believe for\nThirty one percent believe Kavanaugh Harris Poll chairman Mark Penn a former Bill Clinton pollster reported Sunday that the Harris Poll found that forty percent who saw read parts of the testimonies last Thursday felt that Ford alone seem credible wall twenty three percent alone\nSaid Kavanaugh seem credible alone a total of twenty seven percent said that both seem believable\nOr does sixty seven percent total felt that Ford was credible fifty percent felt that Kavanaugh was credible\nWhere the Harris Poll study gets really interesting is in its findings on the impact of the FBI investigation and the issue of cooperation\nThe credibility of their testimony does not appear to be a decisive factor right span rather that question comes down to cooperation as the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should send to the high court\nWhen we're ... we're told that the three name witnesses do not cooperate forged claims fifty seven percent said they are in favor of his confirmation\n\nIf the FBI found no cooperation for Ford's claims sixty percent said cabinet should be confirmed pen reports\nWell I've seen this on social media I Can't tell you how many polls I've seen\nAny news item I could care less I'll bring up anything that's going on out there why won't they right why will they hide things that are important\nTo a story and even if they disagree with it analyze it right but they they as we've talked about before we talked last week about lying through omission mhm in a lot of stories out there now right but if you live through omission we just won't include parts of it and if and while they'll\nGive an interview to somebody who's making claims that they as a news organization couldn't even corroborate right they will ignore\nA key piece to the actual an official piece of the actual\nProcedure the actual process in place\nThey ignored completely but when you give Americans when you start telling Americans will look here's what's going on with this case and you lay it out to them that's why all of a sudden you go to\nYou know sixty percent say oh or fifty percent ... percent say oh we didn't know okay\nYeah that that's that's wrong if there is no cooperation well and if the FBI finds out there's no one sixty percent of Americans believe that that's almost all of independence mhm yeah and that's what you're looking for that's what you're looking for in any election and we always get this and we've talked about the administration\nAnd said look you could a more successes if you have a consistent solid message day in and day out because well you never convince the liberals that's not your goal

it's like why are they gonna do their own version of losing had well most\nI mean you you asked your off and you're breaking up on us mad men's but but you you you know we've asked ourselves that question a you know where do they go from here remember after twenty sixteen after Trump won in a again ah you know as a as a a former President Obama said there was always a twenty percent\nYou have any [laughter] after the election and do that like I Know it's a hundred percent I'm Out in the smartest president that we ever had to stand the room range to understand that it's a hundred\nPercent because he won a uh but you know they were remember all the self reflection that happened at that time\nEric and I went into hysterical laughter right on time in late November early December twenty sixteen when they started you know getting reflected been saying we need to we need to and just start instead of just\nFlying over flyover country yeah we want some work boots and some coveralls on Amazon we we need to to buy some having to buy\nHaving to work out some coveralls and and we need to go into these towns and find out how the people are ... you know how they're thinking of polls will tell you you don't have to go there\nYou don't I don't know if you really don't\nI don't have to go anywhere to know what a significant portion of the middle class is thinking well\nEven remember the reporter uh who worked for the times that didn't even leave as his apartment to through the stories they said he went to [laughter] what's his name Brian Williams I don't think it was [laughter]\nBut but you know you don't even have to I mean that but it it is a very basic point that how can you be doing analysis real analysis not the opinion how can you be doing that\nIn an election year if you really don't know what the sentiment is I'm not expecting them to have the same internal set of campaign without\nOr that a party would have but I Would expect that they would certainly have somebody maybe inside those campaigns are parties\nThat would see some things and say okay it's there are real because Obama is always a twenty percent chance he said that after the election but really you know it was a couple of idiots overnight said\nDon't don't buy the hype in Pennsylvania watched Pennsylvania watched Pennsylvania because there was something else going on and it was anecdotal but if if we could see that really with out and we did research that we're not going to say there were no tools but\nWe don't have the tools that are available\nThat a news organization like the New York times or Washington Post or\nAny of them have they have rooms filled with people that can whack and do we ...\nDidn't have what either party had that two weeks before they started seeing the turn in Pennsylvania right uh in Michigan and Wisconsin then and we you know we might have had anecdotal evidence but we didn't have the same information\nThat they had where they started seeing that that the turn and and you know remember that as you look at the polls now I mean we're ... we're I'm very interested in what the polls are going to do\nNow for those people that because we always get the people who called ... poles or number right actually they are ... you can find polls as we have done if you listen to the show for any length of time\nWhether it was really twenty twelve and twenty sixteen will really started looking and saying okay what polls were actually correct and what you find out is\nA yeah two months out three months out four months out the polls aren't that accurate once you start getting thirty days in ... you start seeing that the poll start tightening and by the time you get\nTo a couple of days beforehand or people for example say that the polls for drop are completely wrong no they weren't no there were polls that were dead on\nFor the numbers they may not have the polls didn't figure out the electoral votes and you know you and I said well maybe they should start doing that I don't know how much money would cost them to do it right but the the by the time you got to the the the polls are done on what the people are thinking\nUh and and so to get to those specific districts and\nAnd break them down you would probably need more votes you wouldn't be need more numbers than what you what your sample sizes you know country countrywide so that might be a very tough thing to actually do to predict\nBut they did know the internal polls they started knowing about two weeks before that there might be a shift happening or in in certain districts are in Pennsylvania and and uh Michigan and in Wisconsin\nAnd but the fact is the polls on the where the people voted some of them were dead on yeah you're right I mean just within a half a percentage got a point of the actual numbers\nAnd they said don't show Hillary winning Leno show with Hillary would get in the raw vote and that's what she did get very close to it and the same thing for Trump he won the electoral college ... so you know that's something that they've since we've had to elect ... you know two very close votes\n... ah you know back in two thousand and uh in in twenty\nSixteen you know maybe they should start looking to see if they could pole and then\nFigure out the electoral college you know that way if there is a better way it was a better way to do it but\nWhat you saw back in the day with Tim Russert he would he would sometimes break it down and say and paint scenarios going look if this happens here and these districts here and those districts and this this precinct here in this state\nAnd all these come together you could see the electoral votes in this state go to they he would break those down but you couldn't really I don't know that there was a that wasn't so much of a poll as it was really a demonstration as to\nWhere it might go it wasn't based on sentiment that wasn't based on respondents that was based on basically history and indeed given precinct or or any given district in a state you know they would break that down they don't try and do that anymore\nBut if you if you watched election night or twenty sixteen what\nYou saw was this I mean it was a very smog attitude it was they were almost doing it was almost a parade for her\nHillary Clinton and then into the evening the later it got after the polls closed it just went down where it was a downward spiral because\nIt was reality and they had painted the picture and the media helped of something that wasn't true\nAnd they saw it as landslide without looking at again you know how this might\nAdd up right uh but looking at the polls now as we were we were you know doing earlier a ... in our pre show meaning ah I I see a ton of races out there I mean I'm looking at the Arizona race right now the Arizona Senate race Mick Sally versus send them a Christian send them at the Democratic a Democrat and a Martha McSally the Republican\nAnd you know the the last repulsive send them up three seven six and three ah and but the but uh in earlier polls are earlier in the month\nA mix Sally was up by a couple well right now the latest poll was one to the from the sixteen to the twenty okay we're still not into the myths of the whole cabinet thing and cinema was up by three but margin of error four point seven\nSo that's a dead heat\nAnd if you if you look at that overall except for the uh the one likely voter poll by CNN that was that was done where she was up by seven everything else shows that that really is a dead the that is a dead heat right there and we don't know what the polls are going into the cabinet vote\nI think a ... and again I think that\nThe cabinet vote has the potential to energize both but I Do believe that it may energize Republicans more\nBe it he whether he is\nA not confirmed or confirmed the energy that I see right now the motivation the voter motivation on the right to me as much greater than it was too\nTwo weeks ago I don't know if I can necessarily say that about the ... because I think the left has been on maximum overdrive for the last year looking at the last two years looking at this mid term right and so the energy is there I Do think just because I how in ... and it is\nWhen you talk about the possibility\nOf and again you don't we don't know one cabinet is going to do cabin on could get on and do what what what Roberts did you don't know mhm but the possibility and I were talking about were\nRoberts you know change the uh you know the the wording mhm in Obamacare to actually you know to fit the

I just want to talk about the the the president and the agreement on the new trade deals a yesterday this was the president's talking about it yesterday by the way without tariffs\nWe wouldn't be talking about a deal just for those babies out there that keep talking about terrorists that includes Congress so please don't charge tariffs without tariffs you wouldn't be we wouldn't be standing here\nAre just want to spend a couple of moments on this\nThere's been a couple of moments on this we know people want to talk about the cabin all thing but uh this is really a huge deal and I do think that\nUh this is something that the president politically can use a ... to help in the midterms when he's out there doing the rallies you know the the the we got the trade agreement and everything else\nNow the specifics of the the the trade agreement some good some bad mhm uh now the good is we don't go to a situation where we don't have any trade deal with Canada and Mexico that would be bad if the president decided to go in that\nIn that direction I still don't think we won't know know and it's very tough to predict what's not going to happen\nUh but I don't think the president would have ever gone that direction to begin with because there would have been pushback from the Congress yeah in fact I Would I think that President meant to say and that audio we just heard was the threat\nOf tariffs because he knows that terrorists aren't good he's admitted it\nYes uh but the the the when you look at this the free trade agreement and I've got an email today from a guy saying you guys are the only true conservatives but think this deal stinks well number one we haven't really given her opinion on the deal and as we said last night\nThere are some parts of it we don't like it all including the major portion that the president\nHas promoted but there's some good things in there are now we did open up some agriculture and dairy\nNow we heard about the dairy that was one of the big things the president promoted but as of Wall Street journal points out we will only expand our market by one percent when it comes to dairy in Canada but still it's movement in the right direction mhm and if you're making that more free trade world for that\nAnd that's a good\nThing or one of the reasons we didn't hear about timber is because that's one of the victories of Canada got what Canada got was the president remember put the terrifying soft timber or in April I Believe it was\n... he'd give me when he ... he's got my support if if we're going to stand strong against China there's the than in and by the way politically you can get away with that all day long to it's going to it is going to hurt but if they're not going to play by\nThe world Trade Organization rules then not only the U.S but all of our allies and other trade partners with China need to get in line and putting the pressure on them that's a very real strategy\nIn it is going it it has to be effective because I don't know how you can put a cost on on China not playing by the rules and stealing intellectual property time and time again and getting away with\nEight six six Ninety ...

the middle of the night in the U.S\nI said two things about uh the you know the president and and the timing of things so when he was that the the summit in Singapore mhm after they did the the photo op with Kim Jong il and he had his own press conference\nAnd he said to reporters these were global reporters saying look in a year from now I might be I might tell you that this deal did not work out didn't go the way I wanted and I'll probably make up a story you know make up an excuse\nThat was self deprecating humor and the other point that that I think that the other thing that America Mr course was his his wind in his victory speech that night of the election in twenty sixteen\nAnd he's sixteen um because what I what I heard was a humble public servant speaking and of course it wasn't a lot of that wasn't replayed by the media you really had to search for it but when you look at you know the president I think in in front of the people\nEspecially right now we talked about his cabinet being settled in after the first year how he started to appoint people and we said look this is going to play out differently because these the people who are being appointed\nIf they accept that you know ah if they're that nomination than they know what they're in for right so he's getting the people that the put the cabinet and place and the staff in place that he really wants in his second year\nI think the case could be made\nBy recent activity or lack of activity that may be the president is also settling in with the media or he's been directed to tone it down a bit until after the midterms that could be either or but I I I Do believe that the president has always been\nIn the private sector comfortable in his own shoes\nThat changed when he went from having zero bosses to having\nMore than three hundred and twenty million bosses in one night and I think it you know I think it it it had him kind of all over the place a for a number of reasons during the campaign and after the campaign\nAs he became president and I think there's a case to be made as he's settling in and learning the job and and is now ... knows what he can do and what he can't do\nI think there's probably a little more thought\nBased on recent behavior going into communication and how you interact with\nMedia because here's the thing he's winning\nOn the Kavanaugh nomination they wanted an FBI background check he gave it to them then expanded the whole thing on Monday he's winning\nWhen you look at the things that that he's put out there aside from some gas communication wise president is winning the leftist screaming because not because they think that they're winning they know he's winning they know he's resonating\nIn the media especially that's why they call it the resistance and the first place\nIf you want to get in lines are open eight six six Ninety right I Will get to more of your calls in a comment on the uh uh Kavanaugh investigation FBI investigation and what Mitch

that Trump was going to win it\nWill not be the end but the point is that this was like dealing with the woman that was on CNN last week was the ... the guy makes a statement we say well this is what you're saying and it's exactly what he said and then he goes no that's not what I'm saying well of course that's what you're saying because why Harry Reid decided to change the rules of the Senate when he was\nThe head of the Senate when it came to federal nominations therefore when he did that\nUh you had Mitch McConnell come in and say okay you change those rules were going to change those ... these rules for the Supreme Court justice\nYeah the people in power we get to ... these aren't laws were not changing laws were simply changing rules of the sun it that we have the ability to do constitutionally you may not like it but hey when elections that's what Harry Reid said\nRight and Mitch McConnell came in and said the exact same thing that's the reality of it and what you're saying then it's it's okay to defame somebody's ah defame somebody's character because\nThat's the reality of highly Democratic Republic constitutional republic works\nUh and then you got into the plane to we now have to go back into the womb when you have a life time yeah position so that does anybody agree with them that we need to go back to the room numb all Supreme Court justices we need to go back

threw ice on someone [laughter] in a bar legit I let's let's well we do need to say that the kids were in a bar\n[laughter]\nBut this is this is the desperate attempt by the left and they

[laughter] [laughter]\nWell I guess I'd say we're all end up on this big part off again or not [laughter] [noise]\nWell I mean what do you think about it if if Republicans are because remember the it's the it's the deficit this year that's going to sky rocket through the roof yes over a trillion dollars in one year and we're not at war no it's not that and it's the Republicans and we're not into recession throwing seven hundred\nA ... billion dollar said at a banks or\nAny of that it's it's the Republicans spending I asked this question in all seriousness if Democrats were able to take over\nBoth or the Senate and the house and what would there\nNever will move the president's budget B that he would hand them and what would the Democrats won\n\nIf they're Republicans and I don't want to use a drunken sailor analogy because I I think it's unfair to to drunk and sailors and but at least a drunken sailor is ... how did they drink yeah but and they were out of high school and they were drinking offended they throw out ice on anybody\nGot it all relates doesn't it\nUh but how much would Democrats ... Republicans are ... are spending this much\nAnd and the fact is I look I don't blame the Republican Party and I don't blame the president why the American people don't care can people don't care if there is no political pressure this will continue as I said this is this is my uh twenty ninth anniversary or this week of doing talk radio\nUh the first issue that we had which was back in eighty nine was the whole clean sweep that Congress will spending too much money\nAnd it's time for a clean sweep and monitor forget the protests all over the country people in front of congressional offices saying\nWe need to cut back I think the deficit at that time was\nFour trillion or less ... maybe even three I care don't even remember what it was at that point right but it was nothing and people were upset about it they were actually marching in the streets\nAbout the debt [laughter] [noise] yeah like some of them are marching advantage what are you guys marching for the debt who's that national debt oh\nOhio the debt for every working American by the way every working American uh\nUh went into debt eighty I think it's eighty one hundred dollar gift year from the fed or get them every working American the the debts that basically has its if split up on every working American that adds eighty one hundred on your behalf\nBut remember in the tax bill last year mhm the only the only kind of people that are actually paying more for the debt paying more in taxes\nAre people like Eric in myself who's taxes actually went up yes because working norm is Lee wealthy exactly that's why we're as the one caller said\nA couple of years ago billion billionaire yes which was a surprise to all of us yes keep it up\nI'll tell you this if I was a billionaire ... I'd get rid of the my Fifteen year old vehicle and has two hundred and ten thousand mile oh yeah yeah yeah no I'd put that out with the trash [laughter] that would be going my butler would I Would\nBut because of certain business ... we both share a we can't take them anymore and therefore our our business did matter [laughter] no nobody cares about oh we're not upset that we are actually looked at the tax by the tax thing was the right thing to do is we evolved in state of before a irrespective of the unfairness towards us\nAaron is towards us other problems 'til the spending\nA and and that's what it comes down to the weakening because the the the fiscal policy uh you know you you look at the the monetary policy of this this nation and and while [laughter] all over the place especially in recent years but like over the last Twenty years especially\nBut beyond that the fiscal policy\nBecome something very different because and this is it once you start creeping in once you get the foot in the door it as the government provides is provides this provides this will start talking about making cuts start walking into the neighborhoods of America\nAnd start saying well in order to get our national debt in order we're going to start cutting back on\nA this program this federal program in yours your child's school\nNo up start taking things away that's when people start getting motivated that's when they start\nPaying attention now they wouldn't they still wouldn't be able to tell you the majority of them are they still wouldn't be able to name the three branches of government but they would tell you to get out and you are not welcome in that kind of policy is not well there is because this is what it comes down to for a Obamacare spending\nAnd a number of issues that conservatives are watching and had been watching for ever enter important because they've always been important but this is it an Obamacare as one of those\nYou know on the way to getting to what the single payer system but the idea that you're going to get something and somebody else is going to pay for it well then the liberals like that one couple in California well we liked Obamacare we voted for Obama we didn't know we were going to have to pay for\nThat's why even though you have when you had Jake Tapper of CNN and and even ...\nQuestioning a case yo Cortez reality and Gail I'm In Florida and and and Gillum about ... you know the ... of Medicare for all the way they understand what we're spending right now how do you pay we're already going to be a trillion dollars in debt ... you can't pay for all van and pay for what we're paying\nFor it today it's impossible so the only thing you can do is put massive debt\nOn the ah on the American people the other thing that isn't being talked about either as the because interest rates are going up ... how much of a bigger bite that's taking in how much interest payments the American taxpayer it's growing exponentially yeah every single year now and we've talked about that over the last year but a\nA until it actually starts affecting people and that may be you know you know too late it could be ten years from now Twenty years from now I'm Thirty years from now odds are are you and I will both be dead when it happens\nBut as we've said is immoral and nobody wants to hear it but it's absolutely immoral and unethical to be putting what we want today on the backs of future generations we have is we have stated before\nWe found a loophole of taxation without representation we found the loophole your tax the future they didn't vote for it they had no representation\nThey had no say in it they're completely innocent and all of this and we found the most moral way and we just hide our heads in the stands sand\nLet's put it on them and because I said that I expect to get the emails today which\nI always get whenever I said that oh you are exaggerated the debt really isn't bad it's all in control in debt is all part of it\n... ...\nI Hope that sues you're guilty conscience by writing those emails\nWell because it effectively when it gets to the point that you can't even service the interest on the debt as a nation\nAs a nation the massive hit to the economy when our\nGlobal trade partners can no longer trust\nThe U.S it will be catastrophic\nIn nature to say well we can just write it off on paper and start over nope no you can't because no one is going to trust doing business with you any longer\nAnd would that happens then are great show great grandchildren and their children and great grandchildren will not experience or what the expansion of wealth\nAnd the freedom and liberty it brings to their family they won't experienced that 'cause they only play there is going to have the
