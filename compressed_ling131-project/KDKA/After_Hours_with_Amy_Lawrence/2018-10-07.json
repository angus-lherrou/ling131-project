online anytime at oceanic natural dot com once you check them out when you have a chance to have some great information there on the Web site\nToday I Want to welcome Sherry granted year back to the show Sherry it's great to have you back in the studio with us think Chris is great to be here you know share he's been on the show a number of times or for those that may not remember Sherrie is a nationally recognized nutritionist\nAnd alternative health advisor she's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional athletes she's also written several books on helping nutrition\nAnd Sherry last time you're on the show we were talking about seaweed and about a new natural supplement called title greens yeah which comes from seaweed\nYes and it is called title greens and it is from oceanic naturals and what it is it's a multi nutrients the we blend ended at sixty times more potent\nThan any land based vegetable and what I Love about it is it addresses so many of the health problems that people are facing today because they just are not getting the nutrients they need were literally dying from our diet in fact the Centers for Disease Control ... a fact sheet\nThat indicates that poor nutrition and lack of exercise or the number to cause of death in this country and at the rate we're going if we keep this up it'll be number one very than\nIt is it's sad but you know we're we're we're not in a situation where we are starving now\nUnfortunately the foods that were eating or not as nutrient dense as they used to be for example vegetables back in the Nineteen sixties okay they were fifty percent more nutritious than they are today because there were more nutrients in the soil\nEven if you're trying to eat a healthy diet trying to get those fruits and vegetables you still may not be getting the nutrients\nExactly yes that's very true and then when you add the synthetic fertilizers and pesticides you've got a recipe for\nRecipe for a lot of malnutrition the city and disease but you know the good news is there's a lotta nutritional benefits from the sea and that's what we're learning about and that's what title\nGreens of it all apparently exciting I mean there there are some remarkable discoveries now coming from the ocean\nYes even the FDA the food and Drug Administration\nThey publish articles that suggested many treasures from the the will actually give us a medical answers that we are looking for for example the scientists are examining the metabolites of single celled plankton which the national Cancer Institute tests have shown to have cancer fighting potential that's amazing research in this area is in high gear and labs all across the United states\nAnd and I want to get into this a little bit but but maybe just to set this thing up okay what are some of the symptoms but you know their body is not getting the right kinds of nutrients well\nAll sorts of illnesses and diseases they have pain and the body pain in the muscles pain in the joints they find that they're still lacking energy um food cravings eczema\nAllergies digestive problems lackluster hair dry skin brittle nails those are also a sign and you know the bottom line is you just don't feel good but you can't put your finger on why\nYeah and I think there's a lot of people in the situation\nAnd they just think it's part of aging and this is what I'm going to have to deal with which drives me crazy I'm like no it doesn't have to be that way and what I Want our listeners to understand is that a gene isn't about the breaking down of our bodies at all it's more about how the body repairs itself your body wants to heal itself it wants to repair itself\nAnd if you give your body what it needs it will do that\nMhm so what about seaweed why is this kind of the key\nWell first of all titled greens has a blend of seaweed that are the most nutrient dense vegetables on another planet ought to defer seaweeds right yeah there's over twelve thousand ... and the other reason is seaweed is so unique is that it's sixty times more potent\nThan any land based vegetables see we as more phytochemicals the word means plant chemicals in these plant compounds are\nAnd building ourselves these phytochemicals\nReally do play an important role in the biology of ourselves okay in fact these phytochemicals there are so powerful that they and able seaweed entitled greens to grow at a rate of one to two feet per day without a route\nThat that's amazing so more anti accidents more minerals more amino acids lip it's trace minerals\nEnzymes we need enzymes today just their food especially as we get older I'm plants they're almost like a gym slave annoys Polly females many of which are not even found in land based plants\nAnd we're talking about the minerals like calcium ten times more in the way then in a glass of milk um sodium magnesium which keeps the muscles relax potassium iodide iron and zinc\nAnd then of course of vitamins vitamin a B. one be to be six knives and vitamin C ... within a gas in and folic acid I mean there's even trace amounts of vitamin B. twelve that you cannot get from any land based plants I mean the list goes on and on\nAnd you know I it'd be great if we can just go out and drink the water in the ocean but you can't do that now but what we can do is consumed those powerful vegetables that are in the seat in the form of seaweed Chrissy we have all the nutrients that are required\nBy human beings to live so in other words if you ain't nothing else but seaweed you could

joining us I've got Dr Michael Pincus on the phone today and we're talking about something that we're all too familiar with these days and that stress\nAnd we're finding out about the damage that every day stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress and Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and how we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress\nIn your ... formula can help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium factors in I mean\nUh I I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium what\nWe're talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium probably of all the vitamins I could list many of them is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere's three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that there was involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and for example if that was a low levels of magnesium\nYour own beat two very important factor in life and I would say so\nIn fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with them to fish and says okay you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's anxiety has autism chronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease cast a patient diabetes\nFibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps\nParkinson's Bastille Perot's this list just goes on and on and on\nIt just goes on and on and on and and this is this is associated\nWith a a lack of magnesium and the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium fool you know it's nothing to really mess around with no what happens is that you need that many of them in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nThough so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first ... which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other about there's many more practical applications of this ... formula ... first of all like I said he would drink so it gets into your system\nAnd one of the first things we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress and they can't sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for\nPeople that have trouble sleeping really because it relaxes you ride any do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the after you drink a cup of the comics formula\nInteresting\nNow the other thing that is really really good for our people who are in pain oh\nOkay I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case studies of people actually taking account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic pain\n... which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas I'd like to discuss with your\nWhile that's fantastic some of those things that you name seemed to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older he's there a link there\nThere's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency spend a nickel magnesium they don't absorb but their food\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know let's use it might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing\nAnd a lotta people justify that they're getting old and they just need more\nGrass or whatever right that's what I Would think that what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones to start getting ... you start getting 'em all muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know it you are feeling all yeah and you're about it actually started to manifest at well\nAll due to a simple lack of these nutrient\nCalcium and then they'll let me tell you and it is simple\nThe problem in being a doctor researchers how do you get this end of the system the formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because it's a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in any drink this cut down\nThe street absorption rate is really incredible because it it actually goes right into your bloodstream\n... and this was probably a good time

nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this is an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead of happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and their\nBody well that's the thing is that a deficiencies are not like I'm a water main break and where you have written notice all things considered drips little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill a little bit at a time to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too

the public square a panel is assembled around the table and ... and ... just standards of ceremony Elsie ... gate Ellen Duncan and we were discussing more important topic I mean a lot of important things come up on the show day but this is this is critically important isn't it\nThe whole nation Wayne is riveted on this conversation about the Kevin confirmation hearings and we actually had to and how will tell you the whole story here we actually have produced a full show to run last week\nAnd on this subject and then yeah we pulled the show ... and and we we switched out we apologize to listeners we did another really good program regarding Christmas in America coming up and the reason that we stopped us because we felt\nThat the amount of evidence in the pipeline and data that was flowing it was so significant that to come out and try to say too much too quickly you would be inappropriate it would not be of good conscience\nWe couldn't do the program in real time we had to do it in advance so it was hard to know how the other situation we got to change and it did and\nYeah and we we pulled the show at the very last moment before the stations would have downloaded it off for the weekend program for many of them who who air this on the weekend and so we were trying to do this ... another reason that we pulled it has to do with a listener letter now this is kind of interesting because\nThe letter didn't cause us to make the decision but the spirit behind the letter is is important I think for everyone to understand recently received an email from a person who will leave anonymous uh because of the confidentiality of of their career they work in the ... with the giant tech industries and\nUh they're up there and that they they start off their email hello public square friends I've been listening to the public to our podcast alongside my men's Bible study group for the past two years\nInstead of following a set study we use episodes of the public square to spark conversation and discussion in our group that meets every other week\nWe started with the American mission series and have moved on to the weekly show I wanted to thank you for all the work that you've done in the work you continue to do to educate Americans on viewing public policy through a Christian lens\nPedals gathered around the table here at the American policy round table and this is the public square today um I I think I heard you say maybe Dave the title this program is does Kevin all matter\nUh yeah because the point I think we're going to see very quickly is of a certainly are Brett Kavanaugh matters certainly doctor for better certainly everyone we've seen on TV every member of the Senate every member of the house every member of the media every person\nAll God's Children matter ... the question is do some things matter more than that particular individual claim or career or even the question\nAnd what the question is really is the truth yeah what's on trial here that's what I was thinking about right and how do we get to the truth\nSo let's go back to what the ... you know this whole question of what the Bible teaches about the presumption of innocence the cooperation the necessity of two or three witnesses in court of law\nAnybody want to guess ... and there's a lot of answers to this why does the Bible teach this necessity why two or three witnesses all the time it's in there from genesis revelation why\nWell because if you simply make an accusation and they're automatically guilty you could accuse people of anything and then get rid of your enemies very easily as long as you have enough power to prevent people with it that have agendas from\nComing in putting that agenda forward and seeing it carried out just based upon one thing 'cause some people don't have a problem uh misrepresenting the truth [laughter] to see their actions carried out of actively\nDate isn't it also imbedded in to the concepts of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution which talks about equal protection under the law how can you have equal protection [noise] if you have no protection against an accuser\nI'm I'm with you on all these things I think you can go back to the premise of our country and the promise of our country and the declaration of independence that if all people are in effect created equal\nOr Mrs where uh where Atticus Finch made that famous quotation in the movie to kill a mocking bird in which a person was unjustly accused and unjustly convicted\nAnd our court rooms every person is equal creation of God equal under the law I think one of the other reasons the Bible brings up this point of the necessity of two or three witnesses because\nUh the lord is very keenly aware of the fact that we live in a fallen state or the necessity of two to three witnesses actually cares within it\nIt's actually cares within it to presumptions the first is that we're likely the lie now sometimes we end up lying unintentionally so not truth an untruth a sometimes we see things incorrectly sometimes we thought we heard something or failed to hear something\nThere is the sense of just a misappropriation of our facilities that leads us to an inappropriate understanding an incorrect understanding\nBut there's also passion vengeance hatred fear all those other human emotions that lead us to change our story\nDave I think we saw that play out with how the um accusations it was like gasoline on a fire if you don't have to have cooperation\nThen you have another accuser come forth with more intense accusations with no cooperating witnesses and then from there I guess even more intense after that if you in a politically charged environment and you can have anyone make up anything if that's going to be the new standard for\n... example after example of people across the country\nThat have been put in prison based upon eyewitness testimony people that maybe had good intentions but they recalled it wrong they remembered it incorrectly and then people were exonerated because the DNA evidence did not match the eyewitness testimony I say all the time and officiating college basketball I'll see a play happened in front of me\nI'll make a call and I'll say yeah that's how I saw it and then the next day or the next week I review the film and I'm like wow I I missed that that's not how I remember that happening and it was right in front of me clear as day but sometimes we don't get it right and what were you recall from memory\nWe've got the notion of the fact that we're falling and were flawed and we can get it wrong or there's another side to this as well though and and two or three witnesses because there's a second presumption in that\nIs that in the multitude of witnesses justice will prevail now what's the biblical mindset behind that [noise] that cs Lewis talks about this in in the abolition of man that that the notion that within every civil culture\nYou find in innate some print if you will he didn't use the word dumped him but I'm using the analogy light it's like a thumb print\nA an impression for justice he says it this way he talks about the idea of cutting in line\nAnd it doesn't matter what culture you're in if people are in a line or lose would say cue\nAnd you're standing there waiting you're turning someone cuts in on you everyone regardless of their language their education or what time in history\nThey no that's wrong now why do they know that's ... ... and Lewis says this is just one of many many uh testimonies inside the human spirit that that notes that we were we were cut out of a cloth that includes the threads of justice ...\nAnd and so the idea of two or three witnesses is almost God saying I Want you to partner with me in holding yourselves accountable\nTo that standard of justice because I treated you I treated you equal\nAnd you should treat one another in that\nContext so there there's there's in essence of positive and negative side of this but this notion of two or three witnesses the presumption of innocence and the requirement of corroborating evidence\nIs pivotal now in a way are two or three witnesses goes not just to the defense or to the to the presentation if you will of the offense\nBut also goes to the notion of trial by jury which is another huge part of the fight of liberty threw out western culture\nWhat's your you know in the old days you come before the king or the feudal lord and it's off with your head just 'cause that's the way he felt about it or she felt about it\nAnd and and even western culture you know you go back to to Henry the eighth and the and the tower of London and all of that stuff I mean the fight to half trial by jury of your peers\nHas been a huge part of the struggle to reach the point of honest jurors Britain's and liberty in our culture\nThe notion again being that was in our composite a jury of twelve or a number of judges and appellate judges that somehow people will ultimately want the truth that they'll want justice if for no other reason than the self serving reality\nThat uh what goes around comes around right and if I can do this do you maybe you can do this to me which then brings us back to the whole concept of loving our neighbors we love ourselves do unto others\nAs you would have them do unto you\nSo this notion of of the presumption of innocence and the process of trial by jury\nAnd and and all of these issues and multiplicity of corroborating evidence it's all a very deep part of who we are as people I'm often mindful of that passage we talked about from the film and John Adams that wonderful work that are good friend David McCullough\nReally help to birth in his book and Tom Hanks and others hope to develop into film\nThat terrible scene\nIn in the revolutionary period of America's timeframe and colonial America where a a a an individual that was a a tax collector if you will for the Brits was seized by a mob and tarred and father it's one of the most horrible horrible things you could watch on film [noise]\nUh in regards to the treatment of an individual the painted everything just creams out of horror and terror of a mob denying this man and then physically ... I think that people died of that kind of actual treatment as well with the Asian fun they put a cartoon that was terrible\nAnd you think about that justice is supposed to mitigate against the possibility of that happening\nBut for that to happen people have to believe the justice is attainable by everybody I Know we've got to get to a break here pretty quickly about when we come back I Want to get to that question about what was in fact this just a job interview or was it a lot more than that\nSo we'll get to that question coming up and just a moment on this week's edition of the public square once again\nIt's Dave's an oddity here leading our conversation Jeff Sanders mentally ill see rubble gate Ellen Duncan I'm Wade Shepard all participating today and glad to have you with this ah this program is part of a\nA whole long list of programs in our archive which you can listen to any times so thanks for listening and by the way David you mentioned the letter to open the program today I was in southern Illinois over the weekend\nAnd the first listener I bumped into said hey you're the guy in the public square I loved the public square so that was encouraging as well we we've got listeners out there how 'bout that well we sure do and we certainly loved those listeners in\nSouthern Illinois and all around Peoria and peak in in that wonderful place back Rob Watergate aren't you do on a policy briefing they're very soon\nThursday October twenty fifth\nPeoria, Illinois\nPolicy agree that's a great area and and but I was even further south a mess so I was down in southern southern Illinois [laughter] All right we'll get back to the existing very important conversation to the public's where we are found online and you can listen to this program on line at the public square\nNegative braking take a break and we're going to get the question about are we ever going to get to the truth and we'll we'll discuss that next on the public square [noise]\n\n\nWe'll be right back from the looking glass [noise] [noise] [noise]\nPlans [noise]\nThanks for your support the public square which has hurt him this form this hour long program each week we have a daily program as well versed on many radio stations both are available online to the public square dot com [noise] does Kevin no matter what uh important conversation to have today in the midst of what's\nOn in America Dave well let's ask this question um [noise] the notion of the meeting\nOcean of the me too movement is that Dr Ford is entitled to her truth\nAnd I've heard that a number of times in recent years her truth is truth a and and I got to tell you I'm sure doesn't give a surprise to anybody around the table or any of our listeners that I really kind of stumble over that terminology what are you all think when you hear her truth or history\nThat makes me think that whatever they say is accurate as long as they say is accurate and that is a perversion of what truth\nAs long as you agree with that it did most of them you know it's the most un philosophical statement you could possibly make\nHow so al ... I I think those true philosophy you know we're gonna have some programs coming up with a professor William be Alan but he's a political philosopher and it just struck me the conversations that we had with him\nWas just the importance of a search for the truth philosophy as a search for truth the love of wisdom and so you've got to believe that there's actually something out there that that is objective that you can actually ascertain so so it's just an philosophical to think well you you got years I've got mine you know it's just that lazy yeah\nI think back to over the past couple of years you think of the Duke lacrosse case you think of the Rolling Stone article regarding the University of Virginia you think of what happened at Columbia University ah those things where\nThe media grabbed on and said that truth before they did investigating or looking at what actual truth was lives were destroyed what about New York times writing an article about Nikki Haley a few weeks ago and then later they had to retract it but just because they said\nHey that means it's true right Jeff excellent point and also made me think about the stories that we talked about a few months ago with Jim Jordan yeah right right all the accusations brought against congressman Jordan that just disappeared they just evaporated have how they were all made in the court of public opinion [noise]\nTry to cross cable news for days and then with just disappeared\n[noise] um this idea of who's truth well the ... I Want to go back to the proverbial a question that you bring up because in proverbs chapter one I saw passage recently that says wisdom shouts in the street\nIn proverbs one inverse twenty in fact I think it's fascinating that in the Old Testament wisdom books that were in the wisdom literature wisdom is personified as female\nIn both ... versus a chapter one in proverbs chapter eight wisdom is personified as female and wisdom is literally shouting in the streets when you look at the Hebrew word there\nIt's it's usually used and shouting for joy ... the notion being the truth and wisdom are discernible there revealed there are available but we have to search for them but as you mentioned philosophically\nThat truth and wisdom are not necessarily in eight we don't create truth and wisdom truth and wisdom is something that we search for it is outside of us if you will and in in the American model going from the declaration of independence and the constitution the self evident truths\nAll contain this notion the truth is transcendent it is in fact above us it comes from the create or\nNow once we understand that as the model for America and then you understand our constitution establishes our laws in our state constitution established those laws all in the context of that confession of the premise of America and the promise of America\nThen when we educate matter so we go to court would go to court in that context so the idea of hurting\nThe idea of her testimony his testimony that's valid but her truth histories and they're each equal right questions we have to ask is what is the truth\nRight that's why you can't say in this situation that both testimonies were credible\nBecause they were certainly because one set a hundred percent yes one set a hundred percent knowing how can they both be true exactly unless of course we divorce ourselves from logic\nRight yeah a equal non a one has to be right they both camp\nIn our political persuasion shouldn't help us determine what the truth is and unfortunately I think\nI'm too many people in Washington DC go looking for a ... with their lenses covered by that political a shade and they want it to be a certain thing so that their agenda can be accomplished and that's unfortunate for everyone in America\nAnd I think that's why the public discourse also you're getting such a backlash against folks who are pointing out the inconsistencies and they're receiving such venomous responses from people who don't want to see the evidence who don't want to understand the objective facts\nThis brings us to the primary question does Kevin are matter because in in ... in essence what we're saying is a judge Kavanaugh Dr Ford\nThe Senate the Supreme Court none of those things matter more than the truth that's our point none of the matter more than the truth\nBecause if those all of those those testimonies those institutions the processes of our government are not founded on truth then how can they be American let alone be just we hold these truths to be self evident\nSo if everybody is suddenly entitled to their version of the truth I haven't in essence we've come to the disintegration of culture as we know what don't we just end up in anarchy mob rule and the most powerful people those who can shout the most or get the most people to chat with them when\nWell history is filled with a lot of examples of revolutionaries who uh who did it through mob rule do just what you described\nI mean Jeff in a way of sort of felt like watching that Senate committee made me think that the French Revolution had finally\nReached America yeah you're not far off the mark a because during the reign of terror and the French Revolution Seventeen Ninety three Seventeen Ninety four some sixteen thousand five hundred French citizens were ...\nBy their ah tribunals were they were just accused of disloyalty to the government and then they were off with their head and then another estimate of forty thousand people were killed were murdered or not by trials at all but simply by mobs of making an accusation\nYou know day there's so many different facets to this but one of the things I've been thinking about is the fact that this is all taking place within the context of the me too movement\nAnd all the revelations of of the past couple of years of all these powerful people that suddenly or just honored by their actions and this is what this is the context that this is all taking place in\nWell and I think that there's certain and certainly reasons to applaud anything or any movement in culture that is rising up against physical abuse course of course absolutely will power using their power against others\nBut and so that is that as it is certainly to be a recognized and and appreciated the challenge that I have with with all of these movements is it's one thing to talk about the consequences into a poor them into a crowd against them but what about root causes yeah\nAnd this is what I find most challenging at one side we have all of this discussion right now\nBut now about making certain that that that women are in no way shape or form or anyone is sexually abused\nYet ... when Hugh Hefner the father of the sexual revolution was buried recently he was a clean you all these very same people who are on the very next news page with that speak about the me too movement at the end you tell me that there is no connection between the perfection culture\nThe world of pornography and sexual abuse going yet and we celebrate one\nAnd we condemn the consequence on the other hand we are confused you\nKnow Dave ... we want people who have\nBeen legitimately sexually abused to have justice\nI'm at but we want people who've been falsely accused or to go free but there's one case where like like Bill Cosby for example he was accused\nOf dozens of women accused him but he admitted that he had relations with these women\nAnd a mountain of evidence was brought forth and he was convicted in a court of law she did do these things and they proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he was violent and and he did these things without any ones consent\nWell I'm Glad you enjoyed it but I I think it's that had back in\nKilling I'm sure they'd be careful getting out of the\nI'm going to return the kayak\nHow about a pack the\nShortfall in the neighborhood he had to

have it and they just pissed off a lot of woman in the country and you saw the protests but do they what female\nShe I don't have to I ... I don't perceive it as that was that they don't care about females because I think we all have some empathy for what Dr Ford went through but I think everybody was trying to say\nThere may be smoke but there is no fire so let's kind of move on and get down to the business of what we need to discuss to see if he is qualified to sit on the Supreme Court\nI don't think the on the other beyond that

something I think\nAs much as we should pay attention to\nBecause you know you saw what happened to Bill Cosby you see what's going on with CBS you know you see me too movement Laffer curve off\nThat is extremely real there's a lot of rage there's a lot of anger end up going to come through one way or another and I think you hopefully come throughout the whole\nBut you know what but here's here's what's amazing to me and you brought it up and I'm going to talk about it I I still look at Bill Cosby and think why him and why she behind bars and everybody else who's been accused in this\nIt'd be too where he's incarcerated\nWhile I mean that he is the one that won the big fish okay the man is that right to\nLive because that's what a lot of police evicted ... you know each evening president

ourselves me be honest with herself because ... understand his sense\nIt certainly changed I think a lotta man's Derek on a very much for me too movement or making a huge mistake or making a huge mistake because I'm On the women are going after man\nWell you know where you're going to happen here ten it won't be long before men will be coming after women to [noise]\nAll that well I wouldn't be surprised no me neither I mean\nI'd also going to start to clarify rape as opposed\nIs rape intercourse touching what is rape documentation all of that stuff is going to\nStart to really be focused on but when it comes to governing I Hope that we can find a way to put this stuff where it needs to be properly and more importantly do the due diligence in the background that you need to do to be able to have the information before it gets to the point that a deal with Brett Kavanaugh\nCorporate cover was a a you know was that it I mean let's be honest with ya I I think that like I said the person I have a bad happened not doing his homework they want to do it so that's what you got you got a mess and the impression on screen quote which really hurts is that that spring quote right now is not legitimate\nIn other words it's just losing a its legitimacy all around and our expectations people do not trust the teacher in ... and that's a bad plan they really don't um and for this country to go forward or there's going to have to be a\nA lot of changes that is going to have to happen in the beginning of the people's ... when it comes to dump 'em at all they allow you know people\nThey don't learn from them because of the outcome that maybe there was a little bit more believe that government can work through some serious adverse cities or do you think\nNo no no not now okay our topic\nFor the ... and the people are divided it's going to take a while uh it's it's like you know a lot of space right now it's [laughter]\nIt's like a ... step to I'm just going through some changes and um the change is going to have to have a ... it's going to be messy but it's going to take a while it's going to take a long time because right now we we're we're losing\nI Want to say are definitely but it's it's like a ship that doesn't have pap we were we lost a place we don't know what we're going\nAnd it's going to take a while before we we we get back and you know if people want to say well well this sprayed we've been doing great thanks\nThat's just something point but right now you know if you're looking at the outside a lot of states as being the mess\nAnd it is all they allow we don't have been talking about ... ... ... people in the world but we're we're talking about each other you know what you're talking about them versus us and that's just right now we're in I say it's it's it's just a divided count all the way around\nThe world are you listening to Charlotte each other so are\nYou going to go out do you think he's going to be able to move for like Clarence Thomas did or do you think this is because of a default and I'm like oh no\nOh no no you know I mean you know have people's phase not by drunk in court you know I might say\nYou know I might say that somebody may if if I got a new bill for you know they have nothing but I was you know I mean I hate to say that but I heard it on the streets\nSay there's not enough on the court and that that really hurts because the emphasis right now people don't look at it as fan I'm representing have anything in this little guys like another institution that for\nA man Florida and that that's the way it's a lot of people are looking at it\nYou know it's it's just going to be a while I mean the fake it for me for fame of they're rarely only go after and I won't be ... and I will not be a\nWell listen I admire these women for doing I think it takes a lot of courage what they're doing and if it can make it a safer place then so be it but I also think you've got to it's kind of like separation of church and state there's if you've got to be able to find a\nBetter path to take and and I think it has to do more with background checks but he but here's the thing Ted is there anybody above reproach show I mean who's lived on this earth\nAh long before this started now I think the generation being born our who's on this earth say for the first ten Fifteen Years of their life\nIt is going to be a lot different when they are moving forward to select somebody from the Supreme Court fifty years from now because of what this is going to do so you have to look at the good that will come from this but right now the the current world that we live in I mean is there anybody above reproach do you think\nOh no one wants to work with social media and everything you are you kidding me I mean like three four who want a job like that I Would look at your background\nAnd I'm from ... you know that's where we live in everybody knows everything about somebody else and um you know one day about social media for each secret say more about them all over the world people are more connected to that\nIn those days are over it's it's just out and you know the last thing I guarantee you don't feel safe\nAnd it's you know it's it's a democracy that's laughing football democracy less ... and um you know it's just not good for the counter but you know it's something that I got up from the ...
