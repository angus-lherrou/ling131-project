I cannot see the Republicans delaying it any further\nNo I don't know that do have the votes um if it comes back early ah I'm I'm I suspect that are that you will have further scrutiny you know and and it could be a Jeff Flake or anybody else\nBut your ... this comes down to the votes of those people who were\nOn the fence well if they if they interview him or mirrors and anybody she wants them to interview and anybody who's come forward that ... by the way that that part of it will likely that claim will likely take the longest\nLikely is more involved because of the fact that it was not a part of public record Dr Ford testimony is a matter of record and there's only so far I think with Dr Ford's case\nThere's only so far you can go and it would basically be the parameters would be everything that was\nEverything that was outlined in the testimony\nWeb but I mean politically if they get ... and you know and they get her you know they do an interview with her and everybody else surrounding it which means they've expanded the investigation beyond just one of the Democrats can't make that\nPoint no they'll try to but no there's not going to be they didn't have a point to begin with but what can they build what's allowed when someone like flake did what he did\nWill will the Republicans at that point move on and by the way did you see the story to he got a little bit of publicity that ah the ah the weekend poll that came out of the poll voters would friday or Saturday and showed Holly up two points\nOn I'm I'm On tester no no no I'm In I'm In\nMissouri ... yeah well right and and we wondered about a Claire McCaskill McKay if that's if that was that there was going to be a last minute yes vote although politically I think it would be too little too late\nOr it could be potentially we'll see I think what happens um you know later this week\nBut I think the hesitation by those senators who backed this the the you know the further investigation the\nFBI background check then I I think politically they could be damaged even if he's confirmed you did the damage anyway you allow the circus to go on created more of a circus as a result of it and we know flake is not up for\nReelection which is why I think it it became more convenient\nThe the other the other senators likely jumped on board\nOr you know and and by the way they are they did so potentially at their own peril politically but flake had to be the guy because he's not up for reelection he had to be the one that went forward and requested this and the president you know comes in and says okay fine\nBy the way for what a two week better part of two weeks Democrats have been screaming\nAt the investigation up the FBI investigation story from the hill the headline White House defense FBI invest [laughter]\n\nThey got their investigation now they're screaming about it [laughter]\nLet's go to Robert in Johnstown New York Robert welcome you're on run I Radio Welcome to the

any ... in the garden because uh [noise] anyway [noise]\nI was when we are as we understand your we understand your point [laughter]\nI mean really how it goes to a cameraman getting in hell of a U.S Canada in that building that ...\nI it again it was it was pretty crazy with if you if you uh were following the procedures on friday morning with the committee and then you have the Democrats walking out and then they were of course outside doing their own press conference and everything else so you had a ton of chaos fight\nI'm with you but that they've not I guess as secure as you would think even for senators it's not as secure as most people would think it is in that sense we're\nAll sort of on the side of it is it with that\nParticular shot at it [laughter] I Know that was the target right right but that would be the right but that would be the target yeah I mean that would be the target that they will be looking here or I understand it does seem like you're you're the question in your mind is seems set up a\n[laughter] I Would have to say yes that that that that ... that flight set it up right [laughter] right oh I just did this or they they can front of me and they made a good point and so I Do agree with them yeah and and that's it yeah\nI'm a cameraman right what yeah what do you live where I Am all people are just hold\nWhile at the age age it's likely was getting to it's inevitable point and and also Lindsey Graham is probably the perfect person in that case because he has crossed the aisle so many times I think a lot of people in that regard likely didn't see it coming\nAnd also didn't see it working the way it did and building momentum and while ultimately it didn't work [noise] uh in in in moving the process forward thanks to Jeff Flake it did\nIt did I think build even more momentum for Republicans in general we'll see if that translates in November at election time but ah five weeks from tomorrow by the way\nWell so but I but I Do think that Lindsey Graham actually what what do you know the what he said I I think he I this is what he believes that oh no no I I think so I think it was old school you understand what the Senate's role in you advice and consent\nAnd and as you said that's why he brought up sort of my or ... I'm sure that he had problems with Kagan and ... and the things that they believed ... but that isn't the job to job isn't the job is to say\nAs a senator was never supposed to be the job of senators to say do you agree with me at every point\n\nA no All right well then I'm going to defame your character as a justice right right but that was that was never the role to begin with it's are you confident the president gets to pick\nWho he wants on the Supreme Court yeah no I don't think it was pretty determined I didn't mean to imply that it was pre determined that that Lindsey Graham it just happens that he was yeah a pick to do that uh it just so happens that he did do it and he really was the perfect person\nTo do that in that setting eight six six Ninety ...\nJoin the conversation using the shell wrote several hotlines eight six six nine zero seven three three three nights when I radio and shell hotel uh making your hardworking journeys more manageable\nAfghan ski we have hundreds of flat bed and specialized million mile drivers white because if you like driving for a local trucking company with national\nPower than we have a long term home for you Deb ski as a family of sixty locally run flatbed and specialized companies in communities all across the u._s._a. and care\nWhere you can put down your roots you on short haul or long haul want to drive our late model truck for your own trying to you like to drive zone over as a team\nAbout the challenge of specialized loads a desk in the family of companies is your million mile hole if this along with consisted miles great pay and talk to your benefits sounds like what you're looking for to go to Dr ... dot com\nAnd learn more about our family of trucking companies find of black venue specialized opportunity fits your knees and Dr ... dot com that's dry da ...

other stories out there the lawn must have got a slap\nHand in here [noise] yeah you know this is a interesting the way this thing went down\nYou're seeing the way this thing went down because as a the developments on Thursday came out the centrally the ill on mosque\nAnd his lawyers early in the day had reached an agreement with the SEC saying and and and and apparently that whatever the agreement was was going to\nHappen and then by the end of the day they were pulling out of the agreement and he was willing to fight it\nUh this all stems from him saying basically that he was going to take\nThe company private and that he had access to funds a he had done that some time ago and as a publicly traded company\nThe chairman of the board and CEO you can't say that because you're a centrally by that statement especially if it's on true and that was the whole point is is that did he actually have the funding was at a was a secured had been promised to him\nA any evidence that that he had access to funding to take a private\nThat started this whole thing into okay and then of course the or some other things that he has gone on social media that question his ability to run the company but that's a special because you're manipulating the stock price or the company\nUh it had a jump when he announced that the stock price has a jump because it was you know people investors if it were true might have been able to make good on something like that uh and do well if they drop the stock up\nBecause he would have to buy out all of that existing stock\nThen it came out on friday which was interesting actually late\nOr Thursday and friday morning the investigation showed that because he came up with this price of\nFour hundred and twenty dollars per share and according to investigators he actually used for twenty four reason that everybody suspected on the Internet he was trying to impress his girlfriend according to investigators with the Ford twenty price and of course\nAnd and and that's the thing we talked to and people said well the media controls go whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa one thing we we can tell you with age as we know how it used to be back then ... and not only are there more news sources out there\nYou just brought it up ... not not only they're more news sources out there\nBut you have to realize that heart access to information to find out exactly what's going on is greater than it's ever been before we were growing up mhm they could say whatever they want and if you want to research it it would take serious time to\nDo the research to actually know what was going on yet might we said that people are actually more informed back then they are today oh because they did the basics first\nThey actually learned and paid attention to and knew the basic ideas on which this country was founded well they were taught the base and now you don't have any of that so what do you have\nPeople thinking I guess they don't have to learn it because they can Google it if they need it well they're not even willing to do that but when you know the basics of how government works or how ... works\nThen you can have the debate on the ideas regardless of who's reporting what regardless of who takes what position you can have the debate on the ideas\nBecause it's not about the people it's always been about the ideas and the one idea that

read I let us head back to a year we go to Mario in Florida\nAnd Mario in Florida Mario welcome you're on the Radio Welcome to the show\nWell thank you my my uh my thoughts on this uh uh it's a judge Kavanaugh are that they all bullshit ... style ... or even at the Lowes\nThey are they're going to continue to attack him a even after he is confirmed as as a Supreme Court justice I'm sure of the ... and I have another question\nIt's oil a day they they made but it's not going to go anywhere you know once once I let her know once once it's done I mean I I think they'll focus elsewhere because once you get on the Supreme Court this whole thing about threatening to impeach him that's not going to happen\nNo no that's not out of ... things early there's nothing that's going to happen ... the the the uh the lip service will continue Mario no doubt\nRight but I but I think a move I I think they'll move on to other things where they can have more control\nI say what you mean yeah the the lip service that's where the attack as it gets into the lip service and I think that they'll continue to attack and that's\nWhat that's but that's that's the norm they call that Tuesday right they'll they'll they'll attack him when they were to say the Supreme Court decision that I don't like that when he lies on her door to give song in on something friday not funny because Mario or a Gary and I were talking during the break\nAbout the the question by a George Stephanopoulos asking one democratic lawmaker over the weekend or do you think judge Kavanaugh should recused himself from any case involving if he ceded any case involving\nA democratic lawmakers and the lawmaker comes back and says well yes I think that would be the\nWell in that case I can I can make the case that\nIf you're a male you should not be you should recuse yourself from any case involving a female and if you're a female the same the same applies and then beyond that\nIf you are a in a ... a heterosexual marriage you should recuse yourself from any decision involving gay marriage or\nOr or vice versa or I'll take it to the most extreme level if you are not the person in the case\n[laughter]\nYou should read shooting yourself because you couldn't possibly understand if you're not the defendant person making 'em do complain you have no standing or one of the interesting Congress ... plays one of the interesting conversations that got\nI got an over the weekend with a with a few other people which was\nWell how come it's only only one of the fifty three genders ... have to be believed right only the allegation from one gender what about the other fifty what is it fifty three fifty four and genders uh the the that are out there and then we just got into the bizarre conversations of of why don't you believe the other genders and going through the specific other genders\nAnd why they should or shouldn't be believed it was an interesting conversation about\nFor video road here's your forecast\nGoing to pick up a lot of moisture for Southern California and western Arizona as the remnants of hurricane Rosa come ashore through the early part of the week there's a low in the Pacific that's combining with the system that will create some unsettled weather\nThen\nYou know we can keep it anonymous in the in the FBI in Korea but after that if you wish to continue than your name will become well known she didn't do that now\nAnd so everything along the line of [laughter] who paid for the the ... you know a ... lie detector or the the suggestion of a law firm everything that has gone and then you get to the point\nWhere they leak or name and you know they they they link or name the people that were supposed to protect her\nAnd that has to drive somebody like Lindsey Graham just out of his mind ... as it as it did he feels he has been completely betrayed our point is you're just learning that\nNow when I was like Jeff Flake you know I I'm I'm guessing he found at some point he was going to make friends with a lot of people on the left remember he was doing the whole to buy a thing when he announced he wasn't going to run\nYou know this isn't this isn't a the way it should be\nUh the politics has gotten so ugly but on friday he was being cold out and even after he decided to go to the White House basically announced the administration request demand really but he was not going to vote on the floor\nYou would in committee but not on the floor for the confirmation then as soon as that came out there were others basically on the left coming out and calling them out still\nYeah I'm calling him out still\n... because they if they believe in this to my approach it has never about working with the other side or coming together the two sides coming together if Republicans coming over to the left\nThey don't hail Joe mansion is somebody who is bipartisan while technically he is but\nHe's not getting them he's not getting any points with his own party now he doesn't get any praised for no no McCain did on the media doesn't praise them no McCain did I mean after McCain was Hitler after he ran for president right and then went away and was no longer a threat\nYou know and then and then after his passing he was praised by the left but it's always someone on the right who goes left it's not the other way around\nLet's go to Peter in New York City Peter you're on run I Radio Welcome to the show\nBut I Do very good [noise] [noise] [noise] I say more bloody and brought the investigation that sort of like to find out a little more about this stock their size school college so\nHer have oh you mean expand the investigation on her show I mean all upset\nAbout this just so hey this is just but it's just as bad as just showed Vegas they didn't get enough that it by ... and we'll hear nothing about her\nWell you know here's I guess this'll be my my point on an forward we just found out who she was of course you're going to know more about\nCabinet and you're going to know about forward but it's a it's it's coming out mhm\nMhm\nWell if there's a number of things that that I think as a as a part of the investigation if they're doing it the way that I Believe they would be doing it I remember it's a background check\nSo the I guess the the the players that have been named in this so far ... might not be what the FBI limits themselves\nToo and and discussing it with foreigners according to her attorneys as of late Sunday she it's still not yet been interview\nWell my question is\nYou're going to start with Kavanaugh likely because it's a background check on him you start with Kavanaugh but then you're going to go into all these claims you're going to try and find separately separate from the testimony you're likely going to go and and interview maybe even\nFamily members somebody who could back it up because what you're trying to do the idea is to see if there's anything at all at the White House or the Senate committee should question in his background and you have to substantiate those claims\nSo there could be a number of people here that we're not even thinking of\nThat could be interviewed during this process and that might not be good news for Dr Ford or her\nAttorneys or the guy I mean apparently are going to interview the guy from Gail who said no he he drank more ... right it's like I don't know where that goes well how can you quantify it and how can you prove no and that's that's the ... and plus it has nothing to do with this it's got nothing to do with the original case so it's it's it's a basically this\nThis old classmate from Yale claiming that he perjured himself right\nSo we'll see where that goes how do you perjure yourself on the amount that you drank did you see because I didn't want to buy it right now there was there was no ... and there's no proof\nRight he hasn't been asked about that specific\nAsked about that specific incident right so it's there it's it's not perjury unless you get to that point to ask him about a specific incident mhm and you of evidence that he lied but the the consumption of alcohol and what's amount you talk\nAnd your judgment of it compared to somebody else's judgment thirty five years ago it would be an interesting perjury case\nRight [laughter] so I don't well because then you would need a somebody in the house to start that that case against him and that now that's not going to happen you know\nAnd they'll they'll see that they will interview this person like they'll interview everyone and they'll determine whether or not anything was by that person's claim can be corroborated not just what Dr Ford claims\nBut what any other person related to the situation claims they're going to look to have those claims backed up by somebody else\nMarty in Saint Augustine Florida Marty welcome you're on the radio Hi Marty\nYes I'm a first time caller here and I think first aid from Daytona Beach but\nUh [noise] I I ...

I think she said she couldn't remember what year it off if I Love steak right\nNow she got there how shadow cab that\nCode or needed to old ... kilowatt she had one last away\nCannot afford the yeah you you would have to you and we have ... and ...\nAnd we'll have to weigh locate lawyer would act like you would have to ask the Democrats that question I Can't answer for the Democrats are as ... as I said very easily that's why she's not ... that that's why that alone she's not a credible witness unless\nThere were people to bakar up when they say she's credible on like based on what and this is a legal statement this isn't a personal statement against her right I don't know what she went through\nBut when you say I'm a hundred percent somebody did it where\nI don't know when I don't know how did you get there I don't know how did you get home I don't know\nAll you know as he did it but any information surrounding it and then the witnesses that you give\nGive contradicting testimony that you gave stock credible right the ... and that's why I said I don't know if somebody has asked the Democrats that specific question but again as you see for example George Stephanopoulos lesser question when they don't answer it just moves on\nIt's like okay give me an answer you want to look something that bothers me more than even even the the the ... which we call the fake news ... is the lack of guts\nOf journalists to say I'm not leaving this question until you answer it right because it's that important that there's an expectation\nYep [laughter] remember who ... who who was at who asked to Obama to follow a ... question where was that was that\n... that was here in uh in there was ... was wasn't oh no yeah yeah yeah well first of all separate ... okay or one where you have a local reporter here uh uh from WFAN ATV in Dallas but no the one you're referring to was Chris Wallace\nAnd then they came back and said well we weren't told there would be ... of ... that\nThat if you asked a question didn't make sense to be a follow up question right that that there was actually an and this is something that has to stop this ... this kind of buzz sorrow world respect\nThat we have for politicians when I'm a journalist and I ask you a question if you don't answer it I'm going to ask the question again and then I'm going to come down right to it and say you're not answering my question\nWell I don't feel it's important oh so you won't answer my question I Want you on record that you don't have the guts to answer my question I phrased it that way which of course is not permitted because there is some kind of bizarre real world verse back\nThat a journalist is supposed to give\nA politician who won't answer a question on an issue but as the reason that you brought them on the air with you ... don't waste my time if you're going to be come on the show had the guts to answer my question but if you're gonna be got lists go away\nI feel like I'm Talking to somebody right now and yelling at them but if you're yelling at all of them and and [laughter] you know that's but that's that they get away with it drives me up for you know because people like well Stephanopoulos than everybody else allow them to get away with\n\nThe the person especially a public servant who's being interviewed does not dictate the questions\nNo no I don't\nKnow what would they do when they don't answer the question they do when when when they don't answer the question they are dictating the question\n... well and that's just they need to it it's very clear to us but it's just said we're going to help this person to build a narrative here so let's talk to them\nLet's help them build their own narrative yeah we'll forget journalism right oh I'm Sorry ...\nThen my question isn't the one I should be asking oh\nMy focus should be elsewhere you're saying well okay and and the\nEasy thing to do is the challenge her own owes answer as soon as she gave that non answer I Would have said okay so you're saying the Democrats did\nLike\nYour your your or\nNon answer their tells me that you're basically admitting the Democrats did leagues is\nYou can respond to that statement if you'd like to yes or no true or false\n[laughter]\nBut this is why people right or at least frustrate the daylight Saddam ... this is why people hate it no but you're going on with Tim Russert because they knew it didn't matter which side they were on they knew they were going to face tough questions\nOr remember for two weeks on the road and none of the Democrats from the Senate Judiciary committee would come out with Chris Wallace for what they do is is if you do that\nYou become black balled yeah\nThey won't come on your show any more because you demand that they that they answer the question everybody knows what the questions are going to be\n... yeah when you come in with look when you're a U.S senator and you come in to talk or you're the president or whatever you're somebody the White House\nWhen you go on a show you know why you're going on the show ... they'll tell you we want to talk about this\nAnd so you know what the general questions are going to be and your goal is okay oh look I Need to get my staff around here we need to figure out how to way not to answer any of the questions out of white filibuster\nWe the every journalist knows everybody on ABC CBS NBC and Fox knows that's what is CNN they all know what's gonna happen mhm they all know they're going to do that when it's somebody gonna finally say a you're not answering my question would you answer the question\nAnd at that point what happens is you're not going to get the major you're not going to get the major personalities anymore think about this we live in a society\nWhere the media believes we need to get the major personalities on the major political personalities who run and dry this country it's important that we get them on the air so they won't answer the questions that we asked them\nYeah that's it\nFace the nation no its face the other way [laughter] meet the press that was pressed the me we're going to do a handshake that's the way it's going to we were just going to go out there and pat each other on the back\nUnless you're a Republican and this week is weak this mhm where are you there [laughter] [noise]\n[noise] [laughter] [laughter]\nYour mom [laughter] I might\nAs well be giving that answer to every question here mom [laughter] what do you think that you're a mom\n[laughter]\nOh yeah [laughter] ... because that's the ridiculous nature of this why not just make it why not just make it I Would have a group of buddies I went to grade school with and we play this game of\nGrade school Scrabble ridiculous Scrabble the words actually you got to make up a word nothing\nMake up a word nothing can be a real war word\nAnd you've got to use it in a sentence when you put it on the board\nAnd as long as you used that as more [laughter] okay so that's what I Would just make it a game [laughter] because that's all it is exact nobody's taking a the their constituents\nAre seriously in the case of a Jeff like he didn't care ... ... you know how she could answer it I don't know I don't know who would yeah I don't know like you're asking me a question I Can't answer right why didn't we but why didn't we get the I
