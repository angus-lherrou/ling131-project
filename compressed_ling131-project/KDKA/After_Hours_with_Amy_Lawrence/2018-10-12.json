eighth\nOr when the president is trying to get Iran\nA you know sanctions on Iran which means the world Laurel market is going to you know increase the cost of oil even though we are producing\nA more

welcome you're on red eye Radio Welcome to the show\nA high I really interested in what you're talking about and about the stock market going down there the number of reasons like you said\nA including perhaps a ... a political agenda with respect to some businesses but the thing I called about is about our country being able to produce everything that it needs right here in this country and the good thing about that\nWhich is why it was so bad the good thing about doing it here it's we create more jobs\nNo its horror Mary it's horrible the last thing you would ever the last thing you would ever want to do is make a law that everything must be produced here\nBecause then prices would skyrocket through the roof you would have monopolies\nThat would make the goods and services that you get prices would be much higher than they should be Newt and retail doors shutting wrapped and right on the opposite for ... you would go in a massive recession if\nWe had a policy that we produce everything in this country\nGo up or the Saudis have some play in that too yes and we'll see if they ramp up production and\nAnd and aren't able and change that and it is an incentive a a\nAgain because it makes it more profitable for American producer yes and and were eventually going to get to that point I Believe\nI well it depends on who's in Washington but I Believe we will get to the point of self sufficiency where you know we can produce for the United states and export at the same time which is a which will be a great point\nA to a to get to we're not there yet but as we ... really one of the most underreported stories\nOf the entire year ... is that the United states\nIs now and it happened about three weeks ago became the number one producer of oil in the world mhm\nYeah um and and this is it I mean you if you put in place all the things of that will make an economy great again [laughter]\nUm and they did by the way I think that's the number one reason ... supporting um uh the uh the the president his tax bill went way way down\n[laughter]\nBut um the you know the [laughter] that'd be enough for me [laughter] it's not the case for me though mine went up a but but the line to you that right\nThe but but you put in place all those dynamics for great economy and all it's working up in ...\nWorking up until what the ... three numbers we talked about the GDP numbers from the second quarter and said hey this is great but what is the third quarter fourth quarter and then first quarter of next year look like if the cost of raw materials\nIs still high and increasing still going up that is a negative that is strictly controlled by the government that is something about us policy put in place\nThat doesn't need to be there what\nThey'll do win and we said we stayed with China and the intellectual property yeah we understand we understand the case there we didn't understand Canada Mexico or Europe or even\nA for the most part are not that you couldn't have done a few things different in in TPP but remember\nThe great victories of the dairy with Canada was already in the ... candle had already agreed to that of a you know ... before so that was a lot of disagreed victory uh but that was something we already had before and decided not you know the Trump Administration decided\nYou know not to uh to take that you and I went through and and and uh as you know Wall Street journal and others didn't look actually at the the new NAFTA and then there's not much change from the old\nNAFTA the biggest victory that the president has claimed\nThat he claimed was the fact that the terrorists worked to get what he wanted with the automobile industry right all all he did in the automobile industry was increased the cost of producing an automobile\nIn Mexico in the United states and in Canada yeah nobody is debating that that's not what happened right and that's viewed as a victory well if I remember\nTwo of the president's major goals\nHis goals his state of goals was to reduce the one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit\nI don't see how this does it because the majority\nOf the new NAFTA does is the exact same as the old NAFTA ... except for automobiles the dairy which would have been in TPP anyway only increases the U.S market to Canada by one percent mhm\nUh and the uh the rest is still the same right\nSo you ask okay what were the what were the because that the president tried to make the terrorists are worth it because we got we wanted in automobiles so what did you get\nYou increase the cost of automobiles for people in the United states to produce them in the United states in Canada and Mexico raising the cost of an automobile for all three countries\nAnd because production costs went up you are less likely to be able to sell those goods\nTo you know producing them in the United states and sell them elsewhere exactly the opposite of the two things that you wanted a reduction in the trade deficit and to produce things in the United states to sell them elsewhere well\nAnd and the right now we are I mean if you look at at at oil that's one great example of because of the technology created a in recent years and and how much more efficient they are as an industry\nAre now you you talk about you know the farmers I mean if you if you say it's a very populous viewpoint right we need to help the farmer but when you think of\nThe role that they play and and the and the global market in terms of food\nUh you know set of before\nBefore a few minutes ago but they feed the world that food goes all over the world\nUm you know and and they're telling the administration look your your your money that you gave us a thanks but no thanks we need the business that's what we need\nAnd and that's the because\nForget about the political pawns president doesn't need them he doesn't need to uh I Know everybody does it politically but this president doesn't need that\nAnd they're telling him basically it's ... it's doing the opposite\nRight because it is\nYou know it's just protectionist policy\nWhich brings about retaliation from our trade partners and then all of a sudden the farmers are hurting\nAnd it's not just ethanol farmers [laughter] it's I mean they get their government bailout with the ten percent mandate so I have to believe inside the White House right now they're probably\nScrambling well in terms\nOf of getting things done as you said it was it ... it wasn't just a coincidence that the president announced yesterday\nYes and and and that's the other thing too I mean for the president has a ... you know the uh the supportive of a lot of people and other and I know people who are otherwise\nConservative and say you know they supported the president they say well well this is all negotiation but wait he was a master negotiator why does he need to threat threatened and ultimately cost people a lot of money and hurt industry in order to get the ...\nThe go she Asian done he's a master negotiator he doesn't need to do that\nWell as I said you know and again him or we can go through any political rhetoric are out there but where was the win in NAFTA\nRight well and that's it\nExcept for the you know it and you can look as we said you can look at it the one percent increase in the market share for the United states in the Canadian dairy mhm but then they really won the you know they they the the whole timber thing which will be which will help America actually ... but the president did allow what what we\nExcept for the dairy that now which increases the market size you know the our our market potential of a one percent of the Canadian business which isn't a lot of dollars right overall was that worth the loss of business with the terrorists that the president has\nPut on that does raise the cost of goods and services and affected the cost of raw materials\nAnd other goods and services for American businesses\nAre businesses to actually produce it to get a one percent share more of the dairy market of Canada which is miniscule right because now but now he mentioned that but his big victory this is what the president said we're not is this isn't our opinion\nWas the automobile thing I got what I wanted an automobiles what did you get\nWhat we made it so some uh some employers of in Mexico have to pay sixteen dollars an hour ... some\nHave to do that well\nFine you just made them say okay we're going to go to automation quicker right ah and even with the was it uh I think it was a Wall Street journal said Boston I forgot who else said well it's only a to point\nWell it's only a two point five percent tariff so really isn't going to affect that it isn't that great so we're just we're still going to sell it and try to you know and and we're still not going to produce anything in the United states we're we're not we're not transferring any business to the United states because of that\nBut the other thing the president want to do is make sure that we could in the United states seller vehicles overseas well that's less likely to happen because the cost in the United states in Canada and in Mexico went up ... as to his caps on what what Mexico you know could send us in cars\nBefore other terrorists hit ... we have an ... they haven't reached that cap\nAnd car buying in the United states has stagnated\nSo they looked at that promote Canada and Mexico and said it sort of like what they did in South Korea where they said okay you can only do we now doubled the amount of cars uh with the safety precautions to twenty thousand that we can sell\nWould you prefer to read wrote king on your smartphone will scroll down version is also available at ... dot com simply click on view digital

have they looked at the president said look Republicans ... they they look and they just they were voting against the party or the president if it's true it's about I was saying that it's weak in the

most definitely be going to the polls\nIn November yeah it's really it's only when you think about that here's something else interesting looking at the end and it's just one small indicators of small movement but I find it interesting looking at our sci fi and the map for the house race or the house races\nSo Republicans took one from the Democrats\nI haven't figured out which one it is but it was at two o five Democrats in other words likely very likely\nDemocrats and one Ninety eight for Republicans it's now too old for for Democrats one Ninety nine for Republicans\nAnd the center of the toss up district still remains at thirty two and a two yes I Would love to see what your district that was a that that that shifted and I and again not from toss up but from the Democrats\nBut from the Democrats so I'll go back and look at it I I have no idea um but it is interesting so you but you do look at those thirty to keep in mind to Eighteen is the number\nThe magic number or for a majority right so right now only Nineteen to those thirty to need to go for uh the Republicans but even fewer uh fourteen only need to go for the Democrats\nSo\nIt will be interesting to watch those house races as we start seeing the polls\nAre and we and we will more and more are in the coming weeks that's going to be I'd be I think by the time we get back a week from Monday\nThings will start shaping up because those undecideds more and more of them will start making up their mind and that that's where a shift happens and what is the impact of the capital and that entire thing\nAnd really me and my look at the our CPA for example in Montana isn't a toss up state right with test or you know up or the last one was done not you know nine twenty two\nWhich had test her up for the one before and and uh with the margin of error three point seven five and the one before that was test her up just to why isn't that a toss up state why is that definitely yeah on the on the Senate race yeah unemployment rate right and and ... my point is though yeah is the legitimacy of\nThe hour cp average if they're going by polls and there are so very there there are a lot fewer poles when you talk about a lot of the congressional races out there\nWell the ... and I guess historically can shift happened uh\nWith ... if you look at the margin of error on the on the polls that were done by the recent polls that were done in that race or the the uh you know test her up by by four\nAnd a grab us a margin of error is three point seven so that you know that right there could be neck and neck are they calling a toss up because of the fact that you know it's still too close to the margin of error once we ought to consider is not a toss up that's my point ...\nMy point is it's our cp has it as definitely blue\nMm\nOn my map is still showing great it's just one gray\n[laughter] I didn't get it when it just went crazy I thanks to the staff at our CPA for ... it was it that way of what happened and just when it just went gray yeah All right I Apologize yeah I don't know if it updated it and then what I had was from a week ago or something\nBut it's just one great sense now I tiny brain asked myself like I Do wonder am I looking at the right Montana well and the look at the end when you're ... or something like ... and all of a sudden it updates Edwards gray in front of me yeah because ...\nArizona was ingrained before Arizona was like blue was slashed us or what men slightly favoring blues and I was going to ask sat next because it makes Sally and all of a sudden boom that appears in that comes up is great\nAnd that because ... there's been a huge swing there okay in recent polls are going from All right I'm a al Marri Sienna I'm cinema and and now she's plus six that's a huge swing\nDifferent pollster\nBut it is a it's a it's a pretty big swing so um and it is a it's a different uh the pollster in fact I'm Molly\nOkay I Know what I was looking at I had the one that said there's the R. C. P. Senate map\nOur CPA Senate map and the one next what is the Senate note taught sop\nOkay they don't include any taught sub Senate ... what I was okay that's what I was they had nobody there ... if you click that that's and I thought that was their general analysis oh right right it makes sense now yep yep 'cause I was like wait a how can you call\nA can't Montana and not be a toss up at this point right All right question answered oh by the way in at the wrong map out the\nThe New York times CNN poll this fly pull that continues basically uh you know four days up until the election actually look at Tennessee Blackburn now are on the days ten eight to ten eleven Blackburn now ahead by fourteen\nWhat'd you say it was a political that did the article on bread ascendant and his volunteers right furious the fact that he said he would have endorsed Kavanaugh\n... well something's happening there yeah I mean you see behind us and then the CNN\nPoll going back to a a between nine eleven and nine Fifteen of likely voters and Brad Olson was up five\nBut all these the polls the recent polls are from last week and this week show Blackburn leading but the New York times poll a ten eight to ten eleven uh the New York times the apple\nFort ... point lead for the Republican Marsha Blackburn\n... ... in a month that is a Nineteen points to swing yeah that's huge deficit is\nHuge are causing comments coming up eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nWanting to do for your goals ...

opposition research from\nA ... a fusion GPS who paid the former British spy\nChristopher Steele who got a information he says from the Russians close to the Kremlin in order to change the outcome of the election by getting unverified salacious allegations against Donald Trump\nThat they were going to use to kill his campaign and when they couldn't do that they wanted to use in order to destroy the legitimacy of the twenty sixteen election they also use that information\nAs a basis to get a secret warned against the Trump campaign while the campaign was actually going so you know you see fusion GPS\nWas a part of it well the co founder of the opposition research from Glen Simpson will invoke his first and Fifth Amendment privileges to avoid testifying before Congress next week his lawyer has told Congress\nAccording to the hill Simpsons attorney told house a judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte the Simpson will not appear for a deposition because the congressional investigation is not designed to discover the truth\nReally know\nThe average Virginia Republican subpoenaed Simpson on September twenty ninth\nOr after\nThe lawyer says Clyde would not appear voluntarily for an interview before members of the house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform committees\nSimpsons firmed up fusion GPS was hired during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign bottle law firm that represented the DNC and the Clinton campaign ... fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele\nTo conduct an investigation into Donald Trump's possible links to Russia the result of the probe was eight thirty five page report alleging collusion between the Trump campaign\nAnd the Kremlin Republican lawmakers are interested in the ... largely because the FBI reportedly relied on the unverified documents to obtain surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page so of course a lawyer is going to say you're not trying to get to the truth\nWell then what does the lawyers say they're trying to find here's I either get are they going to ask are they going to ask him about his personal taxes I don't I don't write are are they going to ask him about a a\nWho he believes is the best running back ever and the national football league if you are listening earlier to the show you understand why I brought\nThat up uh I don't think so what are they going to ask him up\nIt came up with ... they're going to ask him about Kanye West [laughter] probably not they're probably going to ask him about fusion GPS and their\nRole or\nIn the\nUh entire flow chart of the Democrats and the Hillary campaign colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the election\nSo here's my question thinking a of a fusion GPS Bruce or his wife was employed at fusion GPS yes\nThe\nInspector general's office\nOf the department of justice where Bruce or was employed as the and an associate deputy attorney general\nAh\nThe inspector general would have then access to any communications if they're still there between Bruce or and his wife if there were any to begin with and if they're still they're inspector general gets them for the asking\nA does he oh he but he yes from the department of justice\nYeah well yes because it because it why they were done internally they right on right on an official yes device from the department and I and and again if those are ... that's a number of ... right away from the point being is that\nYou look at all the in this case basically it's a it's a block because your GPS doesn't want to call for the truth they have no interest in doing that\nBut\nAh so how how would you find it otherwise well part I Would think part of that would be looking into Bruce or his involvement with a you know a\nProfessionally possibly with his wife and if there were any communications I think the number one thing you would do the first thing you you would do as you would look to see if there were any communications during that time and if they were on a those devices if they're still preserved in any way\nWe know you have the you know you have the right to claim fifth mhm yes I have to incriminate yourself yes and we understand what I Would wonder is a blend Simpsons lawyer mhm what is he worried about if they aren't let let's take him at his word mhm that the house Judiciary Committee\nAnd the house oversight committee aren't trying to get to the truth right\nThen I Would ask ... lawyer then what do you think they're going after right if they're not well look at our is is part of what they hypothetically as part of what they are concern what is the same thing as a Mueller investigation\nThe Mueller investigation has had nothing to do with actual Russia collusion with the Trump campaign right so that would be the question are you worried because of where the mother investigations is going is at the same thing might happen to you that there was nothing wrong that you did nothing wrong and\nI don't know I don't I don't know what I don't see any crime from what I Know of of fusion GPS committing any crime\nI don't know I'm One I don't know where there was any evidence of it you would uh concerning you know get gathering information and getting the money from ... they're an opposition research firm that just on the level is is ... that's what you do you get dirt on the other\nDirt on the other party's candidate or whatever you you do up as well do what they do opposition research is self explanatory so what does he worried about\nWhat would they be what possible crimes is Glenn Simpsons lawyer worried about\nWell and\nAnd finding the time it gets interesting look I say this because Donald Trump junior I testify I'll go under oath I'll do there are plenty of people that don't wander oh mhm so what is the crime that he is\n... ... what is the charge that Glenn Simpsons lawyer if you talk to him privately would be concerned about even if he believes his client did not commit a crime where does he think they're going\nTo try to prove that Glenn Simpson committed a crime and why would they be going after Glenn Simpson\n\nOr if there's someone else their fusion GPS he's worried about and by talking forget about incriminating himself he's incriminating\nIt's easier on the years in mind reads the stories to you well listen up for starters the print edition preferred by
