information aired on the following program\nThere and thanks for joining in this week's show I'm your host Chris McKay and I'm happy to have your long today is we explore and discovered this secrets their health and wellness fine I Want to start\nBy sending a big thank you onto our sponsor today oceanic natural they're one of the best sources of high quality nutritional formulas using the powerful nutrients from our oceans and you can visit them online anytime at oceanic natural dot com which you check them out when you have a chance to have some great information there on the Web site\nToday I Want to welcome Sherry granted here back to the show Sherry it's great to have you back in the studio with us thank Chris afraid to be here you know share he's been on the show a number of times or for those that may not remember Sherrie is a nationally recognized nutritionist\nAnd alternative health advisor she's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional athletes she's also written several books on health and nutrition\nAnd Sherry last time you're on the show we were talking about seaweed and about a new natural supplement called title greens yeah which comes from seaweed\nYes and it is called title greens and it is from oceanic naturals and what it is it's a multi nutrients the we blend edited sixty times more potent\nThan any land based vegetable and what I Love about it is it addresses so many other health problems that people are facing today because they just are not getting the nutrients they need were literally dying from our diet in fact the Centers for Disease Control ... a fact sheet\nThat indicates that poor nutrition and lack of exercise or the number to cause of death in this country and if they're ever going if we keep us up it'll be number one very than\nIt is it's sad but you know we're we're we're not in a situation where we are starving now\nUnfortunately the foods that were eating or not as nutrient dense as they used to be for example vegetables back in the Nineteen sixties okay they were fifty percent more nutritious than they are today because there were more nutrients in the soil\nEven if you're trying to eat a healthy diet trying to get those fruits and vegetables you still may not be getting the nutrients\nExactly yes that's very true and then when you add the synthetic fertilizers and pesticides you've got a recipe for a lot of malnutrition the city and disease but you know the good news is there's a lotta nutritional benefits from the sea and that's what we're learning about and that's the title\n... really exciting I mean there there are some remarkable discoveries now coming from the ocean\nYes even the FDA the food and Drug Administration they publish articles that\nThey publish articles that suggested many treasures from the sea will actually give us a medical answers that we are looking for for example the scientists are examining the metabolites of single celled plankton which the national Cancer Institute tests have shown to have cancer fighting potential it's amazing research in this area is in high gear and labs all across the United states\nAnd and I want to get into this a little bit but but maybe just to set this thing up okay what are some of the symptoms that you know their body is not getting the right kinds of nutrients\nWell all sorts of illnesses and diseases they have pain in the body pain in the muscles pain in the joints they find that there's still lacking energy um food cravings eczema allergies digestive problems lackluster hair dry skin brittle nails those are also a sign\nAnd you know the bottom line is you just don't feel good but you can't put your finger on why\nYeah and I think there's a lot of people in that situation\nAnd they do think it's part of aging and this is what I'm gonna have to deal with which drives me crazy I'm like no it doesn't have to be that way and what I Want our listeners to understand is that a gene isn't about the breaking down of our bodies at all it's more about how the body repairs itself your body wants to heal itself it wants to repair itself\nAnd if you give your body what it needs it will do that\nMhm so what about seaweed why is this kind of the key\nWell first of all title greens has a blend of seaweed that are the most nutrient dense vegetables on a lot of different seaweeds right yeah there's over twelve thousand ... and the other reason that seaweed is so unique is that it's sixty times more potent\nThan any land based vegetables see we have more phytochemicals the word means plants chemicals and these plant compounds are\nAnd building ourselves these phytochemicals really do play an important role in the biology of ourselves okay in fact these phytochemicals there is so powerful that they enable seaweed entitle greens to grow at a rate of one to two feet per day without a route\nThat that's amazing so more anti accidents more minerals more amino acids lip it's trace minerals enzymes we need enzymes today just their food especially as we get older yeah I'm plants they're almost like a gym slave annoys Polly females many of which are not even found in land based plants\nAnd we're talking about the minerals like calcium ten times more in the way then in a glass of milk um sodium magnesium which keeps the muscles relax potassium iodine iron and zinc\nAnd then of course of vitamins vitamin a B. one be to be six nights and vitamin C. pets authentic acid and folic acid I mean there's even trace amounts of vitamin B. twelve that you cannot get from any land based plants I mean the list goes on and on and you know I it'd be great if we can just go out and drink the water in the ocean but\nYou can't do that now but what we can do is consumed those powerful vegetables that are in the sea in the form of seaweed Chrissy we'd have all the nutrients that are required by human beings to live so in other words if you ain't nothing else but seaweed you can sustain a very healthy life oh\nReally yeah it sounds like a great solution here before we go on I just want to let the listeners know that if you'd like to try title dreams risk free and get free

the calcium but what does magnesium forward\nTalking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium is probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that he's he was involved with is almost like a hormone wild and for example if that was a low levels of magnesium your heart won't be very important factor in life\nYou would say so\nIn fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions that are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety has autism\nAnd chronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps\nBargains says that's due process and the list just goes on and on and on and\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium and the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully you know

I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has a magnesium deficiency\nThat's what happened is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency spending a gleaming museum they don't absorb but their food\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know that's used you might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing\nAnd a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more\nGrass or whatever right that that's what I Would think that what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of museums\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones start getting bone loss you start getting all muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and your body it actually started to manifest at\nAll due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nAnd let me tell you and it is simple\nThe problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get the end of the

binge watching that was the door to the United States Supreme court and when I Know you've been to Washington many times yes I've\nBeen I've been in front of the court many many times\nI've had a case before that court I'd been in that court um I have been with friends and those steps I have met with the media after oral arguments and spoke from those steps\nUm and I have taken tours of the Supreme Court I brought friends of the Supreme Court and I can tell you with absolute certainty\nThat the last time I was in Washington DC and ah I I had some time on an evening and I decided I Would like to do a prayer walk just just quietly no no no snow crowd no one knows just walking past some of these institutional buildings of our government passed the capital and just take a moment in prey\nI got to the Supreme Court and that's how much I've been to the Supreme Court and been involved with a case before the Supreme Court and so I was familiar with the area I knew not to walk up the stairs or try to get to the door as is interesting is that door is does that door his artwork on it that's very significant in our culture\nThat you ... to the world wind\nAnd of course it's a comment that are now justice Kavanaugh made in his testimony before the committee saying what we're doing here by the process that we're going through\nIs we are showing to the wind by doing these that the approach that we're taking now on confirmations is is so into it and we will read the world when he was trying to say this won't end here what we're doing here is a mistake and it will come back\nIn a volume I Would suggest that what we saw actually was the beginning of the world with no I think we've been showing this since the Nineteen hundreds in the over accelerated over emphasized overvalued\nPower if you will of the Supreme Court that was never designed to be that way in the constitution and has been ... nippy elated that way by the progressive movement and progressive and understand this\nDemocrat and Republican come bind who have worked against the founding document of the constitution to amplify the influence of the court far beyond it's appropriate role\nYou know proof that we have over valued the Supreme Court\nIs that a few generations ago or let's say early Nineteen hundreds there were no Senate hearings\nFor Supreme Court nominees they simply submitted affidavit that yet there were no hearings now we've turned it into everybody says a media circus but it's an audio visual circus for political agendas\nAre waning them in the monthly update Jeff I I use the terms that this was a show trial that would've made the Soviet Union blush\nHome for Jeff even if they go back to the practice of just nominating and then that person gets a escorted around to all the different offices and ... every Saturday just to have a personal conversation with the nominee and there is no\nQuote unquote hearing as soon as an accusation comes to the forefront is going to be a hearing\nYou know we're not going to get a different we're not going to go back in the bottom yarn and going back to nine months to go back for a second\nDon't ask a different question which is how did we get here how did we get here and and that's sort of ... some of the conversation we had an update and\nAnd I I I Would prefer that there's three reasons we got here the first is that we abandoned the founding principle of self evident truth and not only do we band of the founding documents the founding construct of the country but we we abandoned the founding principle of self evident truths\nEvident truth we're not living it we so we we we sewed to the to to to moral relativism and now we are reaping the whirlwind of everyone now is entitled to their truth her truth his truth what ever happened to self evident truths\nAnd the world windows in the ... century I mean we're we're getting pummeled by the storms will if you have your truth and I have my truth that was my truth better than your truth\nHow will we ever reach to the consent of the governed if there is nothing that brings us together to a shared belief in a\nSelf evident truths\nWe all agree on what the truth is that's the whole premise of the ... of the founding of our declaration of independence was we looked at all the ... truth claims we've looked at the conflicts that we're in and we found a way out that's based upon a transcendent truth to it which we all agree\nOn I think we've seen people on both sides of the aisle a act a bit hypocritical when it comes to some things when they've been searching for truth because maybe the truth didn't fit their political agenda\nMaybe you'll see him make accusations against one party or defend\nA colleague based on political preference where they would attack on the other side now there's an irony and all of this because for years we've we've watched I going back to to the Nineteen seventies in French Schaffer in some someone that I was familiar with in some uh a a a work\nAnd effort a scholarship in the ministry of debris that I was was was can fluent in if you will and I often talk about Dr Schaefer infancy had on my life and my wife's life and and how did that so that everybody knows that story\nUp he's been taught was talking about it people preceded him outright Richard John Newhouse Chuck wholesome at the truce project how many people have done projects about truth about truth about truth about truth about the importance\nOf truth and yet in the midst of this how many evangelical churches took the time\nTo have this as a learning opportunity to explain the importance of absolute truth of divine truth of ... and a half truth is to elevate is out of our parochial self interest and cause us to a higher are good and then if we believe in a creator who rewards us as we follow the truth\nThat obeying the truth and putting the truth above everything else\nIs the best way to love your neighbor and to be blessed it's not his truth it's not her truth it is not our truth it is the truth\nBut yet where is the church speaking out about truth we are now showing we've sewn to the wind and moral relativism in our culture were reaping the whirlwind and I've gotta tell ya\nThere's no pastors calling St we've got to do more about this\nThere's no ... did you get any more speaking engagement since all this went on out in churches raw just the one in my home church that I was scheduled to do the passed around me up front for three you know three to five minutes we talked I voters in a number of other things but know\nWhat I'm saying is that pastors around the country are fleeing from this conversation because they are terrified of the intensity of it and they don't know what to do\nThey don't want people clawing at their door so that does that it yeah Dave in the written update you also cite the breakdown of the family how does that contribute to where we are now\nWe have abandoned the practice of faithful relationships in the context of family\nAnd Wayne what I mean by that is we are now creating we have created we have reaped the whirlwind of a generation of lost boys and lost girls who are angry\nThey are angry because their families have fallen apart they don't understand because they've never experienced the love of a mother and father\nThey are orphaned in relationships and they are angry and reality has been replaced for them by pop culture and by academics in academia they have a different world view and they're angry and so when you put up a moral authority up on a high hill in a court\nAnd you elevate upper turnoff figure into that situation the angry people boys and girls whose families have fallen apart they're angry at the very notion of it's\nAlso in the absence of absolute moral true the only thing that is left is might makes right and that's why you see these people attacking the door the Supreme Court\nManner thing is with a disintegration or the weakening of the family unit that age group of young people become very peer driven and Pierre dependent\nAnd so you take the ignorance of one young person who doesn't know the foundational principles and they began talking as if they have authority to another pier and it's just like a [noise]\nIt's like a leaky dripping wet sponge that just kind of it's messy\nWell look at the logic of this we saw this in the sixties that you know we had the generation gap in the sixties and we had the hippie movement in the sixties and there was this giant rift between the world war two generation would come back and their kids growing up or angry at society and culture\nAnd where this giant cultural generation rift and boom the explosion comes well look at this one look at these kids climbing and crying and screaming and cutting themselves before the Supreme Court doors bill and like Rob said what if they had\nGotten in well wait a minute wait a minute which of these people as homeless I mean what are these people has not\nBeen fed which some of these people were getting paid to do this what is their beef with the American system of justice that would cause this behavior however they been so wrong to accepting some mystical illusion of moral authority\nThat they object to and it wasn't just young people I thought I saw people that looked like they might have been older than me you know this is multigenerational\nYeah the ones that were meeting at the door seem to be a lot younger but the protests on the street where all ages it it's just it's just a progressive uh peeling back the curtain has been peeled back\nNot viewed what was happening during the confirmation hearings as the elected officials acting as entertainers at times and trying to fire up the people they could get fired up and see what reactions they could get\nYou know that's the part that makes me so so so sad I I have shed tears during during this process watching this because I'm so sad how divided we are as a country I don't know what the percentages are but a good chunk of this country literally thinks\nThat we that we have a sexual predator that is now on on this court and that's that's very sad at how\nHow this was played out while a you know ... ... let's just take a second and quantify that because there is the third reason that we've talked about about and and we've talked about the the the breakdown of the family and the anger that that's created we we've talked about sewing to\nThe ... the wind of divorcing ourselves from self evident truths and then the final pieces that we stopped teaching true truths about America's founding to a certain degree\nSome of the people that are doing this are doing what they were taught\nThere walking out the America that they were taught the democracy not the constitutional republic based upon self evident truth were every one would be held accountable for their actions they have been taught America is a democracy that is driven by public opinion by\nPolls and by the force of protest this is what we taught them with our tax dollars in public schools and universities\nThose in political office to understand\nBy let's take that break we'll come back we're talking generally from our monthly update and if you'd like to receive the obtain\nAnd ask for an online the public's where Don Young [noise]\nWe'll be right back for more on the public square\n\nLet's get right back into the conversation today on the public square this conversation is prompted a in large part by Dave's running of the monthly update which I Hope you're getting and if you're not sure that you look that up on line at our\nWebsite or actually get it in print sent to your home I think you'll enjoy reading at each month okay where do we go from here to\nIf the question is is it too late we've been talking about this for forty years this is a cumulative reality we have been pointing out that the ...\nPointing out that the loss of truth in our culture becoming a ruthless culture would eventually that's showing that methodology the God Bless equation the truth less equation would ultimately reap the world where we would have anarchy and chaos\nAnd the premise now is that power for the progressive left what we've seen is the is the manifestation of their core doctrine which is\nThat the truth is subject to power\nIn other words it's your truth it's hurt truth it's his truth and the person who's truth prevails is the person that has the power that's why they are so wailing against the loss of power because their powers in power it's not in truth\nAnd what and and and this is the reality of what we've raped and so the question is is it too late Kent people of truth come back to the marketplace of the first question we got asked herself is there anybody left who still believes the truth\nAnd you know we're we're in the business of following this from a biblical perspective so we constantly see the question of the remnants\nThe notion in the parable Jesus talked about in the stores that guess what folks a lot of times most people aren't going to get it but the conflict for people of faith who understand the concept of a remnant and the power of the ... the importance of bearing witness to the truth is that when it comes to electoral accountability in our culture\nThe votes count\nIn other words remnants don't win elections majorities win elections\nAnd that's why you hear some people on the left talking about wanting to change the dynamics of elections and how people are elected so represents each part of the\nQuestion comes up is a biblical to believe a majority rule or as a biblical simply say we're smarter than you rich or the new more power than you or we get it more than you are we care more than you therefore we're we will rule and you'll accept or else\nThis is the great conflict of the human struggle\nAnd the answer to that is biblical it comes to us from the concept of the consent of the governed God has placed the consent of the governors of core biblical principles so the votes actually do count our history gives us the ability to vote for the context of the government that we want to have\nSo when you save voting matters\nBoil boy does it matter\nBecause the people who vote will decide whether or not we will maintain our systems and the truth premises of those systems\nAnd the application of those systems in the role of constitutional law based upon principles like the presumption of innocence due process of law fair treatment in the courts all people being equal before the law or whether we will move\nTo the screeching clawing wailing sounds of people knocking down the doors of the Supreme Court to get what they want\nIt is that star ... it is that start\nWith do a better job of teaching as well we have to do a better job of teaching history we have to do a better job of teaching civil government where it came from ... who represents the people how elections are how there's so much misinformation out there and there's so many people that were caught the wrong way it amazes me when I hear people speak on this\nThat they haven't studied not only our history\nBut the history of others to see what mistakes have been made the right time so that those aren't repeated Rob I'm Glad you mentioned that because I've been sitting here thinking that many people feel the answer is just getting the right the right to party in power or not the answer at all\nBoy not only is that the wrong answer every one of the things we need to repent ... is our addiction to political parties and I'm Glad that she brought that up owing because this is where people take the opt out they say\nSay well you know the politics that's for parties and not a partisan person I don't want to get involved not going to put a yard sign not going to give up I'll go vote yeah but I'm just not going to get involved because\nBecause you know I just don't like look the partisan party thing is the disaster and the reason that the parties exist today and the power that they exist is because we have all chosen to binge watch we have all chosen we'd much rather have entertainment and athletics and\nAnd lifestyle than to take a core part of our identity and invest it in our form of civil government\nAnd make it better I Would cite the parable of the talents as an example\nThe parable of the towns where Jesus Says that someone was the master was leaving and he left his servants each with a certain amount of talents and said do something when these I wanted to count when I come back and one would have five towns lump got five more one at ten tells got to get ten more and one of them was given a talent\nAnd he hit it and acted buried in the ground and the master came back and said what you do with my tally said look I knew you were tough guy and you would expect something for this and I didn't want to lose your talent so I Would basically hit it underground here's what you gave me back I didn't screw this up\n[laughter] at which point he was his damned by his master because she didn't improve upon what he was given and the minister said oh you had to do is give it to the bank I could at least gotten my two percent\nYou didn't mess thing with what was given to you\nKnow my question is to believers to people of faith a biblical faith in America\nThe talent we'd been handed is a form of civil government that not only generations of people died for fought for ... and was was headed to us as a first right what have we done to make America better\nThe unfaithful steward was playing it safe he wasn't risking things he wasn't trying to ah make himself a target if you go out and you try to improve things you're going to be a target you are taking a risk you need to do this\nIs being out of our comfort zone yeah Jesus is outside the boat right to stay in the boat and we get out of the boat and get out of our comfort zone because that's where he meets us we can't afford to be ... we're way past that point in time but\nWe cannot also think for one second\nThat pushing yourself to the Democrat Party pledging yourself to the Republican Party pledging yourself to any political party is the answer because this is not about parties\nIt is not about the accumulation of power is about the ... the prevalence of ideas is about restoring the founding concepts to the practice of our everyday lives and anyone of any party should be able to embrace the core realities of the declaration and the constitution unless\nWhat they're advocating is a different form of America now if we want to have a different form of America\nThat's a fair argument and a fair debate but let's not masquerade as Democrat or Republican when we do that let's acknowledge what we are we're either for America as it was developed and as it exists in the ideas forward against it let's have the nobility to not mask ourselves behind seats in the Senate and mask ourselves behind\nClosed doors at the Supreme Court ... and for that matter for the Republicans don't mashed yourself behind any movement trend or personality what do you believe civil government should be what do you believe the Bible says it should be and what do you believe your responsibility is because you were handed to freeze form a civil government on the history of this planet\nWhat have you done to make it better\nAnd if and wants his back and says well it's dirty business and and you know I just don't want to ruin my witness I'm afraid that people won't like me and then they won't\nWell like me and then they won't want Jesus because they won't agree with my politics it's dirty because we don't get in falls and God tells us to get involved into a very dirty world and we can do a better job teaching it around the dinner table rather than leaving it up for someone else to teach\nLet me interrupt because I hate to do this all the time we've got to take a break\nThis is
