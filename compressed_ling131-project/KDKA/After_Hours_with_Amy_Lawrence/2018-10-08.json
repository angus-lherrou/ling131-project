get rid of the electoral\nCollege uh we had to go through all the explanation of the electoral college over a period of time and now that Brett Kavanaugh has been confirmed and is now he's Supreme Court justice\nThe next call is coming out and I was waiting for you when I talked about this before who said we we'd said if you listen to the show for a while you know for the last couple of years we've been saying if the left truly wishes to get rid of the electoral college in the next step also is to get\nRid of the Senate there you go yeah yeah ... can ... a reporter at NBC News ...\nOr over the weekend on Saturday\nIt may not happen in our lifetimes but the idea that North Dakota and New York get the same representation in the Senate has to change senators representing less than half of the U.S are about to confirm a nominee opposed by most Americans\nI don't know if that's true because I saw the poll that was across America that showed a that uh if the FBI did the investigation that sixty percent of Americans were in favor so I'm right well\nAnd I guess they're doing it on the population of the state's fault resented the yes okay or they're gay or do okay I'm being those fifty senators in this case so then the senators don't necessarily represent\nThe population of the United states right\nNecessarily oh that was that was his point yeah uh but you know when when we we've talked about this for the longest time that\nUh and we started with freedom of speech few years back when\nThe left him out and it was the big thing that you know corporations and any group people should not have free speech writings that their free speech is only for the individual uh but gun rights or for the groups right [laughter] for the militia but not the individual and we said no the the bill of rights\nAh is ah about\nThe individual and groups of individuals because you have two people does not mean that you lose your freedom of speech we heard you know the the argument that on freedom of speech while a cause they decided to stick to corporations even though would evolved a as we know I'm\nAnd you know it's interesting because you look at what happened after Trump was elected and you had\nPeople on the left you know then that at at that point start talking about uh we want our guns because not all but some on the left we want our guns because uh uh of the possibility of a tyrannical government\nHey welcome to the second amendment\nNow they're excuse the appointed of course directly to this president but it was about the same idea basic idea of the

it was small but much smaller than of course changed doing away with the Senate completely\nWe didn't know we were going to have to pay we thought and someone else was going to pay for it\nYeah well lesson learned\nYou start coming in and you start changing the very foundation of the constitution and they do believe this is this is really been the game all along\nYou know the the the whole um a changing of the first amendment isn't just about\nProtecting their free speech because of the things they want to say and doing away with yours and we've talked about that battle but it's also doing away with the freedom of religion because your religion is bigoted\nIt it needs to go away completely\nBecause we disagree with the freedom of speech while we protect that when it's us it's our group

and I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety run out let's go to Brian in New York City Brian Hi you're on the road I Radio Welcome Brian\nThank you for taking my call ... ... as far as to cabinet are heroes go on the compilation it it wouldn't allow that who was elected president other Republican side it would have done this to anyone rub the crews ... whoever you own your own shares the way Trump fights back\nIs like a lion and and and and and he just makes me very proud to be in America and they were actually very proud to say that I voted bad\nI'm a I Would say this Bryan that I I'm not sure and we will we will never know but I'm not sure how another Republican would have reacted to the heat on Kavanaugh\nIf they might have withdrawn his nomination and I think that's something to consider is that is it that Trump or wouldn't back down and and he refused to withdraw that nomination that's a possibility I don't know how to quantify that because we'll never know but it's I think we have to consider that possibility\nWell back you're like all your wind them ... or you take your and but he brings up a point that we've made along we made it last week made of the week before ... ... you know while this is what you get when you get Trump now this would have happened no matter what\nIs this the the the craziness surrounding it and and the left behavior definitely would have happened I'm In the past Republicans other Republicans might have been apparently not Lindsey Graham but [laughter] but other Republicans might have because we talked about how the Republicans in the past I've\nHad been quick to eat their own I don't I don't know I Can't say that about a is it because we don't we'll never know\nIf Ted Cruz had one or is he mentioned a Rubio or anybody else in other Republican were there or Mike Pence I have no idea or we don't know if if they would have withdrawn the nomination um when the president is president basically said okay fine we'll do another FBI background check\n'em you know giving it the tire a vetting process of seven complete background checks\nHave those discussions but we've said from the beginning\nIt is the reason that you from the beginning so you know ultimately with your vote that it becomes well as it always is that buying their decision and then along the way regardless of whether or not and I saw somebody in my neighborhood with for Ted Cruz signs in their yard\nI thought you know not one not too\nA total of four they're really really voting for a group and so our time for science I'm ... and and I thought I thought to myself you know okay that's that's a that kind of enthusiasm\nUm even if we were to show that uh we don't do and we don't do endorsements because again as we mentioned earlier I don't believe they really do anything and tells it it might tell your audience which way you're going but there are the the point is is that we have the discussion\nOn the ideas and we believe that our audience and the rest of the country is smart enough to make their own decisions they may be willfully ignorant not our listeners but others may be willfully ignorant along the way they can make their decision\nOr you know or are there still capable of finding the information whether they choose to or not but ultimately it is about ah when that person is elected if I\nIf I'm campaigning for them if I'm doing a volunteer work for them if I donate to their campaign\nTheir campaign I'm Still from day one going to watch them on on the issues on their work you judge them on the work and then of course a head of that work you are back them in order to you know uh to to\nHave them do that work to keep them in place to do that work and you see a George W. Bush or anybody else\nThat came together in most did on the right or for judge Kavanaugh's confirmation and it really was about what the work and and and the results of the work of this president by nominating Kavanaugh but also the Senate or more importantly more recently\nUh the work there and why it's important for Republicans in this case right now to be banded together a because it used to be where we could have the discussion will still have them I'm sure\nOf the you know the far right conservatives on Capitol Hill versus the moderates um but the ... and one of those moderates along the way would include a Lindsey Graham\nI was just going to I was just going to um mentioned that that we knew that three weeks ago mhm that the left was motivated because I hate Trump right uh I don't know how much more motivated they could get I don't know this whole debate the more or whether there'll be a\nA whether there'll be more of a sign of of despair and hopelessness we know that there and young people and I haven't seen a change in the young people that vote Democrat are are not enthusiastic about voting in this mid term ... and that could hurt the Democrats\nBut what I Know now know is that the Republican Party you mentioned Lindsey Graham you look at look at Lindsey Graham and the fight to defend Trump and his pick yeah because if you are defending his peck your defending Trump right there is a unity there if you see the George W. Bush or read that called Collins numerous times\nAh to tell her how to a vote when you see the Collins speech yeah and\nAnd except for ... yeah it's really a ... ... there were some things I disagreed with her on her speech and like when she gave a Dianne Feinstein the past and the big pass which he shouldn't have done because I Dianne Feinstein was the reason that we got to this point to begin with\nAnd to say that I Know that she would never leak anything like that is forgetting about everything else that she did wrong and\nAh but the fact is Collins speech was very very thorough walk through every single a point and came across as very very common sense and this is Susan Collins\nDefending the great Trump pick of Brett Kavanaugh um you know you can only fight\nSo much within your own party ... before you realize it's working against you and the things that you wish to\nUh uh get done as a Republican or Republican is party right now is a pretty big party it's a pretty big party going from conservatives to moderate liberal really is as many when you come when it comes to spending culturally uh probably a more right than they've been in a while\nA more constitutional and they've been in a while when it comes to social issues\nNot spending issues are there as bad as Democrats have been in the past ah ah ah right now and you know but and and that's a shame but overall when you look at it you have unity in that party\nAs I said last week like I Can't remember when we had shut unity part of it is the fight or from the president but the president has always had that fight in rhetoric but in substance you know when some of the people that he picked\nSome of the people that he picked and how he would change his opinions or a ... on them and not stick with them and you know even you know going after sessions as he still goes after them as he did others early on made you think OK doesn't really know who is picking doesn't really have confidence and the people out there and him sticking by Kavanaugh\nWasn't just rhetoric it was the substance of no he stays and we're going with him and I don't know whether that embolden other people to say what they what they said I don't know you know ... what was the spark that drove Lindsey Graham touched still be on the Sunday Morning news show saying he'll GO Campaign anywhere in any purple state\nYeah right ... you know and that's it ... because that's where the effort has to be we can still have the discussions within a the right\nOn issues of where we need to go especially putting pressure on them to control spending\nTo change fiscal policy\nOr to the extent that it is going to be meaningful and mean great things long term for this country I I think we are light years right now or to say that this kind of momentum can get us to that point where we can change the spending habits I mean for Republicans\nAnd their mentality on that is is not there yet we're we're probably a ways from that\nBecause that goes back to again what we said the base of the the rank and file Republicans and and what they want out of their government but again that's a discussion we can have\nUltimately what has to happen though and this is this is you see this to some extent on the left while in social media and in the protests calling out or or even officially the calling out of a Dianne Feinstein I mean before this process of the uh Democrats of California you know not backing her officially\nA for her run and that kind of again that's there's that's an anomaly\nOften on the left they are better than the right\nAt letting the uh mansions of the world and even maybe a high camp uh uh do what they do in their state because it gives them the seat ultimately on other end the vote on other issues\nI'm On the right there has to be I I guess a greater unity politically on Capitol Hill of\nBuilding building the wall really if you if you think about it\nThat guards guards this nation against the kind of behavior we saw over the last few weeks\nThis is not this kind of behavior is not over they believe they almost got there they believe they did change the process they do believe they can change the process and other items if they get a head start which is why they start with well we need to do away with the Senate\nAnd we predicted this at the moment they talked about getting away with a good well in the way with the natural dollar the Democratic senators won't before they know that's it's not going to have you know it's not ... but the point being is their behavior is not going to change and they'll work to that end\nAnd it means if the because of they're willing to you know to talk about and and maybe even get some kind of movement growing movement and the calling for doing away with the Senate which again will never happen\nThey are willing to do and and work in any in every direction to do away with this and that and those little things\nAnd that guard has to be built that tower that castle if you will that wall that ... has to be built around this nation to protect this constitution\nCan get a few things done if you're not unified but I Believe you get a lot more things done when you're unified especially when you're unified\nWhen you're unified over the substance of of an issue in the substance is here\nI'm a very easy presumption of innocence right due process constitutional issues not defending somebody when you talk about those are all ... usually moral issues\nAnd that's what has United the Republican Party I Hope it continues to unite them through the election and if they're able to take the house it'll be interesting to see if they can take that unity into two thousand Nineteen and two thousand twenty\nAnd get legislation passed that is extremely productive and conservative\nAnd hopefully give Trump a chance to win and twenty twenty against eight\nYeah ... ... or a book or right by the way I remember after the Roy Moore last that's when they

I think it is about the fact that\nYou have the as I've said why'd I think it was Washington Examiner said a a quarter of Republicans or identify themselves as social is a quarter and a half a Democrat but a quarter of Republicans and I thought to myself you know that shows you how wide the Republican Party is\nUh right now and this and the anger and the unity comes from the fact\nThat they've listened to a Democrat Party and the mainstream of the Democratic party who when you listen to it you're not talking about the fringe anymore you're talking about the mainstream leadership those in the Senate Judiciary committee\nThat are talking insane ... they're talking about things that are completely against fairness and constitutional issues that are just so important just so many of us the presumption of ... of of of innocence\nYeah and it's just driving the Republicans crazy for video world log here's your forecast\nBegin the week with a very active weather map there are at

sequel you know this was quite so illogical or half a sad end he suggests that you are auditioning for a play is Jeff Sessions as attorney general you're a sponsor\nA Frank you don't know what you're talking about in your world Frank is a noble cause to destroy judicial candidates whose conservative whether it be Thomas lido more ... now cabinet\nOn bipartisan when it makes sense [noise] uh I've tried to having good disposition costs are like my job but don't mistake that I don't care about the conservative cause so if I made you upset because I Would not legitimize McCarthyism\nThings good and I think I can survive and South Carolina\nWell you know the thing is is that uh I think Lindsey Graham needs to get off the that was what he really thinks first of all I think it is going to be a positive if he's campaigning\nI'm a second of all I think the momentum from the from uh the uh the outrage that he just\nAge that he delivered a there on Capitol Hill that day I think will I I think\nThat is that needs to be carried through but not just through the election not just through the mid term election it needs to be carried through in that attitude needs to be carried\nThrough a on important things that that ah that matter beyond that including a legislative items and other and and who knows what kinds of other nomination process we may go through a while a Trump still president but uh you know making some very solid point\nOr the left who was going to you know they used to him when it's convenient that's what they do they point to the right\nAh Lindsey Graham and the you know since Trump has been president\nAnything that doesn't go along with you know any comment a that that counters the president the left one or do you use that\nAnd and and\nAnd really kind of a position Lindsey Graham to be\nThe bipartisan willing to cross the aisle Republican that John McCain was and in some ways he was but of course you're demonized\nNow you're Hitler because you stand for something on its merits you stand for something based on the behavior of the left and your outraged and rightly so\nWell you know the thing is and reading Frank ... column and the New York times that none of it relates to the actual\nCase and what he was talking about there is it's it's about the fact that Lindsey Graham has had differences with Donald Trump right and you know in Trump is you know been in a Trump has been means woman called them names and things like that and there's been an animosity between the two and therefore\n[laughter] somehow Lindsey Graham shouldn't be taking Trump side with Trump's candidate I mean it seems that really\nDoesn't get what we said earlier this whole cabinet thing wasn't about Trump\nIt really wasn't a Bernie doesn't get that and\nI don't know I I have to go back on and and count the number of comments\nMade for or against Trump or from Lindsey Graham but Lindsey Graham's a when he issued this concern that day or a week ago last Thursday it was based on the lack of merits of the case\nAnd the ... and on the larger\nA much to a larger extent\nAre pretty much the treatment of Kavanaugh by the Democrats\nAnd and not the not the liberals with the signs outside look right the Democrats on the committee Frank Bruni has nothing to the article he's got nothing well he's angry he's yeah they're they're they're wrong as I've said as we\nDiscuss this for the last two and a half weeks\nWe didn't have any one I have not seen any rational thought or critical thinking statement come from the mainstream media or the Democrats\nTo say that the position that I hold and you hold which wouldn't be similar in this particular case to Lindsey Graham yeah where is flawed at all\nExcept for rhetoric and bringing up other things that have nothing to do with this case with this nomination process\nWith the witnesses and the allegations that came forward every single point that we had made\nWhich are the same what I can see as Lindsey Graham are all legit and the oldest is going to drive the nuts and morals and correct\nAnd right and you're wrong and reading Frank Bernie's column in the New York times you're a simple pin Mr Bruni\nTalked about the actual things that Lindsey Graham brought up gold point by point and say any of the things that he said we're wrong you can't do that because then you'd be line yep\n\nYeah I mean it is again a the\nThey just lack the will to have the debate they don't have that debate you can't have the debate so they have to step out and ... what Lindsey Graham said on that day so they do what well they used to be for Trump now he's against Trump that's basically the gist of it right\n\nWell from their world absolute loyalty is expected as we've said in the real world it's I like this candidate for this don't like him for this all the right over there that's a good nominate that's that's a good nomination pick over there I like that I don't like this\nReal people in critical thinking people and people with rational thought Mr Bruni can do that\nI can say that there are plenty of times I disagreed\nWith Lindsey Graham and John might in the future you are you running for attorney general right [laughter]\nAbout ... the ... general what are you trying to get out of ... exactly ... well that's it he's only doing this to be ... well again that's because you can debate the points that he made the only point you have as he was against Trump and now he's four trough\nWe we've said with the simple ten you know a arguments that will never and I called them simple and arguments because they never directly go after the the particulars of an issue that we are discussing they always tried to bring up side issues that aren't\nAren't even um pertinent to what you're discussing right\n... and you read British telling me like what about the allegations made that they're not wrong you're just saying he's kissing Trump spot to become a Ernie general yeah you know evidence of that you're not contradicting the points that he made your simply saying he's making it and he shouldn't be making it because\nHe was one of the most fierce anti Trump hers and now he's agreeing with him and if you disagree with Trump you must always disagree with Trump which of course is hogwash yes\nYeah it it it is the insanity of the left and and again uh they ... well ... it's funny because they used to uh pretend to be the site that had the greater intellect [laughter] I'll tell you that they are no they don't but it is the ... they keep going for the low hanging fruit\nAnd and the and and really the brunt of the argument right now is well he's just trying to get something out of Trump or he used to hate Trump but now he likes Trump\n\nDebate him on the points made on that day Mr Bruni can't can't do it eight six six Ninety read I\nWas told that it's a six month he wrote a [noise]\nMiss her show listen anywhere and anytime on demand to catch up on Eric and

S. try now for free at ... dot com slash free that zip recruiter dot com slash free the smartest way to hire a centrist by the reading of hiring I ever went to the radio [noise]\n... ... is our hunting and I'm Gary McNamara eight six six nine to write I let's go to Marty in ... California a mark Marty welcome Hi you're on the Radio Welcome to the show\nYou guys great show as usual thanks like I had a ... and I don't know if that's relevant but I think that if mark judge word to possibly a super slander or ... or ... or\n... whatever his name is uh uh I think that may do some I think I think that may slow them down a little bit in their efforts because I agree with you guys are going to continue to this guy um but I think that if judge were super slander or level oh\nHe's a private citizen yet because he's not on the same rules of capping off down or anybody else in public office he's a private citizen who was when I brought it and I think it would slow them down I think that would give them food food for thought\nI I mean you look at it and it seems like a Dr ... her attorneys are are looking to basically\nSo are are looking to basically not pursue this any further\nUm maybe there's something there and maybe there's the they've already heard from judge ... or ... or is lawyers but certainly at the very least we can say what we do know is fact is that he would have a case or is he willing to pursue that or not is the question but\nUm he would be looking to protect his name I mean it would be something that I Would pursue because my name was ... was made public\nA through this with with the leak and everything else ah that's and and who else would be responsible in that chain of events with the leaked to the media and all of that I I think you could probably ... here's what's interesting\nYou the names were brought out as a result of the leak\nForward as far as we know she didn't leak it\nSo if that if that law or pursued we would likely find out who leaked it because what responsibility do they have\nIn a case brought by ... by march judge and or his lawyers whoever leaked it to the media would also be partially responsible or for getting his name out there and that you can see I think ... part of that and you have in any case there that was that was him\nYes you have in any case eliminate because it's clear that getting the of the gang rape that yes you're right that's clear yes right right\nRight the only possibility of parents lash out on the hitters you wouldn't want to put it is a good buddy or do they already the wind is yeah yeah you know got tempered problems I wouldn't want them to think that there goes as he's joined us in spite of use voted to do this for a spy and\nYeah well they you know it's it would be ... it it would definitely play out in terms of the spin on it it would play out\nUh in every up predictable and even some are unpredictable ways we can we can try and come they use our imagination to come up with things and and thank you a market for the call we appreciate it and and I think a fair point or question\nUh he definitely would have standing as you point out Gary and pointed out during this process\nUh you you know you're into the political arena when you accept the nomination a as a Catholic Kavanaugh did and and so you would have to go out of your way to prove that malice\nUh but in this case of 'em are judge or that wouldn't he wouldn't have that burden but you you do wonder about you know I guess the future of claims of this these particular claims\nUm and really the only one that ... that survived at all was Dr ... claim and and it it appears they do not want to pursue that any further\nSo that's why I Am and and I think you make a case that that his name was released because of the leak and so she wasn't trying to link it to the ... a a media but in the ... case yeah\nTo me that would even be a ... and again I don't know who leaked and so I I don't know I'm just on the doctor or using right that that is a possible exception here right uh but with the other case\nTo me that's clear I mean going going after Kavanaugh with an allegation like that that those things are made of politicians all the time and their public figures for the law used them differently yeah but if you're a private citizen you're dragged into it\nAnd you're being accused of a gang rape mhm spiking drinks you know things like things like that or you just you can't say you just can't go out and print that right ... and say that about people right especially private citizens mhm\nNow says then you've got to make your case and say worse to probable cause while I think it might have happened that's not good enough no no\nI haven't actually asked them directly I don't believe they did it but I have not asked them if they did directly\nLet's go to Gary in sparks Nevada Gary Ron Ron I Radio Welcome to the show\n[laughter] Hi how are you cutter you've got this um\nThe Republicans they came for complaining about all the things that the Democrats do but they never a press charges against anybody slide for for perjury or Hillary Clinton or Dianne Feinstein and so on it's like telling a bank robber I'm complaining about it\nWe were both well we're not going to hell whoa whoa where's the perjury Heidi approved the perjury\nHow do you prove that perjury prime well you know ... if you don't want to take that one guy and finds fang okay\nWell I Know how my ... well my point is legal point by point by what you alleged they should do so you're blowing out your first point you don't go after Ford so then who do you charge next than on if you're not going to charge for who's the next one\nOkay Dianne Feinstein with a ... she has a spy a at a chauffeur\nI Believe that there should be an investigation do I\nIn an investigation do I believe that yes of course\nRight I I I Believe there should be investigation they are not so I Would agree with you on that and I believe they have that in their problem is they're they're ... I Believe they are promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make that charge Hillary Clinton's emails there's\nWell that one ... that's ... that's followed that wasn't Republicans fault no\nI don't buy that was combing who clearly was politically driven and then that's something you couldn't control in that moment\nRight well do you expect the the Democrats just stop doing any of\nThese you know with I don't know why it didn't get them but what did this behavior get them ultimately in twenty sixteen mass of loss\nIt is but because of the reason Gary that they bring it up on Capitol Hill that somebody an elected office\nWould bring these up by these items up on Capitol Hill because\nWe've set about uh you know if you go back to uh the email thing with a with Hillary or even back to lying about been God's the which was an intern of itself a crime although it should be but it isn't a you look and see what exactly what we've said\nIs that on the email specifically on the email a investigation and the whole no reasonable prosecutor would would uh prosecuted\nWe said well it what matters here's the court of public opinion what you're dead and ultimately she lost in November of twenty sixteen and and thank you for the call\nIt is not always that that and not that she's above the law or we believe they should have pursued that but I if given a choice having her in jail or is not as great as not having her in the White House\nKnow here's here's the uh the the the point about four to ... maybe he was responding ... sparks Nevada responding to\nWhen we were talking to the last caller about a mark judge following a defamation of character lawsuit well when you when you go after a private citizen you have to at least have some type of evidence that this happened a he said she said\nAll of a of a private citizen can get you into trouble but still might not go to the level of perjury perjury as you would have to prove you would have to have another witness stating she's lying about it right\nUh you know or it was you know about you know I I don't I'm\nI'm trying to think of ones you know somebody has been hit with defamation of character right when it's something that is just so obvious can't be true mhm uh and and so my point was I I don't know the doctor Ford situation\nIs there in the realm of possibility she's committing perjury absolutely sure yeah uh any things in the wrong because we don't know we don't know anything about it because nobody can cooperate and so we don't know what she what she wants to it's proving it\nIs and and our point was is Eric just said that well there are costs to the Democrats lost twenty sixteen uh there there may be repercussions here in this upcoming election where they don't\nOr when the seats that they should be winning a in a first term of a president in the first midterm afterwards but almost always the party in power loses seats and that may not happen a Supreme Court justice was\nAh was confirmed mhm uh and United a pretty fractured Republican Party\nSo it isn't always that your punishment is criminal sometimes the punishment is\nThe punishment is criminal as for Dianne Feinstein though a and Clinton as we explain Clinton wasn't the Republicans and if you're angry that justice isn't always done\nAll I can say is this from our point of view the most important things to get the truth out there yes that's what I Want I Want transparency I Want the truth I Can't do anything if the majority because one of the reasons that Hillary Clinton\nWas never charged is because there is a majority there's probably half of America even if they knew she was guilty would wander charged right sorry but that's just the way that it is part of the power comes from public opinion\n\nAnd it doesn't matter whether she committed a crime or not they don't want her prosecuted\nMhm and\nSo the best we can do is get out the truth and we know the truth about Hillary\nA worry we know I'm\nA ... for example Susan Rice sure about we laugh when you said she said you know the ... that she would like to ... she would consider running against colon seems like an excuse me you're willing to lie to him on ... now it wasn't a criminal offense but it was still line\nAbout a terrorist attack that killed Americans and every one in the United states knows its ally for every one in the United states you could take them and you could show them the law that Hillary Clinton broke right there you could read the law\nAnd and everybody would an agreement that is what she did and there would still be half of America that said so what you should be able to get away with it and can't do anything about it the best that we can hope for\nIn any thing is that the truth is told I don't know what's going to happen in the FBI investigation right I don't know if it's going to show corruption it's now in the inspector general hands Michael Horowitz you and I talked about this it's the one story that's been buried completely over the last two weeks ...\nIs that when Trump said okay we're you know we we we've got a couple of allies that don't want us to relieve some of this information and uh those so we're going to give it to Michael I have an eddy we went that doesn't make ... we're going to give it to Michael Horowitz from my ...\n[laughter] don't give it to my colleagues Minnesota them and they don't have that [laughter]\nWhatever you do give it to Michael Horowitz the inspector general you and I said to each other this was on the air when we went to ... ... doesn't make any sense why would they give it to the inspector general of the department of justice if if they want to figure out how they can release it and and still you know keep some of it redacted they would go to\nA wait a minute inspector general only deals with corruption more improprieties right oh\nYes and and that that story has been buried and analysis of that story has been buried by the mainstream media why would the president not release it immediately and give it to the inspector general of the department of justice because he deals with corruption\nAnd\nSo we don't know what's going to happen there but get us the truth and if the American people if they get the truth and still decide to do the wrong thing that's on them yeah and\nThat's that that's really what it comes down to is that uh we've been calling for transparency on on all of it\nThe whole Russians scandal thing we've said multiple times regardless of where it falls politically as long as that is fully transparent and the process the American\nThe American people can decide because we can't change what people do it in the past nobody can not even the people that did it\nAnd my question would be that if the Democrats took the house do they really really really want\nAn investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is that what they really really want from three witnesses with no cooperation at all who stories were slowly and sometimes rapidly falling apart because this is this would play out in the public\nOver and over and over for a very very\nLong time
