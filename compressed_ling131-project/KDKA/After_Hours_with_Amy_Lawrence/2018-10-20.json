accuracy of any of the information aired on the following program\nAlone won't have you another edition of memories in hell I'm your host Chris McKay and I'm really glad you're with us today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affect each and every one of us and that stress\nAnd believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael Pincus and Dr bank is this going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those you that may not know Dr Parikh is he is a nationally recognized authority unnatural an alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional ... athletes and it continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks it's great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nUp you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure and so the way stress affects the body as this I'm going to persons under stress the body transpose as a stress into tension\nAnd your muscles ended up contract and everyone feels that in there in the upper back in ... right and the doctor I'm more\nConcerned about the muscles that you don't feel that she has the muscles in the arteries that guy up and the mother's heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your\nDigestive tract ... these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties yet I Want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients\nThat is completely handle the body in terms of stress okay according to the research that I've been involved with this as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nCounting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people do you know they just don't sleep well you wake up tired your body hurts more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon he gets sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and I feel for roses and fibromyalgia\nPretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition of people are suffering for pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture and it has to do is not how much calcium someone's taking in their diet or how many calcium supplements or\nHow many ... acids you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith Kelsey um being something to do with stress season calcium for building bones\nWell yes okay yeah and it does W T but he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart and your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually dies\nWow it's all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to us from the bones themselves [noise]\nNobody will ... will absorb it back from the bones if neither\nThat's right and I say and what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of a ball\nGame and that's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from dying tradition yep\nOkay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nTo sure just drink milk just drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right\nAnd second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really because things like pasture as Asian irradiated um the calcium as leach from the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy at the house which started driving a car but these things don't absorb and the body it's time for a couple of reasons one uh\nWhen you take a let's say on antacid that had the calcium in like a dumb [noise] first of all calcium does not absorb in the body unless it's an an acidic environment but to see what happens when you take a Tom\nIsn't antacid [laughter] oh okay so you're in if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is that being absorbed\nI see because it has to be in a in an answer an environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called ... formula\nBut comics formula it's natural\nAnd the differences is that\nThe powder and what happens is you put it in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it down so it's in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbs into your system\nWow so that solves the problem that\nWell yeah because when calcium and easy Myrna liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWell that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says the fans to absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder well\nIt comes down to absorption one of the way to tell if you're not observing calcium is take a look at what drugs they're taking\nAre you on high blood pressure medication do you need something for your kidneys are you on pain medications you need sleeping pills the calcium and especially the museums being absorbed ... you're not going to suffer from all these things\nMy comment formula does absorb incredibly in the body the thing is is that what do you take my comment formula but not like well well I feel better I have thousands of people writing to the doctor pain 'cause I Can't believe it thirty minutes after I took the ...\nThe pain in my wrist one way or I was able to sleep for the first time an ear\nAnd Dr fake I Can't believe it thirty minutes after I took the counter pain and my wrist went away or I was able to sleep for the first time in years

Hi I'm good what's on your mind\n[noise] while this this story to keep as bothering me and I know that you would give me that ... probably better inside and I have one thing to do you give a billionaires and in every area of Saudi Arabia for what I Believe that this on journalists was tortured and murdered\nI mean I've heard that in on CNN they were talking about um the ones that were closed and involved because they involved in that that they've been set a fat and that they're being punished somehow\nBut this is wrong and so many levels what the what is your opinion about that ... ... feet from doing anything about it\nWell that's why I'm asking you the audience to gain on me why do I mean I'm the only thing I can think is make it tougher for them to do business\nIn this part of the country 'cause I have to believe the way they handled scouting this country right now for our natural gas supply because they have to realize the big picture that eventually that will be a threat that's I mean that's my thought process\nYet the I I was thinking along those lines also because when it first happened and you know and it's been all that is on the he was saying well I still feel like we can go through with this this arms deal that they made with them\nI'm first and foremost this man is gone and he said he should still be here for whatever reason that they felt okay he's waiting for the Washington Post he said something negative about them he went there on\nTime is up of a jazz or journalists which is what she was very very good job they sent him there and his wife with outside the conflict for God's sake\nAnd steal was tortured and murdered now for Trump to say you know a president to say for me as far as where it's all about it was well I still think we should go through with this on sale I speak I think he can find out why this man is dead\nAt there's no sanctions that you can put on a on a a country that is not hurting for money so what do you do\nYou use an assembly military I think the answer\nUm do you do as you suggest it up and and now it's happening to our call our resources in this country so that people want to be living like a third world country here because we have that available but also shale oil and things of that we can do that that's a serious for our country\nWell let me just say this is something went wrong somewhere because I he ruffled some feathers the wrong way and God's someone I mean violently upset to where they ...\nBut I heard this is my question and and and I don't know the rest of you feel that no matter what the Saudi Arabian government says if it did happen in their consulate what does that tell you\nThat you're not telling you know that I mean right inside in his temple in you're constantly it I mean I I mean you\nYou don't have any kind of security there to where you don't know what's going on and I mean people have security around their home in the neighborhood that I live including me that you can't get onto the front porch without me knowing who you are\nYes right right exactly exactly right so well for me this man Lincoln and death and even um some ex military people came on and they were talking about it they had the end\nExactly right so well for me this man went to his death and even um some ex military people came on and they were talking about if they had the intelligence to know that this man should not have been going there but in this they stop if I'm going to get and get to him and make him realize that when he was walking into was trapped\nSo whatever he had written in the Washington Post or\nSomething to someone in the wrong way I have no idea\nWhat they're saying was tortured and be headed in that to me is is just it's a sad sad climate on our country now as I'm president you know Donald John Trump you do something about the fact that I'm not saying going in there militarily on saying we'll stop doing business with\nWell this is still one of the British newspapers in our country they do a great right lawyer posted it on our whole mover do hope it doesn't affect the way they're doing business I think if you talk to any tried and true journalist especially those who were covering up or to the world will tell you\nThat ... that's that's that's a skinny that's we're going to happen so you know it is what is it is what it is\nRight but this man there like I said no he felt that you only live for that I consider that an act of terrorism\nIs point like bottom line is the only way you can see it so that you know you at what you write in my day they've been attacking a different news outlets in the United states you know a one back well on this thing going on for a long long long time\nAnd we'll put a stop to it you were president of the free world you show us\nWhat you're about and I'm not saying go their military that will not be the answer I don't believe that the answer to to have people that that bill like this that's something that you say rather than the wrong way they let him walk to his death so whatever that they decide he decides to do about it\nBut not Philip cherry I don't believe that the answer to it sank is what what you would how would that help it wouldn't do anything for him to run on\nA mantra of what we want to do is get dropped and bring them here and be and be our own resource well we don't have to depend on these countries or anything and asking me what show me something\nWell the only way that's going to happen is if we let this president do what he's trying to do and\nTo okay create an economic stimulus to wear a lot of these companies are going to have a fighting chance as opposed to not having a fighting chance of bugs they never did shovels in the ground so\nI'm hoping that we can move more words but you know it it kind of intrigues me and before we had 'em Dan in Las Vegas after the bottom of the hour where I just have to ask you\nHave you ever seen the country so divided in your life ... you\nKnow I have not no I'm not in my all my years I have not and I'm like it's\nIt's as you said uh you know state where you know people either that middle class you can you can just get that because there are people that have two incomes and can't make ends meet as far as\nFood banks and things like that if that's the thing is one of the states that they really really do a good job of reaching out to people now to to to flip it\nUh when Ruckel bomb or you know when he was getting ready to leave office he went and pardon me lots of of people that were in prison mind you for selling marijuana now they have marijuana plants if does he ever what it would give me give you that second chance but don't though back in the person's face\nFor me you want to build schools you don't want to build bridges you don't want to where else do you want people free to make the choice to do the right thing and for me\nIf he shows me something that I'm not I'm not saying I'm going to vote for him because I really am not a lady's going on one level though foreign do show that people something that had faith in what he thinks he ran on a job\nNot saying I'm going to vote on that I really am not maybe going online ... on a new show that people something that had faith and what he thinks a ban on a job mantra is going to change that he's going to change when when did that change and ...\nThat that cat eats volumes and so people out of problems that they didn't witness Harry and Meghan ... Marco\nYes yeah second at first child and you know she's so much for him than I Am ... and the way the queen allow them to have the wedding of their train went off into it and yet when he when like a guy and he's so much like it's not that way and that but for me\nAnd the changing of the guard ... allow people to be on that law they got none of it so well I'm not going to let forever but what we have four children now is a statement on the United states of America and the country as a whole and you have a black last week and ...
