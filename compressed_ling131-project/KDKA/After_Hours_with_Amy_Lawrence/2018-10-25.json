in Minnesota John welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show Hi\nThanks for taking my call and say I'm I just like to take exception a kind of cheer premise of belief that President Trump's going to have a long term effect accomplish 'cause you know I mean\nIt can be over to X number one ... you know he's got three branches or the ... all three branches of government I'm a God or your first by presidents come and do\nA a okay I'll I'll tell you what's sad because we're short on time John I'll tell you what would be reversed go ahead or to get construction is on the Supreme Court\nGood point yeah excellent point\nYeah and I I that's why I don't remember us in any segment today saying what you claim we stayed at\nWell I Believe that did about maybe forty five minutes ago that you know this kind of revolution and you know they got all the all the answers\nAnd I'll make the U.S from you know John John John John Saddam we said that the president and the Republicans were making progress and they are and so what we want them to do is be able to focus on that message and keep the message going it's that simple\nYeah Segarra made about long lasting or anything else like we didn't say anything but of course I could I could defeat you on that because I pointed out uh with you know Kevin and Gorsuch you have to construct yeah you're\nRight on the Saturday or a knowledge of\nThat right and and when we when we ... we were the ... we were the first to say that in the executive branch should we look at Obama most of what Obama done has been dismantled because if you don't use the legislature if you used executive orders ... uh in order to run your executive branch instead of trying to get legislation passed through by legislative branch yeah\nIt's not going to be long term but the tax cuts could be long term well in in ...\nThe thing to what did you have with the tax cuts\nIn in the uh the while not retaliatory but the\nThe response from the Democrats was what not that we're gonna take it back to you know thirty five percent we're gonna we're gonna take it to one eighty five percent\nRemember right almost right away what we need to raise that we need to raise it to twenty five percent what ... what was the Republicans that weren't even saying twenty five percent\nDuring the whole discussion on it and we didn't\nTwenty five percent what I I I was the Republicans that weren't even saying twenty five percent during the whole discussion on it and we didn't think they would get anywhere close to Twenty one percent so it's you know this this whole thing\nOf of being long lasting a good economy is not going to be defeated because the American people want to keep it going I'm\nRight and that's what National Review has referenced right and they're headline pipe bomb and powder delivered to CNN were harmless and other websites for picking that up we don't know outside that Associated Press story that doesn't say that right if you read the said yeah that's that's the point\nIs that right the the the story that their referencing doesn't actually say that they could turn out to be the case and maybe National Review has sources of their own but they're not sourcing they're not eating those ... from the a P right\nYou know so it it's just because\nProblem is is with with if you're going to you know that if that are in the echo chamber of social media especially if that false information\nBecause the problem is is with with if you're going to you know that if that are in the echo chamber of social media especially if that false information misleading information is going to be out there\nThan it is you know it it starts to become\nOr build a narrative in the wrong direction if you start on the wrong premise everything that follows a may sound logical but it still is built on that false premise so you know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review yeah there don't sweat it was an oversight fear in my opinion\nBecause that's not what the Associated Press\nStory all I can understand it because when I read it the first time mhm that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading here and says the ... and then I read it again I went oh\nThat's not what the ... Washington Post on there headline had it right there headline habit that the powder that was sent along with ... you know a along with the suspicious package was harmless and and so\nThe the point being is that\nThat the narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not pass that and you don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now\nPeople are going by their trust of National Review you know based on the headline\nWhich which National Review to me is extremely credible ... at the time I I don't know maybe it's too late by mistake whatever or\nLike I said when I\nFirst read it mhm that's what I told you as an earth are saying the bomb was harmless but this was in our ... not on the air\nAnd then realized oh no that's not what they're saying if you read the sentence again they're separating the sentence and Associated Press to separate the two yes\nAnd then says pipe bomb not again we don't know there is that's the one thing that we've talked about which again which is when we went through all the different questions that you would ask and the questions that and and that's why it's very important to find out you know whether they were you know ... whether they were active\nBombs that could have gone off and could have gone off and would have gone on\nA ... you know and and\nWhether they would have gone off because of the time or or whatever or were they set to go off and what they've gone off or where they just explosive materials that would not have gone off or would we find out that they actually were not explosive materials and actually weren't bombs that they were fake bombs because at that point\nYou would look at it than the questions that you would ask as an investigator would be different\nIf they were all fake bombs than they were meant to just scare\nMhm or\nThey were meant to be used as a political statement mhm well who would benefit if they were all fake bombs and they were sent for a political statement would be the next question that you would ask the right\nAnd so again we don't know and that's why we are\nWhen we talked about you know CNN and others blaming Trump for all of this incredible divisiveness which caused this and as we said don't even realize the irony\nThat they're saying the divisiveness must stop but yet they create the maximum\nDivisive this by blaming somebody for an incident where they don't have\nThe fact they don't know\nWe have no idea that the motivation behind the the the uh the\nPerson or persons nobody has any idea and they create this same divisiveness claiming that they're against the advice of this and it's exactly what they're\nThe the little person or persons nobody has any idea and they create this same divisiveness claiming that they're against divisiveness and it's exactly what they're doing how many times a week on\nThe left doing that it's like [laughter] we're accusing us something which is exactly what we're doing\nYeah right well and especially without knowing all the facts here\n\nYou know they're trying to put a puzzle together with without all the pieces that we've got to ... in fact until they find we may never know the motivation if they don't find the person responsible and even if they do sometimes you don't know the motivation you it takes a great deal of a detective work\nAnd I know sources of said they believe it's the same you know right people are ... percent or group of people based on the material which again that that the number of the number of of\nAh devices that you sent out is more evidence that the FBI can can use I wouldn't be surprised at the FBI or wouldn't be at all surprised if they solve isn't solved it pretty quickly mhm yeah\nIf you look at the nature of or how this was sent a the the packaging the if you look at the um\nThe the one packaging for the the device that was sent to CNN or it you know the multiple stamps it went through us ts bomb each of these by the way\nDepending on who they are even Soros has his own private security go through you know he doesn't open his own male are usually people at that level don't open you know anything themselves all of that sort and there's a great deal of security um but\nBut of course with uh the the Clintons that's the case the secret service for actually has their own sorting that they do so the male doesn't doesn't it's not delivered\nYou know to the doorstep or or in the mailbox like it would be\nFor you and I of course that's that's that's something that's going and has been for a long time and place but but the point being is that they have a a great deal of resources that the secret service has a great deal of resources into and and finding out\nYou know and and putting together the puzzle there's a there's a pretty good chance right now based on just having cameras everywhere these days\nThat they know it may be where the facility or facilities were at these were sent from\nWhat I find interesting is the fact that the FBI knows right now what did these relied bombs or not they know right having said\nThat we haven't heard anything that said that they were armed and ready to go on and could have been triggered\nBy a ... a phone or whatever I that would be the next question why not write well because in in\nIn and I know is is there a reason that you'd I'm I'm I'm not throwing out a conspiracy ... I'm saying there is there an investigating reason why you wouldn't do it well\nAnd if they were armed or or or if they were\nThat at that point those were those devices were ready to go off\nI'm I'm Wondering about the level of security especially in the middle of New York city ah right there in the building the CNN building a the those employees were allowed to go back it was it was after three o'clock some time that but they were allowed to go back in the building\nI'm ... and so does that tell us anything about the threat the level of threat based on what they know about these devices\nWill find out in the coming days you know because if they were armed and they were ready to go\nBased on what they know about these devices\nWill find out in the coming days you know because if they were armed and they were ready to go off then and you suspect that there might be more would you allow people to go back in that building you know it's one thing with the Clintons they ... they always have\nAs ex presidents do a secret service detail and they're always going to have that a great level security\nAh but if it's if you're talking about you know the media\nYou have to assume right that the if the threat is real and if that were at that device word dangerous or we're ready to go off\nThat there you would expect that there might be more or possibly in the system somewhere um but I don't know we really don't know it just that's the question that we have we're not going to speculate to the point of of conclusion because we actually there's really not much to go on here we just know that you've got\nA\n... ... ... you've got these devices\nYou've got a we know who the targets were who they were sent to and\nAnd that's about it we ... we we've seen the pictures on on ah online and in the media as to what the packaging was at least with the CNN device but again where the the the FBI and the and uh\nEveryone that's involved in the uh of course the investigation here they're putting the puzzle together you can't do that this is why I caution and I think it was\n[laughter] we can't you can't watch Fox News I don't care who they are they have the the the so called experts well here's what we're looking at\nEven the experts sitting in a studio can't tell you what they're really looking at it looks suspicious which we already know that's all we know about this entire situation\nSuspicious packages we don't know anything else that's it and when the FBI tells us or authorities tell us more than we can start having that broader discussion eight

public speaking I was I never have told people to go out and vote\n... ...\nBecause I'm number one I never felt that was my real number two I never felt the people that were lost\nSo I never have told

gets Trump's and the Republicans a chance to double down on immigration and issue the Democrats themselves remained vulnerable on\nWhy are the Democrats vulnerable on immigration because they have not just about the attack that they are for open\nBorders bang go we've been saying for years\nAnd this is what we said ... pretty much throughout the show yesterday and and earlier this week as well\nThey have to be positioned very clearly the question has to be asked where do you stand on the border they must be forced to say it because it's very clear to most people but but they're going to have to answer the question\nWhat level of border enforcement do support\nWhat don't use the word comprehensive\nExactly what do you support we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support we know what you don't want what do you want\nHe said again I have argued outs where the party should have been braced an immigration compromise where the wall would be built\nIn exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong uh uh you know a Democrat any from a democratic pollster just you understand but that's really a lot of what we have said that we have ... as we said yesterday and I believe the day before on\nOn the whole caravan thing this is a perfect opportunity for the Republicans and the president to back them into a corner and go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats\nAnd go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have this comprehensive immigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means right what does that mean specifically what do you want\nAnd he talks about it here are I Would you be for the would you be for a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants that are here and then a wall is to be built and anybody who comes here in the future must go back and\n\nAre you for that but you can't we have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has been for the last Thirteen Years yeah\nBecause when you when I came on the show together the issue we had to go back and looked at this yesterday in the history of our show the first thing that we really discuss was a was a like a Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy mhm\nWhich was the amnesty that was in two thousand five just if they they made the decisions to a couple of weeks after you and I started working together right\nAnd so for Thirteen Years the Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration what would they do\nWhat with their plan be thinking about this and that by the way that say Republican failure mhm because of Republican should be demanding every ... every time they talk about illegal immigration it shouldn't be the Democrats\n... ... it should be as we've said you make the accusation Democrats won open borders and when they cry you are a line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you would want done issued them the challenge\nAnd that's what ... was shown as saying here that again they haven't had to answer\nThey haven't had to they don't and they some of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that and there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you don't get rid of ice you don't get rid of border enforcement in this country\nThat's ridiculous that the American public and even Democrats a significant portion of Democrats won border security they may have compassion for people that are here\n\nAnd want to have compassion when it comes to even legal immigration but as we brought it to your attention\nThe demographics that want the least legal immigration into this country are blacks and Hispanics ... when you look at the polling as to the number of when you go the demographics and you see the the numbers\nOf of\nMinorities in this country who want the lowest level of legal immigration but even Trump has never talked about mhm it's minorities the vast majority of them the huge vast majority of them who vote Democrat mhm\nNo the American people stand with the president on border enforcement they do he's winning that politically but the other side of it is is that\nThe Democrats have not been forced to choose say what they want at all you know with the president wants you know what the Republicans won\nAnd and I think that in the entire first off you have to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say and you have to you have to force them and backed them into a corner and and as I said uh get in their face yesterday\nHave to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say\nAnd you have to you have to force them and backed them into a corner and and as I said uh get in their face yesterday rhetorically is what I said I don't mean physically but rhetorically and make them answer back them against the wall so they have no choice\nTo either you made your point that they're for open borders or they have to respond and give you the specifics that they do not\nThe second thing is sort of what Trump is doing already when he's talking about the care of and saying we'll pull well we're going to pull aid from you ... but look if you improve your country and you become more capitalistic will be the first ones here to help you write\n\nSo we can't take in the entire world but this is where you need to start focusing on those governments in those countries and saying we're here to help you help your own people ...\nYep but you need to embrace free markets you need to you need to do something\nYes\nBy the way also we when we talk about the imagery you know the the one picture that came out with the hunter and flag\n... and all that and so people start question well why do you want to come here right do you want to come here to become citizens or is it just to work and then\nYou know go back and then we have to have that discussion as to well what do we want from people who come over here as citizens but first before you even get to any of those other things that I'm Talking about\nYou have to find out what the other major party actually once when it comes to illegal immigration and border enforcement we're not even to that point no how can you have a discussion when only one side\nHas said it has put forth plans of what they want and the other side won't go after they're part of the party that endorses open borders\nAnd just keep quiet on it well silence is your consent yes silence is your consent saying get rid of ice is your consent we're not going to get rid of border enforcement in the United states\nSo why are you preaching that\nNow That's Douglas shown whose looks like to me as the longtime Democrat who are about to use Claire McCaskill's verbiage or isn't a crazy Democrat or\nA says of course the rank and file Democrats the average person votes Democrat and they want border control sure in fact the constituency the votes most Democrat most the time\nActually to get out of illegal immigration and illegal immigration is a demographic that once the least legal immigration into this country look\nYou have a sanctuary city policies sanctuary state policy sanctuary county policy by Democrats have been promoting it for a long long time\nAnd now you have the you know abolish ice protest they they're saying it but they're not forced to say the words open borders they should say they should be forced to say it because that's what they're promoting\nAnd if they're not where's the pushback if they're promoting border enforcement at any level tell me who\nAnd I mean the ... from the party that is actually saying that in promoting it is Chuck Schumer promoting that\nNancy Pelosi or they promoting that\nBe a Joe Manchin we haven't heard him but we have you know there might be one or two maybe clear [laughter] you know she's not one of those crazy Democrats but where's the party saying this is what we want because that's the official\nOne of those crazy Democrats but where's the party saying this is what we want\nBecause that's the official political battle how can we have ... how can we have a debate\nOn illegal immigration and border enforcement when the other side won officially tell us what they would ... what they want right except for those that are in the party that promote open borders and the elimination advice they won't even have the debate why right\n\nDriver with a million miles or more driving with out are preventable accident register online at red eye radio show dot com that's right

democratic political figures over the previous three days that contain quote potentially destructive devices and to quote\nThe bureau initially said it had recovered five packages that were similar and the parents and for the return address an office for representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida the packages were dressed to George Soros Hillary Clinton\nA former president Brock Obama former CIA director John Brennan a care of CNN and former attorney general Eric Holder the FBI said it was possible\nThat additional packages were mailed to other locations\nUh this investigation is of the highest priority for the FBI Director Christopher Wray set in a statement we have committed the full strength of the FBI's resources in together with our partners on the joint terrorism task forces\nWe will continue to work to identify an arrest whoever's responsible for sending these packages we ask anyone who may have information to contact the FBI do not hesitate to call no piece of information is too small to help us with this investigation law enforcement officials involved\nIn the investigation told Fox News of the similarity between the packages has led them to believe that a single individual or group could be responsible\nIn addition to the five packages identified by the FBI US Capitol police were investigating a suspicious package address to representative Maxine Waters of California\nAt the Capitol Hill screening facility and Marilyn water set in a statement that the Capitol police have told her that her Washington DC office was the target a suspicious package that has been referred to the FBI late Wednesday the Los Angeles central male facility was evacuated after employees\nFound a suspicious package which the Associated Press reported\nWas

its bomb squad had rendered the package at the male facility safe and investigation will be turned over to the FBI so that's the latest said we\nThe first I said wow Eric look they're saying that the bomb and I read the first sentence\nAnd then I re read it again and went on and it's not what they're saying right now that wasn't on the air to see a right and it was like no they're not saying that what they're saying is it's the powder that came with the the the bomb they're not saying I both were harmless right\nThey're saying the powder was harmless you know that that's what the source said the powder was harmless they didn't even mention about\nThe suspected potentially explosive package they didn't say either way\nRight on that one so uh again that's you know that's what we deal with

[noise]\nMm [noise]\nInternet radio have money and I'm hearing my six six Ninety or read I didn't want to play the said where McCaskill ah add a\nFrom a from Missouri a Claire McCaskill the Democratic incumbent who's running against her opponent misery attorney general Josh Hawley yeah out two weeks out we see the latest poll misery scout has Holly up by one mhm and that was ten Seventeen and ten Eighteen\nRight guy or buy a buy one um we see\nOut of the last one to three\nRight guy a by by by one um we see\nThe last one two three four five other the last five polls one has been a tie he's been up and three and she's been up in one a three of those were taken in September of the two chicken in\nA ... October was Fox News we're ... was a tie a than the Missouri scout that has holy up by one in that and build a dead heat yeah it is it is is a dead heat and\nSo the fascinating thing about uh this radio ad\nIs what is said in it where there's you'll hear two men talking\nAnd they're talking about you know a Josh Hawley and the problems with him that uh the claim is he gets wind and works out during work hours which we've found really interesting per cent of raised to be the main accusation in an ad that clearly is a\nThat I don't agree with the vast majority on the issues with\nThat I don't agree with the vast majority on the issues with ah yeah and and by the way I Need to say something in the spirit of full disclosure here I Would buy wine at the gym if they sold it okay and if I went to a gym\nOr but [laughter] it's it is\nOne of those it's it's it's a horrible attempt I hate the contrived to all geez you Bob what are you thinking in terms zero vote it's you can use real real people but that's not what they did here they're trying to portray real people with the sentiment of people\nUm and\nThey probably couldn't find it to be ...\nI I Will send in us all I mean with if you look at the the issue that they were concerned about most in that ad uh-huh uh it was terrorists yes and we've talked about the mid west it was something that we talked about yesterday ... that the the the the the farmer\nThat is some of the backbone of the Trump support Democrats are going directly at because of their loss of business because of the the the terrorists mostly due to the Chinese so\nIt is something we we ... we were you brought that up in the last couple of days when we talk about okay what might affect the Democrats to help them win or what might affect the Republicans to help them win what is the strategy that they're using but in that ad\nIt was terrorists twice here's the interest interesting question outside of farmers that that was targeted to in Missouri\nIf you went up to the average person on the street and said what do you think about terrorists do you think they'd have any idea what they were in a nation worst Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the three branches of government are\nYeah um you know it's it it really is about the presence I guess in the state of the industry other particular we had a streak right and and and that is the case in in huge farm states it even if you're not a farmer\nOr ... yeah right now you know like you know to you know the effect on the farmers and they weren't very vocal about it if you're in that state even if you're not a former\nAh you know again depending on the impacts that they they felt it was worth\nUh making that point ah\nWhich you know I Will see if if that point works or if any of this works er here within two weeks\n[noise] it's\nA I I think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it it that positioning was I'm not going the way of of others in my party\nBecause keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her you heard her say she approves this message this is her campaign that she's not saying the people that are protesters she's referring\nTo her ... her party and we have to point out that we pointed out you know over the last several weeks these are the mainstream high ranking members\nOf the party that she's referring to here\nIn terms of the word crazy that's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to do the positioning hear that word is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree you know ... or you know with my my party in it notes\nWith the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree\nYou know ... or you know with my my party in it no so I approach or are you writing again it wasn't it ... the men having the conversation didn't say look she doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extreme is you know in there that she doesn't she's it was the term\nAs you brought up and so rightly\nIt was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and then she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put into that ad right where the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly\nAnd not her that's a desperate tactic because they're looking at the ... and remember this would be in the undecided voters more independent undecided voters\nWho they are looking to sway one way and it's it's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw air just what it is yes I got to let these people know I'm not part of the crazy Democrats right yeah because I Do what they're thinking that's one of the things that's coming back in their polling is the independents that\nThey're they're they're they're looking at holiday because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats might not part of the crazy Democrats but it's using that\nCrazy Democrats specifically and not a you know not radical ... extreme cause extreme if something is a term that Democrats have used a lot\nAnd it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream if you will term word right ah but this is this is also something we pointed out weeks ago during the Kavanaugh thing is that it doesn't matter that\nYou're not a Cory Booker it doesn't matter that you're not a\n... a lizard with Warren or just you know a pick a number of them that are in the Senate\n\nOr that are Democrats that could be you know I guess people are describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have a couple of times it's because their actions\nAnd and we said this a few weeks ago their actions go outside of their state in terms of the race right they will uh taint the races and other states but especially of course\nThose that are neck and neck and and I don't know I mean there's there maybe one or two but this this race is probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest\nAccording to the polls right now the latest polls we so that's the effect is that combat one Harris or or or Elizabeth Warren or any of them they whatever they do is going to affect those races those other races and\nThose people in the ... the state of Missouri maybe looking at this going what or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with at some point a Kamala Harris or you know as side with\nAs you're crazy Democrats she ... as she just did as having outside [laughter]\nAnd which is the perfect example and that's the thing\nThat endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here that is likely that action yes one action we talked about it before the vote up and where does she go on this well she made a choice to go\nBecause she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that did support the no vote bought it\nWell she made a choice to go because she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that did support the no vote but it's not those Democrats and and it's you know it's it's that scale the tips\nYou know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side of goes to the other if she loses Democrats\nThen that doesn't matter of the people in the middle are going to be with her and if she can't get them right now she acted as one of the crazy Democrats with that no vote she condones that behavioral letting we saw during the ... Kevin ... and and that's why\nI'm Wondering what the effect would be again on an undecided independent and we've been getting ourselves into trouble because people when we've been talking about\nYou know how you're trying to win an election people think we're talking about how we think and how they should think and we're not ... we're talking about probably people who don't listen to our show mhm we're talking about the election strategy we're talking about the undecided independents right you're undecided independent\nWho is looked at the cabinet thing and said they're crazy I mean they're they're really crazy and I can't vote for care\nYou know a Claire McCaskill and that's and then that's what the feedback coming back mhm that\nAd may be received by these people to say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats but you're willing to call your entire party crazy that you're that you belong with because you just want my vote right but you actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them\nThis just shows you the lame that we will go you will call your own party crazy in order to get the vote and then you'll be trained me when you get into office\nAnd you'll vote with the crazy Democrat and with that vote on Kavanaugh that was also condoning their behavior him not you know all of that that's you know that's the evidence to back up their opinion yup coming to that conclusion yes\nHave it all just proved that eight six six Ninety right I\nWas very much and they're recording the radio [noise]\nEvery Tuesday and Thursday morning at one am central it's the freight minor runs smart our on red eye radio tuned in to help you run more efficiently brought you buy a freight line or trucks covert\nElectronics is proud to support the fight against breast cancer by partnering with bright pink travel centers of America and Petro stopping center to bring you the twenty nine LCD right thing to the radio this limited edition right then CB\nRadio is helping to save lives from breast and ovarian cancer by empowering women to liberal activists for every radio zone nobody's making the donation device thinking the fight against cancer the right to the radio is available for a limited time ... travel centers of America and Petro stopping centers\nOwner operators we know everyone has flatbed phrase these days to make the best for your business in Mercer transportation help you take advantage of that phrase with no company trucks Mercer is committed to our owner operators says we have fast pace over forty years experience and offer a dedicated coordinator unhealthy manager at all so you can focus on running your\nIf you or someone you know it's a truck driver with a million miles or more driving with out are preventable accident register online at red eye radio show dot com that's run I radio show dot com\nThe red eye radio million mile club would not be possible without the support of our great sponsors including Petro stopping centers\nHow's lubricate or the ... family of companies motel six the sink Christopher fund cats scale\nAnd ... products we applaud the individual truckers athletes who drive with care and keep our highways say\nSo truckers quick question for you how do you stay entertained or the end of a long drive\nMe I like to own the wind at the end of the day but live HDTV in my cab ... satellite antennas it's easier than ever check it out and just remind drug duck and they get older TV you love to watch you know when the door for another job which coast to coast service is\nPerfect for fleets to for more info visit desperate my drug duck on restrictions apply [noise]\nThough ha ha ha I'm sort of stuff as her views from Katie JFK radio\nThirty one degrees at five AM good morning I'm Joe distilled or searches on for the male driver of a dark blue Nissan Versa who beat and pistol whipped a woman them is also I before dumping are often ... square last night Katie Katie these ... as the latest\nThe woman had very serious injury or faith and she walked into the giant eagle in the south side of asking for help really do believe that the victim knew the sad fact been released the ... name all day releases a description of the vehicle and the\nPlate number which is K.
