All right okay All right bill that are dying what the result\nOf hatred and partisanship coming from both sides and I will tell you that the left has just as guilty\nOkay here's the saints here's a point that I Want to get too because you this is very important because one of the things that that really\nGets to conservatives because conservatives have compassion and I believe and I believe that and I believe that that the the yanks when we're we've got some interference or I I Believe the Trump is compassionate\nI Believe Trump's rhetoric at times goes over the top ... example [laughter] you know the example I'm going to give [laughter]\nKeeping the conspiracy going the cruise Ted Cruz's father was part of the Kennedy assassination so to me that was the high level anything since then has actually taken down a little bit because that's one heck of an allegation so we understand that when it comes to hyperbole he can go over the top\nBut don't you care about the substance\nIsn't only the hyperbole then is that what you're claiming Democrats are Democrats only care\nAbout how you say it's not what you say\nAnd you also have to understand when it comes to the theory that exist in America by a lot of people including Trump when you see the Democrats wish to protect illegal immigrant criminals\nThis is not ultra part is than to get people angry it is the reality of what exists today\nDating reality is not hate talk\nBut when you have the Democrats who prefer their preference is the safety and security of illegal immigrant criminals over American citizens\nYeah you're going to get people angry including the president mhm yep what's gonna happen\nUm look and by the way the whole thing with the remember the president said the rapist thing and you know it's you know you and I for example we've said you could take quotes that we have said and and you know in the context of not knowing other things you could take it out of context as soon as that was said he goes no I mean the the bad people not the good ones and he said we know there are good people tried to come across\nThe border we can't do it\nSo we clarified that a long long time ago in fact be clarified that right after it happened yes but again it was a what they did was they took it and they ran with it at all or rapists ...\nNo you said all\nHe said rapists well and he didn't say they were all rapist won't him across it and and middle and change the making the point the very simple point that we have to that every single person that comes in this country that was the point he was making\nYes because does the most hardened criminals are the ones you don't want to hear\nVery simple or something I'd like to go point by point with our last caller to find out just how liberal you are\nYou have to understand where liberalism ... uh you know ... again\nTo find out just how liberal you are because you have to understand word liberalism ... or ... you know again and you can tell at least he conceded he was conceding some points or by the way I did see over the weekend we need a third political party everything here proves that that would stand for what\n\nYeah what are you going to both of us are going to vote for about a third political party stand for well where's the center\nWhere's the center yeah who's really a moderate right now\nI don't know what a moderate is right now you know we've been you know over the past few years especially over the past twenty four months we've been trying to define what a conservative is a think we all know what the liberalism there are varying degrees of liberalism but it starts\nPretty much on the foreign left and then goes to the extreme far left well tell me what a moderate is forget about conservative or liberal tell me what a moderate is\nOne of the stand for what are they promote and how they vote\nAnd I've talked about how a a talk to a a relative by marriage who was a college professor and he was a liberal I mean I really never got into the conversation and did this year at our family reunion and even though he's a liberal he rejects what's coming from the Democrats completely and he said about Trump said\nJust look my dad loved Trump Trump look his rhetoric has over the top but not a racist he's done ... come up\nIs a New York city deals with everybody and this guy's a liberal professor who says I Can't stand being on the liberal campus was he said because we're not liberal anymore now she would be in his fifties mhm so he might still be some of the old school\nLiberal so to exist out there versus

Valdes the Democrat yeah frack\nA former former sheriff of ... and that's not even close you you don't hear anything about that so here's a question that I Would ask this is a very interesting question you have\nProbably a couple of hundred thousand people maybe even more that are voting for Greg Abbott but will not vote for Ted Cruz ... there are people out there that are voting for Greg Abbott who will vote for federal ... why would be my question mhm\nRight because there's such a disparity if if there is\nAnd and right now or or what the real clear politics or he's roughly up a a Ted Cruz roughly seven points they they moved it I think in our cp though as to now lean\nIt's not a close to ... Republican ... uh but Greg Abbott absolutely dominating in the polls I mean there was one you can go back a couple of months you can't find one that's not double digits\nSo you've got a ton of people because if he only get six or seven wins by six seven eight points Ted Cruz and have it once by twenty huge number of people we voted for Greg Abbott voted for better or voted for Greg Abbott and would not vote for Cruz why would be my question well\nKnow we'd have to point out and I don't know if this is a part of it or if this would be in in the you know part of the answer that uh that you would get if you were to learn that\nUh but we we talk about it was two years ago Ted Cruz being the Damon oh I agree with you know and and you know I mean back when banner was was speaker of the house and and you know a ... there were people in the Republican Party\nYou know I mean back when banner was was speaker of the house and and you know a ... there were people in the Republican Party we know that in the Senate and in the house that hated cruise but I mean if you had any question you look at what happened at the our and see if the convention in the summer of twenty sixteen\nYeah but without the age but now he's beautiful dead yes right well because now he's useful but if you decided to challenge the president and twenty twenty but isn't that politics though yeah of course it's strange bedfellows ... to me yeah that's and and it's nothing new but\nIt it is the same\nThing is is that okay well but in that setting it was about his lack of endorsement and now it's I think you could probably point to a number of people that say that still stuck with me even though the president is with him in Houston I'm not\nI mean I I think he would probably again which some I Can't even measure that but I Know there are people that support the president right now support governor Abbott\nAnd are not going to support Ted Cruz for one reason or the other and it's it's likely because I'm I'm guessing a handful of them at least are saying it's because he did not get on board and\nTwenty sixteen I Would love to see those votes how many votes for Abbott but don't vote for Cruz at or battle just don't vote for Senate mhm yeah\nNo there or you know if you if you look at that there there could be a number of them that aren't voting and the Senate or how many of them\nYou know are looking at the governor's race and and you know going well yeah that's it that's all great wonderful but Lupe Valdez is not our candidate there were a number of things that came up and her history as a share of that the left is considered the ... in fact been more vocal about\nUh of course in the in the past few months that they're concerned with her actions as an and policy of the basically the Dallas County sheriff department\nUnder her leadership so you look at that and the end and those that probably has some to do with it again you know you could put some of those answers in that category but we'll see what it where it comes together I guess on election day in and how many people actually did vote for Abbott\n... wouldn't vote for Ted Cruz that's an interesting question and point\nEight six six Ninety red eye\nIn addition to being required by law pre and post trip inspections are vital to the safety of professional drivers conducting thorough pre trip inspections allows you to catch any problems before heading out on the road post trip inspections give the shop time to react to any problems that were identified\nDuring your next pre or post trope inspection check to make sure your fifth wheel securely attached and free of any excessive where\nThe train or can and must be watched properly and the jaws of the fifth wheel also check to make sure your safety chains are attached properly\nTh trucks service understands the importance of these inspections if you find any issues during your own pre or post trip inspection stopped by a location near you have your vehicle looked at by one of our experts technicians\nThis maintenance tip is the surface of the aid truck service road squad if you break down we show up Paul eight hundred nine two four shot\n[noise] what are you ready to go with a record ...

Bush and John McCain while they weren't Hitler Hitler but but definitely this guy is really Hitler but that's the that's the um oh the left they really want to come out and and make you believe that this guy or whoever it is the most recent was there at the current threat\nIs the one that is is is the biggest threat to you right now the only way they can get away with that or they think they can get away with that is by creating a monster and the person\nYou know a James I saw the a young black Leadership Conference that the President Trump spoke to the other day and I saw one of the young people that was interviewed that said\nI'm finally off the plantation and when he said that I went wow that's going to drive liberals just crazy but to me and I'm not black\nBut to me when he said that\nWhat it was was I I'm I'm Out of the I'm Out of the mindset of groupthink that it ... it I'm involved in group think find being told that I must think this way because of the color of my skin and then my mind is still in the plantation\nAnd that's what I tried some other for your ear you're pointing the finger at a a Republican plantation what I'm saying what what ... what are you a are on right now that one I allowed you to think as you really think because\nWhen when you're talking about folks about the homosexual if a and the marriage thing or whatever that you're talking to the mission by issue as they lined up with\nMore of a conservative mindset but because of their best so brave brainwashed shift ... of racism racism racism racism you know at clouds their their their their judgment\nYou know I I Wonder because you know we've talked about the identity politics with a with the ... with the Democrats and and the identity politics that have really I think come to the forefront because they're so radical is you know number one the transgender moment where if you're\nA a man you can be a woman and the the country in law's must ah recognize you that way and then what we've got into now is transracial that if you're black you can be white and if you're white you can be black\nLegally and when I start thinking about that and wonder how many because we said that we said with the transgender it seemed that there was more acceptance and when they jump to the trans racial\nI said I think you're going to get a lot of blowback from a lot of black leaders out there stating wait a minute so you can be whatever race you want whenever you want to be it and I thought that was really interesting I Wonder if people thought that that was just a ... a lot of minorities might have seen that and said okay\nMaybe this is time for me to get on a different mindset as to where the Democrats are going\nTo the extent that challenges so what does this fight for a way you put it all in vain yeah right\nNo that's I I think that's the question that that many of us have been asking for a long time I mean when you think of the mindset from the the the the left right now that\nThat that many of us have been asking for a long time I mean when you think of the mindset from the the the the left right now that you can be whatever you wish to be now that includes gender or race\nSo there because there's transgender ism there's also trans racial Islam and they want you to believe well if that's how you identify will hold on a second\nBecause if you look at a you know the the the civil rights at the protected groups created under the civil rights that if there if you can belong if anyone can belong to any protected group\nThen there are just by saying so then there are no protected groups\nSit in the civil rights era and has done is is over I I mean the the the civil rights act but everything that the civil rights era that happened there all that entire battle is we're not\nAnd not only that ... into the uh\nThe civil war was for a new fight against other oppressive a governmental systems you know why did we fight you know let's just say oh it's not that we should have done that uh we're we're on a different path now so I'm like no\nWe are America this with America we're not saying that we're as individuals better than anybody or any other country where say our ideas are better than everybody else yes or into the country\nYes and ... and and and the goal would be to everybody to adapt the actual ideas in in in the constitution where they they don't always do so and the other thing is too I mean there's also this thing that the left throws at\nThe conservatives enough to write that you don't you want to acknowledge racism come on and we all know what are how horrendous racism in slavery and Jim Crow was\nAnd I don't know any conservative ... which is to go back to that\nAnd my belief is the Democrats and I think about my grandfather my grandfather was the ... the Democratic chairman of the town\nThat we grew up in and he was because he emigrated from Canada and he came to town and they were all Republican and he just said well you got to have two parties you can't have a system with but he was he was much much more conservative but he left the Democrats that ball I I Believe\nMy father never had the official conversation with somebody and he died before I got to ask him but I said ... be a Democrat today and he said no abortion abortion changed him a lot of the liberal politics or changed him but\nWhen you think of what they what the Republican but the Democrats used to claim in the seventies and eighties they cared about and then the identity politics where everything is about race everything is about gender and the whole cabinet thing where you saw that you must believe a woman\nWell that's ridiculous if you must believe the woman that used to be a must leave the white man over the black\nYou know over over the black person in a criminal justice in the black person you don't believe in a white person you believe you know you go by evidence and what I find in credit is what I find incredible as the bigotry and intolerance and the actual racism and sexism seems not to be coming\nFrom the Democrats\nWhen I talk to black man about\nOr that situation I'm late fully understand that uh because I remember there was a little while later it was several years ago she ran away and uh she blamed it on to black males as so every black\nBut ... several years ago she ran away and or should lay in bed or two black males as so every black widows that within the city you know capable under scrutiny and they came out that she just wanted to run away or you know so\nSo I'm like well you have to understand that that if you go to that system will be fully aware of that what you're trying to fight against for which\nJames uh thank you so much ... some reshaped writes thoughts ... than the ... yeah I mean you're not the first person who was called the show and said look I'm black try being me conservative and live my life well\nYou know what's interesting too is that you go through the day to day experiences and we hear that from callers uh every so often\nAnd and I think of and then you mentioned the signs in the yard I have a a a a neighbor or has been my neighbor for almost Fifteen Years at the end of my street he's so he's at the corner he's got a corner lot right\nAnd one of the three of that corner not not our street but the the the cross street there is a is six lanes so there's a lot of traffic but he has a cruise sign\nAnd another conservative that's running on the state level for for a for Congress here um that is our our our congressmen on the state level\nAnd\nI just I just wonder I haven't asked to me because I haven't had a chance to talk to him he's a black conservative but I haven't had a chance to ask him has anybody ever tried to steal your science I mean not that they would know he's black and and that that would even matter to anybody on the left but you see the things on social media\nAs anyone ever tried to steal your signs you know from your yard 'cause he has them right there on the on the side where the big street is and so\nI don't know I I Would love to to know that if if anyone's ever attempted that he's he's always working in the yard I you know I I think the ah\nA group that the president spoke to the young black leadership summit mhm\nAnd the response is that you got in the media coverage of it and James like our our last caller and this is striking fear I'm not saying there is a monumental change in in a black is going to vote Republican\nBut they're much higher profile now and getting much more coverage the left hand not permit that\nThey must demonize every single person who would tend to do that because you're talking about a solid demographic base that they have held for a long time a long time you have a long long
