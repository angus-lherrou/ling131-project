their health and wellness fine I Want to start\nBy sending a big thank you onto our sponsor today oceanic natural they're one of the best sources of high quality nutritional formulas using the powerful nutrients from our oceans and you can visit them online anytime at oceanic natural dot com once you check them out when you have a chance to have some great information there on the Web site\nToday I Want to welcome Sherry granted here back to the show Sherry it's great to have you back in the studio with us thank Chris afraid to be here you know share he's been on the show a number of times or for those that may not remember Sherrie is a nationally recognized nutritionist\nAnd alternative health advisor she's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional athletes she's also written several books on helping nutrition\nAnd Sherry last time you're on the show we were talking about seaweed and about a new natural supplement called title greens yes which comes from seaweed\nYes and it is called title greens and it is from oceanic naturals and what it is it's a multi nutrients seaweed bland and it is sixty times more potent\nThan any land based vegetable and what I Love about it is it addresses so many of the health problems that people are facing today because they just are not getting the nutrients they need where literally dying from our diet\nIn fact the center for Disease Control ... a fact sheet\nThat indicates that poor nutrition and\nLack of exercise or the number to cause of death in this country and at the rate we're going if we keep us up it'll be number one very than\nIt is it's sad but you know we're we're we're not in a situation where we are starving\nNo unfortunately the foods that were eating or not as nutrient dense as they used to be for example vegetables back in the Nineteen sixties okay they were fifty percent more nutritious than they are today because there were more nutrients in the soil\nEven if you're trying to eat a healthy diet trying to get those fruits and vegetables you still may not be getting the nutrients\nExactly yes that's very true and then when you add the synthetic fertilizers and pesticides you've got a recipe for a lot of malnutrition city and disease but you know the good news is there's a lot of nutritional benefits from the sea and that's what we're learning about and that's what titled brings them at all it's\nReally exciting I mean there there are some remarkable discoveries now coming from the ocean\nYes even the FDA the food and Drug Administration they publish articles that suggested many treasures from the sea will actually give us a medical answers that we are looking for for example the scientists are examining the metabolites of single celled plankton\nWhich the national Cancer Institute tests have shown to have cancer fighting potential that's amazing research in this area is in high gear and labs all across the United states\nAnd and I want to get into this a little bit but but maybe just just\nAnd they're fighting potential it's amazing research in those areas in high gear and labs all across the United states\nAnd I want to get into this a little bit but but maybe just to set this thing up okay what are some of the symptoms that you know their body is not getting the right kinds of nutrients\nWell all sorts of illnesses and diseases they have pain in the body pain in the muscles pain in the joints they find that there's still lacking energy I'm cravings eczema allergies digestive problems lackluster hair dry skin brittle nails those are also a sign\nAnd you know the bottom line is you just don't feel good but you can't put your finger on why\nYeah and I think there's a lot of people in that situation\nAnd they just think it's part of aging and this is what I'm going to have to deal with which drives me crazy I'm like no it doesn't have to be that way and what I Want our listeners to understand is that a gene isn't about the breaking down of our bodies at all it's more about how the body repairs itself your body wants to heal itself it wants to repair itself\nAnd if you give your body what it needs it will do that\nMhm so what about seaweed why is this kind of the key\nWell first of all titled greens has a blend of seaweed that are the most nutrient dense vegetables on a lot of different seaweeds right yeah there's over twelve thousand ... and the other reason is seaweed is so unique is that it's sixty times more potent\nThan any land based vegetables see we have more phytochemicals the word means plant chemicals in these plant compounds are\nAnd building ourselves these phytochemicals really do play an important role in the biology of ourselves okay in fact these phytochemicals there are so powerful that they and able seaweed entitled greens to grow at a rate of one to two feet per day without a route\nThat that's amazing so more anti accidents more minerals more amino acids lip it's trace minerals\nEnzymes we need enzymes today just their food especially as we get older yeah I'm plants they're almost like a gym slave annoys policy knows many of which are not even found in land based plants\nAnd we're talking about the minerals like calcium ten times more in the way then in a glass of milk um sodium magnesium which keeps the muscles relax potassium iodide iron and zinc\nAnd then of course of vitamins vitamin a B. one beat to be six knives and vitamin C. pets authentic acid and folic acid I mean there's even trace amounts of vitamin B. twelve that you cannot get from any land based plants I mean the list goes on and on\nAnd you know I it'd be great if we can just go out and drink the water in the ocean but you can't do that now but what we can do is consumed those powerful vegetables that are in the sea in the form of seaweed Chrissy we have all the nutrients that are required\nBy human beings to live so in other words if you ain't nothing else but seaweed you can sustain a very healthy life oh\nReally yeah it sounds like a great solution here before we go on I just want to let the listeners know that if you'd like to try title dreams risk free and get free

over it but I didn't edited either\nUm because ... those things that we talked about the those are very important questions and I thank everyone for bringing those questions up but I think we've reached a place where we've got to look in the mirror and say are we going to obey the commandments of Christ or not\nRight and and the commandment to love my neighbors I Love myself is not negotiable I mean we have staff to study at this at this weekend\nJust Sanders was up you know we have a rotating staff a study every week and the scriptures and and Jeff was covering the passage out of Matthew

night including ours and and and all of our friends and affiliates along the line and\nHe's just wanting to get to jump on twenty twenty he's already there are just not fair I'm looking at around member all those videos we did for twenty sixteen in the primary I Do remember the or about to do them again but bring up a very good point Rob the folks that\nWatch this stuff for a living there is an interesting thing going on we talked about a red wave we've talked about a blue label or we are a independent organization and I'm a registered independent\nUm as the c._e._o. of the corporation we fight to be fiercely independent we do not take money from candidates are campaigns we don't endorse candidates would not tell you to vote for\nWe believe in the Republican and the principles upon which it stands the principles of the decoration in the constitution and the principles that are underneath those documents that's where we're coming from\nBut it's so blatantly obvious\nThat if there was going to be a race to the finish on this election that the people who are players\nIf you will on the Democrats' side would be furiously engaged in the states where race is still hanging the balance\nThe superstars of the Democrats' bench that are looking to become the first stringers in the presidential election so I went looking for and the other day when I was in Florida working out of our foreign office I couldn't find any of it and then we were in our tendency office I was looking for the mayor and another ... couldn't find him I went over to Pennsylvania couldn't find them over there because\nDog gunner on South Carolina\nAnd suddenly I'm saying to myself\nAnd find them I went over to Pennsylvania couldn't find them over there because dog\nGunner on South Carolina and suddenly I'm saying to myself wait a minute and they have some Iowa New Hampshire trips lined up as well exactly and then I heard that bill and Hillary decided to take a book tour together and I'm thinking to myself okay for them twenty twenty is already started\nNow to be fair the president announced his reelection campaign I think three days after he was elected as a matter of fact is that like they weren't getting started for an end to be fair the Obama group\nBack in two thousand and ate the day after they were elected started their next campaign with their tech companies so it's not unusual for income but to start the next day\nBut my point is if you're watching and we love the people who listen to this program we do and we want you to know what we know so we don't come to you on the public square saying we're smarter than you so listen to us\nOur goal is let me tell you what we've discovered\nWhat do you think and what we think what we've discovered is they're moving there is a caravan of candidates and they're already on the move toward twenty twenty\nAnd we talk about not being on are aligning ourselves with a team but there's clearly teams that are out there and it's been fun to watch the benches of the Democratic party trying align themselves to see where they fit in because right now that twenty twenty nomination is wide open I had this\nConversation with Michael do journal this morning on WGN in national flagship station in in the mid south\nAnd and uh he was saying upstate or is this going to when she said you watch there's no way it'll be a reprisal Bernie Sanders is going to be the Democratic nominee because it's the reprise of what happened in the injustice of all it's inevitable I thought man I really I don't see it I don't see that\nYeah there's so many that are lining up I mean you you have Kamala Harris and Cory Booker and Bernie Sanders and not to plug Web sites but drudge had the headline the other day Hillary's twenty twenty you know her her folks are talking about what it's going to the book tour you mention it it's a book tour why wouldn't they were selling ... Elizabeth Warren do why wouldn't\nThe Democrats unify early behind a single Kennedy why would they want to go through that primary process and beat one another's smithereens I mean that's what they've been doing for years wouldn't it make more sense\nWell that would take someone to step back and say I think you should do it and as we learn from the Republican primary and twenty sixteen if you're a consultant earned an advisor to one of these folks in there say there's eight contenders\nAnd you're getting paid anywhere from thirty to fifty thousand dollars a quarter to advise your candidate ... yeah ... yeah quarter ... are you going to tell your Kennedy you know I think for the good of the country we should get out of this race and step aside\nBecause if you do that you're going to lose your paycheck she her paychecks gone number one\nNumber two all the folks around the country that are writing new checks if they're telling you do not get out of this primary are you going to step away from the primary knowing you're going to go back to your old job\nBut they're never going to write you a check again\nSo are you listening to what you should do are you listening to financially what's responsible in the media is not going to like that either because they're not going to have a bunch of debates that they can televise I mean the Republicans had a round Robin tournament going on around August of twenty Fifteen was the first Republican debate Cleveland\nOhio same place the convention was\nFox rain in August of twenty Fifteen year one full year before the convention I\nNow we are now Oregon station is profoundly opposed to legalize gambling but it's going to be really hard to keep their from being an over under that around here in regards to win\nThey opposed to legalize gambling but it's going to be really hard to keep their from being an over under ... around here in regards to win CNN will host the first Democrat debate let's face it August snow pack it up I Would it will it be January\nIt will it be before or after the super bowl in two thousand and Nineteen [laughter]\nI think it's fluid and it'll always be changing they're talking about it now but it's going to be sooner rather than later\nNow is there any a bellwether indicator in this uh again\nI don't take anything that we're saying is us being smarter were sharing discoveries\nBut it does make me wonder if in fact the two thousand and Eighteen races were as close as the polls say they are\nThen why instead of this caravan of Kennedy's marching toward twenty twenty aren't they in every one of their localities working so hard or you're on these local races that's the part I find kind of mystified well because they already know it's ...\nWell they may know it's over but if it is over in their team loses they can use that to their advantage for fundraising because in the Senate if you don't have sixty votes\nThere may be gridlock to begin with the house say you have a two or three seed advantage no matter which party or with but if there's gridlock in the Senate which there's going to be no matter what\nI Believe that the Democrats can use that to their advantage when they run in ...\nThis is a very sophisticated segue Mr Vice president and project manager by voters has just done to us he just said wait us into an end in Troy he does he set the hook but he had he\nHad ... have you ever called Ralph's sophisticated enough of a terrifying Martin down after the ...\nOf what he's saying is not only is the care of and moving toward twenty twenty but they analyze the fact that neither the Republicans or the Democrats will get to sixty votes in a super majority to stop the cloture nonsense and the Republican progressive lack lack the courage to go back to constitutional simple majority rule in the Senate therefore\nPolicy will be gridlock for all of a twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty and so they're all ready strategically moving down the road setting up the hostility between the outsiders and the administration to come into the theme of the president\nSo I don't I don't think the Republicans you really think all that well I I Know I don't think the Republicans want to not have control of either the house or the Senate they're going to have control one but the Democrats what I'm saying is I don't think they wouldn't mind if it stood pat for another two years\nBecause as they have a run up for the White House they would love to be able to use that\nAs a campaign talking point because he had a theory that majority that can't get to a to cloture they can't get to know they're not they can't get it done so there while so they're doubling down for him and ran in Nineteen forty eight he campaigned against the quote do nothing Congress\nBut they don't you think they're going to reach the frustration level that where they're just going to get rid of the cloture rule I mean they've already done it with Supreme Court justice\nWhether it is from Democrats or or progressive or Republicans from your lips to God's ear may we be done with the cloture rule which is cursed this as a nation from the early Nineteen hundreds right that it is more into a behemoth of of iniquity in regards to defrauding\nThe United states citizens of a constitutional republic by setting up a separate government inside\nThe United states I actually think the immigration issue is going to force that issue this ... going to move the country to wanting to put pressure on the Senate since ... that rule so we can solve the immigration issue\nWell you know it's interesting I never got to get to a break but Wayne in two thousand sixteen because of voters dot com and our network stations we were able to call the elections\nThe immigration issue well you know it's interesting I I Know we've got to get to a break but Wayne in two thousand sixteen because of our voters dot com and our network stations we were able to call the elections\n... about an hour and a half to two hours ahead of the networks so that our friends could get to bed earlier and know what the outcome was ... and now it looks like we're actually ahead of the uh the game again which terrifies me so hopefully we're being inspired by the research and perhaps\nBy more inspiration and that the what we're telling you is what we're discovering there are clues a foot\nOr pay attention because the times they are changing\n[noise] yeah I'm a I Want to go back what Rob was saying about close you because you know the Democrats win if they do and when if they don't because it doesn't matter what the results of this mid term are they're going to they're going to take that and run with it as\nThere are seven and spin to twenty twenty and we can already see this pivot starting now\nOkay All right well you are listening to the public square spirited conversation here today as always glad that you've tuned in and thanks for your support in this program this program wouldn't be on the air if we didn't have people who believed in it so\nPlant [noise]\nUm\n\n\nSome day on the public square where to play what happens during the brings but not today hopefully I promise everybody's safe but let's get back to the conversation now uh twenty twenty just began we're talking about that here today but let's talk about churches in elections to have\nA way and I've got a confession to make it goes back to what we started to talk about earlier today a\nIn this program and and it's actually for me it's it's becoming a wound its its brews in it it's not good and it's a very a sore spot with me [noise]\nI'm Sorry about reading [noise] in my personal studies of of Jesus in the book of revelation\nChapters one through three and the reason that that's significant to me is because I read of the life of Christ every night\nUm and I've been doing that since I was in college when I had a professor or who's focused was teaching the life of Christ who said it'd be kinda dare to say I dare you to read every day just for a few minutes every day for the rest of your life something from the life of Jesus from\nThe gospels and I thought what a novel challenge so I respected this guy and I took him on\nNow I have now worn out several copies of the book that I used it as a sudden optic compilation of a life of Jesus I it goes in paragraph fashion goes from the start of his ... his birth to his his resurrection and his ascension\nAnd I read it and well it dawned on me that I had not been reading the really the last chapter of the words of Jesus which are found on the book of revelations chapter one through three where Jesus writes back to his churches\nAnd so I started reading those recently and I'm deeply troubled by them I think I may have a whole year of study a head because\nThe tone the delivery the tenor of these words is powerful compelling I Would submit even haunting where Jesus is speaking back to the church thing I see who you are\nI Know what you're doing I Know where you're failing\nI and I I take issue with you and if you don't straighten up\nHere's the consequence of what you can expect\nAnd I have to tell you it's it's I mean it's it's causing my skin crawl because I'm guilty\nI I'm One of those people you might write to and say oh by the way you think you're this hot shot guy on the radio let me tell you about you and let me tell you about how far you fall from what I call you to be and I'm I'm guilty and then I thought wow and so then I was reading in first Tennessee\nPaul talking about there's one thing we can tell you for sure he says in the first chapter Jesus Christ came to save centers this is the one thing I can tell you with absolute certainty and then he goes on the same sentence and say among whom I Am the chief\nJesus came to save centers and I'm the biggest one of all and then he goes on to talk about his personal testimony and the unlimited patience of Christ\nWhich by the way Jesus talks about his patient says he's writing and others churches as well my question is thank God it's unlimited but in the book of revelation it it's it's not it's not limit less if there's a point at which he says for your own good I'm not going to be patient with you anymore\nAnd so this is sober me greatly and then as I read on and first Timothy I read that commandment in first Timothy\nIt'd be patient with you anymore and so this is sober me greatly and then as I read on and first Timothy I read that commandment in first Timothy chapter one reporters to Timothy instructing them as to how the church should be and says first of all first thing I Want to talk to you about is this\nThat you teach people that we as Christians as our first priority should be to pray for those in authority over us you got it there Jeff first Timothy to one\nUh yes first of all that and first of all day and I urge that suffocation prayers enter sessions\nAnd Thanksgiving is being made for all people for kings and all who are in high positions or in authority that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life godly and dignified in every way one sentence past that this is good and it is seizing and the site of God our savior\nThis is good and it is pleasing it's what God wants us to do and friends I've got to tell you something as we come into the selection ah we're we're we're looking at were monitoring we're getting reports from church after church after church around the country I must tell you that for me this has become a wound\nWhy won't churches pray for America on Sunday Morning out loud from the ...\nThere's not a son he goes by that we don't\nThere are some that do there are some that too and there are some churches that because of their liturgy have written in a moment in may they pray every single part of liturgy every single week there's a a segment we're intercession has made for rulers and those in authority religious rewards and civic ...\nAnd we should be praying for leaders in rollers and civil authority ... regardless of what letters next their name or party they serve front on\nSometimes I think people are afraid to be perceived as raw raw political activists here a patriotic Americans they don't want to do it\nBut this this is written before America existed this has written to to any country in any country in the world that you live and you should do that polish telling Timothy to pray for a dictator that is murdering Christians\n... you know look this is going to get me in more trouble than last week email may have gotten me into because now I've gone from preaching to Madeline [laughter] and now basically I'm calling out the celebrity preachers across America who are on radio all the time\nAnd the mega church leaders who have giant congregations and giant budgets and talked to thousands of people and who who present themselves as being leaders were God is moving and God is speaking based upon the size of their organizations\nAnd I want to tell you emphasize those flex I Want to ask you why are you defying the words of the living God\nWhy are you directly in disobedience to the ... commandments of the New Testament why will you not pray for those in authority over you civic religious political leaders why won't you do it because your silence sends the message to every young person\nIn your congregation that the Jesus you're preaching is not relevant\nNor should he be obeyed in a first order of priority\nAnd then you wonder why when they leave your home and your congregation and go to college and somewhat begins to preach to them a socialist world you are an anti God world view or a or a Darwinian world view why they're captured and captivated because the world view that you advocate has never been relevant enough\nFor you to honor a single prayer connecting the God of the universe\nAnd the leaders of our country to buy\nTo advocate has never been relevant enough for you to honor a single prayer connecting the God of the universe and the leaders of our country\nTo bifurcated worlds ... said if I didn't when Jesus is okay for over ... here but he's not concerned with over there\nYou mentioned a a secular or a Marxist a liberal or progressive world view a lot about it what about an Islamic world view there are people who want to capture Christians and bring them into Islam\nAnd dad is a complete world view why not pray for those in authority in the realm of Islam is well every Sunday Morning right only for those in authority so yes I've gotten read in the face yes it is a wound\nYes I Know it's not a calling that I Want I Do not relish this window of opportunity I don't in joy making people angry and I don't enjoy the reaction of people who suddenly treated like the enemy I look we don't get invited to come and speak in churches as it is because\nThe notion of public policy and and Christian life is controversial now meddling with what's happening in Nepal but but I my question is simply this if you're not hearing someone from the pulpit pray please go to your pastor and volunteer to do it every Sunday\nYeah that's my question how should we usually people are addressed\nThis issue I think we should write the pasture and explain our concern and ask him or her or whoever's in leadership authority where you are may I please visit with you on this for five minutes by request is not partisan in any way I'm reading this passage and I need to know why we don't do this would you mind telling me\nYou can always do it in your Sunday school class or or adult boggle fellowship or Wednesday nights\nIn a way we should do it everywhere all times but but it certainly I'm advocating for Sunday Morning by the way I'm not talking about using prayers some political manipulate right I'd rather talk about obeying the scriptures are it's\nTime for ... somebody you have to leave us now but if you do you can always listen to the rest of this program on line at the public square dot com for everyone we're going to talk about I Know it's not Thanksgiving yet but we're going to talk about Christmas we after Christmas in America as a

Ken rice and everyone yesterday just makes you realize\nHow fortunate we are to have some of the most incredible journalist anywhere but it all gets back to the victims and the people and that synagogue and ... they had two in here and also I was home late last night and it was just an exhausting day because when I left the radio I went into another\nIn what they had two in here and also I was home late last night and it was just an exhausting day because when I left the radio I went into another studio here\nAnd worked on the social media side of are covering the story and talk to everyone or from the Allegheny county sheriff bill Mullen Sam Rosenberg from impacts which is a self defense a\nFacility and here's a guy that actually has seen it from all sides who has family from squirrel hill and that synagogue\nAlso talked to Sandy ... a dear friend or ... or his father actually survived a concentration camp and he lives literally he and his wife Barbara a block from that synagogue many friends attending that synagogue\n\n[noise] ... it's just a a very difficult day even talking to Lou genteel CSI investigators twenty five years [noise]\nPennsylvania state police and he was talking about the hate speech and we're going to get into that in just a few moments but he and I both have a lot of dear friends from the Jewish community community and I literally just was thinking about all of them yesterday\nKKK or a oh it was the right to say listen with any of\nThe ... war [noise]\nFat Rob ... Sunday we're spending the next hour talking about yesterday's tragedy in Pittsburgh history\nAnd I just want to get your thoughts I think we've all talked it to the point where there's not much left to say other than just that ... feeling that we're all left with and I would definitely love to hear from you [noise] those of you especially from the school hill area or who are just a part of Pittsburgh or of the Jewish faith\nThis is a day that I'm I must tell you I I'm not shocked because of the headlines and as I was sitting here yesterday and the story was unfolding and I actually got a text message from Nancy Cohen who had just left the building and she\nHad heard about this active shooter and ... it was just like here we go again here we go again and I that that hate in this world today\nIs so alarming that I'm I'm I'm concerned about my children who I was thinking about\nAt length and my son who is just he and his wife gave birth to a little girl a few weeks ago grace Murray and you know you you start thinking about where are they going where is that next generation what are we teaching what are we showing people [noise]\nSo it's up to you I I but but I definitely think you have to have some deep rooted feelings about this for ... and I'm going to tell you this right now it's your prove a point\nFor those who were trying to politically tied this whole thing to a Republican or Democrat or all of that stuff you need you need to forget about that\nBecause this is something that is running rampant in our country and it has a lot to do because we've taken our eye off of our mission as members of democracy and what the founding fathers really wanted us to do with this epic opportunity that we've all had\nTo be members of the United states of America we have literally dropped the ball we of lead generation after generation and I'm not tell you a lot of it has to do with the American family the infrastructure of the job force\nAll of this stuff has crumbled and it has just exploded in front of our very eyes\nAnd and dear God to to the poor people of the Jewish faith what they've had two in here and I've said this many times before the strength\nOf what they've all been able to overcome even the ... building in Tel Aviv you know was paying homage and respect to those who lost her life people to the Jewish faith get it they understand family they have overcome obstacles that you and I will never be able to understand\nBut it's up to us just specially those of us or none of the Jewish faith to do everything in our power to stop this and we need to start teaching our children as I have\nSince my children were old enough to comprehend why you need to respect people of the Jewish faith and especially the state of Israel with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been trying to do what they've been doing in the middle east\nThey ... the reason that there is such\nHatred is because people see their strength and they realize that they are able to overcome people of the Jewish faith things that honestly\nHatred is because people see their strength and they realize that they are able to overcome people of the Jewish faith things that honestly I mere mortals I don't know if they would have the chance\nAnd I think of some of the great names in Pittsburgh you know my friendly her which they left family and what these people did when they came here all of the struggles and the sweat equity\nAnd I you know I have a friend is the root of who I I've only met once but you know we've communicate it a little bit and I've said respect for his tradition and his family and I just don't know what ... said else to say today other than\nWe got we have to do everything to stop it in as the president said we need to punish people who do stuff like this and if this\nIndividual was still shelling anti Semitic remark after he was arrested\nI'm Sorry that there needs to be justice year\nThere needs to be justice here and we need to and and the reason Israel is so strong because they do handout justice crime and punishment you do the crime you pay the price and and we in this country had been way too soft on people that are doing things like this and we are not setting a good example for generations to come\nAnd and this this is one story that I I I I'm I'm putting my foot down and I'm simply saying I've had enough\nAnd now with this this persecution again and I've seen this anti Semitism which has been starting to sweep the world in recent decades has been going on for decades in Europe and we've been feeling it here in this country in recent years and now after this I mean Pittsburgh is famous for a lot of things but I Am so\nSad that this is going to be a part of our our history\nAnd if it wasn't for the brave police officers no matter where they would have been it's a miracle that more people weren't killed\nBut one life is way too much to lose\nSo what are we going to do to stop this this madness this this this this sewer Egypt just anger and ugliness that continue to come out\nYou know we could all be so lucky to be a part of that faith and how they treat each other as family members and how many come here and work hard and for years would send money back to Israel God Bless them all\n\nThere has to be a recipe here for success that we can all learn something from and and I've said the reason that I've been a fan of President Trump for a long time is that he is an ally of Israel and I think that as an incredible thing\nIncredible thing so do you believe is I Do\nThe death penalty has to be back on the table and it's got to be carried out you know you get your due process you get your appeal and if it does turn out that this is the man and he is found guilty\nAnd the court of law by a jury of his peers I'm Sorry I I I I don't want to be hearing about this this this individual if he is the one and he is found guilty and I know we're all innocent until proven guilty but you know what a enough of the rhetoric we we need to look at us for what it is\n\nI mean this two thousand Eighteen have I mean you realize six million Jews were exterminated murdered killed in cold blood World War two young and old alike have we learned anything all these years later and you know what I Would tell you this you know veterans' day is fast approaching into all these veterans\nThe few that are alive from World war two but many of us baby boomers who remember the stories and things that we heard and said and I had a neighbor who actually went into a concentration camp at the end of World War two as a foot soldier and listen\n\nI had a neighbor who actually went into a concentration camp at the end of World War two as a foot soldier and listen\nWe didn't we learn anything haven't we learned anything\nAnd I know the age old argument you know assault weapons you need to ban them this and that you know I heard somebody yesterday say um that that he had more weapons on him than people who go to war listen they'll find a way don't focus a listen you got to focus\nOn is this is the person they did the crime court of law a trial and punishment this person or any person who does something like this\nAnd you know something that somebody told me yesterday when I was doing all the interviews and you can see if you would love to go to my Facebook page or you're more than welcome or my Twitter site number of interviews we did yesterday afternoon\nAnd the thing that just kept ringing out was you know you should be safe when you go to your at least your place of faith but I mean look how many churches look what happened in Texas I mean this this is nothing new\nAnd we in this country I\nMean I don't even know how if you're the president of nine states you're saying to yourself in that\nQuiet time that very little quiet time you have I'm Out there doing all of this trying to make all of this happened you know creating a better economy the economy's doing well let's get ... heading back in the right direction and you you have all this stuff happening with in your own country\nAnd you know we're worried about who's coming in and all the craziness we we can't keep living like this and I don't want to turn this into a political thing today and I'm telling you right now I'm not going to listen to it\nI'm not going to listen to it this has nothing to do with politics this has to do with what it is a tragic event\nWhich eleven people were killed\n\nEleven people killed it's to the point where I Am getting so frustrated\nThat it it's almost like ... and I I was actually looking at the Pittsburgh Post Gazette headline today\nAnd it and if you want the entire story everything any right in front of me so you can see it get it but I was in ... township very early and they were on bundling the papers and I'm looking at this squirrel Hillsborough hills squarely at one paper after another and I'm just like\nHow much more can this
