when it first you know most about a week ago mhm was first started that\nUh when we come back from vacation and we saw the you know we saw social media\nAnd a lot of Republicans were saying well they're they're doing this in order to affect election day and you and I came in and say wait a minute when you see how far away they are and how far they can walk in one day I'm not going to get here

hundred troops down to the border wasn't as big of a stories I thought it would be and I wonder that over the past week at the media has looked at this and said this isn't going to benefit us\nLet's

they have lost because of the way that they have argued mhm so even though it may satisfy your primal urge or instinct\nTo rage out to somebody\nLike they're doing to you and you get a moment of satisfaction out of it\nIt's one of the reasons that they're losing but you and I said this\nMany times all we need is true mhm and when you look at the things that we believe they work mhm that's why we promote them\nThat's why we do the kind of show that we do we spend a lot of time talking about this yesterday that's why we break down everything that's why we get down to the issues that had and we get pushback from people on the right when we do that by the way mhm there are some not all but there are some of the right\nDidn't want to believe the rhetoric they want to believe the height\nYou know you and I and and that's why we you talked about dictator remember when\nUh we we should hear Obama's Muslim and we said where's the evidence right while his father now where's the evidence that that's what he believes if you look at what he believes\nWhat does he believe he believes more in the church of Jeremiah Wright mhm which wasn't preaching you know Islam but was preaching hey\n[laughter] and not Christianity but was preaching a radical hate him or hate America or a message message and thank you very much ...

Fifteen\nWhen you know it was the\nNight we were getting barrage with phone calls you guys just don't understand you know understand what we know we know we know and that's always the argument from the conspiracy theorists oh we know something that you don't know there are more I feel special because somebody else has told me in and and I know and this is when they were talking about how top secret was and we had to bring out\nOf the uh a press release that was done from the local chamber of commerce and one of the counties that you know you were going to have the special forces in that had already figured out the economic benefit to their county\nChamber of commerce in one of the counties and that you know you were going to have the special forces in that had already figured out the economic benefit to their county frightened by\nSomebody that was going to be spent on those that I needed to be may be spent that's how sink rented was right that the chamber of commerce had done it I mean they spent over two million on the tunnels under Walmart alone [laughter] you know we we dealt with it we we dealt with it after the nine eleven conspiracy thrives remember we had to go to we actually had to go on the show to popular\nMechanics and these are people that listen to our show yes so it for us it's a constant fight\nAnd you know what the nine eleven conspiracy theories that people were buying into I remember we had to [laughter] read portions of Popular Mechanics number of Popular Mechanics said look I'm we do mechanics ... and so we weren't getting get involved in this and we realized wait a minute that's what we're here for\nThese things these theories about mechanics and physics are being put out there that's what we do like to see whether they're actually possible or not uh what was the other way we uh we dealt with it um\nWe dealt with it the night of the Saturday off brothers\nOh man so we go on it we had been getting a information coming in\nAbout what was going on and we're in Watertown uh uh about thirty minutes before we went on for about eleven thirty central that night and we started coverage route twelve thirty when we started getting confirmation of the of those reports 'cause there there was breaking\nNews and we we continue that coverage or through the end of the show\nSomewhere in the middle of the show we started getting emails this from Boston bombing the other bothering bombing suspects and when they essentially went through Watertown and\nAnd uh that night that uh you know one of them died and the other one uh eventually was captured the later but when you look at the the\nThe ... about I don't know half way through the show when we looked at our email that was coming in and it was about\nWell if it then they gave us Pacific names these are the people that they're chasing these are the people that there\nWhy are you saying this asking us and they were and by the way they were to Middle Eastern names right\nAnd look we're not going to be\nI don't have any a desire to go out and be first\nI only have a desire and I believe responsibility to be accurate if we're because we often report on breaking news we don't I Do I Do not want to be I don't want to put something out there I don't want to be a Brian Ross at ABC\nI don't\nHere's what's different about specific names\nIf we if the details do change on on breaking news stories we know that better than most people because we we cover and we've covered some big stories over the years the details do change but we're talking about like numbers or maybe okay it was over on this block or was in this town not this town\nWhat it is a specific name if those names belong to people who are innocent Brian Ross\nOr anyone else that might be reporting something\nThen you start saying that because of Brian Ross at ABC after the Aurora shooting well right there's information that there is a man with that name that belongs to the Tea Party well how do you know it's the same one you just put that on ABC TV and they got burned and and he got burned big time\nYou know it's the same one you just put that on ABC TV and they got burned and and he got burned big time\nI Believe\nThe goal and it is our goal to be accurate but the thing is is that there were people just they just kept pounding as for the last half of our show because we weren't putting them out in fact you and I it wasn't until about thirty minutes after the show was done when authorities announced who\nThey were chased phone and that always the sunny and we set it on the air we set it on the air that look there's a couple of names out there we just can't verify from many legit source that we believe that we have confidence in that it is uh that that is true and and as you mentioned thirty minutes after our show\nIt wasn't the people right and\nSo again we were called every name in the book we're you know you name it we were called it for hiding the truth from the people\nSee that's the implication hiding something from the people were not looking to hide anything we're just looking to be accurate\nAnd so when I look at this week that's what we've been focusing on is\nFor the Republicans on the conservatives just focus on the truth\nThat so you can you can passionately attack the other side but don't play their game I've said it before they need to do it they don't have the substance of the issues they can't back up their points of view\nMay need it they thought of desperation that they do it\nI don't feel desperate and whether whether whether the\nSide that I favor more wins an election or loses an election right I have never felt the need to use inflammatory rhetoric because I feel I have lost the substance of my argument\nTwo thousand two thousand eight denied of election night uh you know are they all the power goes to the Democrats and we got calls why aren't you guys angry\n... look it didn't go my way I'm disappointed but I had my say in it well we had been blunt uh I've\nA friend of mine yesterday posted wow you know the whole country's going much more conservative right now and I said look on social issues they aren't fiscal issues or not and I explained it to him the debt mhm the country's not going the way that I Want when it comes to debt Republicans don't care about the debt that we're putting on future generations right they've completely\nJust said let's not even pay attention to it right that doesn't\nMatter anymore what we put on future generations doesn't matter anymore we don't care we think that's wrong for the Republican Party we think that's immoral or the Republican Party to not be wearing that as a badge of honor every single day\nWe understand that's because they are following what the people are doing that yeah the rank and file of there and that's why we brought up that remember that the swamp just three years ago the swamp was about Republicans who wouldn't be fiscally

[laughter] [laughter] ah\nYeah we'll we'll appoint you secretary of making pies\n... [laughter] [laughter] ah\nYeah we'll we'll appoint you secretary of making pies\nYeah or is this out yesterday Senate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley announced that he is referring Julie sweat Nick and her loyal a lawyer excuse\n\n... that would be interesting to see where a case like that would go right\n\nYeah um you know you have a number of things there that honestly\nThat that that warrants an investigation I think\n\n... here's here's the question what if\nAnything happens to it after the midterm assuming like the house\nTakes control does it does an investigation like this go anywhere I guess\n\nBecause no reasonable prosecutor [laughter] with would pursue a a a a refer I\nI Would have to look at everything that Grassley has but here's what he writes here in light of missed what Nixon Mr ... own statements to the media information obtained from committee interviews of her associates and publicly reported information about her and Mr ...\nIt has become a parent that the statements Mr ... submitted to the Kennedy likely contain material false claims rationally wrote him a letter grasses across does not guaranteed Justice Department will open a an investigation\nIs the last part of that and we'll send he sent a letter to attorney general\nRight because if the if the committee were to do I mean if they do an investigation then what would happen about if they found that there was wrongdoing you essentially send the Senate you send to\nA referral to the Justice Department at that point I mean good for prosecutorial means if you found that there was a wrong doing if you through the investigation your own investigation from\nI don't know everything that Grassley has yeah so I can so and I ... I can only speculate that if it's you know she claimed the gang rape mhm right right right\nAnd then but here's the thing\nYou the investigation doesn't go doesn't have to go too far because of the fact that she went on TV on a national television show on the today show and started to walk back some of the things in that sworn statement\nSo it's not like you it's not like the uh the the the house\n\nSo it's not like you it's not like the uh the the the house and their investigation into the Justice Department where you're looking at you know it's like pulling teeth and getting some of the evidence or document\nYou have things in the sworn statement that are countered in a nationally televised interview\nThat are different by the same person\nAnd the question is you know what do you do with that I mean does the political climate change if ah if the Democrats take the house or you know ... and does that kind of soften I guess the or or or steal from the the the desire\nTo pursue justice here well that this will be the Senate so I Know I Know but it doesn't change anything about the sentiment because there has to be that well if we can't goes back to that political will I think again no one is above the law and if you go through the process and this this really focuses\nOn the the if the uh the\nTearing down and the shredding of the actual process itself by the Democrats especially Ron that committee during that process\nWe know that that was the you know the the hearings ... were about Dr Ford but this war was ... at ... this was adding to a an intended to influence the the outcome of the vote\nOn Kavanaugh the confirmation vote on Kavanaugh it was part of that entire you know process well it was a separate from Dr Ford part of the camp a confirmation process so when you talk about doing the doing away or trying to do away or or completely dilute\nOr shred the process\nThat in the cell just then then I don't know why you wouldn't at least pursue an\nWell when we had the lead to come out and said look this isn't a trial this wasn't a trial we said well no it is a political trial then and there are things that are similar to a criminal trial which is\nYou're under oath mhm if you commit perjury mhm in you know if it is and that's what he believes you know making false statements perjury ... if you don't that is against the law that you are breaking a criminal law at that point right as we said it's different than a criminal trial but as a political trial\nThat has similarities you are put under oath\nAnd so the circus that we saw going on and I understand we're Grassley has going from if they if he believes and I don't know what evidence she has I don't know if anybody came forward after it I don't know who didn't testify or what information was not brought out the Grassley had that might you know that he might have now so I really don't know but if he believes\nThat he can make that case for making false statements base based on what she said based on the TV interview and based on\nWhat other people that might have come forward have come forward and a might have come forward since then have said to him absolutely he should go forward with that because\nIt is a it is a legal process or if somebody commits perjury or makes false statements they shouldn't be prosecuted we see what happens when we see what happens when somebody makes a false statement to an ... an FBI agent they go to jail Martha Stewart went to jail\nSo should we said that when a political trial happens because that's what it was\nThat none of the law should be followed at all that people should be able to go in and make a circus of it\nIf you can prove they know you know that they lied and their lawyer lied and their lawyer put them up to line should you go after it I think the majority of Americans if you ask them that generic question\nAnd kept the you know kept the case out of it the vast majority of Americans\nAnd I think the majority of Americans if you ask them that generic question and kept the you know kept the case out of it the vast majority of Americans would say yes because it is it was an attempt\nI think you can they would probably be able to prove through this investigation that the attempt the the the uh the the motive or what they were trying to do was disrupt the process and if you do that through false means\nOr what giving false testimony a sworn testimony to the Senate committee is against the law for reasons that that that's what that's about because that is a part of the process and if you if you can show that this was the the the clear intent here\nWas to disrupt that process\nAnd new knowingly said things in that statement that sworn statements that were false I don't know why\nYou wouldn't move Fort wealth with that ... whether they take the house or not this is now in the department of justice for just under the president so I don't see it stopping if they believe they actually have a ... ... because it does this really isn't at this point isn't about\nPolitical will because frankly the left doesn't care about sweating no or apathetic no so you know my question on

in recession until after\nThe midterm elections however only three members were present Mark Meadows John Ratcliffe both Republicans and James raskin of Maryland medals called Papadopoulos critical witness nobody in that he's\nThe person who supposedly was the whole reason that we have this Russian collusion investigation going on Papadopoulos is loose talk\nOr overseas about Russians having dirt on Hillary Clinton prompted a an FBI investigation into election interference what we're finding out\nOr without talking about specific ... what is going on is the whole reason that this investigation was opened up was certainly not built on a solid foundation metals told reporters he added that some Justice Department an FBI staffer should be referred to the department of justice's office of professional responsibility to determine whether\nProper protocol was followed and I'm certainly willing to encourage that\nThe Republicans and Democrats are painted partisan portraits of

right\nAnd all of a sudden one day on the air mhm is what I think it was the day after or whatever we said well wait a minute 'cause we're we're we're we're like baffled ... because they were making

New York is two hundred people showed up invited\nEllen New York is two hundred people showed up invited you know a Republican candidates from the earth to show up nobody showed\nUp though so it was going to be like maybe some kind of informal Tom whole discussion or something or ... what were they gonna really going to talk fire prevention\nI mean what's the what's the point of them showing up\nI uh I I really don't know but ah I just you know\nI don't know where to draw is for us the ban I mean I Know there's because I use use perceived as the guy\nWho who got the momentum going for Trump Mm [noise]\nYeah but didn't the ... the charisma though and I understand what she did you know for the campaign but really that charisma was carried by by Trump\nThe I so I I Know I so I don't know if of course I mean after you know after you're done as an advisor\nThe concern is as we've said before is once the government spending moderate than that increase goes away and as we've said before the truth grows\nAnd if you listen to the show you know we've been consistent uh irrespective of whether it's been a Republican president or a Democratic president or the GDP is not the most accurate way it's the way that we use and it's become the accepted way\nIt's never been the most uh uh accurate way we believe to truly a show the indication of economic growth because money being transferred back and forth or government spending is viewed the exact same way\nAs private sector profits and sales and we believe that that distorts\nThe actual growth rate of any economy but it's been consistent from democratic presidents to a Republican presidents well it's important to monitor the truth expansion of well\nYes and that's and that is the that is the increase in goods and services produced by the private sector not that we don't support an increase in defense spending no we're ... we're just talking about how we analyze how it applies to the economy is doing so without the increased in government spending\nOr you would have had a a a\n... a growth rate of of two point five six percent up from the two point two percent from the Obama administration\nThe point is how critical it is because you see the increase\nYou see the increase in a huge increase why because of fossil fuels which drives the majority of\nThe private sector increase in GDP that's still what driving the majority increase in GDP in the private sector\nIt's still not as much as government spending right since April of of twenty Seventeen that's how much you know we have increased government spending\nOver the last\nYear and a half when that government spending goes away so does the GDP increase that's why we have been so concerned and we have taken a great deal of criticism from people who used to agree with us but now disagree with us\nOn the increase of increasing the cost\nOf goods by terrorists and as we've stayed it doesn't matter who you are doesn't matter whether you call yourself a Republican\nOr conservative or liberal a socialist a capitalist if you believe that an increased cost in good in the marketplace benefits the economy then you don't know what you're talking about it's that simple\nAnd so that's why we have always been so concerned about trade and about artificially increasing the cost of goods and services when we've talked about the president\nAnd the new NAFTA the president's number one accomplishment on the new NAFTA has been what what he believes he has done to the car industry which will increase the cost of buying a car in the United states in Canada in Mexico and we'll make it harder to\nThe street which will increase the cost of buying a car in the United states in Canada in Mexico and we'll make it harder to sell that product made in the United states overseas\nWhich was what the president claimed he wanted on trade and we will continue to say this on tariffs the president does all over the place and when you're all over the place on a particular issue one has to ask do you have any idea what you're talking about\nWell and as we are break down the GDP Growth and you look at it right now and the way that there's this long lead and then they point this out on this Wall Street journal article for items like aircraft carriers and things like this so we're likely to see as this money goes through the ... a Pentagon and then as actually spent and\nAnd and and through the contractors were likely to see some of this growth continue in terms of the defense spending growth\nA leading the way into twenty ... twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty so what's important here is that you kind of separate that from what the private sector is doing we're the gross is in the private sector or where the lack of growth is\nIn the ... in the end of that you do yes you you do have to\nSeparate the two because government spending even for\nA quick and even though there is a benefit for those companies doing it that's not why you do it right it's not why it's not why you do it but also that is the majority of that money mhm of increase of that money is coming from borrowed money is coming from money that the that we are putting on future generations\nSo the economic impact overall may help now but down the line the burden of the debt is going to hurt one works against the other one the other thing is the multiplier effect\nIs not the same as in the private sector\nBecause the multiplier effect in the private sector is if you build something that makes somebody else else's life more efficient or makes their business more efficient they use that and it's the combination of building that good in service and the increased productivity along that private sector in line that really boost\nIt really is the true economic engine that that shows that you are having an economic growth thinking assume our society thinking a smartphone\nYes you know like it is so that that is that that great demand a because it's at that because it\nCreates that efficiency and society and and and productivity increased productivity and that's where you see again that multiplier ah the create that huge expansion in wealth and and ripple out you're not going to you're not going to see that with defense spending\nOn defense spending you will build the initial product mhm but the initial product is used for what that's the cost of doing business\nMhm what your ... and so yeah we understand how\nThat helps the GDP but you're creating something you're using debt down the road where yes in the ... the funding ... write long term debt to to pay for it but then that actual good or service is not used in the private sector and to improve the efficiency\nA ... and productivity of other businesses down the line\nIt stays there and it becomes a a burden of the cost of doing business on an entire economy yes\nMan that I mean difference you could make a a very indirect a link to it and say that it preserves capitalism and general and the role right but it but that does not have the same and media the fact that the private sector multiples uh do\nAnd that's and that and that's why when you left\nBut it but that does not have the same immediate effect\nThat the private sector multiples uh do\nAnd that and that and that's why when you look and that's why when we bring up the tariffs then the cost of home building now and the cost of of timber because those terrorists from what I Know ... and told the deal is signed her still on with the with with Canada the increase you you talk about the two biggest drivers\nOf of when you talked about what ... what the consumer marketplace and tried the economy it's housing and cars\nBoth have been targeted by terrorists mhm we haven't even talked about food yet and what a drag that might be down around the road for and the big terrorists haven't even hit yet and that's why we are we are so concerned with the direction of this White House when it comes to economics and I have no idea where\nHas has the ... Congress talked about and uh about what they're going to do with the new NAFTA there'd been I don't know I ... zero talk on\nWhat happens if you because they want to get this done\nSoon and what happens when the house if the house goes to the Democrats\nYou know can they get this thing done by the end of December and they get this through\nThe end it because we're talking about what to the Republicans how they feel about it right we're not we're not just your young even forget about what we talk about the the house\nTurning blue we have to talk about and that the the Republicans right now and given or assuming that they might try and vote on it by the end of the year\nAnd so you have to ask what are the plants because the steel and aluminum tariffs still stay in place right\n\nAn

material cost I mean what about all the smaller companies\nYou know we talk about the contractors you know Lockheed Martin is a given right but there are many smaller companies that that are included
