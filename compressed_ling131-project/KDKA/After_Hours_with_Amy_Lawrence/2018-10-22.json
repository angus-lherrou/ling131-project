got you're going to have a field that is going to be greater than it was what did they have three three and a half candidates going against Trump\nNo but if you in their primary ah [laughter] Mm well

hates Trump more and we're going to give you everything right and so right now the base level for the Democrats have been and Kamala Harris headed over the weekend ... last week\nWhen she came up again with her guaranteed in a ... plan here of six thousand dollars was one of the figures that was thrown out so now it's\n... well ... praises income yeah versus get rid of the the tax cuts right the taxes would have to go up there in order to pay for it even though they ... it wouldn't pay for the six thousand dollars and but six thousand dollars what any American the mix under a hundred thousand something to do what it was I\nI'm a but a six thousand they're free healthcare completely Medicare for all where you pay nothing\n... there's no deductible there is nothing mhm which ah by the way uh I thought the president had the best response for that before we went on vacation when he said oh good screw with people that that right 'cause what's going to happen right you you you you think you're going to Medicare for all you can just going to enter screen old people because\nThere's not enough money for the old people that have put in for Medicare that we can't pay ... for them right\nAh but ah you know so you have you have that and free college free college free health care free money mhm and we hate Trump and really if you want to look at it there was nowhere else for them to go\nThat route it we already know what twenty twenty is going to be yeah yep\nI age because there has to be again the that battle on stage to you know who hates Trump more poor or now will just kind of usher in this this thought and entertain this\nThere has to be again that that battle on stage to you know who hates Trump more poor or now will just kind of usher and this this thought to entertain this for a moment\nOkay\nMaybe it is Hillary or maybe it is Joe just anyone that can beat Trump\nExcept there has to be more than that there really has to be more than that because what you're looking at at the end of the day or on election day\nIs oh what's going on with the economy and and what are they really promising and and do I have ... I Know a lot of people have trumpet I didn't vote for the guy I may not ever vote for the guy but\nAm I motivated to go out and vote for this person what are they gonna do for me\nYou're talking about other sports were just talking about rank and file voters rank and file voters right because what did you see Wall Street journal going through Harlem and the than the day after the election and twenty sixteen why do you think he was just you know random\nParticipants on the street interviews\nAnd the the one common thread in those and those respond as from those respondents was he was talking about problems we have here at home she kept talking about problems over seas somewhere outside of this country\nAll as we said the reason the Trump one was not because he had all the solutions but because he simply identified what the problem was what the problems of war and\nAnd the fact is you haven't had presidential candidates sort of looked at the topics that people have cared about\nAnd even point out these are the problems that we have to solve them and that's how bad it had gotten by twenty six team as we said the Democrats were talking about instill our climate change and race are two major problem ... well they're not written Americans didn't view was that way right from is president because\nHe identified what the problems were and now we can debate all day long whether all of the solutions\nThat he has come up with or that he has promoted or the correct way to go or not ... but the fact is he came up with the problems and identified the problems and politics are so bad in America\nToday\nWhere if you just identified the problem in twenty sixteen that got you elected president of the United states right\n\nAnd then what you have now is two years later you got a ton of people looking at the same and you know something a lot of the solutions are the correct solution some\nYeah I mean that's in in that's it it because what you have to deliver in order to be reelected for a second term as a result so if we're still looking at low unemployment that we're still looking at you know the people taking more money home because\nTaxes are lower if we're still looking at a situation where the economy is getting better\nThan where\nDo you go you can offer free stuff what's that going to look like ultimately you're going to have to spell out how it's going to work alternately you're gonna have to you know I I mean\nWe say what you will about Herman Cain's nine nine nine plan\nBut guess what people still said the the name of the plan now we torn apart and it didn't work and ultimately didn't work for him\nBut the point is is that you come out with something very simple here's how my plan is going to work here's what I Want to do while you're up against potentially a president in twenty twenty who has delivered\nWho has delivered some pretty stellar results on the economy so you're going to do what promised a lot of free stuff do people still buy the hype in the free stuff if they believe that will never be delivered ultimately\nAnd because\nHere's what changed after the great recession and we saw that it was well the banks got the bail out so I should get mine even people that otherwise might be conservative you know we're like okay we want we do want more free stuff we got a ton of those calls and and so there\nIs that affect their but the concern is too is that\nAmong the you know just the generic voter population out their rank and file voter they're looking at as a this big promise oh free health care for everybody free whatever it's going to be the big free package\nAnd they say to themselves you know what it will be free for somebody else and it won't be free from me they they compare themselves to their neighbor or somebody else and it's like\nNow I just got you in this good economy I just got to making this amount of money and guess what they're promising something to somebody else I'm not going to get any of that\nYour calls and comments coming up eight six six Ninety red eye\n... goals eight six six months she read on the radio [noise]\nRight now AT T A N Petro stuffing centers so

thought it was important\nTo bring that up because that's more of the the emotion of what drives an election and I and I don't think I don't think we should discount how important that is in this election that reason the Trump is drawing the crowds that he is is drawing\nA especially from a Republican Party that you'd think two years afterwards that he's going in and doing these rallies and he is drawing these people and we had mentioned the the uh the the story that came out over the weekend that Tibet O'Rourke a small little theater\nLikely not no but it was kind of a you know with all due respect to well the answer I think we all know that any critical thinkers does that I don't expect they\nLindsey Graham or or another conservative on the committee or or Republican on the committed to get up and do what come out with Harris did you know after the committee will get up and storm out\nThat wasn't the point\nYou know but I'll Wait wait a minute and again you can't make the case of the he was trying to make the case that it was the same and I'm like no it was unprecedented what happened right mhm and you even look at Justice Thomas you know that goes back you know twenty five\nOr ... that goes back twenty five years ago and and uh you know he those hearings were held and then but then but then he was he was you know confirmed and I believe some Democrats even cross the line and voted for him yes they did I Believe that yes they did well I Believe that was a Democrat said at the time\n... yeah\nAh so yeah so you know they they ... but this was unprecedented nothing nothing we've ever seen\nA ... in our lifetime or in modern times has has been like this so to even question that to me uh shows ignorance and that doesn't mean stupidity it means a\nLack of

which is not their role which is why we were against\nTheir nomination but it was based on judiciously what they would do not by what we want each and every day mhm mhm but what the job of the\nJudges and that's the difference and that's something that we brought up with the whole cabinet hearings that we should look ... you know conservatism Republicans stop have to stop arguing\nThe same premise that Democrats are arguing right Republicans keep arguing most conservative versus liberal justice no it's not ... I'm not voting for a conservative judge I'm voting for a construction is an originalist\nI'm voting for a judge irrespective of what they wish the government to be each and every day understand\nThat their role is not to make law either left or right\nThere their job under the constitution is to interpret what the law says\nYou know it's interesting to see that as we got to the uh the the closer to the the\nUltimate vote on\nOn a cabin on you know I made the point that even the liberal justices respect the process in my opinion based on experience and I think one thing you can look at one judgment you can look at it from ...\nWas recess appointments which was unanimous yeah against all by against Obama yeah because if you look at that that really was something that was very clear on what the process yes and so\nRespecting not only the process of how you know the confirmation process of of of how that's done but also again the process at the highest court I Do believe and you know you can say what you will about\nThe opinions written by against verbal or or whether they're they're descending or majority opinion you can we can tear it apart and say well they're wrong about this or the wrong about that or we disagree with this or that\nBut in terms of the process I think ah by and large I have seen them display consistently respect for the actual process\nAnd I can point to that one example but there are others a recess appointments was ... that unanimous decision where look you can't do that and and and that is that is the difference\nWhen the left no longer respects the process\nWhen you don't respect to process what is left because what is left is shouting people out of restaurants do away with the Senate do away with this do away with the President's Day do

[laughter]\nThat's what we said anything anything since then the ... like I said was minor it's like we don't you use your ... well now did you hear what he said that two years in six months ago or your\nFather was part of the plot that led to the is the absolute ... assassination of a president that's not a small claim you know like your father was once a Democrat you know\n[laughter] he helped kill Kennedy\nAnd you know and today there will be a really yeah you're right now and and I had a much bigger like white they were in a small place move a bigger place now the campaign is claiming Trump's twenty twenty campaign boasting a hundred thousand people plus interested in attending\nUh had the basically the the it was like a fifty fifty on the houses that NPR a couple of weeks ago they thought that if you go yeah yeah so and and it came out to eat yesterday that in\nWhat is it likely a vote or ... or the Republicans are moving closer right okay that came out just yesterday I think I have writers somewhere yeah\nThe the the story here but it's so much tougher to tell on those house seats I just I I Wonder that if we're going to gain in the in the in the Senate mhm and so that's you know that's looking at a populations across the state and right here or that\nYou know I just wonder how they extrapolate it out to so many of these races where if they're using the public polls out there there are so few of them\nSo few and far between felt that you know if you're going to the internal cone polling which I'm sure as being done by the\nCampaigns you would have the better\nYou know a better guess at that right yeah it it gets here it is a a a Dems mid term advantage narrows among registered voters yeah my new national poll a few weeks before the midterm election shows the chances\nOf a blue wave are far from a slam dunk for the Democrats the NBC Wall Street Journal poll released a Sunday shows forty eight percent of registered voters\nWould prefer having Democrats in control of Congress compared to forty one percent supporting the GOP these seven point gap is narrowing from a ... point gap the Democrats had in September I don't know if that tells you anything though\nWell and and again I mean registered voters ... we've got to talk about likely voters and then again what the motivation is on election day this we've been talking about this it has changed since the Kavanaugh's confirmation leading up to and since I don't know to what extent\nI Can't tell you it's motivated the left or the right more we do know there is no doubt the rights is motivated Republicans are motivated right now are they more motivated than Democrats I Can't tell you that\nI I watch it on the might call before we started talking about you know the the whole Russian collusion at the top of the hour and I say that because\nMy was not driven to call based on what we had said and therefore he you know became passionate about giving his point of view across my called with that passion about the Russian\nCollusion investigation and his anger and his feeling that this could possibly changed the election you know and and moving to the Republicans before we ever started talking about I think that's important\nBecause I don't find many people like Mike ... I don't think honestly\nNow we covered everything when it comes to the whole Russia inclusion from day one and we've asked every question known to man kind of we do think that we have looked at more\nOr as investigators in partisan\nAnd we believe that hey that with everything going on and with the Pfizer warrant in and and everything there that we are going to find out\nThat probably the Democrats were up to a lot more ... than the Republicans ever dreamed of actually doing it as we know already the only evidence including with the Russians in any way directly or indirectly would be the DNC and the Hillary campaign to\nGiving the money to uh Perkins gave it to a fusion GPS and gave it to the former spy Christopher Steele who said he got his information his salacious on verified information or I or against Donald Trump from people close to the ...\nHe said he got his information his salacious on verified information or I or against Donald Trump from people close to the Kremlin right so the only people that colluded any way with the Russians were the Democrats from the information that we have\nAt this particular point but I don't think right now that's driving anybody to go to the polls\nNo it really isn't um it it could it is\nIt an underlying factor as a part of the larger I guess scenario with Republicans or conservatives\nAre based on following you know the work of of many really great reporters who who really brought to light so many things in this thing if you really followed it\nBut you could it be there again is that underlying motivator that's I don't think that's the big push right now I don't think that's the big emotion nothing right now um I Do think there's something to the the the fact that\nThey then alleging all of this sense you know a after the election and since certainly he's become president uh and they never showed anything for it and and it's really been this media circus and it's really based on nothing\nI think that's a motivator but it's not what I don't think it's the here and now I don't I don't see it\nI look I I think that there are some people that have looked over the last couple of years and what the Democrats have done and they have included\nA ... in its in its contacts the whole Russian collusion thing and how unfair they believe it is and maybe that's partly what's driving them to the polls but the difference that we've seen over the last month in the energy level or what are they called the excitement level of Republican voters to come out\nWhich would make the difference\nIn keeping the house and increasing the number in the Senate none of that has to do with Russian collusion right or the mall or investigation at All right not\nAnd see I don't know what a a a ... report does the if the if the report from last week is true that says the that Mueller would would uh issue the core of his report after the midterm right after the mid term\nI I don't know what that does politically because first of all how can it be an accurate report without including the fact\nThat of how all this information was obtained and what you just spelled out not us that direct line that we know that no one has disputed between the DNC and the Hillary campaign and ultimately Christopher Steele\nYou can't you can't debate you and you can't you can't let out a report I don't do it it's incomplete um what I Know what the report right now it's not going to even talk about that in and that's that's the whole point it's like a ... but it's not even going to talk about the possibility of Trump clued in with the Russians I I just\nBecause where where it would be the evidence if there is not going to be an a movement on a dime\nIf it is just to report a chrysalis over at CNN a former Washington Post I write it you know where he said you know I think it's ... it's ultimately going to be just a just a report he's been saying that for a while\nIt's it's ultimately just got to be a reporter is really not going to be any more indictments unless maybe there's a you know lying to investigators charge somewhere else along the lines\nAnd and we've got what are the Michael Flynn hearing\nAnd everything else of us probably will never see this ...\nRight because it and that will be a complete does that it'll just happening right it's it's\n\nBecause it and that will be a complete does that it'll just happening right it's it's another dilemma done the last two years yet accusations got just as an owner\nExcept for the fact that you have the I. G. working on some information of what was going on at the department of justice\nDuring that time based on what the president and the White House sent to Mr Horwitz and we've been asking this where I still haven't seen anybody else asked what ... what we asked why would the White House said it to the inspector general ... we're talking about the\nBad as the ... that is the most interesting mystery that exist right now in Washington DC and nobody is talking about is asking the question what do you start out by the way on vacation I owed everywhere nobody is talking about talking about and we said it when it happened we said wise you send it into the ... the only reason you some of the ideas because\nYou suspect corruption why are there no leaks on this why is nothing coming out on the story at All right\nWhen red and people have just a refresher when rubber when President Trump said he's going to declassify\n... the ... the application and other emails that were sent between the FBI and the department of justice rules to Twenty one different pages but ah and then it came out well he\nUh uh we have some allies that don't want us to ah you know released it there it might be some sensitive information so we're going to send it to the inspector general to look at it and expedite\nWhatever that are meant hoard yeah expedite a report out of and we said well why would you give it to the I. G. I. G. is nothing to do with whether you should release it\nOh corruption and how how to our allies know what would be in\nHow our allies know what's in it and what's not in it how could they object either way because they don't so why are you studying the I.
