was going on ...\nOn the little mind I Can't figure out the connection but I'm sure well\nI it's not I I could do it\nAnd the thing is I ... now that I Would want to do something like that it's not a possibility it's not something I even ever thought of when I was young it's like before though doing what they do in the weather channel or being a meteorologist like bad which isn't the average meteorologist out there let's be honest I mean what they are they're\nFirst of all had no need for Hillary Clinton or or if they did and they look at what she said just a couple of days ago highly disagree with that kind of tactic and will use it but the problem is is that that's squeaky crybaby whining wheel\nIs always going to get the grease\nAnd that's where the cameras are that's where the social media is [noise]\nI I look at it and I think to myself that the reason and Benin talk radio twenty nine years and I believe right now for is insane as it seems to be out there I Know the flag that I get is extremely light\nI think probably people who've taken it to social media but I really believe that the point is\nIs not that are that are arguments had changed any or had become stronger we may ... and I think it should be called talk show host you learn\nHow to debate batter and put your points are for the better I think it's the fact that the opposition is completely and totally insane I mean right now they're just insane and so people you know they look and they say okay\nYou know we're what's what's McNamara saying today okay I disagree with that but ah he's not insane like they are over there I really think that's worth of a [laughter] when when you you know you if you're you're comparing and you're say okay what about ... what do I compare you too and\nWhen you see that the opposition\nIsn't articulating anything in any type of common sense or critical thinking fashion that I think more people are just open then to or an ... an agreement just agreement to\nAn opinion that they might not even agree with one hundred percent but they see that there's rational thought and critical thinking to it mhm\nRight well and and they and we and we do hear that from time to time\nBut I don't agree with everything but I yeah I understand how you get their central right mhm and we've had over the years we've had plenty of great discussions with Democrats liberals who call and want to have a sane discussion on the issues\nBut ...\nFew and far between if they exist at All right now because I don't know what they're looking at their party and asking well how do we actually win something and then move forward you think about the word progressive oh that's the whole idea right of taking the country to its ...\nNext stop that's a great point where they're still using progressive yeah I don't think so well you know that there's no way you can when they're saying get in your face and shot him out of the building that's progress the answer is it's not it's the opposite of progress\nI think the key is here is that it is the evidence the last couple of weeks and then what is just come to this week\nWith the proclamation that we're not going to be civil anymore right until we you know to win an until we win shows that they have come to the realization that they cannot defend their own arguments on the substance of the ideas they are lost\nAnd it's just pure range an emotion over what I don't know I Can't figure out a I tend to believe that we think in a in a in credit at a critical thinking way and they're just pure rage and emotion and there's

New York Times doing their old with Oceana college ... are you ready for some of these yeah what are we got record okay we gotta we gotta we gotta look a little over ... okay a\nTexas Senate guy from New York Times ... fifty two percent or work forty three wow\nAnd now that swing a has been a total of six points\nFor for Dean Heller in recent days this is why we talk about pre Kavanaugh posts Kavanaugh but especially the hearing and then you would look the hearing that entire week of discussion and and craziness\nAnd then the vote this last Saturday as you mentioned that's really the the period you want to look at and of course after that what changed if anything change the minds of a the voters and which voters which group the Democrats as you mentioned\nNot you can't find one that's getting a real bump but there are a couple of Republicans that seem to be getting something from it is enough to win is it long lasting will stay there until election day well keep in mind a couple of things first of all\nA within a couple of weeks you can start seeing early voting and those that are motivated will have it when you see early voting numbers are that are up that means people are really motivated and very anxious chomping at the bit to get out and vote\nNow and the the the New York times poll I guess we're still continuing their it's called allied poll another one in Texas right so they they start doing it again tomorrow but as of right now and that's the woman had Ted Cruz up by nine now using cruise up consistently uh you know in there and I\nLook I I still believe Texas has different animal and probably wouldn't be the same\nAs as other states I I Believe that\nThere are states I I Believe that that uh if curves wins it occurs wins by you know double figures yeah I think he would have always won by double figures irrespective of the cabin our race yeah I I just think Texas is a different animal than than other states are in a ...\nYou might want twenty sixteen he wanted to stay\nUm do you look at a also\nNow look there was a period a where especially ... right around the convention time [noise] plenty of people in the Republican Party didn't like Ted Cruz remember the uh there was he got voted right and and [laughter] and the word from Capitol Hill I mean he was being demonized by fellow Republicans\nAre at one point so this is someone attacked cruises someone who gets the benefit\nI think maybe\nA to a greater degree as than than others of the Republicans coming together after the capital thing when there's a juggling within the party than someone like Ted Cruz who's been criticized by his own party you know\nThe then he's going to get he's going to get that bump a little bit more or the benefit of that a little bit more uh than than others might\nSo I I'm it'll be interesting I think to to really watch this next three weeks three and a half\nWell yeah and and ... house races we can't tell because there's that you just look at it in the polling or they don't do a lot of polls for a lot of these house races and so you really don't have an indication now I'm sure inside their campaign they do\nBecause they're doing the inside the inside polling but you you know that's one of the complaints you and I were having to learn by our Mitchell meeting there are a little while ago saying ... really can't tell because the no polls in three weeks ... or no pay off in two weeks you look at the\nTop ... the number of districts right now that are that are classified as toss ups are categorized as toss ups thirty two according to our sleepy and they're not doing they don't do polls on the house seats as often as they do for the Senate seats\nAnd I have to wonder what has changed after the Kavanaugh hearing and confirmation vote and I have to wonder again in those districts\nKeep in mind a number of those districts or the race is is on\nTo fill the seat that someone has is leaving a Republican stepping out ah what does that mean is the makeup of that district changing and we look at Texas thirty two uh that is uh the uh\nPete Sessions or the the demographics in in his district are changing\nYou know um that's that's something that\nWell changes politics and it's much of that district is uh I think in fact I think all over this Dallas County and Dallas County has gone balloon and well\nGosh going back to a Obama in two thousand eight so for a decade or Hillary won in fact that district or buy a point and a half and I believe it was a so we'll see what you know what that means for Pete Sessions\nAs see right now is only a while and it was a poll in late September by one point\nHe's been you know he's been somebody who has been a a strong contender and years ago you would think well that's not going to change it does change in those districts when the demographics change I I'm\nYou know one of the things and and again you look for any type of barometer out there to see if you know the whole cabinet thing\nHad you know well what kind of it it's going to have an impact it's what kind of an impact is going to have ... and and uh I look at Montana for example in Jon Tester and I I guess Charlie Cook came out the other day and and uh also ... has now said it's a toss up our CPA says it's a toss up\nTester's been up uh in July was up by three in early September he was up by two by late September he was up\nBy four but that was latest poll ended nine twenty to write a at a up over Matt Rosendale the Republican challenger what happens in you know bad state as we get closer ah ah Jon Tester has never been over fifty percent\nIn any of the the polling or a he is he is just over the margin of error you know just slightly over in in his in his um\n[noise] a ... for example he was a plus for and that was a margin of three point seven margin of error and he was up by three that was march of two so he's over but now it's a\nSenate race listed as a toss up and the question is in a in a place like Montana\n\nWhere conservative politics still wins in the majority of Montana and after everything that we obscene and and not just cabinet but everything that's coming out now you know the Hillary videos getting played everywhere\nThey you know and but we played on yesterday show the comments\nI'm of the former attorney general mhm are being played you know a well if they go low will kick him from Eric Holder mhm they're being played ah the you know CBS News story I mean even the mainstream media picking up that\nDemocrats have said they're not going to take the high road instability now is there a politics of choice by the way had Sarah Palin said if they go low will kick him oh it would be the number one story and the mainstream media right\nSo you you see the strategy that they have\nWhich is not a strategy of expanding\nTheir base because it's not claiming you're going to be you know on civil claiming that\nIt claiming as we said during the whole cabinet thing 'cause this is what to me that was the big message it came out of it the ... the criticism that Democrats put on Republicans or anybody else\nThat didn't agree with them is if you if you believe in the mindset of due process and a presumption of innocence\nUrine enable is the ... you weren't able uh uh uh rapists and that's what you do ...\nThat's the message that they set out I I ...\nIf that's a great selling point in America today than we certainly are doomed yep if that if you believe that gives you an advantage and it does in an election then you're right we're heading down the wrong path I mean we are doomed as we've always doing away with civility\nWins in America\nIt will prove me right eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nGo for the Sixers Paul wrote a review

radio and he is our economy and I'm Jerry McNamara eight six six Ninety a run\nI coming up on the bottom of the hour we will talk to meteorologist a a Tom hale in case you're just tuning in right now are waking up\nA hurricane Michael is now a tropical storm a latest update was so about an hour and a half ago from the national Hurricane Center and a sixty mile an hour winds tropical storm now sixty mile an hour sustained winds and heading toward South Carolina\nYeah we'll hear from Tom uh his take on on uh the ... this historic storm as it came ashore but also what to expect in the coming days ah is ah the people in Georgia right now are feeling the wrath of\nTropical storm Michael all the entire state basically covered by that storm massive massive footprint\nAlso coming up and say about uh apparently the or the FBI getting that man who was going to build a bomb for election day ... and detonated in Washington it looks like they went to his house and found two hundred pounds you know found some kind of explosive device or was like two hundred pounds you know are you\nYou go back a day or two and listen to a Senator Rand Paul\nTalking about where the left is going and of course after his attack he knows all too well uh what people will do when they're politically motivated\nBut talks about the greater potential love them and he said he was concerned that there will be a ... there might be an assassination or ... or another attempted assassination or we go back to the um uh the the the ball field is shooting of ...\nA strength in terms of uh the when it goes back out over the water\nAnd reaches Ireland yeah yeah why some are so [laughter] yeah well ah\nTo our friends in Europe or you know um you can have and we hope you does that does that does that apply the water is warm enough that far north in the Atlantic to keep it going then yes no guy yeah wow yeah I did I just assume by the time we got ... probably be cool down so I was surprised to hear that but the outer still warming up yeah L and\nAnd and that's why we're having these storms or you know the the normal hurricane season ends at the beginning of November right and so at this point there's a reason to that extent this is the fourth\nMajor hurricane\nThat we've had in the month of October period\nAnd so yeah that's and that's simply a and it was unusual to have a major hurricane to begin with in October when you consider that there's been four of them total\nAnd and so and the last nine something that just sticks in my mind was and I can't remember which one of you said it well is it gonna kinda lose some power as it comes into shore and\nAnd I and my immediate reaction was no no [laughter]\nYeah yeah I can and you were right because I I'd asked that question which brings into another question that is just a just personal interest to me and and that is when you get it from ... you know turn ... tornadoes hurricanes get their energy from the warm water right\nRight yes All right so do does that mean that a hurricane like this doesn't then does it as a result that it's taking the energy from the water does the water actually cool down\nA yeah actually it does because what it does this causes a boiling um which by the way is a very bad thing if you like oysters\nAnd [laughter] just letting you know [laughter]\nNot a good or Easter season right\nI'd hate or the came in and Nineteen eighty five was the last storm that hit this area of Florida and and and came came in hold onto your hat\nAt Mexico beach wow the same place wow and for that entire year and I and I'm not sure it might have been longer than that it devastated the oyster crop of the Appalachian bay um you know ... right area\nWhile while in terms of the life of Michael you know from the time that it was officially a tropical storm too you know looking at the forecast as you mentioned a back out over water in the Atlantic\nOr is this going to be one of the longest living storms in terms of the the life this band the time that Michael is active\nUm no I don't think so you've you've stumped me on that one because we've got some that don't even make it here but for some reason they just spin around in the mid Atlantic right we're in the western Atlantic and so I've never I've never looked into that\nYeah yeah um it it just seems that a ... and you mentioned this earlier talking about you know we always often we'll talk about a storm the remnants of the remnants of and as you mentioned we this we're not going to get to that point in terms of it being overland here we're not going to talk about the remnants\nOf Michael it will be still tropical storm Michael overland\nYes it is to Charlotte to Raleigh and Norfolk\nYeah and that's where I Am concerned about a lot\nWhen it goes through no fault that whole area up there the Hampton Roads area you know that area just floods [noise] yeah and and so I mean we didn't talk about it a lot with Florence but it was flooding in Florence it was nothing compared to the flooding that was going on\nIn in in central North Carolina\nAnd so it never really picked up any news [noise] but when this goes over there I think we're going to hear a lot more about the Virginia beach Norfolk\nAnd Hampton Roads area as it probably exits somewhere right in that area and heads out into the end of the ocean and you know we haven't even touched on power outages right a power outages there's a there's a huge swath of it's gonna be\nFrom power outage outages from Columbia pretty much all the way up to the uh\nUh Virginia border to at least a pass Wilmington and and just where you start to get into the outer banks violence\nUm this is widespread power outages\nAnd then we also throw in here the tornadoes now the tornadoes are kind of different they are normally super cells so were you see the large cluster of thunderstorms which currently are moving their way across interstate twenty\nA heading toward Colombia and going through Augusta well that's not the likely place where you've got the heavy rain it's where the feeder bands that are probably fifty to a hundred\nThey fifty to a hundred miles further out where there's individual cells and as we start to get into the morning hours where we'll have an an uptick in the [noise]\nAh what's called the low level jetstream and wins and we get a little sunshine we're going to see some um some some possible super cells develop along in the ... and\nI'm a John ... touchdown and he said when you get the friction of the land and you get this massive fast rotating storm and it hits the land\nOr it kind of dragged to the bottom it creates wind shear and so the the the ah tornadoes are typically week they're F zero so the F ones\nAnd um and they're they're shallow they're short lived\nAnd um and they're commonly in the north east quadrant of the storm so if you cut the storm and four pieces you've got your your northeast your southeast you've got your south west northwest well the the the one that is closest to the ocean\nAnd the further north than the ... where we see these individual cells and feed her band stringing their way and and so that's the other area where we're going to be watching now yesterday we had a three tornadoes reported two in Georgia one in Florida [noise]\nUm along and near highway Seventy five as as the storm was moving its way through Panama City\nAnd northward toward Tallahassee inland and the main peninsula Florida that's where we saw those feeder bands coming in and we picked up the the the tornado activity but as as this entire system moves forward we've got these threats one\nOr the winds are going to topple trees trees are going to topple power lines\nA power lines means widespread power outages over the central sections of the Carolinas\nAnd possibly into a southern Virginia then we have flooding and that flooding is going to be a along and through Fayetteville to the west as we get up into the hill country I call it\nA rally and so forth that area is is is perfect for flash flooding because there's all kinds of ... and so forth hollers and that all creates its own issues the flash flooding and it doesn't take a lot of rain considering all the soaking it has had [noise]\nAnd and then\nBeyond the tree toppling the power outages and the tornados that that we have with this thing [noise] um you know it's a it's a pretty complete storm and it it has enough energy to maintain itself as a tropical storm until it gets out of here leaving Virginia Beach and heading for the uh [noise] hadn't for the other side of the pond\nWhile just incredible energy behind the storm and of course uh just unbelievable devastation in the wake of Michael ... and a much of that will still have to be assessed as the sun starts rise or in what is now that that path that the that Michael took\nA and I were just looking at at one website uh and and the power outages your\nReporting in the hundreds of thousands of course I've got seven hundred yeah are being affected here and they they said for some of them it could be weeks\nUh I I remember my ah my brother being affected they got to higher ground from their storm there on the Gulf Coast of Texas a and they went in they went inland but uh they couldn't go home for her it was a couple of weeks\nAnd before it was a couple of weeks just for them and that storm was into the size and and intensity that Michael was\nAnd so it could be weeks and weeks before some of these customers have a power again by coming up here and just a little while we're going to get back with you Tom we appreciate your time and I will talk more about what to expect from tropical storm Michael at the bottom of the next hour thank Utah\nLooking forward to a

hour on a hunch that are now down to a tropical storm flashed up they was that one\nI Am a the a sixty mile an hour consistent wind speed is what we had at that particular a point but it's still a well defined tropical storm over Georgia entering the south Carolina and will through the day go move up through North Carolina\nAnd parts of uh southeastern Virginia before it heads off\nOr in the Atlantic but ah as a time in both the John ... told us a earlier a ... and and they predicted this was a storm that was going to stay together it wasn't going to disperse and it looks like as we talk to Tom last hour he said all the way to Ireland\nUh yeah it's going to it's going to remain a that there's enough heat even in\nThe uh uh I guess central northern part of the Atlantic and there's

know we'll have the latest update coming up here in a little bit the other a big story a stock market down\nEight hundred and almost eight hundred and thirty two points uh yesterday looking at the

maybe a couple of hundred points to start to start the morning we'll start that will start down\nA variety of different things uh it was interesting 'cause I was thinking to myself I'm not really surprised by this\nAnd has written the wall Street Journal and said investors really weren't surprised\nBy this and I'm thinking okay well I don't put myself in their category\nBut just looking at everything that's that that has been going on things you know little signs out there that you and I talked about when you see the bond yields and you see what you know treasury bills we just happen to be talking about that last night right and and we were looking at that at how the the interest rate on treasury bills for the most part has doubled in a year\nThat's just in a year it has doubled that you know that means there's more money that the government has to pay out just\nOf or I guess getting close to the actual fall out of the subprime mess the fed was rising rights\nSo you have these these loans out there that were set to balloon and mature and as they were the rates were going up which meant when it jumped to that ultimate rate it was going to be much higher than expected\nWell when you had delinquency rates are as as they started to creep up and up the forecast for that sky rocketed because of the rise in interest rates that was ultimately going to do those homeowners it was clear well if they can't keep up right now\nWell then what had balloons out with even a higher rate to a higher rate than uh than they had expected and plan for well all bets are off it's just not going to happen and that's that's part of that was part of the dynamics in place\nWell what you have here is you know uh the basically the fed going in and the the point Kramer was making is that\nIt was not Jim Kramer at CNBC in the street dot com was that he wants a more regimented and he wants them to do the homework on the economy he feels that the fed is not doing their homework\nAnd they should review the data because to his point what do we know about the fallout from terrorists what do we know about a\nLong term effect uh you know where you have the PG saying you know part of the the um\nThe demand for from China has softened greatly and so part of their problem was not just the the the cost of materials and freight\nWell or that but that that's an intermission from the administration that the economy isn't expanding as quickly as they fight as they're selling and therefore we can't raise the interest rates in a way that's politically that's an admission that it's not going as good as it should\nRight because if you are saying that you're raising interest rates um and it is regimented and and really has\nA you know a ... ... if your point is a ... and the administration that they should wait you know Jim Kramer saying it is one thing but at the point is being made that the the feds don't need to raise rates right now well you\nAre admitting you're saying that our policy is also affecting you have to admit that any policy by any governing entity is is affecting negatively right terrorists or whatever it might be like ... ... ... regulation\nAnd taxes because that's what a tariff it doesn't matter whether you call it a terror for an income tax whatever if your tax if you're raising the cost of doing business it's always going to hurt well and and that will see in the\nComing days where where the market rebounds if they believe this has long lived if they if it's going to be long lived if if they believe that the administration is going to do an about face on terrorists and and and the tears even in the situation with China\nBecause it's it's affecting negatively way too many producers here in the U.S a than than the market will adjust accordingly but if we start seeing that uh that fear become the reality in the economic numbers than the market will also ... and the way a core if\nYou see positive news coming out of leadership in

you're you're talking about eleven twelve hundred points are and who knows what happened the rest of the you know the the date you never know\nOkay multiply that by two assuming there's only two people affected by every home and we know that numbers low and and here it already a one and a half million people already without power\nAnd that number is going to grow as it gets into the Carolinas and I think the next big numbers for power outages\nAre going to be in the Carolinas during Florence\nBetween the Carolinas they had over seven hundred and fifty thousand power outages and I think this is capable of of if not repeating it at least bringing in another four to five hundred thousand customers\nYeah and so we're going to get a will get over the two million mark on on people affected without any kind of power and then you have the question they were staging people for power in Pensacola and just draw circle around from Pensacola around this whole area\nA thousands of power of of trucks utility trucks right and they're going to go into the areas they can get into for so maybe the Carolinas and George and so forth are going to have a better shot at getting power even though they did stage I Believe the numbers\nThe number was up to Nineteen hundred dollar trucks uh around the uh Pensacola area around the panhandle and so\nYeah they're going to be working as hard as they possibly can but just the physical flooding an inundation and the damage and the debris is going to limit the time that it's going to take for them to get their power back so I still believe that\nThe landfall area the pan handle the took the greatest Bryant is going to have the longest period of time to restore power I mean [noise]\nFace it there's a lot of places they don't have to restore power to anymore but they still have to be able to\nAddress the power lines that went there\nSure dad the infrastructure itself has to be restored and and\nAs you mentioned there may not be a a customer are there any longer unfortunately but\nStill is a a a a an infrastructure because down that line of course there are other customers that that has to have to be\nA half to get that power and have it to restore the the if you look at uh the uh the impact there as it came ashore a hurricane Michael again one for the record books you and I ... I was asking you the question kind of put you on the spot last last hour but you\nYou actually answered it on the spot very well and and were corrected generally speaking talking about the longest lasting\nA hurricane and and I found a little data their weather dot com about ah this would be a our hurricane John back in Nineteen Ninety four which had a a thirty day run a this thing traveled in nearly eighty two hundred miles and all out in the Pacific\nAre affected Hawaii but then kept going and but ah roughly a thirty day run but I mean if you look at and you mentioned this earlier\nAnd it it is something to remind folks that are still in the path of Michael that\nTypically and very often we see a that a storm or or hurricane starts to fall apart overland and then we we hear words like the remnants of but there are no remnants then again this is a well formed a tropical storm a that is traveling uh right now headed for the Carolinas and wreaking havoc\nOn on Georgia and uh and then we'll go back out over the ocean ah we also\nWant to go or you name it extra tropical once it goes out over the ocean ... okay and and right\nIs it just oh longer in the it's no longer a tropical storm in the tropical zones or so forth and it's going to lose power to forty miles an hour and then it'll regain power and that regained power is considered extra tropical but it's\n... you're right in in nailing it here the it it may not be the thirty days storm that meanders out there and because it's making a good time but it's definitely covering a lot of terrain\nIt really is traveling in the end and speaking of traveling for those professional drivers out there and the high profile trucks I Know that ah that ah Jon Traub mentioned this earlier it bears repeating for those truck drivers that\nAre and they know if they're seizing driver they know\nA that those those are the those sustained wins a the ... whether it's hurricane force even tropical storm force\nCan turn one of those trucks over that can happen very easily and we're not even talking about the gusts or as you mentioned the the threat of the tornadoes there those sustained winds at forty forty five miles an hour\nCan wreak havoc on those high profile vehicles there along Ninety five and as you mentioned we're going to see kind of that route over the next day or so uh with with Michael it will kind of ... I guess a Ninety five in a way a so those traveling along nine to five need to be aware of that\nAnd if I Need to be aware of that uh because that as a main quarter of course between of Florida and New York well and um\nAnd then go ahead to some ... some degree they're going to have the stuff that they are back in the wins and so that the the\nProbably my biggest concern would be three eighty five or twenty uh although right now it's moving across twenty with very heavy rain in Augusta\nAnd but there are a number of those roads forty as another one going up into Raleigh Durham Seventy four that comes out of Wilmington heads to Charlotte every one of those crossroads the ... I don't have a number four but the one from Wilmington\nThat that goes into Seventy seven through Florence all of those east west roads are going to have cross wins\nRight yes Tom where does this go on the record books\nUh it goes in the record books as the number three\nA storm to hit the United states while a and it it and it goes in the record book primarily because of intensity or low pressure at at nine Nineteen Miller bars\nUm just beyond that position number four and the record book happens to be Katrina\nSurprisingly enough and then behind that cat five Andrew is number five in the record book but what I found really intriguing and we talked about this yesterday about a continuing to grow as it moved its way ensure mhm atmosphere was perfect not\nIn the last hour it dropped from nine twenty two to\nNine Nineteen and it was deep and in an intensifying even as it was starting to come on shore wow I haven't seen that that I haven't seen that much of a change to begin with a three meal a bar drop\n'em and at the same time it went from one hundred and fifty\nAnd a ... and that's what I found when I when I woke up from my nap after the the morning\nShow [laughter] Florida higher up out of [laughter] a hundred and fifty yeah why\nAnd then it jumped to a hundred and fifty five yeah now the ten I'm as Kendall Airforce base yes right and\nA ten dollar has a radar and that radar was quick read as it was coming ashore at um I Believe it was clear read at five thousand feet or four thousand feet wind speed wind speed there are a hundred and Seventy seven miles now\nNow now that doesn't translate to the surface but\nIt obviously um there were probably that were easily go over a hundred and thirty miles an hour in this particular storm that made it down to the surface\nBut that's just to give me an idea how powerful this thing is and again I have to thank all the people who weren't went out there and report it uncovered this um\nAnd and I saw a much more professional manner of them covering it this time you know you may have noticed everybody in the weather channel that was out there\nHad to had their hand held Anna monitors this time ... right yeah they didn't want to have anybody walking behind them with a grocery cart\nYeah [laughter] yeah the kind of ruined the drama if you will um God yeah [laughter] you know and and that's you know if you look at this ... a storm eight carried on it carried all of its drama Michael came with his own\nWith his own drama or it was there was plenty of it you didn't have to go [noise] make anything of it
