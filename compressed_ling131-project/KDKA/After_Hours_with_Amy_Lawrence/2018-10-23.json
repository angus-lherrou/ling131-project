simply by claiming simply by claiming can belong to any protected group there are no protected\nAnd and so we you know and it's not a pop but back then it wasn't a popular opinion to haul no river grand sized for that but what do you mean corporation yeah\nPeople in ... you may not like it but yeah people well why should why should they have it because\nTheir goal is to make money and the matter what their goal is are are they stealing or ah right they still need for money right a a buddy ... ale colonial because it was it was it was coupled\n[laughter] and I don't know I mean that's okay [laughter] it's real bad you know [laughter] but the but the thing is is that um the the\nIt was it was part of the whole well there's too much money in politics\n[noise] ah oh who's the guy that was on um he used to be on CNBC then he went over to MSNBC or Dylan Ratigan you know that was his ... and he you know have had the fake anger thing going on\nBut we said look breakfast out of work do you know what I'll break it down to two words oh Casio Cortez\nShe spent next to nothing compared to her opponent Hillary want Hillary didn't win right\nBut I Know but nobody in the life really has complained about money in politics right since ... Hillary's it was funny 'cause some I saw that on social media somebody said Trump won because of the money in and said mom you know\nHillary raised more money and then they just shut up they were quiet life right a look at look at ah look Democrats don't complain about money in politics them if they're raising the money you see that in the exact no nobody's complaining about\nNot I've not heard one Democrat come out and say it's just wrong but Robert Francis or Rourke is raising on President did money pursue it right now in fact it's quite the opposite they're they're promoting the idea you have sons is a good thing\nSo when that started coming out and that was McCain ... but you know that was McCain fined gold and and that's when the rules and regulations came out as two groups of people that\nCouldn't that couldn't run advertising or you know within most at sixty days of of an election I Believe ... sixty days within an election because it might influence an election\nRight well that's the only reason you run ads is to influence an election and the reason you run ads close to an election is to influence an election and at that point we just said do these people understand\nHow the country was formed do they understand about the partition of government for redress of grievances irrespective of who that group is do they actually understand that and clearly they didn't want to understand\nIt so we said this back going back ten Fifteen when you when I started working together\nSo going back Thirteen an hour or maybe almost Thirteen and a half years ago right when you and I got together and I know we were saying that beforehand ... but it's like we said we don't believe in the first amendment you don't believe in the second amendment\nAnd so that's grown and grown and grown and grown and grown and since that time we have said look if you don't believe in these major tenants of the constitution and the United states you actually don't believe in the United states right\nAnd now we're to the point here where they don't believe in the Senate they don't believe in the the bad well the what was it came out said that the presidency was adequate yeah that was a few weeks ago\nRight and now we're to the point here where they don't believe in the Senate they don't believe in the the ... well the was it came out said that the presidency was adequate\nYeah that was a few weeks ago was that that was Michael Moore what's it Michael Moore so it was somebody in that same it was the same time well no it was at the same time when he said it's over that the ... century essentially to the office of the president of the United states you know it's over this is you know it's it's now gone it's\nAnd then someone in that same period and said we we need to do away with the presidency\nAltogether right and so but we've heard the electoral college just to go now it's the Senate that has to go right that's being picked up by more on the left every single day if you go to social media oh it's just not fair that set it needs to go\nSenate needs to go to and as we've said that is extremely important because if you do understand the constitution which unfortunately\nThe majority of America does not ... if you've seen the polls a majority of Americans can't tell you what the three branches of government are they can't tell you what the rights are in the first amendment to the constitution they don't know they a lot of them don't care\nBut the majority of Americans don't know according to the polls and when it comes to this you know the separation of powers the three branches of government that's the vast\nMajority of Americans can't tell you that well then you don't even know how our country works which I then we have stated we understand why people say the country isn't exceptional you don't even know what makes us exceptional right or\nIf you believe that the Senate shouldn't be gone if you believe that the electro college should be gone you don't understand the basis of what this how this country was formed but it wasn't that that it wasn't on a pure democracy\nIt was on a representative government we're the minority would be protected were individual rights would be protected something that the left used to understand and promote\nAnd now they don't care as long as it's as long as it's they they don't care to protect the minority as long as it's the minority that they don't care about [laughter] or they don't care about individual rights as long as it's individual rights of people they don't care about it and but when you get down to it it's a\nClear under a not understanding of how the country was form so\nWe have said that that's a huge issue for many conservatives because they do understand the constitution and they understand everything that we just talked about right now and that has energized them to go out and vote so beyond just because\nThe Democrats were against a nominee that Trump picked because Kavanaugh went way beyond Trump that's why you had the conservatives who are never Trump hers come most of them [laughter] not all most of them uh uh come aboard at that time and that's why we've seen I I Believe in more United\nA Republican or Republican Party so you can look at that you can look at some of that may be driven by the fact that look we're concerned about the house because the whole Russia investigation goes away if we lose the house and uh also when it comes to judges the fact that if they win the Senate\nOr ... and Trump has another chance to get another judge in maybe in the next couple of years and that would be unprecedented because conservatives understand that if you can have a construction is cord and you can have\nOf not only a five to four but it's six to three ... that that can move the country in the right direction for the next generation and that's extremely important the other thing is and this is new and it's the caravan\nSure and it's it's interesting too is that if you you mentioned it earlier but it bears repeating here they even if the care of and and it likely won't reach the border before election day two weeks from today\nThat the news cycle is what's keeping that story there and and we've talked often about how the news cycle you know\nNews cycle is what's keeping that story there and and we've talked often about how the news cycle you know changes so not drastically but so often\nUm and the because the protests by the left is one thing even even during the Kavanaugh a confirmation process itself what was the first protest all those documents remember\nWe need to be able to agree we need time view that that was their first protest was that it became about Dr Ford but we said after he's confirmed whatever happens in you know we didn't make it a a production but if he's confirmed on on Saturday through the vote this was before the confirmation vote\nThen on Monday is they'll move on to something else as they did because it it but there is there is at the point being there is a new protest and new hot button or\nAlmost daily but certainly a couple of new ones every week so we got two weeks left so you've got the care of and that's that right now is new but that goes back\n... if you ... I guess this adds onto a consistent issue that's been around for a long time but the Republicans thanks to this current president when he was campaigning for president\nOh and\nIf you think about it you know everybody talking about the conspiracy theory and who's paying for it and who's not paying for it it is working for the right it is a motivator for people on the right to get out and protect because if he needs money for the wall\nHe needs to house the president if he's going to get money for the wall he's going to need the house right\nAnd and so to me this has been a huge motivating factor and\nI saw the other day that after ah the the illegal immigrant caravan them which is to get into the United states from Honduras that they walked about nine hours right well at that and and blisters and they were going to rest her while mhm well at this pace they won't get to the United states for a month\nRight so ah you know if that was the pace that they are are are going at as to you know who was supporting them you've got you know the right wing website stating far right wing website stating that it's you know ... groups you of the wall Street Journal\nSaid in you know basically they're not sure they talk about the leftist politician and Honduras that organized system started it\nAnd then they were surprised how quickly or the number of people got aboard they talk about people without frontiers\nThe U.S Mexico a group that has been got involved in it who directly is giving the money nobody is really sure here at this\nUh particular moment yeah a lot of these groups are have funding in the past from folks on the left including Charles but whether they have directly given the money or not who knows right but the fact is if they are right now it's working against them will have some audio coming up here and just a little bit actually from the view right right which was a really good from a from Meghan McCain talking about it\nAll coming up plus your calls and comments eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nBucks more red are ready to do with a record ...

yesterday would shows Republicans\nAre in most states are that they have ah a surveyed in seven of those states with a close Senate races favoring the Republicans right now one of the reasons why you know the one issue is that Democrats are using that they believe is in their favor ... what's the one issue Democrats are using right now against Republicans\nAnd it's the one that we said they would we said you've got to either do nothing or do something but if you or or complete the task because if you don't do it and you do it half posterior the Democrats will use it against you when premiums skyrocket\nCome down temper and October ... as they now refer to what Trump care mhm\nThat's the one thing that they believe that's the one thing in the polls that the Republicans are way behind that the people believe that the Democrats will do a better job they do not allow the Republicans on healthcare yeah as we said would happen\nYou saw Schumer was a it was a a few weeks ago uh well it was actually it was right after the Kavanaugh confirmations\nWhere they talked about their their focus was going to be healthier 'cause obviously there are internal we're showing you know this is where we get a win on an issue but what's their answer to healthcare which Medicare for everyone Medicare reform right well we can't buy for Medicare\nFor some by the by the way it's complete Medicare where everything is taken care of ... which we can't even do for the senior citizen who put in for Medicare for their entire lives rented still doesn't cover everything right and they're promoting the fact that we can a Medicare covering everything for everybody twenty four seven for the rest of their lives are\nReally now mhm\nWe can't even do it for senior citizens who put in Port their entire working

[noise] we can we can go into um I don't know how many trillions of dollars of debt\nHundreds of trillions of dollars the ... the only thing right now I think the Democrats could have focused on it if they didn't go crazy over Kavanaugh if that hadn't happened they might have been able to use that as a wet ... that's a good point to take the Senate for video road log here is your forecast\nPool of cold air from Canada has descended on the central us mainly the northern plains and the central plains as we get into the day today will only see a highs being Indianapolis for instance of fifty six\nBut I don't know that you know I'd I Would go in this direction I mean the first thing I Would do I mean naturally for me it would be if I couldn't solve and it was really becoming a problem because it it it would become a medical issue at some point then I Would go to my doctor that would be\nRight as mine ... and now you may spend a lot of money at your doctor ah you know and I understand people not wanting to have well I don't want the chemicals or or this to to go to sleep but\nThat's something I Would discuss with my doctor even sell you know okay let's not do the pills or whatever let's what can I Do what do you recommend I I I don't know that I Would go into the for me I Would want medical experience first if I'm going to turn to somebody you know\nYou know for for me it's really interesting and and I've been blessed that I've really never had major sleep problems at all ... and and I feel blessed because of it but I Know as as I was telling me ... or are we just today the last week\nI still can't get on a regular schedule where you sleep you know really one time of day who the day shift so tough now I'm back on this ship sleeping twice a day 'cause that's what I did when I came on the ship and I you remember I just said I'm going to you know I couldn't\nI was trying to figure out okay what time can I sleep well I Can't do that with my body my body tells you when it's time to sleep yeah and and I'm Glad that I can pick up on what my body tells me that\nWhat time can I sleep well I Can't do that with my body my body tells you when it's time to sleep yeah and and I'm Glad that I can pick up on what my body tells me that because it's twice a day I go home and I go to sleep and and and then I sleep again at about five to six o'clock when my body gets tired\nAnd you know I mean you know what a disciplinarian I Am at that people that know me and to know me and my whole life said you really became disciplined I mean you have to sleep during those times and I said if I don't it throws up my tier mind my mind is gone if I don't\nIf I don't do it but because I'm a because I'm On that schedule rarely do I ever\nHave to you know take even anything over the counter ... anymore I I was for a little while they're taking the melatonin maybe once in a while and\nSometimes on weekends I may have to take a little bit of it because my I changed my my sleep pattern but that's even rarer now I've decided no just sleep and if you wake up in the middle and I get up you know do some stuff for an hour and I go back to sleep and it was my ... my my dentist my uh who\nAre asleep therapist who who uh said when I told him I scheduled because he was always concern as my dentist is there was also went to sleep therapy\nAnd I told him I scheduling what oh she's asleep twice a day goes ... that's how the basically the caveman used to do it gave me to go to sleep like seven o'clock there was no TV they went to sleep seven eight o'clock\nThey woke up and midnight one o'clock and set up for a couple of hours him back to sleep again that's how human beings used to do it ... you said so you're basically into it and he said do you\nFind many problems and I haven't had any problems no type of medical problems but to me the only thing that really insurers\nAre that I I mean it it's almost said I Do have to I Do have to work out almost every day ... working out does make a difference for me ... tiring out my body does make a difference doing physical activity\nI'm having trouble uh getting to sleep I have trouble finding\nThe time I mean my my wife was so busy it ... it literally is a around the clock you know huge family or other business aside from you know there's a and and then of course a lot of the stuff pertaining to to this\nYeah but it is but I've known your long enough you can operate without sleep I can yeah yeah well I Do not my\n... and point I was up to a um a Sunday Morning and uh up until a almost one PM\nOn Monday a afternoon that's when I went to bed Monday afternoon I got up at six thirty and then went back to bed for another Ninety minutes as\nI can I can I've known your long enough to know that you can operate with sleep your brain still works my brain does not work yeah the same at all if I if if I don't sleep crack heads is so tough for me to to to do that so I guess as well and\nFor the same thing I mean my allergy well yeah and and for me it's the same thing it is also too about the exercise and diet and everything else because had I during that time I mean you know where the where the big family wedding on Sunday and I was I mean I was there until I was the last one here at night falls closing\nUp a venue and and uh and and clearing everything out a loading out\nA but\nHad I had a well a piece of wedding that's that sugar [laughter] and you know what I mean and and you have to know that I mean everybody was looking at me strange we although I did I take some home\nAnd I had some Monday morning you know when I when when it was time and I knew that wouldn't be that wouldn't cause me any any problems\nBut you you have to do that and it also has to include like for me to the difference when people I Know people that can like drink coffee\nProblems but you you have to do that and it also has to include like for me to the difference with people I Know people that can like drink coffee you know full strength coffee and have no issues um it's you know comedians and cars getting coffee\nIt's amazing to see Jerry Seinfeld loves coffee and he talks about these they drink you know it looks like he's drinking at least two or three cups\nIf I had two or three cups of coffee and a day well then that would be no but I just couldn't I couldn't do that I can drink a total of maybe one and I'm good but\nThe I have to know the the point being is I have to know that I've got to keep exercising I the diet it's got to be right especially during those times when I'm not going to get that sleep\nI'm going to have to really mind my piece in Houston and lots of water or\nThe insomnia thing I've I've been there\nUm and and maybe it's because I'm aging I it's not about insomnia for me it's about schedule a typically in the air lately it has not been this this past weekend was a total anomaly\nBut typically it has been here lately you know getting to bed a and getting a good seven hours of sleep on the average um and I I Do notice the difference in that it does it is you are a especially physically you're you're better\nYou or\nMentally your your better I mean this has been a big issue for truck drivers for a long time because there is ours a service that regulate the drivers and\nAnd a lot of changes to those hours of service going back to well gosh going back of the Fifteen Years and and I like that I couldn't do it why couldn't do it it's a airline pilots and and you know they all go through they ... they all have their their hours of service\nYou know based on operating you know the the aircraft are operating the big rig and I for me I don't know how someone could sleep in a you know in the cab of a truck for me I ... and I I think I guess eventually I'd get used to it but\nBecause you've got to ... you got to create that sleep environment right or or ah people tell me though the same thing I don't know how you sleep during the day I don't know how you sleep all night um or or stay up all night and and sleep during the day but for twenty two years now I've been I've been doing that and it's it's perfectly normal\nI I don't see how people work on the rotating shifts my my dog ran my best friend's father was a cop yes\nYeah most of his career yeah he would work six weeks for ... yes than six weeks second ... life than six weeks third shift said that I don't know I don't know I don't know how we did that you can't get a routine down now you got to have your routine and that's the whole thing you've got to have your routine\nOr whatever that is uh that worked for you whatever works to get that sleep you've got to stick to that and that has to be disciplined\nAnd you know it's a habit that I\nI don't know if they still do that is in law enforcement down to me that ... that are well that would be an an alert as concerned yeah are you alert when you're out there well I knew and you've got to change sleep shift like yeah I Would be a ... total concerned yeah I have a friend who's been a prison guard for a long long time and that's that's kind of what they do they\nIt's called that's called shift work right where you're changing you know that that your routine\nAll the time my dad did that he he was talking to me about recent he said I I still don't know how you do this and I said well that is easier than what you described a back into your military days he would do that when he was a military police officer in the air force they would do shift work especially in the early days\nOr when he Rosen rank that you know changed he didn't have to do that but uh you know for the longest time they did the same thing\nIs uh when he Rosen rank that you know changed he didn't have to do that but uh you know for the longest time they did the same thing and uh as an MP and he said that was just for me he said that was just difficult it was impossible because you don't have a routine\nThe other thing I Can't do is on Sundays when I go back to my regular sleep shift yeah\nI get up at like five in the morning yeah I have to change it a little bit I pick it up so I'm tired by the time Sunday night comes around I go to sleep ... one thing I Can't do on Sundays Evers lift weights\nI lift weight in the Sunday I can now my muscles are too much stimulation ... on it that's the one thing I

welcome you're on running Radio Welcome to the show high [noise] yeah Hi\nI was watching a show or you were talking about Booker Harris and Booker\nYou know I was listening to show or you were talking about Booker Harrison Booker mhm yeah well they're they're trying to buy votes that's what it amounts to ... million by giving away at giving away the whole everything mhm they can buy their ...\n... well if they got married it could be president and first lady\nYou know I ah I doubt that's going to happen but clearly the it's always about buying the votes\nYeah do you want to give away something you promise something for free I mean back in the day Hugo Chavez in Venezuela\nIf you if you uh I don't remember Venezuela was a a a socialist nation now they're they're just uh the remnants of the socialist nation but in Venezuela they would send checks out in the mail before election day you know yeah it's always about well\nBuying live I I ... I think ... every every politician on boats on on both sides looks at people's self interest no way around it all depends what your self interested that's I've voted my self interest might I vote for my self interest me much might [laughter] much worse my\nIt paid well really didn't work out for me just laughed\nAnd why shouldn't we since we have to pay more under the Republican tax plan\nNo but what is my what is my bigger self interest\nMy mind bigger self interest and your bigger self interest is not what other people's self interest is my self interest is not getting free stuff\nNo my self interest is freedom well when we have the liberty of ... and and the ... of of our nation right that that's my number that's my self interest is a lot so people vote for their self interest all the time for other people's self interest is give me free stuff mhm\nThat's not my first self interest because I Know that it's a bogus concept I Know that it doesn't work I Know that it doesn't solve the problems\nThat they claim that they're trying to cure and so they're simply selling\nTo people who believe in don't care what the future may bring look we live in a nation that doesn't care about\nThe deficit or the debt either side now doesn't care about it it's completely and totally irresponsible both Republicans and Democrats don't care about the deficit don't care about the debt they don't care they don't care what it does to a future generation\nSo for for both sides now keeping the status quo of what we have today is extremely important sure\nKeeping the status quo of what we get from the government I Can't tell you when the banks were getting bail out how many people called up and said they shouldn't be bailing out the banks who should be bailing out me right also government's role is to give you money well from somebody out\nThat's where this shift was from you know a lot of people in fact that that said that they were either conservative or voted Republican and they were talking about saying it and it it it really was kind of this mentality that had been built through the media and also from Capitol Hill and\nAt that time uh you know at the uh the the end of the Bush presidency\nOr that the world is coming to an ad remember a McCain and Obama had to come off of the campaign trails to rush to the White House to save the world you know because the world is coming through that uh but the that that a a fear drove\nTo the White House to save the world you know because the world is coming through that uh but the that that a a fear drove a lot of people after the bailout started happening to say well listen you know that's going to happen then\nRight I Want mine so it became is almost the looting effect right the government money looting right idea I wouldn't mind if they if they're thrown out money throw it to me not throw bank right to throw it to me we were saying no throw at you know one\nRight and and that's because when government gets involved in every aspect of your life they become a ... and everybody understands us when you take it out of the partisan talk and you're talking about should we be run by a monopoly right sure healthcare system be run by a monopoly\nDemocrats used to be scared to death of a monopoly why because they understand the monopoly has complete control right therefore can can you know can do whatever they wish to do you know we live in a way we live in a a a a time\nThe reality of a political promise connecting with someone motivating them enough to vote for them\nThat's all that is that that's that's the only thing in this equation because you think about it oh wait a minute a you know a a Casio courthouses is promising or Kamala Harris was promising me this on the living wage right okay that's that's his or Ocasio Cortez is saying a will ah will will pay for college\nWhich would include your college you're existing college loan or in some cases right will pay off your college mom um\nThose are those can be retroactive or can be a future promise for people who are voting now not only if you're talking about the you know the people who might vote Democrat or or might be in the center are being independent and look at this idea and go well well well that could work\nOr does it really effectively work with their particular situation\nAnd then on top of that or does that interest me if if I'm really thinking about a generation who's having fewer kids\nThere's the book or plan even resonate with them we were kids I I Know what about me I'm not I don't I'm not worried about my children because I don't really\nPlan on having a family I'm giving my children the debt well yeah [laughter] I'm not going to have kids because it's too expensive even when you're fifty thousand dollar plan enough it's not enough so I'm not a oh\nWait a minute but\nThe thousand dollars doesn't help with raising my child now that's what I needed ... dollars a year that's exact and help with raising my child now that's\nBecause the idea is that we have you know we have too many kids in these poor families that by the time they're Eighteen they're a disadvantage to because they can't afford college or home and all this all these items\nWell no no no no no no you're you're not you're not trying to get the future vote of those kids who haven't been born yet you're trying to get there but you know would be parents votes right now and\nThey're thinking to themselves well no I've got a number of reasons why I don't want to have a family 'cause I Can't afford it you're not given ... so it's never going to\nBe All right so now I'm so Camilla Harris gets my vote because she's promised me six thousand dollars if she gets a lot and have it out with my kid exactly want ethnics thousand now and or\nBernie gives me or maybe Kamala Harris comes as onto it and says free college for everybody and she gets my vote too because she's going to include existing college loans and of course free healthcare yes Medicare fail to right yeah\nSo the what you can get me no ... or it and put out my kid you're several thousand I Know I'm not having kids ... thousand Eighteen years from now no and and my kid gets it I don't get ... no no I'd rather get the six thousand dollars now\nAll the way it will give me bolt will know give me the six to ... don't get me six thousand dollars give me Fifteen thousand dollars to raise my kids now right\nInstead of the fifty thousand dollars at my kid could use down the road right no I Want it now and gave me an now gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme that thing\nYou're not trying to get the vote of the the baby that's yet to be born you're trying to get the adult vote they don't care about the future\nThey care about now see they're not thinking we're ... we're trying to tell them Gary we can do the strategy for I don't know a couple of million apiece they're just not thinking you're either not going big enough or you're not going direct enough\nLet's go to William in Virginia William welcome you're on ...
