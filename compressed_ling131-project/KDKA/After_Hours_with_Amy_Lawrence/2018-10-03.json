on the boat talk and he remembered twenty seven years ago he put two and two together that I put him in jail for carrying a non law a weapon he could remember that he decided he needed to leave the group and come back home\nThe man remembered that because that was a defining moment in his lap and all I'm trying to say is this woman\nIf that had been such a defining moment in her life she she can remember that that was Kavanaugh one hundred percent on top of her she could not tell us how she got to the party how she got home\nAnd you know if it was such a defining moment in her life how did you get home where was this house that would be things you would think a person would remember if it's such a defining moment\nAnd now all of a sudden it's just last move the goalpost maybe she did maybe she didn't but this man has been nothing but exempt or his whole lab and part of the presumption of innocence to be just thrown out the window by the Democrats are just crazy to me\nYeah I mean that's part of the the weakness as we said nobody is just credible or non credible it see you have to take it you know based on the evidence that exists and their testimony and when the ... or in whether the testimony that they give especially when it comes to these witnesses notice they were there and when those witnesses or act in the ass and say\nTo see that you know what questions were asked\nUm and and again how the how the process on that level work I think that's fair\nYou know the thing is when you make an allegation you have to be willing to provide all the evidence that you have used to cooperate if you're allegation to begin which which is a lie detector test right if you don't and and nobody above it I'm sure somebody has brought that up but\nThat has to be brought up because just like the fact that when you used and said these are the witnesses these people witness it and they say no and then you say I took a polygraph a test will have you ever helped anybody else to take a polygraph test you know in in you know trying to beat is what they're trying to say\nNo I never did well when you get a sworn witness dating nope I Know she I I you know I Know she did well then you want all relevant notes\nBecause she is using the she is using the polygraph\nAs cooperation that there is credibility to our accusation therefore she should be willing to give everything over to the Senate Judiciary committee so they can verify is that the lie detector test was done in a legit way\nRight and and and that's again part of the process because if you believe it was legit you're promoting it as legitimate\nThen you have no problem you're telling the truth right and the process that part of the process was done thoroughly thoughtfully\nAnd in order to get the results that it was always going to get because she was always telling the truth\nRight her attorneys on Tuesday implored the FBI to enter\nHer and act on investigative leaves leads they have provided for its inquiry into sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh quotas is inconceivable that the FBI would conduct a thorough investigation of Dr Ford's allegations without interviewing her\nJudge Kavanaugh or the witnesses we have identified in the letters to you attorneys are Deborah cats and Michael Brown which wrote to top FBI officials in our letter obtained by political\nUh again it's not an investigation no this is the whole point in and look I even said that the other day I said well now that they're doing this you know they'll probably talk to her at the end and also ... wait a minute when I saw the story yesterday said wait a minute no they won't they won't they if they don't I understand why they would not\nBecause it's not they're not investigating the crime they're doing a background check on Kavanaugh\nAnd so what they're doing is they're not going after they're not from they may not be going to her or Kavanaugh to get their statements because they have their statements by the way\nThere is they don't get to know the the the attorneys her attorneys don't get to know who the who the FBI interviews or who they don't including people that they say they told\nThe FBI they directed they say they directed the FBI to interview other people associated with is the happy I may be doing that but the FBI doesn't have to contact her lawyers and confirmed that they're doing that right that this is not about her this is a background check on Capitol\nIt's about her claim\nBut she is not this is not about getting her any kind of justice she does there there is\nA no there is no right for them to be a part of the process for them to be\nIncluded or directing the process\nI Know they think that because they were able to manipulate Capitol Hill into giving them their day in front of the camera but that's not how it works with a background check process you may we may not ever know\nThe American people may not know cabinet or may not know who they talked to who they interview\nAnd and political here I'm renting from keeps using investigation it's not an investigation it's a background check as the timeframe for completion of the inquiry draws near Ford's attorney ... call later Tuesday with beer officials to discuss the investigation\nYou don't get to do that and it's not an investigation it's a background check\nAnd it's not about her it's not about Dr Ford it's not about it's about the claim but she does not there is no there is nothing they're going to deliver she's not going to get another day in court this this is not a criminal legal process she\nDoesn't get a copy of the background check up only the senators to that's right and uh as well while McConnell Bob and only centers will be able to look at the FBI's final\nUh findings ... minority leader Chuck Schumer pressed for the public release other redacted version of the report but Republicans are worried about breaking precedent by releasing such information they don't release information from a background\nWrite I write\nWhich can be made public available to the Senate the before the Senate votes this week I'm Kavanaugh's nomination according to GOP leaders all one hundred senators will have access to the report\nIn a secure set in after the FBI releases it as when he expects the report into multiple sexual misconduct claims against Kavanaugh to be completed his ... said I think it will be sooner than friday but I don't have\nAnd then friday but I don't have a an exact date by the way we will find out what's in it because you'll have a Democrat Senator I'm almost positive release something or half\nWhore a partial\nMartin of the transcript there would be damning mhm uh you know to a to a cabin off in the context of not the complete paragraph or sentence or whatever right uh and then it would force the Republicans to ah you know released a holding released the entire thing so um\n\nLet's see\n\nYeah I think you're going to see likely are either because if the investigation is as the report came out late in the day on Tuesday but the investigation is winding down\nThen by the way ... yes [laughter] thank you well know but we know but my point is well I was there the report but investigations are technically I was correct but yes as as the reports came out and that's that's exactly how everyone is raising it yes\nAnd ... joined it's a criminal investigation and it's not it's ... because that's what they wanted they wanted the criminal investigation\nThat was never going to happen it was never going to happen but keep in mind there they are they they were given a clear directive and and so on and in terms of the timeline you've got to get it done in seven days\nSo of course if it's done let's say the the interviews are done with a report still has to be written so imagine that the that that the interviews are are winding down now\nAnd and maybe only a few more to do on Wednesday then the paperwork has to be done to submit the report and that likely will take what I'm at least today\nAnd they all were then we went we we've been told that they can get it on the earliest today later on today\nYeah well if you have multiple people talking about it there would be one person one lead likely at the FBI that we'd compile all of what the different ages found because it's not just one agent and it's not just in one town in fact that they're doing these interviews\nSo it's it's all over the country depending on where those subjects of those interviews are but the point being is that it it's likely one lead that's going to compile all those and it's likely a series of reports of the interviews and that's\nIt would be a it would probably just be transcripts of the interview\nAnd and then a summary on each interview\nAnd then the the lead would be responsible for summarized in the entire report I guess I'm guessing\nIf you want to get in lines are open now eight six six Ninety right I\nAgree with what I

chess game and he's twenty moves to head up\nThere is going to be a terrible is going to get his his nomination okay I I honestly believe that but\nMore importantly right now they're talking about the

flash flood watches warnings what that's what we have over the next couple of days\nMhm it would not have been acceptable it would not have been acceptable\nFrom any previous Republican administration before this one as we talked about yesterday we talked about the trade deal to do the trade deal with Canada and Mexico and had the stipulation on the automobile companies like\nWe had that would have been absolutely unacceptable and we'll end and the debt and then what the project to the deficit yes a is somewhere around a trillion or ... or more you know when you look at that are over the is it over the next year I think in the next fiscal year um that wouldn't have been acceptable in fact I remember\nWhen Obama came in to to power came into the presidency he was talking about well I inherited that huge deficit remember that mhm which by the way we had to point out well you were actually a part of it 'cause you voted for that\nSeven hundred billion dollar package so you were part of that you didn't inherited you helped to make it happen it wouldn't have happened\nOr without the Democrats voting for it as well including him but the point being is that\nBack in two thousand this would have been you know early two thousand nine but two thousand nine they were talking about it even the Democrats were talking about it or the you know the now they were talking about it because they want them to put that on on George W. Bush\n\nAnd they wanted to you know they wanted him to own it completely because everything was Bush's fault remember but Robert\nRhinos rentals started before that but then ... rhinos became the swamp yes but rhinos in the swamp was when Paul Were really came to the fruition especially when\nMcConnell and banner they were saying weren't topping off in the bunch it's when you look at you know twenty twelve twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen the Republicans were furious and conservatives still had a solid hold\nOf the Republican Party that's gone\nIt's gone when that was it that uh that that that uh\nPaul Ryan proposed the balancing the budget and it would have taken until twenty thirty\nOh that that was a that would have been a forgetting that out that well that right now it would have been the it was the the summer of the the whole camp it was the summer when you know a of of ah twenty twelve okay it was the summer spring southern only get so it was before this one or two of election right yeah\nAll right so you have that scenario and he was called a radical you know for wanting to balance the budget by twenty thirty right\nI mean that was oh no no no that's that's unacceptable now we give the the president credit no in fact I I think it it falls on his shoulders the credit for getting the corporate tax rate down to Twenty one because\nYou and I thought that was never going to have right based on the rhinos on Capitol Hill and the fact that they couldn't get it\nDone right but but that tax cuts have never been the it's always been the spending ... rhino when the swamp had was always directed at the out of control spending in Washington and\nNot necessarily the belief in tax cuts and that was really I'm In my opinion drove the anger and created the rhino when the swamps the spending the spending ... from the the campaigning on twenty sixteen\n... no ... even earlier than that remember you know you and I sitting here late at night when ... came out and they were trying to shut down the government uh uh uh uh again in the shut down the shutdowns of never been about tax cuts the shutdowns have been about\nSpending and and when the Republicans wouldn't stand up to the Democrats you're right they were called ... recalled the swamp Trump was coming in to get rid of the swamp gas stop the spending to stop the sand and even going back to the the uh the school lunch program\nYou know and the rhinos back then going oh no we can't cut anything right on and so when you're that goes back he's so much for when you got twenty Fifteen\nAnd you know and and uh a banner was leaving and Ryan was coming in Bangor didn't like messy so he went to work for a tobacco company right and so Ryan came in and and ... remember that but the thing was that everybody expected Ryan Republicans\n... maybe it was unfair but it was what they expected of Brian was to redo the budget deal and when he said nope what's been done has done he\nWas automatically targeted oh yeah people were furious because ... they wanted him out of the speaker of these are the supporters of of the the the president back then Yuri as they wanted him out\nTrump's gotta Khamenei has got to clear the rhinos out the swamp out we've got to cut spending look where we are today and so there's been a huge evolution of the Republican Party\nIn in just a you know roughly a three year some pathway well remembered late\nGo back to twenty twelve why was Paul Ryan brought onto the Romney ticket for conservative street cred remember and the concern with Romney was that he was too much of a moderate and it was our final question to ah the light of Andrew Breitbart\nYou know why should if if he's the nominee 'cause it was that was still early but but if Romney's the nominee and it it looked at that point potentially he was going to you know the I think it it was pretty obvious by that point\nBut he was going to become the nominee but if he is why why should do back I'm In his answer basically which goes because Scott which wide awake rings so\nRight now does today as you thank you Andrew Breitbart for those words but I think it's important but yeah it's I mean look at history in and see what Ryan when swamp was about it wasn't about tax cuts was everything on ... being a rhino and being in a but now it's changed mhm but ...\nBut back three years ago yeah swamp ... state now but yeah a swamp is deep state a swamp is what's going on right now in the Senate Judiciary committee with the Democrats yeah it's sort of been moved over ... nobody's viewing McConnell right now\nAs part of the swamp well I don't think no ... Republican leadership right as part of the swap if they had done if they had spent and and agreed to a budget that they did this year and last year\n[laughter] three years ago\nThese are Trump supporters would have been absolutely up at arm's these guys gotta go not a peep right that shows you the evolution\nIt's look I'm not making a judgment here this is just an observation of where the Republican Party has gone you know or you know were against the spending but this is not about opinion I'm not criticizing this is just the analysis of what those terms meant back three years ago\nAnd the fact that the definition has about completely inside the Republican Party inside the Republican mindset and this is a Republican voter\nI don't necessarily blame those in Congress and even the president\nYou know when they talked about you were going to cut we're going to cut we're going to cut as to where they are today because they're simply reflecting where the Republican Party where the rank and file voter has gas\nIf there were pressure at their pressure right now on spending on Obamacare and all of it it would have been done all of that would have been done it would have been a priority\nAnd the president is not wrong for focusing on national security and and border control but it's part of the again where's the mindset of the voter that's the question the mindset of the voters that now we don't really want all of Obamacare to go away we just want the penalty to go away\nAnd we said look look look at the polling from five years ago\nOr until they were discussing it last year and you could see the I mean you could see the difference overwhelming yeah they were against Obamacare and then when it came to getting rid of Obamacare was the\nWe need to get rid of the taxes and the mandates and let the benefits we like yes well as long as as long as you're there you're never going to control spending ... ever and you're not going to control debt and that's where the mindset of the country is right now how you respond as a politician to that\nTo do the right thing and be fiscally responsible I don't think it's possible right now no because there was no bad there's no ... there was a small core as well what do we identify a senator and a half [laughter] yeah right that might be concerned about it\nAnd maybe twenty to thirty Republicans in Congress outside of that you you there's no base to even start from now the conservatives don't control the party you know\nEight six six Ninety read I\nRead a book with what I told him for his ... he wrote a [noise]\nJoin the conversation using the shell row tell a hotline eight six six nine zero seven three three three nights when I radio and shoveled tele making your hardworking journeys more manageable to keep you trucking cc are tires to serve\nAs dedicated providing high speed tire certain cutting edge to thousands of devoted service liquid over Fifteen hundred service try five minute alignment ...

warnings the biggest differences scale\nThe nationwide system is designed to blast a message to all two hundred and twenty five million smartphones in the United states reaching about Seventy five percent of the population news of the presidential alert test drew almost immediate criticism\nOn social media what some people vowing to turn off their phones believing wrongly that they will be a captive audience of president Donald Trump [laughter]\n\nSome were worried that the system would allow him to tweet every American mhm or text every American and it's a tweet here in the story yeah\nOr the federal emergency management agency ... and experts say the presidential alert will not be Trump's personal megaphone\nErudite [laughter] yeah but I don't [laughter]\n... they are a lot

it would be more efficient it would last her as the people can do other\nAs as we said with the you know the the on the uh the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada mhm\nAh by the president coming in and and and stayed in a that there has to be more American or should be more North American materials are in these in all the vehicles and all the three countries and setting labor standards and some wages in Mexico\nWhat you're doing is you're going to be driving out the lower uh the the the lower worker and expect to see a ton more automation coming to Mexico and the United states lowers your workers will be again right a lot lower overlooked lower skilled workers in the United states and Mexico will be overlooked\nAnd they're going to be looking to do whatever they possibly can because\nFewer cars will be sold because the price of cars because of the new trade deal will be going up in the United states Mexico and Canada and that that's not the only worry the other worry 'cause remember what the president said one of the presidents mangoes mango we talked about this yesterday\nWhich to have companies in the United states producing it here in selling it elsewhere\nWell by doing what he did you're going to get the opposite right there's going to be less of a chance of America being able to sell make cars here and sell them elsewhere and because of all the rules and regulations we'll put on cars in\nAll of North America and Canada and I have to say North America and then say Canada Mexico and not and the United states because they have\nChanged North America to that in the actual name of it\nAnd and so you know we discussed it a yesterday I ... the wall Street Journal and others you don't have that discussion saying look you're actually going to hurt\nCar production in the United states you're going to hurt lower skilled jobs especially in Mexico or there's something going to say fine you're gone automation you know automation a that comes in ... comes into this particular point and in the United states to and you're still not going to be able to defeat all the\nAll the cost of the regulation from government\nIn the new trade deal which means what there's less of a chance we can build automobiles here and sell them overseas which is exactly what the president wanted and now he's implemented a program that does exactly the opposite of what he claimed he wanted to begin with mhm that's the frustrating part and well and keep in mind in two\nThousand eight when the domestic auto makers were bleeding cash their their foreign arms their foreign business was what was keeping them alive\nYou you've you've now encouraged the foreign arms to say okay we're going to make them all over here ...\nAnd that was one of the president's number one complaints and so we implement something that will have the opposite effect mhm based on economics which is how people respond to incentive in disincentive ... not in my opinion how people respond

Ninety right I I think they may get Kavanaugh for\nPlagiarized being ripped a bitter Ginsburg yeah here it is a Justice Ginsburg not a hundred percent sober at the state of the union going back to the state of the union address back in\nOne was at twenty Fifteen was it as a few years ago where she fell asleep you know third or twenty Thirteen yeah ... when she uh she fell asleep the are just looking at the the article here and uh uh she didn't\nPass out she fell asleep right she didn't blackout right from drinking too much when she fell asleep\nSo that's mhm so did he go back to you know that that's what I'm Wondering whether he's plagiarized it took her excuse\nRight\nNow she caught them I'm Sorry that's how bad that's how bad it's God no no no no no that would be maybe a myth Ginsburg calls him ahead of the testimony and said\nLook just very simple you drink beer you fell asleep I Do with all the time I drink wine of fall asleep you don't blackout you fall asleep\nOr in the role in fifty two percent said there is bias the fact that you have sixty six percent\nOf American voters favor an investigation that means many that believe biased didn't play a role believe it should be investigated anyway\nYou're talking about again the independence there those are independent center saying okay I'm not sure maybe I don't think so but yeah I think an investigation should be done\nRight\nSo that sixty five percent of American of voters favor or that an investigation where we are right now\nThe FBI report could be released only to the Senate it will not be made public unless it's late uh [laughter] yeah excuse me it won't be made public until it leaks\nAnd then liberals will be screaming for transparency\nThe first time they've screamed transparency ah regarding the FBI and all I don't know roughly I'm just taking a gas the last couple of years or so\n\nUh you know it's interesting that seems like a after two years Americans are paying attention fell into the Russian investigation to sixty five percent of Americans mold\nA a you know believe that the investigation or you know into the FBI and department of justice or to see how the investigation started mhm uh is uh is warranted hey maybe there's a couple of Democrats and they're like we said they believed that Trump committed collusion\nAnd they want to find out where everyone and they're willing to release it to ... to ... that he committed maybe there's a couple of people in there that actually believe that\nWell I mean if you look at the number I mean that would go\nOr you know beyond that a typical party line number of just said well he you know of the people in the center being roughly wanting a the independence and then\nRepublicans being the other forty so\nThat goes to sixty five which means there's likely a cup a few Democrats are liberals mixed in that and\nWho knows why they want it but yeah maybe they think that it's going to show that he's guilty but we but we've been saying this it doesn't matter who's guilty of what what was done was done so somebody needs to be brought to justice there needs to be justice in this case but there can't be without transparent\nAnd by the way we pointed out again today because we haven't been able to uh we talked about it earlier because we received an email we talked about it we believe it was early last week\nAnd and this is the because we've been getting some questions say what happened to the whole Pfizer warrant a application and and and those Twenty one pages we're getting we're getting feedback from our listeners saying hey just disappeared for instance there's going to declassify to disappear and what happened nobody's talking about the story\nRight well we did a a early last week when we said 'cause we were sitting here on the air\nAnd the Kavanaugh thing was big at that point and we finally are guy just started talking about it casually\nOn the air and saying I mean what in the world why would you send it to the inspector general you know because what what what they're saying is okay ah there there may be some sensitive things are in here we have some of our allies or we're going to release it ah but ah we're\nA ... but we have some objection from our allies and we're going to send it the inspector general to go through this thing uh uh uh to go through the saying an expedited way and we went inspector general when he was about your general has nothing to do\nWith whether you're release something because it's sensitive top secret material that would be your director of national intelligence but that might be you might get advice from Mike Pompeo because it's former CIA director in talking about OK what our ally subject to which we heard was\nWas a Great Britain and an information on Christopher Steele that they didn't want released but we still started thinking to ourselves\nWait a minute why would it go to the inspector general inspector general ... we don't understand that doesn't make any sense he only investigates corruption oh\nYeah so in the un redacted version they have found information that they wish to give to the inspector general of the United states whose or ... the inspector general of the department of justice and whose job is to find corruption and abuses\nIn the department of justice\nBecause you look at that an aerial imagined that the okay so the president's reviewing that certainly uh you have Kelly in the room with him and then that advising as chief of staff where do you go with this I could see General Kelly looking does and and the president clearly looking at this going okay\nIf this is this massive abuse of power under the a ... in the ...\nA ... in the Obama administration if that is the case if we if we're seeing what we we think we see here than this actually will require Horwitz the inspector general to be involved I mean that's going to happen anyway right yes but\nYou take the politics out of it\nBecause you let the I. G. do all the investigation on it tell us what happened here because the I ... going to have access to records keep in mind what it was like for Republicans on oversight committees\nAnd really the White House the White House has been calling you know ... echoing a the the uh the the ... and and the death of a new noses of the world\nAnd calling for the release of those documents by the FBI well guess what the I. G. doesn't have to call for that yeah gee has access to it directly yep\nSo the I. G. takes this and the president because of the president comes out and says hey we we recognize abuse here we see this based on this\nUh on redacted material now from the Justice Department will that instantly becomes political especially with this president while the president has that authority to come out and announced that clearly and has the authority to declassify that that's not the issue\nYou take the politics part of it away and you also expedite the process of not just looking at these documents but the I. G. has access to everything in the department of justice\nAnd any kind of trail on devices and everything else that the president would ... ... ... it would it would take a million years for the president's call for that and for that to to be handed over\nAnd you take away from Adam Schiff the accusation that you're selectively yeah just declassified part of a life because when you give it to the inspector general he's going to cover that part of it okay what are you out of context of everything that you have released let's expand the investigation and all of a sudden\nEverybody went quiet and the interesting thing is we talked about\nUh uh that you know Deborah Nunez initially was asked about what's going on here I mean they they could have done this thing and why give it to the inspector general and then he's gone quiet and everybody has gone quiet on this\nYou hear nothing right and the media is not covering it really the mainstream media I haven't seen one story in the mainstream media about why did they give it to the inspector general\n\nWhy is the inspector general looking at all this they only he only looks at corruption right that's what he's still he's looking for corruption in the department of justice they redacted this and all of a sudden\nThey don't release it and it goes to the inspector general well did they find out that it's that the the redacted part is things that the inspector general is actually been looking at right now right\nAnd so it goes to it goes to either help assist in the investigation or the fact is he's got all this material has looked at it already\nAnd it's part of the when you talk about Russia probe Trump didn't say about Russia probe right which one which one because I read it and said oh Russia and pro which Russia probe\nWe initially thought you know could because I I'm On the one time they said well mothers in but there's this ... motors investigation right but on the tweet he said Russian probe right and I went oh that must have been Mueller investigation that [laughter] [laughter] right might not be you know\nThey may not be the investigation that they're talking about you did well my mother said Russian probe I'm like whoa now look at the pattern of ...\nNow look at the pattern of behavior in the in the entire history of this this whole thing starting in the beginning of twenty Seventeen right yeah what was that pattern of behavior leaked to the media how many of those leaks favored Trump\n... almost or maybe exactly zero zero\nSo you have this situation there are people on Capitol Hill and in the Justice Department that are not obviously not Trump on Trump's side\nIf if there's an redacted classified material had damaging\nInformation about Trump wouldn't we at least start hearing those types of rumors the sources say it's very damaging on Trump and if that were the case would he also turned it over to the inspector general if it were\n\nAmerican Chopper magazine is not
