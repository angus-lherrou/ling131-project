or on a I Choose a and Amazon are and we're going to be doing limited theatrical a releases we've done a screening in Washington DC that had attendance from\nEverybody from the White House to Capitol Hill a just a few days ago and we had another screening in New York or we starts out more around the country so you go to the website there'll be information there and you can sign up and get updates when it comes to your area but it'll be available shortly online both Amazon and I\nDo still get to have a Facebook page [laughter] well\nYou know it's interesting I'm a YouTube when we initially set up the trailer we actually had some glitches which we we have no reason to\nTo believe or to know that it was connected to the project itself but it does get one looking over their shoulder I mean what's interesting is uh Robert ... who's this a PHD used on always peer reviewed studies I'm actually did research um which demonstrated how Google could swing\nAn election uh well you know one direction or the other\nUh by shifting millions of vote spy controlling the information they got the Washington Post ran a story on this and the next day he was\nBlocked from Google you actually could not access Google products at all I'm a similar thing happened to a doctor Jordan Peterson who we highlight in the film you say a\nPsychology professor at the University of Toronto uh\nHe was actually a blocked by Google a from accessing his Gmail accounts and his Google Calendar and his YouTube channel which you know has millions of people that have downloaded his content\nSo it does happen to people or more often than you think and it just demonstrates the power that this company has to decide if their whim or how they are going to control what you see and what you have access to\nBut they don't play favorites well\nI mean that's why they claim right I mean I mean I I don't think that the example you just gave our our particularly noteworthy I mean there's sort of thing I I understand happens all the time and and and what the point being that that I I I just don't see how they can with a straight face claimed that they don't do this\nYou know that well that's exactly right and and one of the research studies that up Stein did that is particularly interesting we'd go to this in the in the film or is\nHum a is during the twenty sixteen election uh you they actually enlisted volunteers around the country this was a a you know John a a blind way\nUm but they basically enlisted volunteers and had them conduct searches um on both Google and bang\nAs it related to the twenty sixteen election this was over a five six month period\nAnd then they captured all the search results that people got now some of these volunteers were in red states where some were blue states some of the Republican somewhere Democrats independents all kinds of genders you know all kinds of social economic status\nAnd what they found when they reviewed the result was that you know things seem to be pretty balanced but Google in every single search position of the top ten search results\nThis the results favored\nHillary Clinton what they essentially did was they suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton and the feed and they pushed negative stories by Donald Trump\nIn the same search results um and you know by his estimate that this had a somewhat dramatic effect on the election now it didn't help the results at the end of the day um but ... contention is that Google was essentially\nSettling with the books and what's interesting about this is science essentially political but he actually was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty six teams are and what he is concerned about of course it's not the political implications of this in terms of who wins and who loses\nBut his real concern is do we really want to have a company\nHaving so much control over the flow of information that win undecided voters and you know there are a lot of undecided voters every election that when they start sort of going to the Google Search and saying which candidate should I vote for\nA and looking at the search results do we really want to have a company with the power to influence the outcome potentially of elections and that's what the real concern is here\nI think that's a pretty fair concern will take some calls for our guest Peter Schweitzer at the one eight six six five oh Jim boat one eight six six five oh five or six to six on the jumbo had a job when we come back in just a moment\nWe're sort of funny\nNo your ear you're exactly right um and if you think about all the sort of just Topeka knowledge or a novel about\nA totalitarianism it was all predicated on one thing Jim essentially the power of the state was going to smash in control people\nSo you know in Nineteen eighty four it's big brother and you have these you know large television screens or these voices that are sort of pumping information to us but it was visible it's kind of the you know the the\nThe clenched fist right in front of your face you know what we're facing now is not any kind of police state\nBut what we are facing is this ominous power that is trying to persuade us that is trying to steer us in a certain direction but we can't really see the fist\nBut it's still there and the power is still there and I think you're exactly right I mean imagine a ... imagine Mao or stolen or a Mussolini\nThat had this kind of control over the flow of information I mean we've given them an enormous power and Google basically tells us is trust us yeah trust us\nGeorge Orwell you had no idea how right you were to Linda in Champaign, Illinois hello Lyndon\nAllowed cam am I going to make a quick comment a lot of uh the believe that the party has been building a Nazi techno state with still going on Facebook and all these people but what I really called us asking that want to thank our guests for what he's been doing um about search engines\nAnd they're used to be I click which had a they they have another one called start paid for the same company but they got rid of ex click and that was if you didn't want to use Google result he wanted other resolve\nAnd I don't understand that Google suppress did they make them suppressing quicker what happened to it and I use that that go\nYeah no that's a great question I mean this is this is fascinating when you look at at at how Google operates in the space so look at apple for example apple has this search engine called safari\nBut safari is actually run by Google Search algorithm and you know why because Google pays apple nine billion dollars a year for the opportunity to run safari searches to think about that it's an apple product\nAnd Google is actually theoretically\nItaly doing apple a favor\nBy doing their searches but it's actually Google that's paying apple and why is that\nBecause they wanted the information and the data that comes from search results because they can monetize it and\nSell it to other people and this is what Google is doing everywhere and you're exactly right start page a is a a search engine you get great results they actually use Google algorithm they have an agreement with Google that allows them to allow the search is to go without\nData being president I think that is that is going to change eventually biggest star page is becoming more popular it was a deal struck a while ago Dr go is good\nIt's it's not as good as Google and that's part of the challenge part of the challenges the best search engine out there in terms of results ineffectiveness is Google\nBut the price that you pay is they collect all this information on you and they are prepared to use that information against you\nTo either steer you are manipulate you in a way for commercial gain or for other parts of their agenda and there really are not many great options out there um there's even you know discussions about the fact that\nThey which is the Microsoft products which is sort of the great rival\nTo Google a century and twenty six teams truck a commercial agreements a Microsoft and Google struck a commercial agreement we don't know exactly what that agreement is but um they essentially have stopped being so hostile to Google and a lot of people believe\nThat there is some kind of arrangement where they're doing a search they're cooperating and search so that's part of a challenge there really aren't that many great alternatives\nWe'll be back in the moment when you think about how students nation presented by liberty mutual insurance\nLiberty mutual customize
