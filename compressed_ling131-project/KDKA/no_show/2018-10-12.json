the years of one or a with some regularity the other one was a relatively new to me\nAnd we're going to be talking about that and the conclusions that have been reached by our guest Dr John Huber a clinical forensic psychologist and the chair of mainstream mental health Dr Huber thank you for being with us tonight\nWell thank you for having me on Jim I appreciate\nAll right the first one is a helicopter moms or or helicopter parents and I guess most of us understand it is a term or referencing parents who hover over their children and in essence won't let them make the mistakes necessary to grow up and become adults but that'd be a reasonable definition or would you meant that\nMuch but that's a pretty good definition and ah I think one of the things that that they learn is that somehow they are at the very least\nThey deserve things in life at because their parents did those types of things [noise]\nAll right uh ... that's something else that it it seems to be the\nLet the generation that has provided us with helicopter parents\nOr their parents as as a group probably would not really a about doing this sort of thing where they I mean ... it's hard for me to to think that a\nBit for this generation of a helicopter parents that we had a a generation before that have parents that are essentially provided the role model for these people uh it it seems to be that these people sort of sprung up uh uh on their own ended the whatever their influence may have been\nThat it was not entirely their parents because I I don't think that it goes back a that many generations does it\nWell a lot more parents are parents that are so much more a protective of their kids they make a lot more parents looked like like you know kindergarten versus college\nA lot more parents literally mowed down any obstacles any threats of confrontation any chance of failure for their kids which\nYou know a rational adult understands failure for children as a learning opportunity and teach you how to deal with loss and how to how to recover from that and build on your experiences and these kids are\nGetting much less of that than the helicopter kid from the helicopter\nSo it's getting worse it's helicopter parents on steroids\n... exactly\nWow All right let's let's talk some more about that in the company of among others that tonight to Don who calls him from Albany, Oregon and do what do they do and a good ... uh doing fine thank you\nYou're in great myself I just got to say the helicopter and warm or parents sound like the kind of parents are we're glad they have their children grow up poor you know bubbles that that was possible\nNow you know I don't think you're you're ... exaggerating entirely too much there is a dichotomy there was some practicalities of course involved in that but I uh Dr Huber I I think that a dog to the literal truth and he'd like to think he is your thoughts Dr\nI I don't think that actually correct yeah unfortunately what that ... is a an adult who is dependent upon the world for things and not just the permit that completely entitled they deserve this and you know I was taught right on day one\nI don't deserve anything I have to earn stuff to get anywhere in this world\nYeah uh what one would would certainly hope that that was the case I Would I Would like to think Russia to your your thoughts on because I I think that it probably comes close\nTo here right now uh you know I I keep I keep hearing about about people like this I'm not sure that that I Know of any of these people granted I I I ... the young people I Know my my that my my definition I'm Talking about a\nA parent's today's parents who are generally a course in their uh their their twenties and thirties and some of their forties\nOr the ones I Know which are not a a wide swath of humanity they're they're very definitely not a this category or I mean they they do discipline their children their children are expected to do certain things and yes that includes bumps grapes\nA failures of picking yourself up dusting yourself off and and the whole learning experience is there any kind of a of originality about this or a geographic concentration because I don't know that I have never actually met a helicopter parents much less a lawnmower parent\n[laughter] well I don't think it's necessarily region alley I mean I I taught university from Nineteen Ninety six and killed two thousand was Seventeen and one of the reasons why I was glad to step away from that was probably the last four years\nHere's I we get calls from parents going what do you mean my child and got us thirty on their cats and I go well I Can't even confirm if your kids in my class and they would blow up and like what do you mean I go well you know there are actually federal laws against that they're they're adults I Can't disclose anything you know\nAnd you used to be when I got a thirty on a on a test I was in trouble today the teachers in trouble\nYes at at the university level management at the high school level\n[noise] wow uh I had\nOne flew flew in from New Jersey to Texas to to talk with me [laughter] about their child's grade [laughter]\nWhat a good heavens it well but that that does almost eight lay literal helicopter or this case an airline I guess a remarkable hour ride a Greg in Springfield, Missouri joins us on the jumbo how to do with the clinical forensic psychologist Dr John Huber a good evening Greg\nGood evening gentlemen said Dr mass question are okay I've got I've got a one year old grandson and on kind of worried about situation the daughter of all I mean I don't even know if she'd be considered as long more pair and something else going on I mean\nShe obsessed with taking pictures I Love your death if he stands up you know it's like he's yelling baby it's ever done it and then when they don't even she won't even let them\nSit like ... myself grabbed the last thing I think we go there and grab them because always on top of them they you know you can't be around neither grand kids you know they're playing and they get in there are there some germs you know it's like ... and I'm almost worried about I mean\nWell maybe you should be more than almost worried I'd [laughter] uber Dr Huber sounds to me like Greg may have found an example here\nI Am I have that I'm I'm assuming this is our first child\nHow 'bout that great is is is a very ...\nOkay and you know at first child you know like the kids are at the store and they are in the living room they spent their pacifier out you got to go stick it in boiling water for ten minutes before he can put it in back in ... by the time she has her third kid she's become\nDusted off it doesn't matter as soon as you know wherever they get up out of gathering dust off their mouth [laughter]\nSo that's the only time you get more dads that'll change how well she ...\nShe goes by and they won the flu in law\nUh well I don't know I also see a lot older now deliver on my mind said yeah going going longer\nYeah reminder that you know you you raise a child and grandchild or if you spoil the child you'll be raising the grandchild\nYeah exactly as we go to the next call here as a Dr Huber I guess you do know the reason why ah grandparents and the grand kids get along so well\n[laughter] yeah they have a common enemy [laughter] okay\nA little cynicism there for the program I Love it to Tom in Port Angeles Washington good evening I'm\nA gentleman that the uh one of the things that generate show adopt or a mob just the amount of legislation that's out there that you have to see that the CDC that child to fill up at people\nAnd and and the communities can get word if something got your your child got injured or you know did you leave go to play in the yard and this happened and or the charge if the car seat issue of who you know you have the right one for your I had it at that age that if there there's a whole lot of stuff that that that\nYou would never even dreamed of as kids would be\nA and I'm like you're in my church he is right\nAnd and my parents never would have dreamed you know that somebody would have a hand yeah I mean at the state or local\nAt the state or local level a show that's got to create some paranoia favorite for the people that are remembering that used to write on the trucks traders are fifty three Chevrolet pick them up truck and hang out with the truck yeah\nWe can write and the bad and the truck now yeah exactly no I Know\nAnd and and and and it does no good things that I could think of you guys go out and get that next ...\nWell after your thoughts are Tom I Do want extent it has a government if not impose this on us at least encouraged this\nWell I'm from the government and I'm here to help and running and and\nWhat happens is you get you get a vocal minority of people and they go out there and they raise this think and they stand up in front of a school boards and governor meeting on our legislators and all of a sudden we have these things impose now there are some legitimate things that need to be regulated I I don't disagree\nWith that but you know uh\nI've been involved in so many different types of court cases a forensic psychologist of people following a pediatricians word to the letter a on a first child or\nSomething and the pediatrician assumed that oh you know they're an adult they'll they'll know the kids hungry you don't wait three hours to feed them even though I said you know all eat every three hours\nAnd all of a sudden you get child protective services involved\nIn it because you know the kids take being taken up the hospital because they have crying all the time and the other they think oh they're not feeding\nThe kids and the mother's like no I'm seeing them just like the doctor told me every three hours [laughter]\nAnd it's crazy [laughter] it's scary for new parents especially\nYoung man and a ... they follow those rules and and what happens with kids they hit the public school system and they learn\nHey as your parents do this child abuse of your parents do that a child abuse and they start coming home and dictating the rules of the household and it's scary because there's no handbook that says what really you can do parents you know what you can well\nA suffice it to say we somehow it Dr Huber managed to be here and I managed to get here and and the people in the audience managed to get here a\nCourtesy of parents who did not have that handbook either so I guess the the the old methods at least a do not a cause a ... a tremendous a fatality rate among young people that might be some lessons there to be to be learned from that we'll talk some more about this tonight this tendency\nIn the direction of not just helicopter parents bunch\nLawnmower parents I mean at some point that this has to be arrested there has to be stopped one eight six six five oh jumbo back in a moment\n\nBecause Kavanaugh is confirmed for ... and he says I just don't know what to do with them they are also upset\nIf they're really upset I mean I I work with those but I mean they ought to you they ought to do what the grownup would do okay let's organized will uh will become politically active will elect people to office with whom we agree\nI think he was they might have been younger students in school but the thing about it is I think I told him I ... a lot of the U.S is where the problem with these kids they don't know how to problem solve number two they don't know anything about elections you know somebody who needs that ... had the process\nAnd they used to teach civics them in such a moron [laughter] yeah I I had to do that's also part of the problem\nYeah but but what you just said was very telling Linda they don't know how to problem solve all the ... is the point of raising a kid if you do that at the end of the day produced someone who can problem solve I mean\nRight All right that's true why have them\nI mean no seriously why have a kid I I you can't just be doing it out of cruelty let's producer a human being who will flood failed miserably who will flop and life and and do all we can to to handicap nobody says that there is what they're doing\nThe guy the guy said it made it sound like the kids have no future now that well Republicans are running the country or\n... again I mean for the ... if you want to have that view that you're perfect right as an American so do something about uh don't suck your bomb right\nAt all and all you organize I mean I I may I Will be out there for you and I hope that I don't step on your precious little self esteem but that's the only political debates all about if you feel that way they do something about an all out\nI went into this whole still ISIS

way they used to in place there you know well\nAs they do go to complain about the about their kids don't want our guest to comment about windows at the say which I think is a lot the doctors uber\nShe she has cut a lot and there's a lot of validity to that the schools\nYou know they they used to be locally controlled and now they're they're nationally controlled and just like what what they need in in their state in in California or Washington state\nIs different than what they made in Florida and Texas and Georgia and New York straight you know we need to I think my at history of the school psychologist tells me we need to go back and let the states starts setting\nA the the standards of what their kids need to learn their at because our federal government has dropped out of the picture as far as you know they don't even requires ... recommends spell any more national education agency says we don't have to worry about spelling anymore 'cause everything has spell check
