evening\nWith Robert Kagan he is the freedom and senior fellow with the project on international order and strategy in the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution a columnist for the Washington Post\nAuthor of a number of votes books including his latest the jungle grows back it's published by cannot and sometimes in America and our imperiled world Mr Kagan thank you for joining us tonight\nThey around me\nAnd that's a quite a title the jungle grows back and what's the derivation of that\nWell if you think about the fact that you know the world have been living in for all its flaws it's been pretty good uh but you know there are forces out there in the world a forces coming from China and Russia\nAre around ... or is that you know want to sort of destroy the world it's creative and that's what I mean by the jungle growing back and we need to continually push back against the jungle or it'll it'll take us over the Gulf us\nIt was for ... for taking my call is ... ... Mr Kagan\nThat can be out of a song by saying I have a mixture of a K its worst my library how by this book with a avid or address area fully already have respect for him as an ... infected as advisor I'm a ... hour\nDisagree strong it was his press is piss premise\nThat we should intervene abroad in various places specifically at at least\nHaving spent some time in our past life in official down fish wealth as the um I just disagree with his premise that the Iraq War we touched by the way that we should be an Afghanistan it all given the fact that we've been there now for over Twenty years without changing the darn thing in the country\nYou're thoughts police are\nWell I agree we have not been effective in Afghanistan or you know let's not forget why we went into Afghanistan you know we were attacked some of their\nUh I think we would have been done better if we had taken a kind of out from Afghanistan or they had an opportunity to attack us which assembled that we bought a at doing during the Clinton Administration you know as for Iraq I you know I'm not going to go back and say that everything that we did was right in Iraq but I Do think\nI I still have a hard time believing like better off if we had Saddam Hussein in power\nOr that would be yet another vicious dictator or that we can now at people who are now carrying out assassinations or in other people's consulates like the head of Saudi Arabia or we would have Iran still and so you know we make mistakes of the country uh I certainly make mistakes\nOr think about what we should do but the real question it seems to me is a are we going to deal with the threats that are out there are way and ah unfortunately in the middle east there are real threats that we already have seen on September eleventh that come out and attack us and we'd have to deal with them they're rather than having to fight them here\nAnd to keep in mind also are the areas that were brought up by dock\nOr one as regards Iraq Saddam Hussein did not only have programs of weapons of mass destruction but he used chemical weapons against both the Kurds and the Iranians he had a nuclear weapons program and let's not forget that\nAh as for a Afghanistan that was again the headquarters of al ... which was a so inextricably mixed with the government of the Taliban that it was hard to tell the two apart when U.S forces finally reached a\nUh cobble a in some cases or a Taliban government functions were funded\nBy Osama bin Laden and al ... money let's not forget that we had every reason to to go in the problem I think we have in many cases\nIs thinking that we can do things like this are on the cheap and the quick a particularly the second ... Iraq War the notion being that that will go in will pull out the or\nThe underpinnings of the ah Saddam regime and the entire country will rush to the notion of a free pluralistic western style democracy and as we have learned a lot of parts of this world are culturally have a hard time going down that road\nWestern style democracy and as we have learned a lot of parts of this world are culturally have a hard time going down that road\n[noise] well that's exactly right and I think you know sometimes you know we we we learn the wrong lesson or whatever mistakes in Iraq\nThen let us to do nothing in Syria where now we have Russian forces we have a rainy and forces and we have terrorists or says ah you know threatening us our neighbors sending hundreds of millions of refugees are in Europe and I think you know we can't we can't do everything that we shouldn't be everywhere\nBut there are places where we're going to have to address some of these threats or they will in fact affect us directly\nOne eight six six by boat jumbo when eight six six five oh five four six to six as we go to a Marty who calls in from east Texas and Marty\n[noise] yeah Hi Jim uh it it's a I always enjoy your show you know you it's like I'm I'm working on a thesis right now is a historian that the arc of history actually is\nInevitable there was going to be somebody who discovered the new world that was going to be a country that um\nThat are not a country necessarily but there was going to be powers that\nMap to the world and that brought marketing pillows and and and commercialism around the world that we're going to map to where they were discovered the world that we're going to be part of the progress that brings us\nTo the point that we are today and I feel if that is inevitable and America seems to be the uh the chosen vehicles for the inevitable\nA position that we find ourselves in the world today where we are combating a individualistic notions against a you know I'm collective is notions and that's\nThat's something that I think is important to consider\nAll right let's let our guest to comment on that are your thoughts about uh the the arc of history if you will\nWell I I don't know about the arc of history because I think a lot of things are contingent and and I really do think they depend on human actions but there's no question that the caller's right to say that\nYou know the United states found itself in a particular position\nOr that no other country was in an idle some of it had to do with geography you know we talked about being surrounded by two oceans which gave us a certain degree of security but it also gave us the ability to send forces at maintain stability in Europe and Asia and prevent or is there\nA that would eventually engulfed us and it gave us the opportunity to to affect\nAn international economy in a way the benefit of the road so I think that's you know there is something special about America we shouldn't forget about it whether you know whether there is an arc of history I guess remains to be seen by a certainly United States has shaped history with its with that said slow yes\nAnd then of course it is that this might be if there is an arc of history we certainly aren't yet in a position to be able to\nAh accurately predicted one eight six six five oh Jim bow and of course we are a little ah ah to be heard not only in our affiliates stations but also a jumbo hadn't show dot com which means uh anywhere in the world and the skill joins us from the Philippines where it is a broad daylight gill\n[noise] here's Jim I'm\nJust want to comment on a on our guests are views um Philippines like Korea and Japan has [noise] I'm pretty uh arrangements are with the United states and and under certain conditions are we going to be a trip wire\nFor the U.S to enter into a into another major conflict\nFor certain conditions we could re a trip wire for the U.S to enter into a into another major conflict with is is there for Korea or Japan were attacked and a lot of people don't realize it or not that many years ago this war's United States territory\nUntil Nineteen forty six that's true although in the case of a of the Philippines I'm not sure how many a potential major conflicts exist and that is to say I'm not sure just exactly how many countries out there or are covering the Philippines these days\nWhile they are they we we do have an ongoing problem with the Chinese building a artificial island into\nAreas that are are are claimed as a either territorial waters of other countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam or a areas which should be considered international waters point taken\nAll right let's not argue has commented about that that notion of a\nOf the some of the a bilateral arrangements we have around the world with the countries such as the Philippines or with the Japan with the with South Korea and the possibility that that these arrangements might drag us into a large conflict to Robert Kagan\nWell I actually think you know are they actually have the opposite effect if we are reliable uh allies we will deter\nA China from attacking them whereas if we pull back and and and those kinds of it that\nWay will encourage Chinese attacks and then I think we'll get drawn in to conflict anyway I mean the fact that we are reliable allies out there that we can maintain stability and maintain eat and not have to get into war is if we think that we could stay out of the conflict\nThat involves China and Japan and Korea and all those other countries out there I think we're kidding ourselves we've already discovered\nA twice over the last half century that we can stay out of those kinds of conflicts\nAnd uh if we try to do so uh uh we've we've tried other words to go for quote the peace and honor now in our time we usually wind up with either one\nThat's right and you know people talk about or offshore balance SARS but that's what we were in the Nineteen thirties and the consequences of that was we wound up a fight on shore so I think it's better to live the stability through the security arrangements\nStay with us or more to come by one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six Robert Kagan our guest is the Freedman senior fellow\nWith the project on international order and strategy at the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution online at Brookings dot edu he's a columnist for the Washington Post author of the return of history and the end of dreams\nAre dangerous nation of paradise in power and they twilight struggle and he served in the state department and the deputy for policy in the bureau of Internet American Affairs or graduate of Yale and Harvard University's Kennedy School\nWhite six six five oh Jim by our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six more from our guests Robert Kagan and your calls on the boy had a job in a moment\nA look we we certainly are having a high level of of of conflict and disagreement but if you think about what\nA lead to the civil war it was a very specific set of circumstances\nA it was a first of all you had the country divided geographically you had a southern part of the country that ... that had an institution of slavery that the north\nOpposed and didn't have and you had a neat dividing line and in fact Thomas Jefferson said you know in a way it's precisely because there is such a neat dividing line that makes it impossible to avoid conflict eventually you know the divisions we have today they're like\nNeighbors disagreeing with neighbors you have people in the suburbs disagreeing with people in the city it's really hard to see any kind of geographical line uh and we don't have the kind of fundamental institutional difference that we had\nBetween a slave holding south and a capitalist north so I think we're we're obviously ingrained disagreement and we see polarization uh but I don't see a civil war I think that was a very special circumstances\nI certainly am happy to hear you say that and I certainly hope and and I actually think that you are correct Carolyn ... Pennsylvania now good evening Carol you say that it and you need to keep that radio turned down Carol this could be a very long call [laughter]\nCarol [noise]\nAnd you need to keep that radio turned down Carol this could be a very long call Carol\n[noise] I don't want to say much all I Want to say as I Am against the United states doing a first strike well\nOkay I'm not sure that uh that we have an economy and played it as a matter of a of a your thought process Robert Kagan\nA I guess we would have to define a further first strike a I doubt that were the mind to go around let's say when they first a strike a nuclear option a full scale World War three type of should of option although my guess would be that there may be places and circumstances in which\n... proactively engaging a problem before it gets worse and something less than the nuclear level might be on occasion the beneficial [noise]\nYeah I mean we certainly I we I Can't imagine us using nuclear weapons in the first strike that's that's not been our policy in it and it it is not going to be but but yes if if we saw a a crisis developing a that might result for instance in another terrorist attack or\nA in a in a war that we could forestall a by taking some action I think we have to be willing to do that or as we have in the past and uh and you know try to do with his intelligence is selectively as possible but you can't rule out the possibility of using force although not nuclear force if that's what the caller's talking about\nYeah yeah they they get into the the key is in the term of first strike a more to come ... six six five oh Jim boat what should be the American role in the world regardless of what we would like it to be what is the best role in a in a world that is far from perfect\nYour
