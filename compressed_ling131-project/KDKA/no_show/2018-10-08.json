{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "KDKA", "content": "But it's so much more when it becomes just tangibly real and I remember when I was a little boy learning in a Christian Science Sunday school about how God as my father and mother there is a place in the Bible where it says it is he that has made us and not we ourselves\nWell that meant that even when I was living with other families as a little boy\nAs a little boy I still felt very close to my divine parent to got to my father or mother and that was something that gave me strength and continue still to strengthen me knowing that you're constantly Parenthood oh you're never too old for that\nYeah and Susan now as a parent yourself have you help to your own children get to know that father mother God that is always with them wherever they are\nYou know it's funny you think I Would really have a good handle on parenting but when I had my own kids I did feel kind of a responsibility [noise] sometimes I have a responsibility to do it right and to be a good father just to\nMake sure everything went well for them I just learned this lesson even deeper that God is the only parent Mary Baker eddy the person who founded Christian Science\nShe says in her book science and health with key to the scriptures she says God has countless ideas and they all have one principal and parentage well she refers to us as ideas of God\nWe're spiritual and that's where the idea concept comes from but she says we have one parent pitch in other words it's only God who creates us and oh it was a joy as my children were growing up\nToo deep than my appreciation of God as each of the children's parents\nI Would have to step back and let God be the parent sometimes here's a good example when my son was trying to decide on which college to go to and he had done very well in high school and so there were oh I think ten or eleven schools that he was considering\nAnd I knew the lift and I had been traveling around to these different schools with him we were visiting the schools and talking to the different people in the um different departments have the schools and\nI have to tell you I definitely had ideas about what I thought was the best school forum that kind of thing and I'm sure it wasn't the secret to him which ones I thought he could he could probably tell but you know I Know that stepping back and letting God be his parent was what was needed\nAnd you know he had such a encouraging fresh view on\nHow to pray about choosing this school and I could tell it was his parent God who was prompting this in him he didn't ask God to put him in a school where he'll be happy or where he'll do well his motive was to be of use to God\nSo his real question was as he prayed God would you put me in the place that is most useful to you\nWell that's the way above just\nOpinion he was really putting his hands in his divine parents and and oh that is certainly proved true\nI remember when I'm there was one particular school right at the end that we um visited and he told me yes I'm not sure exactly why but I Know this is the school I'm supposed to go to know all the rest of the schools that he visited seem really great too but this one he just really felt this is where he's going to go he went\nAnd you know how sometimes things in your life you know you make a decision and you think it's for one reason but it's for other reasons that you don't see yet and that's what the divine parent can do God's parenting has a much broader\nYour view than just a human parents he went to the school and yes had a wonderful time did great in school and really loved it\nBut you know he met a couple of people who ended up helping through prayer one person who he literally saved her life through prayer and so I Would have never known that that was the place he was supposed to go but that was where his divine parents knew\nAnd from that point forward I'll tell you I won't have to learn a lesson again [laughter] I Know that it's the parenting of God that really is the best parenting\nAnd as we as parents are parents to be are praying about how to help our kids it is so good to know that we can reflect the father of it the the motherhood of God\nYou know there's a place in in that book I mentioned science and health and it's always been so helpful to me on this subject Mary Baker eddy says in science men is the offspring of spirit the beautiful good and pure constitute his ancestry\nHis origin it's not like that of mortals and Bruce instinct nor does he passed through material conditions prior to reaching intelligence\nSpirit if his primitive and ultimate source of being God is his father and life is the law of his being well\nAs parents to recognize that God is the father the mother of each of our children\nOh they're such strengths and that and you know what's good about it is that the father and mother who is God always is with our children we may be miles from those kids but our parent the divine parent God\nDivine spirit is always with them and that now is my role in parenting to hold back\n... Well Mark really helpful insights thanks so much for being with us today and sharing them I just love being here I've been speaking with mark swimming a Christian Science practitioner and teacher from Cynthia Park New Mexico [noise]\nAnd with me now to continue our discussion of being parents had by God is Jane Hicks and from Brazil ten Georgia thanks for joining us today\nThank you read it pleasure to be here and a privilege\nWell you know we've been hearing so much in the news about the plight of children who are either without parents are displaced from their parents due to various hardships so as a Christian Scientist how have you been praying about the situation\nI Know that Christian Scientists can a naval all of us know and they all got feeling loving president thinking of the children we hear about in the news off the price for a large understanding of home and who are true parent is which I have learned to be our father and mother God\nI landed a good lesson about this many years ago when I was teaching at great second graders\nThis class at thirty four students students who live with their parents want to live with her mom was a single parent the remaining thirty one were led by their parents to live with someone in the neighborhood it was unrelated to them\nSometimes they'd be four or five unrelated children living with a neighbor and sometimes as many as twelve children\nThe parents would come on but twice a year to visit the children these parents were my rent\nCarrots where migrant workers who traveled up and down the east coast from Virginia to Texas they picked whatever was in season cotton pizzas strawberries et cetera\nAnd this situation was so sad to me that each day on my forty minute drive home after school I found myself in tears I couldn't imagine being separated from parents are being heard as like cattle it seemed to me that they were abandoned\nEach day regardless of my tears I Would turn to the Christian Science pastor which consists of two books the Bible and science and health with key to the scriptures by Mary Baker eddy I went to these books for ... for\nA new form genesis one in the Bible that God in Maine man in his image and lightness and John one tells us that God is spirit Samantha spiritual not material is the image and likeness of God man could never lack of father mother his love or a home\nI research the word family father or mother sons and daughters and I knew that God's was everyone's father mother but the thought of being left with a stranger was overwhelming\nAs a research thing came to the Bible verse God said at the solitary and families are also reminded myself of Mary Baker eddy words\nGod is our father and our mother or a minister and the great physician he has man's only real relative and having an on earth\nGradually I realized that these children had never been abandoned by God his love was constantly with them caring for them the children who live together even though they weren't related or especially caring for each other this I saw as proof of God's care\nAnd then one day I overheard some of the children who live together talking with each other about the special than or they had had the evening before\nAnd I'd learn to be obedient to these angel message is so I sent an online birthday card was a sweet message\nBeen I received that day an animated card with a country music same because he knew I loved country music and saying mom hope you have a wonderful birthday to our birthdays are about two weeks apart\nFrom that we started an online conversation which turned into an opportunity to see him embrace him and have him said to me mom when I was in tears it's all okay it's all done we're together now\nI never thought I'd ever see my son again soon I'd be dancing with him and his wedding than being there to welcome three beautiful grandsons and then a sweet little princess\nThis was proved to me from the Bible that God does return to us all the years\nThe locus of eating and the Bible quote and ... eat and plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your God that has dealt wondrous Lee with you\nWell words can't even begin to say what this has meant to me\nAnd how learning and leaning on that sustaining Anthonette my father or mother God has continued in so many ways to bring inspiration inhaling\nI Am so grateful for Christian Science for Mary Baker eddy and for God our father or mother\nWell Kirsten thanks so much for being with us today and for sharing your experience thank you I've been speaking with your

was winter time and I was outside playing and I got started to feel very sick so I went home and ah by the time I got to my grandmother's house\nMy neck was stiff and or had body aches a high fever I went to lie down in this little bed my grandmother had in the kitchen\nAnd ah that's where she took naps I guess when she was cooking but anyway I I I was lying down and the the relatives started coming over and saying things like oh this is what happened to your cousin when he got polio and this is what happened to your older brother when he got sick and died the next day so they were just scaring the heck out of me\nAnd uh my grandmother my mother was very upset and I kind of drifted off into asleep and then I woke up a few hours later and uh I saw this really bright light up in the ceiling\nBetween the beams and this old farmhouse\nAnd the ceiling and it was very warm and it was very bright it was in the ... what I Would call in angelic shape and it kind of a humanoid shape\nAnd uh I the best thing about it was that I felt like everything would be okay I didn't have any more worries I I I I felt fine I went back to sleep and when I woke up in the morning I was completely well I didn't have any any health issues at all and my mother and my grandmother said it was a a\nA miracle and that was my guardian angel and I I think that's\nWhat opened the floodgates uh for the rest of my life I started having these tour normal experiences are quite\nOften and uh uh uh you know kind of randomly but but very often frequently\nShare with us a recent paranormal experience Dr Bruce\nSure um well I Am able to um [noise] as soon as I published this book well okay I'll I'll what caused me to to write this book or\nA friend of mine a dear friend of mine are also of of a Norwegian heritage or passed away two years ago and uh a month after he died I ah had a vision of him and he came to me and it was very clear vision of him and he told me all about his\nThe spirit world you know his uh his after like what is after life was like and it was quite detailed and a\n... he he actually gave me the the name of the book timeless that's that comes from my friend gene but uh he told me that in in the spirit world that he was in there is there's no there's no future there's no past it just as he said I just am it's just all the present everything is just present\nAnd he said it was it was very very nice and uh he had no more\nBut I don't know if you've ever stop stop stop doctor talked to Dr Yeah Dr Bruce all of Solazyme has written a book called the Heimlich ... paranormal personal history I don't care about his history tell me about your history tell me about a paranormal experience that happened to you\nWhile this division Adam was was a paranormal experience I can tell you about it a demonic experience that I had\nA loved about Eighteen your ankles especially ... especially if you're driving in an Eighteen wheeler through the Pennsylvania wild\nIn the Pennsylvania wilds or on route eighty or an eye twenty through Dallas those are those are the ones we want to hear please share with us a demonic experience doctor\nOkay sure so uh I was Eighteen years old living in my brother's garage I was at a very low point in my life\nAnd a sleeping on the mattress on the on the garage a floor\nAnd ah all of a sudden a this call him a fire appeared ah from the foot of the mattress or my feet were and and went in an arc over my head as so probably you know I don't know when six feet up in the air and an ark\nAnd it was it was moving like a like a river of fire and there was this low guttural voice that was speaking in some kind of language I didn't understand and uh I I pinch myself I slap myself just make sure I was awake and I was awake and this probably went on for about five minutes although it seems longer than that\nIt was it was terrifying and and I uh\nI got up and I I called my girlfriend and I told her what had happened and then she\nTold me to come over and she was quite worried about me she said come over in the morning and ah I did and then when I was there she told me well you should maybe we should call a psychiatrist and I said well just forget about it and you know don't worry about it maybe it was just a dream but if it wasn't it was\nReal higher and I think what no I've yeah he was call them ... you know all of the fire engulfed you while you were sleeping while you were in bed well\nIt was like a river of fire a column that went over my head in an arc shape it wasn't a engulfing he was over me you know\nThis is talk of Bruce all of so high and the other reason I Want to Dr Bruce on because every hour I get a pitch from somebody who's written a book who's had psychic experiences but the difference when Dr Bruce is Dr Bruce all of Solazyme is a big deal he's a Fulbright Scholar and professor\nBut he had to wait until his retirement to write this book\nAbout his paranormal personal history the name of the book is timeless a paranormal personal history\nAnd he documents thirty four incidents of paranormal events in his life\nTo let the telecast nieces ghost demons guardian angels

doctors saw\nYeah share with us another story like the demonic store you you you're saying there was a river of fire by your bed question about the river fire by your bed right before you saw that what were you doing when thinking did you do something to invoke the devil or\nDon't believe so but I Do have a a theory about it 'cause the day before actually the night before a I was a cutting through a yards like I usually do since I was a kid even when I was Eighteen years old they still did it jumped over fences and country are just as in Seattle\nSuburbs in Seattle and uh or north of Seattle and I I cut through the yard of this a lady that everybody all the kids called er which\nAnd uh she had like blackberry Bush's they went all the way to the top of her roof and it was horrifying to you know the parents because it brought property values down but to us we just thought she was a witch\nAnd ah so I I just cutting through yard and it was night and I looked at her window and as I was cutting through yard and she was there with the candle and she had this she was very scary like and she had white hair that shot off in all directions she had a a candle she had this ulcer is cancerous thing on her nose and\nAnd uh she was just I felt like I was like a deer in headlights and I was I was just kind of frozen there for a moment until I could break free and I think I uh I I I think it had something to do with her because it happened the very next I think it was the\nVery next night this thing happened so whatever I did I I must have really made her angry\n[noise] have you had a paranormal story yourself you're eight eight eight six eight eight WAMC we have Dr Bruce all of Seoul hunt who's Norwegian and would you agree Dr so high the Norwegian

were holding my hands and they were holding the hands of hundreds of other people which in turn that off hundreds of other people and I realized I was an infinite circle\nI was holding hands with

the left all the protestors go home and it's over you know you you still have some talking members of the house talking about impeachment\nNot going to happen it's not going to happen because\nYou're not going to move on it when when you know you want to well if you want to open this door if you want to go down that road\nGo for it I'm sure you'll have some radicals on the left on Capitol Hill that will keep talking about it but it's not going to happen for a reason because there's nothing there it's the reason the confirmation vote went through and he was ultimately confirmed\n\nNot going to have them well we can move and we can do this it those stories are given the same credibility that the Van Jones story was given\nWhen when when Van Jones is rolling up his sleeves and working in a grassroots effort to change their mind they elect doors no that didn't happen in fact Hillary\nHad a net loss of life doors and Trump had a net gain\nGame after the election after the election because these people don't live in reality\nThey don't look at the facts and anything they don't they don't care about the process they want you to believe that that the process is that they slap on their Superman Cape and they're going to be a hero in a moment\nAnd it doesn't happen that way you had a situation in the cabinet confirmation process that was while it was distorted\nIf you look at it the President Trump\nWas the one that really made that happen in terms of extending it out\nSo there was a supplemental background check\nThere was zero zero credit of course and he wasn't looking to get credit but the people he wasn't looking to get credit from the the media or the left of course\nBut the people the everyday people look at it and\nThey'll they'll look back on this process and go well one of the you know what is it that the the ones I I mean that don't follow it every day and we know people work\nAnd some people work around the clock and thank you for listening and you don't take it in like like we do or or or your average new sound would do so you don't have all the details but they look back on this and they look at the facts of this by doing just simple research\nAnd they see that it was the president himself that allowed the process it was Chuck Grassley that allowed her to testify it was the Republicans that gave her every single chance to prove her case and she could not\nThat's the reality of this all\nNot that the but you know the left wants you to believe in the protesters and the Weiner's in the babies\nWant you to believe that it was the Republicans who squashed it no they opened it wide you could not have given them or her more of an opportunity to come in and prove her allegations not not to the fact that she has to prove them like a court of law\nBut just something just upset my stance or don't have a preponderance of\nThe of of running of the the evidence something to back it up and she couldn't do it\nNow ah and neither could neither could re mirrors and and if you look at what was actually done there are there what what didn't what did we find out the only thing that we didn't find out was Ford who said that her\nThe the uh the note and\nWhether she had video whatever the polygraph doesn't and the therapist notes would cooperate what she said and she refused to turn them over right it's really the only thing that we don't know because she refused\nAnd her lawyers refused to to turn them over\nEverything that we now I mean there there is and if you can point to get to the the as the FBI said we only we know that ... you know we know that are not ... but when the ... ah came out and said that uh you know that her lawyers oh you're twenty people we wanted to interview well that's not the point\nThe point is they asked her directly who are the people that you say are witnesses to this actual event right she pointed out the witnesses they interviewed them none of them right could cooperate and say that anything happened in that case and none of them said anything\nShe had plenty of time to talk she could have gone back to the Judiciary Committee or Dr Ford could and she never did\nAnd with those no she could've answered them over a nearly well it was two weeks ago when the uh when the Judiciary Committee and the chairman asked asked for them right because\nThe the story came out\nThe uh and her more through her lawyers were offering those therapists notes\nTo the FBI that's interesting that we learned that after we learned that they weren't going to interview her and the supplemental background check that really is convenient\nOh no we're we're willing we call them we were going to give them you know you weren't you knew there and they have to come\nTo you had plenty of opportunity or they would have simply taking them and given to the Senate Judiciary committee how were they were not going to make a judgment on it they would give it to the Senate Judiciary committee ... and the Senate Judiciary committee would have gone over would have gone over that right there isn't anything of substance that the left has I'm not\nThe only thing the left has is again and it was ever changing\nYou always believe women well unless it's a conservative woman\nOr a you know you ... you never believe the you never believe the uh the the man you had white males and the Senate Judiciary committee but when it came to the substance of the actual case\nYou know of of the political trucks that's what it was it was a political trial people say it was just a job interview uh yeah you uh don't involve the FBI and a normal job interview and uh you don't put people under oath\nUnder penalty of perjury for the average job interview so if you're saying it was just like an average job interview or you're a little bit of you are a little bit mistake and it got down to the point where all they had was an allegation and they believe that an allegation should\nBe enough ... really if we reversed roles would that be enough ... really is that where you are now the allegation is enough\nAnd then you've got to the point with Cory Booker well or it doesn't matter the the whether he's guilty or innocent doesn't matter it's just there's so many allegations right that he should step down because yes yeah so then you get what you want just to multiple unbearable hide threat allegations and that's enough for somebody to step down nothing that\nThe left brought up nothing that the mainstream Democrats brought up we need to make sure the right to clarify this because we always get those road that's not just the this was the mainstream of the Democratic party right and that's what they were trying to get you to buy\nThey were trying to get you to buy that the allegation is enough\nThat up a woman says it in this case it must be bullied not in other cases but just this particular case it must be bullied now I Know that they generally said all women must be believed but then the women that said well why don't you believe you not say just conveniently ignored right\nAnd and so that's what we're being told that the preponderance of the the the presumption of innocence uh uh you know doesn't exist uh up for for a man or defending yourself in a passionate way shows guilt mhm\nAh everything that they sure while does not pass the rational thought or critical thinking test ... none of it and it was from again I we need to repeat this this is not the fringe Democrats\nThis is the main stream of the Democratic party it is the Senate it is the Senate Judiciary committee it is the leadership of the Democratic party\nAnd they're trying to get you just to throw away\nAny mind set of due process site\nWell as we saw even independence\nWhen the pollen came out last week you know didn't buy it when they found out oh we didn't know that all her witnesses said they couldn't cooperated with the no\nConfirm yeah and and that's that's it\nAnd that's that's it I mean if you look at the end while it was a a fifty to forty eight vote if you look at the process from start to finish every opportunity was given to the accusers uh the the process was even distorted to that extent so in order to facilitate that\nAnd then ultimately it came down to what while I was voted along party lines with with what two exceptions really and then other than that that's what it's always going to be\nAnd it doesn't matter that it's Trump as president it doesn't matter that it's kept when I was the nominee is where we are as a nation politically right\nNow if Trump wasn't president if it was somebody else yup and he was Kavanaugh was up there yet it would've been the exact same ... same right than a division was not created by Trump it was not eight six six Ninety red
