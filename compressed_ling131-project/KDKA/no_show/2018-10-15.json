{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "KDKA", "content": "You're really cultivating and understanding of what it means for God to be good and then cultivating good listening skills discerning skills just everyday activities\nTo learn to lean on to trust to rest on good when you're doing it with the little things and one big questions and decisions come along it's not so tough and when I'm Talking about\nAnd when I'm Talking about little things it's not so much that it's about asking God for stuff so much of that is becoming aware of God come telling us to see the good that's right before us you begin by expecting to be guided to a parking spot for example\nTo call a friend when it will bless them most of that kind of thing [noise] you know it's not like God is sitting around somewhere waiting for us to ask\nBefore producing good for us when we talk about being guided by God letting God lead well God is an ever present guide always revealing good to us in every moment but do we always see it do we always feel it maybe not that's where a focus shift can happen\nTo start by recognizing the presence of good around us God's guidance isn't always the writing on the wall kind of experience sometimes it is but it's not always like that\nMany times we're just learning to trust the divine intuitions the good intuitions that come to us from God what Christian Science teachers are actually ever present angel messages of good that we can discover right in our own thought\nSo then these angel messages messages from God you know how do we get them how do we hear them and how do we know that it's got talking to us\nChristian Science founder Mary Baker eddy explained that we can recognize these angels or thoughts coming to us by the love they create in our hearts she wrote oh made you feel this touch\nIt's not the class of hands nor loved person present it's more than this it has a spiritual ideas that lights your path\nIsn't that cool and it is but really that live in the heart helps you know when you feel that love\nYou know that it's not just personal agenda it's not just a limited human will mixed in there is this really sweet short prayer and solemn sixty one I Love this prayer I lean on this prayer it's very short it says lead me to the rock that is higher than I\nAnd that's what yielding to God letting God take the lead is really like divine love is Iraq\nIs a solid foundation that we can lean on that we can build on love is compelling us always to yield to good unlimited good more good to move beyond the limited scope of just a personal ego and what that is telling us is good for us\nI Love that because the idea that that love and that actually feeling of peace you get\nWhen you know it's got talking to you that does send us in the right direction now let's say though someone having a hard time and they're still struggling and they're not sure you know what direction to go to hinders us from hearing God\nI Can't really speak for everyone I Know that when I feel pushed or polled with my own one son wishes I don't feel the love\nMaking human plans setting personal goals has rarely worked out well for me in the long term and often left me frustrated when things don't go the way I Would like them too\nIt's not that the angels aren't there\nBut it's like I'm shouting over them it's like I'm reaching reaching for something that I Want to not willing to trust that what God has in store for me is really that good that good that I can lean on it that I can trust it that I can even wanted if I Can't see it\nIf I Can't see it eventually usually circumstances require me to get to that quiet place so that peaceful listening place where I turn to God for spiritual direction so that I can move forward it it gets me out of the stock place of wondering what I should be doing you know or how\nI can hear God's speaking to me\nWell that makes me think that because we're God's delivered child I mean we're that spiritual image and likeness of God\nThat then it's natural for us to be quiet and listen to our father mother God's loving direction is that part of it\nExactly like a like any loving parent God wants the best for us and desires the best for us and give us the best to us\nBy learning to or by trusting in learning to yield to that divine intention trusting in God's will is good for us it open so many more doors than just a personal pushing and pulling and demanding and hoping opens for us\nYeah I find it's better than I could've even Klan exactly exactly well do you have an example on your own life that you can share where you really saw this truth\nI probably have a hundred but I'm only going to give you one [laughter] I applied for a position one time that I really wanted I mean I really really wanted it and I wasn't taken I wouldn't say I was a turning to God for guidance because I really was it\nWas a good job and it would be a blessing to many people so I ... I felt guided to apply it was a good idea to do it but then I wasn't taken and I didn't see it at the time how much I have yet to learn about not pushing my own will to go faster or further than God was leading me at the moment\nBut even when I didn't get what I wanted God really was leading me\nAnd in fact leading me to apply several more times for the very same job\nEach time there was no\nAnd while it was disappointing each know compelled me to appreciate the good that was at hand and to learn to develop the opportunities that were before me I learned actually that I can bloom anywhere\nI can bloom anywhere that God plants me and that was really a good and healthy lesson to learn now the last time I applied\nI remember clearly asking God if I should even bother should I even try again\nAnd the intuition came to me that in following God's leading I should apply but that it was also safe to trust that God was leading others those whose job it is to decide if I get to do it or not\nAnd you know I never thought of that my focus has always been so narrow just on guide guiding me and my really wanting to do it but that wasn't my decision God was leading me to apply and that was enough\nI felt the love and my heart I felt God's love for everyone in the decision making process I trusted them because I trusted God to be guiding them so I applied and that time I was taken\nBut you know what I now know I actually would have been fine even if the answered been no because I could see God was taking the lead at every single point\nIn hindsight I can see how different my circumstances where how much better prepared I was on how I wouldn't have had the same richer experience in that work had I been taking any of those other times that I asked\nGod's guidance is such a precious thing to seek it's an ...\nDivine good really is our best advocate a loving parent to his children God demands the best for us and the best of us and I think that letting God take the lead is key to winning or mine for blessing and a life being blessed\nMichele thanks so much for being with dance for sharing your inside it was a privilege I've been speaking with Michelle and I knew a Christian Science teacher based in Paris, France [noise]\nHello I'm Margaret ... highly a Christian Science practitioner from East Hampton in New Jersey I'd like to share an experience I had\nWhere I saw the importance of listening to God's guidance and letting them take the lead about Thirty years ago my husband and I went from Boston to Cleveland for the weekend\nWe drove over a two day period stopping overnight in Williamsport, Pennsylvania\nBefore we left the car had been acting up on occasion and it came to me just suggest to my husband that we rent a car for the trip but he said no he was handy with cars and was able to repair it if necessary so it was not concerned\nI did not pursue the matter further as I relied on his good judgment after all he was on the driver's seat just this week Dr Cleveland the car began to show signs of trouble than when we left there we\nHad not gone very far when it really began to ACT UP we had to stop every half hour or an ad oil and water so we sort of left alone it was not an easy ride and I'm sure I had to turn to God many times\nDuring the day I began to feel on well and my way stop for the night in Pennsylvania I realized I was hemorrhaging Irish frightened and wish to very much that I was home and set up miles away in a motel as the Christian Scientist it\nGod was the one that was doing all the work and I'm so grateful that I I was like to listen and and that was a situation in a party where after that happened and after I made sure she was fine you know I felt led to leave and and that's okay\nAnd I was learning that were praying not to get closer to God but we're knowing our closest to God and it showed me that\nGod's guidance is not something that's out there that just graces asked every once in awhile I resent that if God is the divine mind which is another sending them for God and if I'm at one with God well then I met one with the divine mind just as we all are\nSo listening to God is only normal and natural for all of God's creation\nAlina that's a wonderful example thanks so much for being with us today thank you so much Rita [noise] I've been speaking with Elaine Simpson from Washington DC\n\nUm ...\nThe I'm I'm\nA\n\nNo\nA\nAh no\n\nOh well\n\n\nI'm\nNa na\nNa\nNa palm\nNa na\n... and that's the program to this week next week on Christian Science ... know watch the twenty four hour

could be a\nWatershed moment teachable moment I'm for ... for all Americans um I think that uh the Democrats have not learned\nTheir lessons or in the has shown the door they traded Kevin all and the ... in the Supreme Court hearings\nUm they of\nAssumed that they could slander and live or a person that they disagreed with politically and get their way but um then they'd been doing the same thing to trial for two years but\nUh it's really come to a head was ... was a cab and all of the nation and I think we need to use the midterms to show then clearly that that's not the way to do politics in America that well what is needed in America is\nThe parties to to debate the issues then to use reasons\nOr two but you know they come yeah they they don't go ahead well as we\nHave Richard ... that's yeah that's been there playbook though not just since the last two years with Trump\nTheir play book and I remember Harry Reid saying that Romney didn't pay his taxes you're from some of the middle later on I was a lie but he said it was effective well they'll do anything the book and the worry is it looks like they could win a house representatives and if they do you can't imagine what the next two years of going to be like for President Trump and for all that's right\nThat's right and it's it's the idea that uh you're selfish and justify your selfish Maine's\nUm and that's what the Democrats are using a as they're guiding principle um they're selfish and there's a are justified by their selfish Maine's\nAnd ... up and they also think they have truth on their side they're arrogant as I said and when you arrogant and you think if you think you have the truth than you could do anything right at the end is edge the means are justified by the ends right\nOr the actually

along I twenty five\nYeah well I I Would suggest to that you you know keep up a fight with people who are willing to listen and try to work on those people who might be persuaded by the fact many people don't know right they live their lives they work hard at their jobs and the you know they tune in occasionally maybe that's why the Kavanaugh hearings will be effective\nBecause I think the the great majority of people were not happy about the way he was treated in in what went on there the idea that allegations are enough\nTo convict you at least in people's minds or some people is is that raises is against the whole system where you're innocent until proven guilty he was guilty just because he was accused of it\nAnd so maybe that influence on people I think people are going to be

[laughter] yeah no this\nIs a real problem with voting integrity in this country\nAnd we've known for years that people in Chicago people voted in Chicago but now across the country there are people voting in your case you twice they voted for Obama I mean if you don't have integrity in the election system anything can happen it's amazing when you look back on it that Trump won that Bush won\nBecause ... I Believe that we're finding that kind of fraud that people wrote in in California you know you can vote by DMV and they admitted to thousands of people voted there they said there was some snakes with voting machines we got a real problem when you can trust the outcome of the election\nWell the thing is is that how the ... county Republican caucus committee changed\nHere in Cedar Rapids was that we got a whole new Patrick people in a whole new batch people actually interested and say I'm going to make sure my assault is actually counted\nAnd so we have all these younger people ... says I Love this idea I'm just going to make sure that this guy over here that I don't trust\nIs being equal and that's how we changed from eight Democrats city to Republicans city in this last election\nWell that's good so there's still some good news even despite the fraudulent voted by the way that doesn't take into account illegal immigrants right\nIf illegal immigrants are voting and that's my whole point that's another topic if we ever allow illegal immigrants to vote Republicans aren't going another election or at least nationally a ... in our lifetime ... there's no hope would you let people vote who aren't qualified or are not citizens of United States\nYou're you brought up a great little election\nI actually got to get her get a little something there that they're [noise] okay it's all depends on how you treat the individual\nIf you treat unless people who may be here illegally\nBut are contributing to society you know 'cause I ... you know many a warehouse temp agency jobs where there are plenty of illegals that were working\nBut as long as you treat them like human beings that not you know being angry because they're illegal just realizing that our system that sales for so long that we know integrated people that you know\nIn a in another no way should have been there and the first place but because they are good to us and we are good to them\n[noise] maybe the idea that illegals would probably vote Republican is not out of the questions\nNot the problem I Will not quite as it's not\nIt just 'cause I don't want to get on a topic necessarily the problem is if you don't have a a way of entering the country legally then you're sovereignty your borders me nothing I mean there's a big topic I don't want to go into it yeah I certainly think people should be treated well but whether they should\nBut whether they should be allowed into your country is another issue you have borders or you don't\nBut I don't want to open up that you know for us right now uh you know it it's bigger than just a few minutes ... is not a matter of treat them well in fact I\nDon't even know I teach at night and many of my students may not be here legally ... the great people that's not the point I fault the government for not having a system that makes sense for all of us that's the real issue\nAnd speaking of issues let me know what you think at eight six six Ninety read either that's also eight six six or seven thirty three thirty nine let's see we have time for another call in the segment Charles been waiting Sheryl in spots where does that New Jersey\n... New Jersey\nAnd New Jersey Mrs all from Nineteen sixty nine Mrs Hillary Clinton when her face is there is only the fight this is all ... says all she knows Hillary rotten and\nSome of these is Oberlin gay\nOr the ventilation of hostilities is healthy is valid and\nAcross the board so she'll catharsis\nA catharsis has the way of perpetuating itself\nAnd she talks about conflict\nThis is in the service for I'm going all the way back Mrs right out of ... book of how you deal with how you deal with with his the rules for radical she\nBeing the main student she put it into the says there is only the fight\nAnd this is what she is causing today with all the vandalism you spoke about New York city with the uh uh New York Republican club being hit\nWith vandalism and broken glass this is all orchestrated then promoted by Hillary Clinton\nWell I don't I don't know if it's all orchestrated by her because she laws if you're done such a great job but the fact is you are right the certainly the playbook Solomon skin and Obama followed that\nAnd taking over the young right there so they get a doctrine aid for the most part and he knew if you capture them when they're young you'd have a for a lifetime and that's why the nice guy a you know not forget the last call his name but the idea that uh you know if you're just treat illegal immigrants well that's okay 'cause they're good people you know we know that the people that that's not the point\nYou know what I often say for years I've been saying it's amazing it's not amazing that these students graduate and they're on the left\nWhat's amazing is if anybody goes through the school system has come out as conservatives\nAre they just don't hear the other side they never hear our side actually when I think about I'm pretty optimistic that we could win elections after all that indoctrination because eventually get a paycheck because there was the second\nOne is the permanent taken whole money what do I don't agree with the stuff right but they've got to grow up they're going to get out in the world and they tend to be a conservative\nBut I Want to know what you're thinking I don't I don't want to be unfair to anybody\nYou know I I think there's a civil war going on in this country the second civil war between the left in the right battling for all the issues are brought up at the beginning more regulations more taxes\nI'm more government a lower military it's funny in that sense they want less of a military and again they don't even believe this American exceptionalism that there's something special about this country how can ... go to a you know Berkley and not let people speak\nSpeak or black lives matter when did that start as I mentioned Alan Dershowitz who is a big Hillary Clinton supporter speaking Hillary said this is not the liberalism that he knows you let people who have opposing ideas speak and he tried to win the battle of the the dialogue about which which system which candidate is better\nI don't see that going on not when you can't even go to a restaurant if they know you work for the Trump Administration not thinking from Mitch McConnell in the car with his wife\nNot if they will let you in your own house where they come on the streets to to try to make noise or battling in the streets that this is a scary\nThis is really very frightening about what's going on you got to get out there and vote if the Democrats win the house of representatives you're not going to believe the next two years what's going to take place you'll be hearing there'll be subpoenas President Trump's term is is going to be just the disaster that the next two years\nLet me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye which is also eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine mark guys they're filling in on red Henri", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "15"}
