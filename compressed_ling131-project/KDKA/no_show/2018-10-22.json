{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "KDKA", "content": "Or those are two big questions I I guess the first one I can say you know whether people consider themselves to be religious or not you know I'm believers in a higher power or not I've\nFound that most of them want to be healthy and and inspired about life and\nInspiration and health or the pastor of the church of Christ scientists provides so it really speaks to any individual anywhere of any faith or know face to old hearts are just wanting to be free and inspired and\nNow some of those listening to ward pastor conjures up images of the kind of a religious person who shepherds a congregation of people toward a more spiritual life but the founder of the church of Christ scientist Mary Baker eddy ordained and impersonal pastor to administer to the needs of her church and\nShe wrote in her book miscellaneous writings I hereby ordained the Bible and science and health with key to the scriptures to be here after the only pastor of the church of Christ scientists throughout our land in other lands\nSo Christian Scientists recognize two books as their past or the Bible and science and health now these passages from the books comprise the sermons that are read aloud Christian Science worship services worldwide and our study throughout the week\nBut people who used to pasta preaching of particular ... Sunday reading to blows may seem limiting and lacking of inspiration what would you say to that case\nWell I I found it Mary Baker the road true I have made the Bible in science and health with key to the scriptures the pastor for all the churches of the Christian Science to nomination but that does not make it impossible for this pastor of ours to preach\nHere's the pastor for all the churches of the Christian Science to nomination but that does not make it impossible for this pastor of ours to preach\nThe word of God is a powerful preacher and it was not to spiritual to be practical and our two transcendental to be heard and understood\nHowever this past year not only ministers to those who attend services but two individuals who've never step foot inside a church or you know probably never think of themselves as religious it ministers privately to people all over the world is they read inspires and he loves them\nWow so that makes this pasta the Bible in science and health valuable to anyone at any time\n[noise] and the value of having two books as a pastor's that they can be with you when the human touch can't you know you can hold them in your hands or read them on your phone you can memorize their statements and you can listen to the audio versions\nOr it can be a just a mentor spiritual resource a timeless guide and as you said it's open twenty four seven and many find them to be a physician\nAgain that may be a very new concept to all this in this case so tell us about Mary Baker eddy who is not somebody that found the Christian Science but also the author of science and health\nAnd she was a just a lifelong student of the Bible and although the scriptures always took the lead in her life during the Eighteenth fifties and Eighteen sixties she experimented with different healing methods including homey up at the end the use of placebos\nDuring her research she discovered that drugs had no intrinsic power their own and it was the human mind that empower them and she felt there was something more something missing to the puzzle of healing\nAnd then she suffered a life threatening accident and as she lay on her bed reading accounts of Jesus healing she experienced a dramatic recovery and this swift healing ... back into the Bible to discover the cause of the betterment and\nShe came to realize that although the human mind appeared to do marvelous things it was actually the cause of most pain and disease\nReal cure she found was in the spirit or mind of gone that genes as expressed are utilized and she learned that both the human mind and body became subordinate to God's laws regarding health on this spirit or mind have gone just lived in expressed\nAnd she then put into practice which he learned through prayer she healed people who've just cute chronic and organic diseases she taught others to human named her system even Christian Science and in Eighteen Seventy five she published science and health she recognized it to be going to give to the world\nSo she ordained Bible in science and health as the pastor the impersonal past her for her church\nBut not only does it care for their churches needs but anybody who's picking up these two books they they just feel guns love and care a powerful president they feel the majesty of guns being in their lives\nOh that's beautiful and I mean that's a wonderful sense of a a pastor that I think I Would want to reach out to have I was in any kind of needle wanting to understand something more about spiritual life so tell us a bit more about how you learn to love and an lean on the pasta that you just described\nFrom an early age you know my my parents were both Christian Scientist so they they constantly everyday studied the Bible and find some help through a Bible lessened the Christian Science church publishers and it's the same Bible lesson that is a red\nStudied the Bible and science and health through a Bible lessened the Christian Science church publishers and it's the same Bible lesson that is a red in church services throughout the world\nAnd so they were constantly turning the Bible and science and health and that way and so that that was my example and so [noise] uh an early age I went to the Christian Science Sunday school and heard Bible stories and how they were irrelevant to my life\nHow they could and reach my being\nA ... and then I found that these two books they just they they became my friends and guides and constant physician and they were just always there\nThat is great and uh so he says that you you had a good relationship with the pasta right from the get go\n[laughter] you know it to me it's been just two automatic thing when I have a need I just turned to these books and whether it's a familiar passes I Know are sometimes I just open up randomly in and see where the inspiration leads because I found that it's the spiritual ideas\nIn these books that move salt and wouldn't salt moves that's when he is happening and what I mean by salt moving is just moving off of a materialistic or unlimited or selfish on base and I start to recognize the spiritual nature of what God has created us to be\nSo when you I'm sort of started hearing about this as as a child can you remember any specific experiences where you felt the ... of the past or really felt that this pasta was communicating to you\nOh boy there's been just so many times [laughter] from physical things I remember one time uh I was ...\nMy twin brother and I we were playing little league baseball and um I was playing shortstop and this is the biggest fastest guy was hitting the ball and he smacked a ball and hit the ground and took a bad hop and hit me right now I'm all\nAnd so I'm San during around and listen to figure eats you know around the field as they're scoring runs on everybody else afterwards kept us all you're going to have this black I made a lot of pain and stuff like that and when I got home and I I just my parents just kind of\nLove me and cared for me and just open up the Bible and started just reading just comforting passages and the next morning there was no black guy there was nothing it was just immediately dismissed and so it just over and over again\nWhether it was I'm overcoming chicken pox just in a matter of twenty four hours or I'm just all sorts of things that kids get into when they're playing in the woods in Texas [laughter] and the main thing was feeling I'm afraid\nThat's to me that's where the pastor has brought me a feeling a sense that I'm not a victim I'm afraid that I haven't dominion over my thought and therefore I can control my body\nMm well that's an extraordinary thing for people to have isn't it I think everyone listening will think that that's that's what I have ... how does the pasta helped us to find that that to me in that sense if you like both ... every aspect of our lives\nOkay the book and Matthew in the Bible I Love it\nI read it a lot and then it starts on saying when he was coming down from the mountain it's talking about Jesus when he was come down front amount and great multitudes pond on him and behold there came a leper and worshipped him saying lord if ... if not we'll ... make me cream\nAnd cheeses put forth his hand and touched him saying I Will be though clean and immediately his leprosy was crying\nIf it if not we'll ... make me cream and cheeses put forth his hand and touched him saying I Will be though clean and immediately his leprosy was clans and\nSo over the years when I'm looking at that I I think about the mountain and that was that physical elevation or was that a spiritual one this with God and that and that's what the Bible in science health teaches me is how to pray\nTo gain that one is with my God the infinite mind or life one of those with capital spelling that they're sending them some names for God in in that sense that um\nIf that will now can't make me clean and he says I Will that sense of well I'm going to try wasn't there um any sense of fear trepidation but it was just spent ... million right there I'd gone given dominion that Jesus espresso fully in what\nWe learn in science and health that's called the Christ that power I'm gone that dominion over situations and then in science and health\nAnd and after a while the road crew and the other musicians started to see that there was something to it\nThat there there was healing going on and every time there was a problem in their lives or a healing would take place a one time that one of our other guitar players had a daughter who's a was born and had little hole in her heart and they they said the whole would not\nGrow together so they'd have to do surgery and so we waited for nine months and booked are done in Galveston children's hospital where they were going to do the surgery so we're on the road for nine months and\nEvery time we're about to eat a lunch or dinner a breakfast you know we'd all be sitting together and he and his guitar player he put a little picture of his little daughter up and he can I start crying and so I Would start sharing ideas that I was learning in the Bible and science and health\nSo for nine months I'm sharing these these thoughts and these ideas just not pushing it just kind of trying to just lovingly be compassionate about\nSo nine months later we show up in Galveston and they do a test or and they're on the test and I find that the whole as actually disappeared little pinpoint and they have no idea how that took place and they said there's no surgery need is\nJust wonderful to see him going healing powers through the pasture touching people around us ...\nAnd that was obviously you'll stepping stone to find the deciding at some point that that was way you'll focus was going to be absolutely\nWow so you have a ... you don't just see on a Sunday [laughter] when you're in trouble it sounds like you go to your pasta every day and have a ... radio ongoing relationship\nAnd that's the comforting part I'm never without my pastor\nThat's lovely are there any final ideas you would like to share all is a ... of the useful benefits of of knowing God through the Bible inside the house\nOne of the comforting things as a for many years I was single and you know thought about what ever find a wife suitable for me [laughter]\nPicking guy and so after a while I finally just gave up and and and I turned it over to go out and say okay you know God it's you or if it's going to be your responsibility\nYou know in my in my just going to walk and single blessing this but they're always seem to be a little void and ... just a materialistic selfish thinking but as soon as I\nTurned to the pasture and found just comforting ideas of goodness and completeness and then that that disappeared and as soon as I felt complete spiritually that's when I met my wife\n[noise] Mm well that's lovely and I'm One of the things that I've just loved about this past a of a mini is is is sometimes you can get very familiar with thoughts of\nBlood it sharing and yet the same thing that you've read over and over again one day it can just suddenly take on a whole new meaning and are not changing the truth to sharing but that just bring to light something ready fresh and new and your own experience\nAnd uh it's an exhaustive all sorts of good isn't it\nOh it's great you know that there's a statements in genesis they bring out the fear not for I Am with the end will bless the fear not neither be just\nThere's an statements in genesis they bring out this and they fear not for I Am Wednesday and will bless the\nFear not neither be discouraged me strong enough good courage fear or not or be afraid of them for the lord thank God he it is that does that

Would I Would go is your wife around anymore or\nI have a much younger very beautiful loving wife and I I like to say she's my current wife but she will tell you I'm your only wife\n[laughter] well I Would maybe together ask her okay because you could say you know I'm a guy I don't know all these things and is that\nIt you know it was brought up that maybe you had your monthly and and it is that maybe the problem why you were stuck in a in a locker room you know instead of going to the gym class because you had a problem and you didn't know what to do 'cause you weren't equipped for it gee\nYou know I had been whatever and that's ... yeah I Am home\nAgain but again I Can't say that her mother has to have a conversation with\nA wreck that I mean if you could have her find out and

good\nKid turns out that attendance was taken by her gym teacher and the gym teacher reported that she wasn't there and it was first period or second period or something\nWhere it affected the whole day so I get a robocall now ... where is my eighth grade where's the kid well it turns out she had spent the entire\nPeriod in the ladies' room she spent an hour and the ladies' room now I don't know what to say to her\nBecause I don't want to make it a bigger deal than it is because frankly I'm totally empathetic with they're cutting Jim\nAnd at the same time this can't happen again and the reason that can happen again isn't because we would not have excused or from Jim\nBut because I Need to know where my kid is I Need to know where she is this is not a casual thing we're in the post a

I never picked up a golf club wants my good me not want on is not one oh my goodness have not even swung a golf and I got a big iron I'm In coming up yeah the independent Bob\n... all by the way I was sort of an independent Bob just called me a few times just ranting I think he knew was um vacation he just ranting and raving ... Elizabeth Warren thing just sending them into outer space yeah he's just like this is just\nWell they they they believe that's a good thing to do that they\nBelieve that this is a good tactic you and I just kind of just in general if you just look at the tactics right now the left is using\nI mean politically we're not talking about the moms in restaurants we're not talking about you know the the the rank and file of the protesters talking about the people holding office yeah\nTheir political tactics I mean there may this is their mainstream political tactic and they believe\nStuff like this is going to work and and that's and you and I made sure that before he went on vacation when we were talking about cabinet and to understand this is the mainstream now yeah of the Democrat leadership in this country because we'll always get calls from people saying well this isn't the average Democrat\nIt's the average Democrat now representing you sure in Congress and in the Senate right this is the standard and we'll get to Elizabeth Warren too\nAnd uh the the three big problems that she by the way they might narrow it down just to to three well one one of the things I I Love was uh I I never believed in white privilege until Elizabeth Warren\nA white person makes the claim yes she's Native American you all white privilege that's white privilege ... runs on cultural appropriation\nYeah right I and and again they believe they're on the right track I Know it just it's just\nUnbelievable so we'll get to that uh the polls everything else you've got a great show up for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nTexas set to receive more rain today there's a couple of systems that will be providing moisture to the region in the Gulf of Mexico there's a low pressure systems and in the Pacific there's a low pressure area both of those systems funneling moisture right into southern Texas and the four corners region\nOr you just do the ... thing right and they thought that it struck disrupt the thing I you know with Grassley a basically would be the tactic they would use that's what they went with\nAn ex like they had that meaning they met all weekend about it okay we can get up and walk out [laughter]\nWhich ultimately they did or during the a committee vote on on on Capitol\nYou know and that you had come out here it's going outside and doing the press thing and all that but it wasn't that wasn't so much the ... that was like the protest after that they are they still voted yet and they still voted so there wasn't offensively anything you know it it will show about it\nBut they had the meeting that first weekend they had that meeting will just get up and walk out there is this ... this is a mainstream Democrats today\nThis this is not the protesters and we talked about how the protesters ... lead the party they lead the party they lead the call for the party but how many groups how many different causes and different protest groups are there this is why they have no direction because they're in every direction\nAnd it's it's it's crazy and then then I guess the the other point was so Elizabeth Warren then does DNA matter quite right does this does this destroyed transgender isn't mhm if DNA matters because remember the the the next thing is as as we all know\nUh we we've gone through the whole trans racial thing than the left just starting to embrace ... remember you're talking about Elizabeth Warren who was [laughter] before this one of the leading liberal icons [noise] you know\nNumber you're talking about Elizabeth Warren who was [laughter] before this one of the leading liberal icons\nYou know socialist icons\nSocial justice warrior ... who broke a ton of social justice warrior winds and regulations ... number one you were saying the DNA matters does it does so DNA matters across the board then and then it matters for ah your your sexuality it matters for your gender huh that writers for your race huh right is is that the\nIs that the whole point or or does it not in okay what's the determining factor of what you are then what is the what is the [laughter] [laughter] where does the decimal point go what is the what is the fraction that indicates that you are a particular ethnicity just great stop\nWell and if I were doing a debate with her on stage I Would say a former President Obama said race is just a social construct yes do you agree\n[laughter] and people don't forget about that because again what you know it that when a president\nObama ... just before he left office on believed it was the was the Atlanta for a New Yorker I forgot what I think it was ... he did a a an interview with and\nThey asked him you know why do you say that you're black when you know your ... right next mixed race soon and he said because I've come to know I've I've come to realize that race is a social construct ... it's what you think you are ... or so is that it now is that done now\nHas the lead moved on because when when you look at it\nThere were so many rules of the social justice warrior that Elizabeth Warren broke and they were completely quiet mhm totally silent mhm everything from cultural appropriation\nTo the fact that race apparently is no longer a social construct it has something to do with DNA\nThat's\nWhy are you using science [laughter] for him [laughter] remember when Benjamin bureau brought up the science on a on the doctor drew show he was threatened with violence\nSo you can't bring up the science that's wrong but see this is this is the madness of the left because there are so many different directions\nHow do you know which one is the\n... here's here's the thing when Trump says something the majority of what Trump says that they criticize in fact check this off the cuff mhm right it's it's an opinion or just the thought that he just boom roads out right and and and the insanity of the left\nWhich is I'm going to call them the whole my beer party from now on cars whatever Trump does like ... hold my beer I think that we'll watch what I'm going to say it's actually premeditated and thought out yes no planets\nThat they were trying they're trying to prove them wrong on something that she didn't give a half a second to he didn't give one one hundred and twenty fourth of a second [laughter]\n\nMy my favorite was the [laughter] water over one hundred and twenty fourth yeah maybe seal and it was a huge\nI with a gun [laughter]\nWe're in a swimming pool or if you know that that's it it really is the um that's the madness because they believe that something that's going to win for them look in her state in terms of you know her Senate seat\nYeah she's pretty safe like Dick Durbin he can get away with saying and are doing a lot of crazy things he's safe as long as he wants to\nThe seed yeah she's pretty safe like Dick Durbin he can get away with saying and are doing a lot of crazy things he's safe as long as he wants that seat but at least for the time being you want to enter the arena and twenty twenty for the big house well by the way not present the White House I mean yeah but [laughter]\nAlthough although Hillary was a contender for both\nUm [laughter] we ... do you have to get up on that stage and you have to bring them out but again you know those um those blue states where they're safe they can they can do the crazier things they can do the protester type attitude but do that up on stage you know we talked about this\nWas a few months ago when we were talking about what the the the pool of contenders in the primary season and twenty twenty will look like right\nThere he's going to have the top each other on\nHow much they hate Trump that will be gold number one you've got to show your anger and you've got to show how much you so the person who hates Trump more in terms of the perception by the voter or the rank and file Democrats\nMight get the nomination because that's the goal number one for them so but in order to do that they have to get up on that debate stage during the primary season\nAnd that's what they have to do they have to do the crazier and crazier and crazier because\nNo longer can you have a debate\nNo longer can you have a real discussion ... what are they going to say well the economy is suffering Mm as long as it holds between now and twenty twenty no a jobs we need more jobs ...\nWe have ... finding enough people right now I'm so you're the what are you going to do well you have it has to be about the hatred for Trump's so you're gonna have to display you know the one who hates them most is going to win always\nOr where it's going that we thought the only way that they could go if they were going to go more or less which is we're offering you everything for free yeah yeah and I mean ... ... and that we are the other game we yeah we do we we do have a fascist mindset and we do is to control\nA lot a lot of things we do believe in the intimidation of of ah the tactics out there we don't believe in the constitution of the United states would I by the way has become clear and we brought this up a few years ago and we were amazed\nAt the very little response so we got from Democrats on this front where we said look they don't really believe in the constitution we all know that they don't they don't believe in the Senate\nThey don't believe in the cars that by the way that gain ground over their vacation and you know the Senate has to go to the electoral college the electoral college just to go to the Senate has to go and what they what they may not realize it but that's when you get into not carrying that belief get you to the point of\nNot caring about individual rights because that's why the Senate exist that's why the electoral college or you know it exists\nBecause we're not a direct democracy were republic where constitutional Republican or a public why to protect individual rights that the Democrats and the ACLU used to care about right but now as we know they don't write and so you know that's where you've got to we really don't believe in America\nAnd so in order to get you to vote for us we'll give you as much free stuff as possible to me that's actually what the Democrats round I Know\nI I you're you're spot on and but the problem there is what\nCNN Jake Tapper and Chris Cuomo asking tough questions from oh Casio Cortez and ... you know separate interviews okay well how do you pay for it how do you pay for it but but but beyond that forget about the media ask ... wasn't so tough but they did ask the question\nOkay well how do you pay for it how do you pay for it but but but beyond that forget about the media ask ... wasn't so tough but they did ask the question\nIf your Hillary and you get back in in twenty twenty\nThe it used to be the boiling the frog slowly right okay we'll give you a little more free stuff and then we'll a little more free stuff you've got to go full on because you have Gillum and Florida promising the world will Casio Cortez promising to world Bernie's been promising the world\nCan all Harris now over the last couple of days yeah you know saying okay let's give everybody right now let's let's give people six thousand dollars a year that's the starting bright right let's just give cash to people right and and so uh so we're to the the the the free cash free health care and free college\nYeah and and they know they can't pay for it and the American voter knows they can't pay for it but how how do you do it if you're Hillary and you try and put up a plan of a little more free stuff no you've got to go full on like the rest of them did\nSomebody will get to the point where we talked about before the twenty sixteen election just offer every American a hundred thousand dollars and exactly or one ticket to the mega millions later this week yet [laughter] eight six six Ninety right out", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "22"}
