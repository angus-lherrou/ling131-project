{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "KDKA", "content": "Are true father and mother which is the source of our love and goodness and on selfishness\nAnd that source never runs drier gets weary we can constantly draw on it\nYou know Christ Jesus certainly did he said I cannot my own self do nothing and he also said I see not mine own will but the will of the father which has sent me and I have found that to be very good advice for satisfaction\nAnd I think Jesus summed up the most satisfying life in what are known as the two great commandments love God with all your heart and soul in mind and strength and your neighbor as yourself\nAnd then he goes into great detail about how exactly we do this on a human level in his sermon on the mount which is in the book of Matthew in the Bible chapters five six and seven and that can be anyone's guy so I think maybe that should get us started\nWell that's a great lead in here to our first question which is from a ... in Missouri and she writes early on I always thought having a husband children how good job where what was needed to experience this test\nEarly on I always thought having a husband children how good job where what was needed to experience a satisfying way but now that I have all those things I can see that there's more dissatisfaction so what do we need for truly satisfying life\nWill I Would say Lulu and now you know ah [laughter] you know and that's a step in the right direction um you see this kind of a experience that you're having is what causes us to go to something higher it drives us to God\nIt doesn't seem to matter how much good we have humanly without ... without the real spiritual substance of life we will never be satisfied first of all it is God has given you all that good and it's helpful if we recognize that\nWhat you can do now is use all those things as vehicles to a more satisfying life\nBy bringing God into the picture actually not only bring got into the picture but make sure your love of God is kept front and center in relation to everything that matters to you as you develop your relationship to God you will\nFind that you're able to love your family more do more for them do more with your job and\nYou know I say this from experience and my wife and I have always found that if we make a priority of knowing and serving God in our lives\nIt has helped our relationship beyond what I can say we are faithful to God and we love each other more out of that and it gives each of us something to bring to the table rather than you know looking to each other for satisfaction\nSo feeling you're one this with God makes all your relationships better so how do we do this well with our spouses and our children we can develop more God like qualities of love and kindness and patience and so forth which is the substance of your life\nUsing your job you can learn and express got like qualities of humility peacemaking and goodness holiness helpful in this and so forth\nAnd that's the substance of that activity which satisfies felt when I found that you know really no one or nothing on this earth can match the blessings and happiness and comfort in love and\nSatisfaction that come from God or divine love\nAnd the ... says blessed to be the lord who daily loaded with us with benefits even the God of our salvation\nAnd you know also I'll just share with you that in my marriage for example when I was uh thinking about marriage um even at that time in my life I was\nReally wanting to put God first because I knew God had all the best for me\nAnd so I was praying about should I get married um how should I think about this is this really the best thing I can do\nAnd as I was praying about it I was reading the text book of Christian Science which helps explain the Bible it's science and health with key to the scriptures that Mary Baker eddy wrote\nAnd I ran across this a couple of census answered my question and so see what you think about this but it said be not in haste to take the vow until death do us part\nConsider is obligations that its responsibilities it's relations to your growth and tea or influence on other lives and that for me was the answer I felt like in this particular case at this particular time\nYour influence on other lives and that for me was the answer I felt like in this particular case at this particular time\nWith this particular woman that\nMarriage would actually be a a strength to my spiritual growth I Would grow through developing that relationship and working in it and I have to say I haven't been disappointed [laughter] on that score a there's a lot of growth that goes with learning to you know be with somebody\nAnd also I feel like it's helped me and my life to have more influence and do good for others and and both of us at ... actually came to that agreement that we felt by by being married that we could\nDo more for others and and that's proved to be the case so I felt like you know just to give you an example that's just a way of taking it even higher\nI Love that mark it's such a practical answer really gives you some specific steps that you know we all can tank that's neat now into our next question from I'm Dorothy in Boston and she writes what are some practices I can adopt\nTo stay happy common I'm stressed each day I find that sometimes it feels like a roller coaster and I just want to stay in a worry free state of joy\nYeah that's good in doors the I say I've discovered this really does take discipline you know I found to get off the rollercoaster\nThis rollercoaster that you're talking about I think it's something that we all have to deal with at some point\nAnd um I found that the roller coaster actually comes from focusing on the world you know thinking like a worldly woman or man in a world of lacking competition and comparisons and pride striving for self worth looking to others for validation and so forth\nAnd that keeps us on a rollercoaster with you know some days we have highs and some days we have loews\nAgain I feel first of all the desire to discover and express our spiritual self who we really are as God's Children\nFind our connection or one this with God is what will really steady us and bring that deep joy and satisfaction that we want to feel especially if we want to contribute more to the good of the world a piece of the world you know and help others\nI Know for me early on in my spiritual growth in study in the in the scriptures and so forth I I was definitely on a roller coaster and\nUh I I discovered it and and uh what I what I discovered was that I Would study the Bible I Would pray and I would get to feeling really good then really hot and\nThen once I started feeling really good I sort of left my studies and my prayer behind you know I kind of is like almost like you know I didn't need God's so much because things were going so well but inevitably I'd always start you know heading back down\nThe roller coaster and I I ... I went back to my books and my prayer and I get back up and things will be going good and\nAnd then I'd drop it again and I found myself going up and down that way and\nFinally I saw you know more why don't you just stay with it you know even in the good times even when you're feeling really inspired ... day with your studies stay with your prayer\nKeep God in your life and by doing that I found that I've been able to maintain a very steady life and happiness and satisfaction\nAnd also if you'd like to know I mean there's some things I Do specifically each day to keep my\nAnd happiness and satisfaction and also if you'd like to know I mean there are some things I Do specifically each day to keep myself inspired I I pray the Lord's Prayer every day\nFor one thing and I don't I don't just say the words but I really think about it uh it's amazing how I can continue to be inspired by that\nEvery day I go over some other things that you know like a Mary Baker eddy wrote a scientific statement of being in it just a really wonderful paragraph that just\nGets your thought on the right track of you know that we're spiritual and not material that were gods expression his image it reminds us of that\nUm and and key to it for me has been the Bible lesson a weekly Bible less than that the Christian Science church puts out it's just phenomenal\nIt's a citations from the Bible and then passages from science and health with key to the scriptures that throw light on the spiritual meaning of the Bible verses [noise]\nUm and it's on a particular subject and can be subjective about God or about\nA life different subjects\nAnd you study that all week and it helps me pray\nIt gives me ideas to take into my day with whatever I'm doing\nAnd that has been a phenomenal as far as as a constant practice and I'll I'll just say one other thing you could read Jesus sermon on the mound again in chapters five to seven in the book of Matthew in the Bible [laughter] that are really help and that'll also give you a lifetime of things to do to stay\nOn the grace of God each new day is Eddie says in science and health\nWhat we most need is the prayer a fervent desire for growth in grace expressed in patients weakness love and good deeds so keep it up\nRight you know this next question is just very short and to the point they write how important is dedicated Bible study and prayer just finding satisfaction\nWell I Will say Bible study of prayer happens to be my method for finding what I feel has been lasting satisfaction and for me satisfaction means that I feel peaceful content you know not wanting anything more than what I have\nEven being willing to let go of everything in this world for a higher purpose if that's necessary\nYou know which to me would be to bless others to glorify God I find a greater sense of gratitude comes with being satisfied also getting into your car for example to drive somewhere and being\nNaturally just grateful for it it brings out a greater sense of love to love in your home the people in your life being so grateful\nFor even your pet you know your cat or dog getting to spend time with them knowing that all this good is coming from God\nAn infinite source of good and all the things on this earth or just symbols of the goodness of God so we don't need to hang on to any of it while we're you know grateful for the simple so good that is not what satisfies\nIf everything we have is gone tomorrow we have the love of God and eternal abundant goodness of God with us and we will always have everything we need it's truly not put things in fact I'll just share something that happened to me one time I was a\nVisiting inmates in jail in the city jail and uh I was spending a few days a week there actually and you know are talking with them about a spiritual things and helping them transform their lives\nAnd I loved it man I loved I loved getting that way even though you know it was a sacrifice to me because there are a lot of things I wasn't doing to do is but I I did love it and\nI went I remember one day and when you go into the jail to visit somebody ah it's anything but home in you know you hear ...\nLocked behind you and then you go into another area next door locks behind you and pretty soon you can get to where you're going and I was sitting there waiting for an inmate\nTo come in and visit ah that I had called and um I had this overwhelming sense of just feeling at home it was amazing I mean it was just it wasn't just a thought or anything it was just uh I just felt so at home\nJust feeling at home and it was amazing I mean it was just it wasn't just a thought or anything it was just that I just felt so at home\nAnd it was so astonishing to me that I I kind of looked around and I observed like where I was and I noticed I'm sitting in this little room with a cinder block wall that are painted shiny beige with Plexiglas windows\nAnd shiny tile floor in the square gray tile center\nFor asset lighting sitting at a steel cable I mean it was anything about homey and yet I felt at home and I had to think it had to be because\nI I was feeling God I mean I was really praying tests so that could help these people and I I feel that I was feeling the Christ which is the spirit of God right then and there and I felt at home so again it's\nIt's not that the things it's it's what what are we thinking what are we doing\nWell my other question they have time for the day but for anyone who has not heard the answer to that question they can go to Jeff age stash online dot com and search how

still a couple of days and there were she knew ... and ... at least one day and maybe as many as two or three days because she started talking\nOn on academics on on a tax cuts yeah the Republican Party is moving more conservative\nOn on spending uh on on a on tariffs and we're not talking about China we're talking about the other ones and no we're moving in the Republican Party is moving in a more socialist right a a a a a position remembers we brought you friday the Commerce Department numbers and a half\nOf the increase we talk about the increase in the GDP half of that increase is due to government spending mhm not not the private market booming now half of it is the private market and preventing and we agree with that\nBut we look at what's coming down the pike here with what Republicans have done and we're extremely concerned about where the economy is going to go but to me when we talked about you know for example tariffs to get and you've got is as I said on friday have conservative lost their economic\nMind ... because you have people that are conservatives that would absolutely be against the increased a government causing the increase or in prices in goods and services because the goods are going up\nAnd they're claiming that's a that's a good thing that will actually make an economy do better actually two responses on that on friday no no no no no tears makes the economy better know doesn't\nKnow we live in ... and so people that were conservative I rent is delusional state\nOf increasing prices helps the economy it doesn't\nIt helps the ... the companies or the industry that has designed to protect beyond that no\nBut when we get to I mean we've been talking about the blame game in the whole civility thing because on many issues out there and we talked about civility when we talk about look you need to get along with everybody well let's talk about the issues you and I've taught gone down this road before and we've looked at what the left as promoting in this country right now and what they're promoting is something that we can't compromise on there is no compromise\nAnd if there is no compromise what do you do as a nation on

I was back in New York and went to church my parents so yeah just blew me away this whole thing\nYou want to you know what I watched a while we were on a break recently I've watched the movie a spotlight a that was the movie on the Boston Globe you know they had their their spotlight division for many years and they did the\nBasically the expos they there are in in Boston and the the process of kind of following that you know through the years\nAnd at the time that the movie came out there was a lot that wasn't known and then you saw the uh the authorities come out about a Pennsylvania Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania and then the latest about you know from buffalo and everything else\nUm but that movie was kind of startling it was when I re watched it it was even more startling\nYou know it was it but they said in the movie basically what we said one of the characters in the movie\nI'm just said you know can you believe it can I go back to church essentially could I ever go back to church again\nFor cover electronics here's your forecast\nYou missed a chance this weekend to be at a part of the country to get out and take a drive and see some of the beautiful fall foliage you're actually passed the peak season for many locations around the country\nIn that home\nYou know do when you when you hear these horrific stories of children being tied up and you know locked in cages are rooms or closets\nAnd are being starved and and all of this well that there are many we could if we wanted to allow that in our society we could just say OK authorities canal just walk into homes at will and to just to see if any crime is being broken or committed but you\nAre in one of the neighbors are of the shooter\nThe synagogue shooter was was talking on you know Fox News saying I didn't even have a new there was no clue that this guy would there was a white supremacist I I didn't know and I wish there was a way to\nYou know to tell I Wish there was a way how do you know what even in a person's part I mean maybe ... people close to them do um but then beyond that how do you know\nHow do you change their heart ah and how do you predict whether or not because there are plenty of people filled with actual\nHate when we don't mean people on social media just talking you know negatively about someone we mean people filled with actual hate that are potentially deadly well there are a number of laws we could pass to keep because\nUh you uh you know this guy was on a apparently a a social media site I'd never heard of a that was ... was a social media site for white supremacists\nA social media site I'd never heard of a that was ... was a social media site for white supremacists\nAnd\nOkay so your we could say that participation in such a site or is against the law we can say that I'm speaking out with hatred in your heart real hatred\nFor groups of people are based on their ethnicity or or or culture that's against the law we could pass a number of\nLaws send it I mean how do you change for freedom of speech ... part of the reasons that freedom of speech speech exist is so people do proclaim what they think so you know who they are new know exactly how they all you do by taking away their free speech rights as what you send them underground\nThat's what you do and and when there's pressure from you know society because the reason maybe I'm guessing the reason and I think it's a solid theory here that the neighbor wasn't aware of of this kind of you know hatred in this\nPerson's heart is because in our society\nWe don't tolerate it morally speaking forget about the legality of it all forget about what can be done legally morally we don't tolerate that because the overwhelming majority of people don't have this kind of hatred and evil and there are no\nAnd you cannot ... and and that's what it comes down to there's there's no way of knowing for what ever reason whatever motivation a person might have\nI mean think of all of the reasons that might be stated a in terms of the motivation of of any mass killer\nIn our history\nThe list is very long [noise] you know I I was just I was going through the headlines are just yesterday just in real clear politics and and it was a it was just really interesting a Donald Trump is a shameless liar\nThat's the headline of an article written by former president for rock Obama got his my witnessed or no one family Detroit News be honest we hate each other\nBut the one I liked the most was Justin Fox Bloomberg's headline if you ignore the news\nAmerica actually seems pretty nice if you ignore the new view ignore the news it seems pretty nice well I I just I thought it was you know I didn't even read the article I just I saw it but I but it's it's something that you and I've talked about before where\nWe've we've said a for and and I mentioned for example everything going on in the news and you walk into the voting booth everybody greets you how you doing what's going on\nYou know you're voting location what's going on good to see a oh the weather's bad Oh thanks for voting pick up your thing thanks you take care of everyone now has I mean everybody goes and it's very orderly very nice but I don't think I've ever had a non pleasant time ever voting in my life right well that's actually the reality of it you know of what goes on\nFor the vast majority tens of millions of people out there one thing we talk about you know the the news media\nAnd you and I have talked about this a lot that they're always you know and and it just because it's it's it's\nThe news the news is what's unusual that's one of the first things I learned in journalism class is news is the unusual right that's why that's why murders are news mhm because for the most part they don't happen to the vast majority of people not to discount that murder isn't bad\nBut the fact is the majority of people the majority of the time\nNever encounter a a a murder right many ... some families do but the ...\nThe majority of the time never encounter a a a murder right many ... some families do but the majority of families in this country do not when you look at the three hundred and roughly thirty million people in this country still mass\nShootings mass murders\nAre quite low but when you look at the uh\nPsychopaths that exist out there uh when I was just watching and how many uh documentaries every watched on it but it was another one on on Ted Bundy yesterday ...\nAnd talk you know the going through the transcripts of his girlfriend at the time I'm telling you just haunting yeah she was trying to figure out\nIs he\nIs he not and going through that progression of her there's no campaign and then sent you know since he's brother ... the Ted 'cause the exact same thing\nShuts the door on the FBI and you know how dare you this isn't this isn't my brother and then finally you know started thinking about it and said well okay I guess I have to\nDeal with reality and it's not that it gives any you know um there was no owners sort of or or responsibility on the part of his\nBrother necessarily because it was as if you know he was learning at ... he really was learning about you know what his brother might be capable of doing or was capable\nIt turned out of doing a A N and that's the case with any of them you know the neighbor here of the shooter at the at the synagogue you know you think of that and I'm sure in in his mind is wondering wow is there something maybe that I should have paid attention to\nYou know closer is there something that I could have done we all do this and by the way this is how we get to this point I was saying there must be a solution because in our hearts\nThere should be one this in our hearts it doesn't make sense but we're trying to make sense of something that will ... the overwhelming majority of people will never be able to connect with\nIn our minds we don't think this way we don't have this kind of evil in our hearts we don't have this kind of hatred for people it's quite the opposite we have love and respect for people and we can talk about disagreements\nBut I always put it like this it's like a family you could sit around and and if you go spend you know enough time [laughter] with your family you can sit around and you can have the ... you can have concerns and arguments and very passionate arguments on very important things\nBut the moment somebody else walks in that door and starts threatening interview and starts going after any of you that's when you stand up together and say wait a minute hold on here\nBecause when you put this all in perspective\nWe're always going\nTo have very passionate discussions about American politics that's going to be the case in we should be the case\nWhen you\nTalk about the the tactics right now being used\nDo away with the process do away with the constitution\nDo away with the electoral college all of these things\nThat are ultimately about giving individual's rights and and instead we're looking at more and more taking away those the people's rights the individual rights\nOf Americans that becomes a real threat but it is not something that is in most\nOf Americans that becomes a real threat but it is not something\nThat is in most people's minds something you respond\nTo with anything else but a vote or a debate it's that simple and that's who we are everyone greens most good people grieve when when there's a loss of life that's who we are as humans that's who we are\nAs a society the the people the very few\nThat have these deranged mines that are that have evil in their hearts we'd like to be able to come up with a solution to try and predict it\nAnd try and stop it ahead of time and I I Wish there were way but as as it stands right now it's just impossible as you mentioned Gary sometimes in a society it is going to happen\nWe can learn from it but it doesn't mean that will be able to predict the next one or stop or prevent the next one we looked to learn from it because we all want to stop the loss of life in a situation like this", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day":
