our gifts to Pete tribute go knows what it is I don't remember if it was very brief I remember that I mean that that it felt like it lasted about one second [laughter] do you do you know what ride that was\nYes I Do actually is one of the first rides I actually was on it it also had a little bit of a what we call a corkscrew which pays years just gave you exactly on that that was\nUm why should I think it was called the ... or something along those lines and was very short it only had that one little uh the one that one little area but\nYes I'm very familiar with it and uh uh in today's standards it probably like a kitty ride but back then it was a it was pretty good and and of course Opry land with a great place to attach to put an amusement park right next to\nThe er the opulent hotel and the and the grand old Opry\nAnd I have to admit it was a how shall I put an exhilarating\nAh I most of your day it definitely woke me up I remember that that uh we had been quite busy we're doing my show from a from Opry land and and the couple of our staffers who were there with me and uh I guess you could say that I was a little bit tired at this point and and uh he woke me up Yes sir [laughter]\nThere'd be no doubt about that [laughter] certainly did [laughter]\nIt was actually called the ... cannon ball of fire is if I really out\nOf that ad well anyway I'll put it this way it didn't lead me say this was awful just be saying well\nIt was okay and since you know as as a gift to the park I got to ride for free okay that's fine but I paid to do it again no not really victim again of course that's a that's just me what are some of the place was out there when you think Halloween and thrill rides\nPete tribute go what places do you think about\nWell there's some great ones out there that started I actually uh uh in I'm In law actually started a I guess it was around September late September and go all the way until Halloween some of the places that come to mine of course the universal studios\nAll which is their hallowed Harlem Nights at universal studios and that's all based on a you know pretty much a American horror story the walking dead the shining great place to go a pretty scary now if you want to go the reverse in\nA place where you have to be totally scared and and ah you know they they do some good shows but it's a great place to go with the kids of course you've got Disney World\nAnd Disneyland that have the Mickey not so scary Halloween a I guess a park in all in for the kids and of course you got the ... are you a Halloween parade and of course the fireworks to happy hollow wishes or over the other thing uh some\nOf the better ones are as we just mentioned to that of course Six Flags and all the Six Flags locations had the ...\nWhich is your cleric classic scare zones all you know where you go into these mazes and stuff like uh the ... the the sewer soles in er which is layer and places like that um\nAnd of course the the point has got hollow our weekends or with the great pumpkin or fast that that goes on there are ... zombie high school shows the entertainment is absolutely amazing my daughter actually had to audition for one of these shows at Six Flags and are they really are they really get into this big\nUh I mean even the chain stores sound extremely we'll plus save and changed the names of the rides sometimes\nAre for example over its heroines a which is a Carol wins in Charlotte North Carolina uh they've got an actual fleet street uh where you can go through the cobblestones of the street and of course demented scare crows and zombies and ... and of course\n... to hide or be be found there as as well as a you know a bunch of other characters are\nFrom a lot of the novel is a great place to do so there is a whole bunch of places that I Would say there's about maybe two or three dozen or that actually do this or and or they're just a you know the rise is still open the weather's fairly decent and people have fun\nLet's talk about the term age appropriate over how many of these are places you wouldn't you wouldn't take your kid even if your kid loves the scary rides\nWell the good thing about all these places whether it's universal studios knots berry farm which is in a ... that's ... that's ... basically Anaheim all we mentioned to the fight fast and the phantom lights over Kenny would a house screaming Williamsburg Tampa Busch Gardens\nAre and of course ... and he's not so scary Halloween all these places that we've mentioned plus others um during the day you know during the day\nIt really isn't like that or it all happens pretty much when the sun goes down and ... awake and that's pretty much uh most of these places so if you if you have kids in there and they're pretty frightened you probably don't want to go at night to these amusement parks but if you do there were scare zones their actual zones\nWhere you'll you know you'll be scared and there'll be people that will jump out of corners and of course the mazes and and and all the different things that go on the actual entertainment themselves in the places that are non scare zones\nAre are very family friendly\nAnd very age appropriate so uh and and of course they they normally will uh will tell you it it it is easily mark where these places are where you can bring your kids even at night or just to see the shows are we just have a good time on the rise and not have to worry about\nYou know being totally you know scared or having a kid have a traumatic experience with that\nPut another way that the lawyers have made sure that none of these places are going to subject your kids do something that might make mommy and daddy call a lawyer\nTo absolutely I mean that's the uh the people that are here you know and again my daughter actually did this for several years she loved it and she had a fun time\nWhile going through college and and I'm a viewer rules and regulations that they follow you don't normally if you're an older person you know that they're probably not going to try to scare you as if maybe or a teenage gals\nOr or something along those lines so you know there are different marks and different people that they'll they'll actually go and give the full one hundred percent presentation and others\nThey know when to back down and do they know if ... if if they scared you\nThat probably the leave you alone if if if it's really really bothering you and again that's all part of the training program one of the reasons why I like a season isn't parts and what they do and how they train people\nIn order to make sure that it is a very good experience for for many uh and again there are there are there scares owned and there are ... are you know if you don't need to scare zone then you know something is going to happen\nOne of the reasons you you just mentioned a amusement parks have decided\nThat uh if you have something for everyone I show for the older people rides for the younger people kitty rides and and little shows for a younger people have food that pretty much anyone can try\nWhether the fast food or actual sit down restaurants or you will find them at the amusement parks because it's a way for the entire family to actually get together\nAnd enjoy a day I mean even the older people uh you've got scooters that they can go are you know around with the scooter is and I have to worry about the walking you know the miles as they say four miles\nOn average that you would at an amusement park\nSo I think that's one of the things that was really really intelligent it was that ah that means imports and not just geared for kids anymore they're good for all family members and that's why they do so well\nStay with us more to compete

they've gotten with the passage of time [noise]\nDo any of these thrill rides a emulate a a real life version of let's say a video game we mentioned a movie like a like a ghost busters up front about video games\nWell not necessarily video games because um they're licensed and and then there are certain details that you need to to follow but but you didn't mention ah like sitcoms like The Simpsons for example or different events like track of course the movie you'll find the universal studios\nAh but as far as an actual mimic it it does mimic what goes on in fact nowadays the big thing happens to be on the old would roller coaster that really are not intense\nWhat you do is you put on these four D. glasses and they cover your entire face a wire going through a smaller roller coaster and feeling the wind in the breeze and to your face\nOr what you're getting is you're actually getting a simulation ride or maybe out in outer space or something or or some other planet or or some other situation where now all of a sudden that ride that normally only goes twenty or thirty miles an hour and goes up and down maybe a little bit\nBecause now more intense or so that seems to be another

inside the bracelet so that someone could not come up and pretend they know that child and file Hi Tammy\nBecause of the names on the inside but if a child gets lost\nThen it's easy to find their parents to accommodate them\nThat's an interesting thought utterly oh of to say the least uh and encouraging one of the safety in general a tribute goes that some people it's practiced and all of these are major theme parks and ah and scary rides\nYes it absolutely has to be because of course the the life blood of any amusement park is directly proportional to the amount of accidents incidents
