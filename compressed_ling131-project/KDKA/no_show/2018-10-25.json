packages that the Clintons received my guess is that the Obama Secret Service detail does the same of why the others would have been suspicious I don't know\nThat that's a good question uh and and I guess it's not clear to me whether they they were open but didn't explode or they just weren't open in some cases they joined or it opened apparently\nThat's what you know that's what I was wondering tell you they know not open\nAnd but I just you know just out there what made these other people say you know high this type of just the fish is it just doesn't\nFeel right doesn't look right now ...

have no indication personally that that uh although I certainly have not condemn the the anti tax I have no reason to believe that the\nThe confrontations with the likes of Ted Cruz and Mitch McConnell were organized by quote the Clinton machine I have no such knowledge and just curious how you know\nThey they they simply will go to a game of death um you know because I'm\nOnly ... who who will go to an end to measure how much a with\nThe Clinton machine is basically um Mm it's built around a whole group of people who just real law let this go they hate our president so much and they think I hate him too and that's the only reason I Know this stuff\nWell all I can say is that ah that while I certainly have seen a lack of condemnation of such activities I have yet to see any linkage between the antifa groups and be quote Clinton machine\nNor have I seen any linkage between this bombing attempt at the bottom and get tips and the the quote Clinton machine there there is the remnants of the Clinton machine out there but uh the linkage escapes me back in the moment\nAnd to be quote Clinton machine there there is the remnants of the Clinton machine out there but the linkage

President Trump should but here's what I my thoughts on this says how do you know it's not the Democrats doing this to rally up to face to get him out to vote you don't know and it\nWe know that is what I'm saying maybe it is and doing it to rally up their people to get him out the vote that because like where I live in the streets to I'm a I'm voting for a ... he can't get a fund for many

about it is not figuring it out to skip in Burlington, Vermont welcome\nInto a little I'm fine thank you listen to the I heard a gentleman say the packages were delivered did not have cancellations on this sense\nYeah the well the package that that was delivered to CNN was addressed to John Brennan first of all why would you send a package to CNN\nWhen it was supposed to go to John Brennan who's not hang around CNN secondly that package was delivered by a delivery service that is why the posted wasn't capital okay then why did you put postage on under the first place but there are a lot of unanswered questions here\nYeah I understand that if you were willing to do draw attention to the Clinton was than you would put it through the mail\nI don't understand why why if you wanted to draw attention to the Clintons you would put it through the mail I miss that\nWell because of the secret service\nSo why why if you wanted to draw attention to the Clintons you would put it through the mail I'm missing that\nWell because of the secret service\nThe secret service checks everything that sent to the Clintons trust me and and the same thing with the Obama detail\nYeah I understand that that was saying is if they want to draw to whoever it is a is a Democrat is doing it the law to draw attention to it\nI I guess I'm missing why using a delivery service as opposed to the male would draw more attention if you said a prominent person a pipe bomb you're going to draw attention\nYou know I understand that but I think that er ... when I say is if you want to draw attention to themselves they would put it through the mail there so the secret service would find it\nWith the secret service believe me any package that goes to the Clintons goes to the secret service trust me same thing with the Obamas any former president and they do not open their own male trust me on that skip\nA ... it it is always vetted by somebody else a Chester and said ...
