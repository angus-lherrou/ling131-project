Europe isn't going to be able to make up the majority of the story being lost if we have had and civilian aircraft got hit a real big in in in July uh last week economic indicators coming out that ... you know because of the tariffs are that were put into place just about a little ... about a week and a half ago\nThat it was starting to hurt a manufacturing not only in China but the indicators in the United states you could see them going down as well you and I talked about this many times you can screen that you want to get\nThe trade imbalance down but the reality is the only thing that matters is economic growth that's a strong thing that the president has had right now you know that there are people in the White House like Larry Kudlow might not be Wilbur Ross might not be Peter Navarro\nBut you know the ... and they're telling him you cannot have\nThese kind of massive tariffs with Europe the United states Mexico and China it's going to kill your economic growth if you wish to be president in twenty twenty you got to reverse course got you got to come up\nWith a ... a deal if you wish to isolate China politically you probably can survive that but you cannot isolate the United states from Europe Canada and Mexico you can't do that\nOh you can't do that and so uh the the fact that this deal was done so quickly at the last second knowing the administration knowing that look Congress is not going to approve just a free trade deal\nAnd you're going to go in there and say okay fine NAFTA has gone and nothing replaces is going into the going into the midterms\nAnd then uh wanting to have economic growth in two thousand Nineteen and twenty twenty and you just said ... gone massive tariffs on China\nWon't deal with Europe you've got advisors to the president saying you can't do this did you hear that a Christian or was the one they say that was one that that got everybody to come down\n... ... ... and there was the one right re nuts and I'm like oh really [noise]\nWell I mean the reality is is that again uh you you head into the mid term you don't have something done you're not going to get anything done uh on the Mexico deal so you're left with nothing or you get this when and claim you know you can at least claim that you're selling more dairy to Canada\nIf you can if you can call it a win which if you're selling more it's it's not less well look we so we ... we said this already that they're you know to try to to try to regulate and international economy and sorry I Know people don't want an international\nEconomy but the reality is you can't stop it\nBut you can I can stop your ... you can isolate yourself but you can't stop it it's impossible but when you have as we talked about in Mexico per capita were a day if you look at the trade going back ... back uh back and forth across the border\nAnd it's a tough thing to figure out because as we said before remember forty percent of what comes in from Mexico when I'm On a good comes in from Mexico forty percent of that good was made in the United states\nAnd the average product has crossed the border three or four times what was it four times they say it was four tires and we were suddenly in Mexico to begin with per capita that's their population for every dollar they they you know they sent to us we sent them three dollars they're smaller country\nThey've a third of the ... you know close to a third of the population of the United states Canada as like what one eight of the population in the United states\nAnd we were uh selling them like for every dollar they set us you know for every dollar you know we bought as in you know per capita that's per person in the United states of Canadian products per capita they were buying roughly eight to nine to ten dollars\nOver the last couple of years per capita is what we were selling them there were smaller country you're not going to equalize the trade deficit\nIt's impossible oh there's no way you'll ever get there oh I don't care how much more dairy you're going to sell them\nThey'll never consume as much as the United states wanted me to be close no so ah ah again we'll see what comes out of this and it probably we you know start leaking out hopefully in the ... next couple of weeks especially since\nNow goes before Congress and we'll update on what's in there\nFor ... here's your forecast\nGoing to pick up a lot of moisture for Southern California and western Arizona as the remnants of hurricane Rosa come ashore through the early part of the week there's a low in the Pacific that's combining with the system that will create some unsettled weather\nThe word coming out of those meetings is that mentioned was a yes\nA\nFlake in fact announced that he was going to vote yes all of a sudden he gets cornered in an elevator\nThis is the difference between um\nA well this is exactly what ... what really got us here was the idea of putting all this on TV in the first place because now the left feels empowered to be able to change the landscape by screaming by shouting at you\nAnd they will be thanks to Jeff Flake\nThey they believe they can win they in fact one of those shouting at him and that elevator was all over social media on friday this is why we go direct\nGoing direct means getting in your face which means expect more of that were ever you are if you're a lawmaker oh I'm Sorry if you're a Republican lawmaker\nThey don't see they don't care about flakes hatred for the president they don't care about his disdain for see I don't know if he was looking to coon by his situation now he\nHe knew he wasn't going to win in November So he decided not to run then he of course has been going off on the president on a number of things holding up procedures and and and essentially are a number of items\nHostage so he can get his way\nHe was ... going to the left repeatedly but see Mr flake they don't care about you or your disdain for Trump you can be in agreement for that disdain with them they don't care 'cause you're still the bad guy\n\nSo he goes in and he of course decides he's going to hold up to vote\nI'll I'll support it in committee but I'm not going to support it on the broad vote well\nThere you have the essentially the door open for others to say okay we support that as well so now you have the background check\nNot in this is not an investigation no one does not know it it has a background check with a series of interviews\nIt is they've done several all ready they're gonna do another one and the scope is limited and see the liberals got on onto the president for limiting the scope of this is only about ... the accusations but it does include the Ramirez accusations not just the Ford accusations right\nSo now you have again the claim being made and now it's going to have been by the way we could have done this\nJuly thirtieth with a Ford accusations\nAnd you got what the FBI going and doing interviews they will not make a decision they will just hand their report to the White House the White House will send it to the Senate that's how the all of this is going to work so you delayed it by\nA week or\nIf you're the Democrats you realize this thing is going to go nowhere and you start screaming perjury while the house isn't gonna bring up perjury charges perjury for what exactly what\nSpecifically and where's the proof that he lied about it see the problem with the the Ford allegations\nIs that you cannot they they think it's impossible to prove or disprove based on what has been present well\nThey initially jumped on the fact that there were a a of friends of a Ford who said he lied when he said I'll but he lied about his drinking\nRight out yeah right\nHow just how is that I you know he talked about the fact that he drank and mhm\nAnd in high school he writes very still like spear right you know it and you're because you would have to get down and he said he never order in ever said he ... he never he said he never blacked out right now but he said he fell asleep after drinking mhm which might have you know but but how do you [laughter]\nWell I didn't get much reading that you you don't know if he blacked out or not so how do you get 'em on perjury for that but I don't I don't understand well you know what's interesting here is if we're going to go off on that then then what about every ... person\nWhat about every person who wants to run for president\nBecause I don't know I remember a bronco bomb on the and and\nAh and him smoking pot and the story of him ... paying Arnold is but they're just sending the perjury of it oh no no no I Know the better but but the point is the perjury is what goes back to we want to label him as a bad guy\nHe's a liar he's a blackout fall down drunk right\nWell\nThen this is and then you've got to push back of course on Sunday from a Lindsey Graham and and others are where it was you know look this guy's not stumbling drunk\nBut essentially goes back to label labeling him Kavanaugh\nAs such from high school or gosh ah I thought we set that standard with Bill Clinton with with ah with Brock Obama and others oh it only matters is if he's if he leans right\nIf he's a threat to the left then we're going to shout well we never you never heard of a guy drinking beer in high school really\nWell I I what I also love was how they move the goal post were first on friday a and part of Saturday\nIt was he's two part just because of his reaction attacking the Democrat asked the data that he was ... that that he was too partisan right and and can't cannot serve he doesn't have he he doesn't have it takes because he's too ... well the part that turned into because then the\nThe uh uh the report came out about ... Britain's Ginsburg back in twenty ah sixteen where she said ah that um\n[noise] uh\nShe calls Trump fake her ... she getting involved in politics you shouldn't be getting involved in politics and this is a direct accusation at you by individuals mhm he didn't take on and say the entire Democratic Party he said you\nWell I have written in in one story or because there was no promise a that he could he could a ... he could rule without bias or something to that extent\nAnd I thought are you kidding me you've got Sotomayor on tape on record saying it is the job of judges\nAnd justices to legislate from the bench\n\nThe whole thing is this is it because if it were another let's say Elena Kagan that the president nominated now there would still be objections he must be up to something that would probably be the objection [laughter] if Trump he must be up to something\nI mean he could have nominated Merrick Garland oh no no no no no no we look further into Merrick Garland a nice the wrong choice I mean it it it would have been something some kind of objection but for the media is\nThat there's no promise that Kavanaugh would leave is biased as side right now is you what first of all that they still don't get it\nRight but then they dropped that ... they dropped that in became his temperament it became his anger it wasn't that it was directed at that because once against bird\nThing came out of the women Ginsburg has been political all the time and then they had to drop that when they went to the next thing they moved the goalposts again which is his temperament and you know Feinstein has gone to the you know as petition or the or the or the ADA too uh to change their um\n... they're um [noise] uh uh their ranking up him as a from well qualified and because of his temperament because of his screen or because of his anger\nMhm yeah right\nThat's where they've gone I mean and so it's just they just keep moving the goalposts above Nichols holds becoming a goalpost because Grassley\nAnd flake let it happen they allow them\nTo move the goalpost and here we are and it will be two weeks\nEssentially passed when it should have happened the vote so that's on them ... ... ... but did they have the numbers last week while they wouldn't have without flake\nYou're talking about friday this broader either they had the ... they didn't have the numbers and had no choice well apparently this is where it their changed recording goal reports this flight was able to convince the others a handful of others to get on board and support the background check", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "01"}
