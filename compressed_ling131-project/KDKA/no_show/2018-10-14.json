people on one side of this a line like ... who was killed people around the globe we do know is whether or not this instance falls on what side of that line\nCBS News State Department reporter currently Edwards says the administration seems to be taking a cautious approach in part because of its ties to the Saudi kingdom\nAnd critics let's say that the president is already on taking some pressure off of\nThe kingdom and Saudi Arabia and saying that if even if they didn't do this we're still going to continue doing business with that uh senators on the health things that they should be a reason to stop those commitments that we have to Saudi Arabia it's a hundred and ten\nBillion dollars that the Saudis are buying in terms of US military equipment so that is a lot of money and the president is arguing listen I don't want to jeopardize the business that's happening between the U.S companies and Saudi Arabia because other countries are going to come in and fill that void like China\nAnd Russia but at this point the question as well if it is proven that Saudi Arabia\nIs to fault did actually murder ... shouldn't this a commitment is military agreement and this sale a be in jeopardy and that's what senators are arguing that the White House has yet to say that that would be the case\nAnd there's clearly a difference between how the White House who's approaching that could show ... compared to the senator's we heard from from the Foreign Relations committee\nYeah so it's really a disconnect um in terms of how they want to approach the situation the Trump Administration is saying we need to get the facts here yes the Turks say that they have evidence and as you read earlier the Washington Post is reporting that they have\nBoth video and audio of this murder happening but the U.S does not yet\nA claim that they believe that that is the case they haven't seen everything lined up that completely pros are the allegations that the Turks are making\nLet's not let all the rumors dominate the conversation before we talk about the repercussions\nThat the Saudis will potentially see\nOn the other side of the coin you have senator is on the health saying let's put the threats out there had of what we know happened so that the Saudis know that they can't do this that they can't kill and journalists to say bad things about the leadership and Saudi Arabia\nAnd get away with it says two different kind of tactics here and we're going to have to say if the White House um get the hat and starts playing out any threats\nBefore a conclusion is kind of two in this

sat down with Republican senator Joni Ernst of Iowa voted in favor of Kavanaugh\nWill I Do think that judge Kavanaugh was eminently qualified I did support him in my vote I also do believe that Dr Ford did experience some sort of trauma in her lifetime\nUm I don't believe it was Brett Kavanaugh that perpetrated a that that intimate crime against or that I think she was outed um she wished to remain anonymous\nAnd unfortunately she was outed and she faced those same threats against her who\nDo you blame for the housing\nI work I Do blame the Democratic committee staff\nAnd what do you think their motivation was to help her or to sing too\nI think it was to think Kavanaugh I think they put her feelings of an animal ... aside and they threw or to the wolves and I think by doing that I think they hope to think that Kavanaugh's nomination\nDid you strike you as a reluctant witness once you do testify under oath\nAnd public knows she did not seem to be reluctant at that point she had already been outed\nAnd I think it was at that point then she was able to make her statement I'm and she did and I think every accuser has the right to be heard I've I've been adamant about that
