all\nBut rather the fact that judge Kavanaugh I'll listen to us\nRight there at a hospital and call it\nA so there you go there or you or I got to tell you though this is my favorite argument I Love now because the left just starting to make arguments that really aren't arguments\nAnd uh and uh this came from a National Review a column and national view where they're talking about was Swisher one of the cabinet as former classmates who are over the weekend\nA one on CNN and was interviewed by Chris Cuomo and was asked the question what do you know about Brett Kavanaugh\nThat he was not truthful about in the hearing Cuomo asked here's a quote I Would have stayed on the sidelines if he had said I drank to access in high school\nI drink to excess in college I did some stupid things but I never sexually assaulted anyone ended up close and then she said but to lie under oath to lie about that what else is true\n[noise] have to say right here National Review but what's your comment about what she believes capital ought to have said in order to be truthful lines up almost exactly with what Kavanaugh did say during his testimony I quote I drank beer with my friends sometimes I had too many beers\nSometimes others did I like beer I still like beer but I didn't drink beer to the point of blacking out and I never sexually assaulted anybody asked\nWell ... be pointed out you know sometimes I went to sleep which by the way is what nearly one hundred percent of people do after a night of drinking I I\nBut it it's just you know and you know look at I was you said it yesterday that the story started falling apart for them because of media Lee after they got the FBI investigation than boom\nA if they started with the all the you know ... everything else and it was his drinking what did those words really mean in his uh you know a a yearbook wanted the slang or really mean and so you know what that particular point they said ... okay we got to start moving the

claim you know for example for the witnesses that she claims oh say we don't know what she's talking about the changes completely what people think which means\nA significant portion of people have no idea that the witnesses that she has used\nHave not cooperated what she has said as soon as they do I think it's up to you know a a fifty cent fifty seven percent of people believe that he should be confirmed for that means roughly forty you know because I'm sure there was a few people that go home and do\nSo I mean somewhere between thirty five and forty percent don't believe he should be confirmed and of course that's roughly the number of Democrats just yeah so as we've always said in any of these\nUh in in and then that we talked about people do when you're never going to convince everybody that's not the point now your point is not to convince everybody your point is to convince\nThe majority of those independents and those people that are in the middle ... because if you roughly have forty percent of America that's Republican and forty percent that's Democrats it's the other twenty percent is that right at up to a hundred or that the you know that's what your those

Rockies through at least tomorrow as much as three to six inches isolated amounts of ten inches of rain\nOr in the the fact that they ran with the story to begin with shows your word journalism that Abdel ... no you're absolutely right that trash journalism any journalist listening right now and you know we're worm on hundreds of stations across America including\nAll the major ones in DC and New York WMA al WABC\nWhere all the media you know where where where they are located and we know a ton of you listen and you all know what NBC did was a complete hack job that is in journalism an allegation in it sells\nWithout anything else to cooperate it is not a story it's not a story that a manger that a major newspaper or a major TV network should ever run it lacks completely on any type of journalism ethics\nAnd they know it had that been someone claiming that about Obama and two thousand eight that it never would have ... now today well what were you know it's coming out now\nIs the leaks are completely anonymous yeah right there was another one ... completely ... of anonymous people are just sending letters hey I was abused right and then that's being like oh this is another letter from somebody else have you paid attention to social media\nAnd you can make these people don't even use their real name on social media most often right\nFamiliar most often right I mean it's just and and it's\nTo me it it shows you know that NBC don't ever ever complain\nAbout President Trump using the term fake news and directing it at you right if you put out that kind of peace trash story yeah\nBased on an allegation and you do an interview knowing going in there that this person is walking back everything that they say and you can't find anybody to cooperate if you don't dealt with that story it's the same thing\nAs I mentioned from my it was we talked about yesterday from Eric Brady at USA Today when he wrote\nWill should Brett Kavanaugh will be coaching girls' teams not until the investigation is done and then talked about in his original article a credible source by the way just the ... set on yesterday show I I I Know Eric Brady um was it used to knew him as a kid he was a really good friends with my neighbor across the street just\nSo people know that it's important see that's what you're doing your blood people know that [noise]\n'cause somebody might find out in and I as I said last night I said you know I've\nI've uh since I knew him when he was young\nAnd you know we've kept in in touch over the years just on Facebook or which is a space whose Facebook vows to lead it but that was a piece of trash article that he wrote and said you know claim it as a news story not an opinion that credible evidence there is no credible evidence against Kavanaugh\nIt's a ... and and this is and that's why when you said that during the break it just it has hit home with me\nThey're never going to get off the break here no no this is and it won't end when Trump was no longer president this is not going to end no because in fact they'll feel more empowered Trump is the one who calls him out the next guy or gal likely won't\nAnd here's what's interesting too so NBC goes with the interview from sweating they admit they can't find anything to back it up anybody else to back it up they go with the interview an interview\nThe story on the ... this is the prosecutor brought in to do the questioning at the hearing and the memos released\nAnd on Monday\nNBC News decided that wasn't worth reporting now if Mitchell had reported that my finding is that judge Kavanaugh is not worthy of being seated on the highest court that would have been the lead headline in fact it would have been an NBC News but right\nNow if you're wondering NBC News why nightly news\nIs that an all time low\nThat's it nobody believes you and I see right through you\n\nYour tax nothing more nothing less and it's shameful behavior yes oh stop\nFeeling insulted when Trump says your fake news right\nYou're not even worthy of his recognition frankly because\nYou're nothing if you're going to put somebody up there you admit you can't backup independently as a news organization anything the woman is about to say you put her on the memo which is part\nYes we don't feel that the president should stoop to yours\nThe your level right that'll really take 'em off well that that's in and that's what that's ... and that by the way coming from a guy who ... who has how many times that we sat on this program there are times when somebody needs to just take the the his Twitter account way for a few minutes\nAnd and there are times when he doesn't speak effectively where he says something that totally doesn't work the communications from this White House have been horrible but that's how bad it can be see but it's all you don't urge you shut it you have an\nEarned the right over him because it's also what you get from the left that well because of this presidents and there were changing the way that we do thing yeah we haven't no we haven't shall we don't care less active communication when we we never we never change our standards of what we will do whether it's Obama\nWhether it's Bush whether it's Clinton while we were working together with Clinton [laughter] whether whether it's a a Trump we don't care no or certain and it ended up to two idiots overnight can do it NBC you certainly have the ability to do it you don't want to do\nWe know they go out of their way to put somebody on do an actual interview with somebody and that they themselves as a news organization can't backup and one word she's saying but ignore part of the official process and that statement was part the Mitchell a release the memo was part of the official process\nThey could take it and take it to another prosecutor and asked that prosecutor well what did you think did you watch it did you what do you think of Kavanaugh's and Dr Ford's claims and would you say the same thing the memo did not even that\nThey completely skirted the entire thing and then you're going to have all these guys and gals chomping on cigars in the boardroom at NBC News trying to think what's going wrong wire ratings go well what's what's what's the problem here\nWell it's interesting because one of the one of the other stories that came out during the day on Monday is that you have the founder of CNN Ted Turner that says the idea that it has become too political this coming from a guy who's clearly on the left and as the founder of the network\nAnd then you have a the the uh the the former show runner really at the Greenfield Jeff Greenfield yeah or who ran CNN for years\nComes out and says the people that work at CNN thinks that they're part of our act as if they're the quote a they they count themselves as part of the anti Trump\nResistance but we know this we see it it's it's very obvious but when you have other people that were you know there before that can look at it and say this is clear what's going on these people are active it's they're not journalists\nThey instead of opinion they're not even they won't even be a ... they they like cowards hide behind the word analysis that's the new word for opinion right opinion at the top\nYou have an opinion should be based on some well see why your hand analysis\nShould be here's the situation but it's not it's here's my opinion\nSo if you're going to have an opinion piece called opinion but you know what the cats are already out of the bad people see right through these news organizations it's not tolerated anymore and you wonder why they're not trusted and you wonder why those CNN shows or at the bottom of the cable news and NBC is at the bottom of the network\nNews it's not Trump inch you
