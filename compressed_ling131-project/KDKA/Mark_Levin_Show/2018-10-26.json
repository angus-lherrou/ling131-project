six Ninety or read I welcome in good morning also coming up we'll tell you about the the story in the wall Street Journal they actually took the Commerce Department numbers\nAnd figured out that a significant portion half of almost half of the increase of\nThe GDP since\nApril of last year or the acceleration of you know it going from roughly two point two percent\nAnnual growth for the last few years under Obama to from the middle of last year or two right now of two point nine percent half\nAlmost half of that growth just under half ... uh is because of government increased government spending defense spending federal spending increased state and local spending you and I talked about the flaws of the GDP right you know and it's the only thing that you can go by so you go buy it and not that there wasn't government spending before but\nThey looked at the acceleration of the increase in spending\nA over the last year and said that ... is cause for half\nOf it and the reason that it's important is you know we look at you know everything in an economy and what might affect it we look at the good portions that we've seen mhm we've also looked at the things that can hurt the economy the the terrorists increased because of that the increase in cost of\nOf timber and steel and materials\nOr the you know the the housing up or slow down over the the the last a month\nA government at times believes that they can and people believe the government can help the economy and at the same time manipulated into success ... by picking winners and losers and they can't look\nNot that there's anything wrong with increasing defense and I don't know there um but what we want to do is set that aside and look at where the growth is and isn't in the private sector\nBecause the the the what creates wealth what really moves the economy is the new goods and services that are produced by the private sector ... and the GDP lotta times takes in government spending and the transfer of money\nNow we know it's also not nearly as important as if someone on the left up here is like they might have been injured you know by the oil everywhere they what it was sold me alight but nobody really knows and so I guess in the colleges they could start to take something like ... that's actually quite victim status so they can help straighten us all out a world where you\nHave that [laughter] well you know my hair Eric you were talking about what's at the tweet was a Donald Trump junior the\nPut it out earlier yeah Donald Trump junior making some a very good points on social media uh yesterday Thursday and and I think on Wednesdays well saying well where was the call for civility when someone sent fake rice into his residence and and\nIt was you know they've got a ultimately close to to his wife was intended for him Donald Trump junior and the same thing happened to his brother he was asking uh I forget who was he was asking\nUh in in that tweet or he was responding to somebody else's tweet um but that's that's the whole thing is that there was no call for civility when that happened I mean you see a number of things that happened or that\nAnd with any president or presidential family but especially this one you've had how much you know that has happened had been said\nUm and we have to point out\nBecause Gary laid it out a and thank you might\nThe call a this was a several months ago but you're talking about when you call someone Hitler\nAnd for the call a this was a several months ago but you're talking about when you\nCall someone Hitler what the threat is\nAnd then we were talking about civility then that was the setting yes and the media was you know talking about well civility and civility we'll wait a minute when you compare to someone to a arguably one of the worst\nMass murderers in history pure evil you are saying the threat to someone is that guy is capable this person is just like Adolf Hitler and his capable of doing the same heinous thing\nAnd when you do that that becomes a threat that that you're saying that this person in this case the president is the same kind of threat that Hitler was and that's the ultimate\nThreats\nSo the call for civility\nAnd the media pretending like this is all on the president you got to give me a break rhetoric is one thing comparing him to a mass murderer that one of the most evil people to ever exist on earth that's very different [noise]\nNot only Hitler but when they combine Hitler with fascist and the or Terry in mindset yeah Donald Trump which has to be a dictator as we've said nothing indicates set in anything that he has done in any of his executive orders anything that he has fought from the court's everything\nHas in in my opinion about let me All right let me say that Ninety nine point nine percent of what he has has of what he was promoted maybe somebody can find one percent and make an argument that that will be willing to listen to so I don't want to say one hundred percent ... so Ninety nine point nine percent of what Donald Trump is best promoted\nOr his rhetoric may offend you mhm ah his provocative nature may or a offend you but what does he actually does\nDoes he deserved is it fair to relate him to one of the worst mass murderers\nGenocidal mass murderers in the history of the world right is that even close to any type of accurate portrayal no it just pure demonization and inflammatory rhetoric and what is it designed to do\nIt is designed to create range in the people that will believe you fear and right it is not an attempt to have a discussion on the policies of the president well let's look at this and\nIs that too much government intervention no it's Hitler it's the same\nAs the guy who are committed a genocide UBS six million human beings\nIn concentration camps that's what Donald Trump is he's a fascist let's throw most selenium there to well what you know while rabbits and let's combine Hitler was Mussolini and let's combine the worst brutal evil people that have ever existed and say\nThat as Donald Trump well of course that's just the most bizarre and inflammatory things\nThat you could possibly say\nAnd the other point that we made over the last couple of days is after\nThe Steve Scully shooting a going after the the I Can't think of his name right now but the man who was a a you know a supporter of of a Bernie Sanders\nUh going after the the I Can't think of his name right now but the man who was a\nA you know a supporter of of a Bernie Sanders who attempted to assassinate members of Congress if it wasn't for the Capitol police you probably would have quite a few dead Republican Congress people right now ...\nAh they came to the defense and we're we're able to stop that that situation Steve Sebelius represent 'em ...\nSeriously injured did that change the rhetorical nature the inflammatory rhetorical nature of Democrats at all or have they ... it up to the point of as we saw with Kavanaugh outer insanity over the last couple of months\nThe reality is it's not going to stop why we live in a nation of free speech and people are are going to go to the limit of ... of of of free speech and they're going to go to the ... that's just what happens\nIn our society we may not like it people may view it as an civil but it's the reality of where we live and what is the thing that will temper that what will temper that is if they continue to lose elections Americans must reject\n\nMust reject that and it gets to the it gets to that point and so\nYou know we we have talked about you know also the morality of the media and and this is that we think extremely important when you look at Donald Trump being accused of treason mhm the Russian collusion almost two years of it\nNever ending pounding by the media\nAnd they sit there you know when Sarah Sanders defense and said look it's it's been\n... the the law is against this president coming from the media had been never ending right the source stories that have been inaccurate that you hide behind your sources\nSay well this is what our sources told us well if you can if it's not true and you can't prove it's true you don't always believe your sources well it\nYou know you have a the remember the indictments that came down with Papadopoulos and Manafort and the president tweeted a that day you know no collusion and then the New York times article that said he was tweeting that as they were proven collusion something to that effect\nNope nope no and\nThat's the fault that that is a blatant lie or complete incompetent either you don't belong at any you don't belong on Twitter if you're if you're putting that kind of if you're a reporter putting that kind of be asked\nOut much less a major newspaper because there was no proof none still is none to this day\nNothing and you have what a false narrative that has gone on and still goes on and no one knows what more has in front of them\nKnow that may change\nBut what hasn't changed I'll tell you right now is the false narrative\nWell think about this it was just a couple of months ago in front of the White House remember they were there for days ... because of Russian collusion right and trees no precedent now I have the midterms it's not even a topic of discussion right it's like okay we can't go anywhere with this lie that we have perpetuated for the last\nTwo years so let's move on to something something else and then they they attempt to walk away as if well no we bear no responsibility for the instability that happens today or the heightened\nAttempt to walk away as if oh no we bear no responsibility for the instability that happens today or the heightened inflammatory rhetoric that exist today were completely innocent were just reporting\nAnd we're just we're really don't think it's a bunch of crap right the only thing we're doing is telling you that uh she got there illegally he came to power illegally\nAnd with the help of another major nation that is the uh that that in terms of new is the only match really for the United states on the planet in terms of a threat and\nAh he is he worked for the Russians he's friendly with the Russians he's a fascist and he's capable of killing at Hitler was\nRemember it was just a couple of months ago we had followed the survey for the last ... over a year ... that showed that the majority of Democrats still believe that the Russians hacked into the election machines and twenty sixteen\nYeah and we have a a an election coming up and what eleven days yeah and ah and where they screaming about that it's gone silent now why is that", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "26"}
