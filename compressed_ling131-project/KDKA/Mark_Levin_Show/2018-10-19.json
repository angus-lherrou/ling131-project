next week after this week I'll be next on October twenty ninth on another natural showing you can check that out on my Web page or on Facebook\nTo summarize what we've been doing the last few days\nThere's been a progression of seems kind of on Monday morning it was a follow up to the judge Kavanaugh hearings and your reaction to my belief that we've entered a new civil war in this country between the left and the right\nI used to say I'm not the violence or but I have to what's been happening last year or so I'm I'm not sure that's true and uh I I think it's going to get worse especially if we talked about this last night especially for Republicans\nLast year or so I'm I'm not sure that's true and uh I I think it's going to get worse especially if we talked about this last night especially for Republicans keep house\nBecause of the Democrats the less the liberal media almost all the same thing they're convinced that going to win the house at least take back on the part of Congress and if they don't I Can't imagine what the reaction is going to be\nOn Tuesday Morning I talked about the great job the President Trump is doing and of course the unbelievable anger towards him by the resistance right they even found that coined that phrase right away the resistance like you're resisting Nazi Germany or something or fascism and of course that's what they believe\nAnd I also asked you who would be your favorite choice to get the Democratic nomination for president and who would you agree to have coffee with on the other side side by the way that was a sign\nThat many of us ... troubles choosing someone that's pretty bad at it wasn't always that case\nSo they have no idea I'm a talk show host if they knew that might be the end of me but here it's a several anecdotes you might appreciate on election day when President Trump was running it was the first day of new class of my school so I was ... to go out to see the election results\nAnd I remember I I tears roll down my eyes when he a Trump won Pennsylvania which was always a Republican fool's gold always stay we might win but when it counted like with Romney we always came up short so when he won Pennsylvania I realize he was like you going to be president\nIt was unbelievable even though I predict that morning I predict on Facebook that I thought he was going to win so what did some students do and these are adults students they went to the system principle to complain that I was texting a lot\nSo she called the inter office at the end of the night and she said you know mark I defended due to the students because all of us were so upset with the results that it was not surprising that ... thing going on [noise] it didn't even cross your mind for second that I could be on the other side\nAnd another time there was a teacher's meeting and the ... teacher trainer who was running the meeting said you know we have some time why don't we go around the room all your teachers and you could tell us something that would be interesting that we don't know about you\nDo you think for a second I Would tell them about my other career life how could have been the end of me and a final anecdote was when Justice Scalia die another teacher said mark let's play knock knock joke so I played along and his answer to who was there was just a Justice Scalia just died and he said that was funny enough\nI probably didn't hide my look of dismay because he's shocked me because he immediately walked away having no idea that I adore just ... and he was my favorite judge so now you know why I'm Still teaching the public school system\nIt's kinda like the McCarthy Era to reverse but I have to keep quiet about my political views I Want to know what you do if you have to keep a quiet at

you and they find out your Republican and I have a son with autism and in the autism community it's very difficult to make and maintain friends or my son\nAnd he had had a friend Cynthia about four years old he's Fifteen now\nAnd I've been very good friends with his father who is a Democrat\nAnd jets recently on Facebook\nHe's asked me to contact him anymore and pleased that trend him because I'm a Trump supporter and I just found that that devastating because that that you know over ten year friendship and he's willing to throw it away just because we think differently and I don't see where that is necessary\nYou totally support my thesis we don't do that you never would even think of that and he ... by the way I guess it could affect your son's relationship with his son or daughter whenever it is it is awful it's unbelievable\nYeah well that's all I had this day and thanks for taking my mom and dad and I know and that night\nThank you very much and now you're national

eastern Florida Today\nAnd I try to gauge them cut it with a smile but\nThat you get hostility right back it is where did we come those people I just don't like it said\nIt ... you you know the other night you said this is your first night you're you've been listening to the other night I was asking about who would you like to see get the nomination the Democrats' side and if you were a Democrat who to like Senate Republican side and that evolved into who would you like to have coffee with could you pick someone on the other side\nSo you you kind of given me an idea that we we can evolve this thing and would you I mentioned my monologue Mary Madeline and er what's his name I just lost his temper carnival\nYeah James Carville um they're married and Eric stream Lee opposite I worked in political campaigns for a total opposite candidates so here's how this may evolve\nWho you marry mark someone who had really diametrically opposed refused to you\nOr why not I mean if you're compatible with every other way and you you white ... why does one little facet of our lives defy everything you know\nPlay by like you're ... you're consistent but I'm going to play devil's advocate okay\nBecause it doesn't politics get into values somewhat about what people care about right or as an example again from this I think a lotta times single women who vote Democrat or looking for the government to take care of them are and so you start to get into your values system I think\nSo now I'm going to play on the other side maybe not marriage because it may affect lots of things I'll give you another one maybe this is very I teach my students values or what should count not so much and I say it's my opinion don't have to agree with me not to and you know look through obviously important at the beginning but that's\nMaybe this is very I teach my students values or what should count not so much and I say it's my pin you don't have to agree with me not to and you know look through obviously important at the beginning but that fades over time it's it's the person's values and that you should care about here's one what if you are religious as an example because of that\nCause you conservative and you believe in God and the other side doesn't so if you have kids some day you're obviously going to fight about that you want them to go to church or whatever she wants no part of that so I hear on the homeless contradicting myself I Do understand if it's going to be something really permanent\n... share the same values and the isn't this one of the vice I'm not saying not to be friendly\nBut I that's why I ... I Want to ask everybody to could you marry someone and you were very consistent he said sure why not it's one thing and when I'm pointing out maybe it's not just one little thing maybe it's something very important what do you think about that\nYeah well I mean we're all Americans here I mean yeah I guess it could be some rabbit cases down the road but I mean if you like me and my girlfriend get along and we have a good reporter with each other and I love her she loves being I mean\nI you know I\nI I Can't imagine that coming up to the extent I mean I'm fifty eight so I don't have to worry about children which is a valid concern but I mean hey you don't want to go to you know people my mom and dad my dad was a southern Southern Baptists my mom was a Roman Roman Catholic they got along fine for fifty five years you know I\nI guess you don't love each other's noses and that you learn to live with the other person it's all about compromise anyway so\nThat when you're a good my producer is not as good as you he\nHe's he said to me you're going to be divorced than five years anyway if you marry someone of the opposite views he used his being cynical well you you have a good attitude about it and you are consistent when I challenge you said yeah what what's the big deal and you're it's very fascinating that you said on these social media sites\nThat it's only one side that says stuff you've not being Trump supporter of his mark thanks for your call it is amazing the hatred and the anger out there is just you know for the president and or anything you know that's associated with him right so if you work in his administration you can't even have a meal\nThat's incredible that never happened years ago or they'll protests by your house on what's going on I was someone asked me that puts oil you kind of set of mark what's ... what's happening in this country\nNow that's why I said the first nice I I think we're entering a civil war and this is so strong this is so big with some people that are they don't want to accept it let's go to David in let's see if I can see that now ... New Jersey yeah I Can't see that\nYou try and you're there you might call and it's a really the People's Republic of New Jersey my uh brother in law is a political he does not vote and my sister does and my brother in law and sister or a family function with my very left wing and\nAnd she mentioned her my brother in law essentially said um how do you think about the Trump tax cuts because his numbers guy and my aunt just who is very well to do is just one absolutely bonkers\nFlights to try to intervene and essentially say oh\nI voted for Bertie to try to try to calm down but it's I I Will say this I felt as ... as the left does back when as far as I'm concerned the Manchuria candidate Bill Clinton\nWas elected in Ninety two and way and Obama got elected I said I get my tongue\nIn ... was elected in Ninety two and when Obama got elected I said I I did my tongue that I didn't say to my aunts and my bleeding heart cousins and my ... as far as I'm concerned communist article I didn't say I'm not going to talk to anymore I just\nI think they know how I feel as I Know they do but\nThe reality is we are as the last caller just said we are American citizens we ought to be grateful I've seen the real world as a former navy guy and it ain't pretty the real world is a very dangerous place in America is the only fashion for free and I'm\nDavid ... thanks for your service and you know among jumble about that kind of yeah thank you very much\nBut it is amazing that the other side oh here's a thought I don't want to lose\nYou never knew what a Thanksgiving or any place we're getting together because I Am a strong feeling that the end of Thanksgiving right you never want to do that and family functions so I think on our side we we have to accept them for who they are going\n... I have my uncle who I consider to be a communist than one day I Will say it to his face not at Thanksgiving but he has a consistent ... a habit of\nBringing up politics and uh whether it's Thanksgiving or Christmas and most of my Irish Catholic relatives are very hardcore left is which\nBrings me to shame because I Know what my ancestors went through and they emigrated here and I appreciate that everybody has their own opinion\nBut the reality is you want to enjoy your meal and be grateful for the ... house so that way you can appreciate the difference of opinion later on I mean I I admit back in Ninety two I was disgusted\nAbout Clinton but I never told my cousins or my my answer that we're going to talk to you guys I mean that's to me to me I Hope most Americans and most of the American people view that as being immature stupid\nAnd there is going to be a long term repercussions for it and I I I wanted to ask you a question if I could I Know you get your time is pretty\nSure that well in the People's Republic of New Jersey as in other states like the left coast when there are candidates that are running for federal or state office you don't see\nDemocrats or Republicans giving a lukewarm endorsement to pro choice or pro life there either are they're not whereas on the second amendment there are a lot of Republicans who do not even remotely even answer even the simplest questions and we're just summarize this voters that\nDon't worry wants this candidate gets in he or she will support the second amendment I I don't see the left\nDoing that on a faith basis for pro choice Democrats in yeah some Republicans like Utah means Romney are we really to believe that heaven forbid mittens Romney as a U.S senator he's going to support the second amendment that I mean given his track record I mean come on\nHave voted for for president in but they I mean just the idea of having another left wing gun grab or the U.S Senate on the Republican side doesn't appeal to me any more than the Democratic party candidates\nI think we can sing rambled\nI just I I Would say there is some accountability I mean their Senate races Florida this Governor Scott he just signed into law you got to be Twenty one by rifle for Pete's sake you know most people don't even know active duty active duty between the ages of Eighteen and twenty\nSo I didn't know why you got to be Twenty one to buy a rifle for Pete's sake you know most people and you don't even know active\nDuty active duty between the ages of Eighteen and twenty army and Marine Corps they're cherished select fire rifles air force you get kids that are Twenty years old that are guarding our nuclear arsenal I mean it's it's totally disgusting that are right\nThat in our constitution is constantly snow up and I predict if all the senators and east coast are left coast states get elected as Republicans I anticipate they're not even going to do anything for the second amendment and I'm not saying that's all a monkey wrench so there's it's disgusting\nHow I mean you you know everybody to get a question mark next to the name of the candidates on the line when you look 'em up I mean they can answer yes oh yeah yeah and I but I don't want to ... like if you didn't make a call ...\nAbsolutely but David you made a big mistake I think he used the word monkey wrench which got the candidate for governor in Florida in trouble right we're not supposed to just use that normal talk you must be a racist even bring that up", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "19"}
