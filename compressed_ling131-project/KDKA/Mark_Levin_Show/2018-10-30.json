any purpose really no it doesn't um and and that's that's the the um\nAt times it can be amusing but but but frankly it's it's useless altogether or there is no real purpose for it or when you talk about the the basic fundamental ideas and then talk about those ideas being implemented U.S policy\nOr that's where it starts to come together but nobody wants nobody wants to have that conversation anymore they don't I I I just think the the uh the art of debate the art of debate\nThe the artist debate is gone it's it is a age that no one is interested in it\nYou know I Would love to hear a on a

people should refuse their money and make them unwelcome and synagogues quote\nAny strategy for enhancing the security of American Jews should involve shutting Trump's Jewish enablers their money should be refused their presence in synagogues not welcome they have placed their community endanger yeah\n\n[laughter] I mean it's just getting by I don't I don't get it I just don't I don't um\nI don't get where they believe that this is again good strategy\n\nI just don't I mean blaming Trump for everything pretty much everything that's wrong and things that are wrong I heard someone say the other day about the economy well but it would be a lot better if look we've had that discussion on terrorists and everything else\nBut the fact of the matter is is right now the economy is looking fairly healthy the question is will be sustained\nAnd everything else but the fact of the matter is is right now the economy is looking fairly healthy\nThe question is will be sustained if the terrorists stay in place and they were ... but this was this wasn't even on terrorists this was just a comment basically on\nIf it weren't Trump anybody but Trump would have a better economy well that's just blatantly falls\nBecause I don't know of one Republican that would have gotten that down to Twenty one percent on the corporate tax rate I don't know of one Republican that was going to get tax cuts anywhere below thirty percent\nI I can guarantee anybody who said that was not able to back it up\nNo okay well of course not as just as just as they're not able to back up you know him being an anti Semite or him being responsible for this or that they can never back it up what did they ever been a recently whenever when did they ever been able to back anything\nThey don't have to blame Trump it must be useful easy enough of a target\nBig red barn that's what he's become\nA Democrats this is from MSN dot com Democrats were sounding growing alarms and the final push before the midterm elections the party lacks the message it needs to combat President Trump and went back democratic majorities in Congress as\nWe haven't had a real message since the last presidential elections so why change it now is a democratic strategist\nChris ... we had no message in twenty sixteen we had no message in between you have no message going into this election you have to give people a reason to vote for you not a reason just to vote against someone else\nDemocrats think they have a good chance of retaking the house majority despite problems given the fact that they're voting base is fired up or to send a message to Trump polls tightened however and there is recognition that Trump has started to fire up his own base the narrow path\nThe Democrats won saw for the Senate majority has largely disappeared ... in terms of the Democratic party having even a semblance of a message it's just not there and that's the reason this election is going to be unpredictable said ... nobody should be surprised if it's a good night or a bad night\nAh Democrats found a winning formula in two thousand six when they captured both chambers with the promises to champion a series of specific policy proposals\n... early the following year including the minimum wage hike and cuts in student loan rates this cycle they replace that design with the shorter slate a broader themes a preferred blueprint in their eyes because it allows democratic candidates to tailor their message to the concerns\nAnd demographics of individual districts sounds like a hope and change philosophy right ... ah this is not a national campaign some Nancy Pelosi\nOr it's one district at a time yet Democrats outside capital or voicing concerns that of blurry or message could haunt Democrats at the polls if voters are left on certain what the party stands for rama manual Chicago Mayor and former chairman of the house democratic campaign arm said his party needs to be more clear in his message for the country\nOr I don't want to say we did everything right into six but we had a six and six agenda set of ideals are that are very clear a second democratic strategist that Emanuel makes a great point I couldn't tell you exactly what we stand for no so in that sense I think Romney's right\nAt least back then we had a target we knew we needed to do to get there I can say the same now and ...\nSo in that sense I think Romney's right at least back then we had a target we knew we needed to do to get there I can say the same now\nAnd that's troubling they talked about democratic leaders are quick to reject that the notion because they've talked about health care costs and boosting wages and fighting government corruption by the way\nThey found fighting government corruption if there isn't a more useless campaign issue\nTo go on and by the way any government corruption when you think of a government corruption for the Democrats what would you think of\nIf I write or a Democrat if you're a Democrat I mean you're well if you're an American ride to Democrat or Republican Russia inclusion right and we know it was the Democrats who colluded with the Russians not the\nNot the not the Republicans there's no evidence of it ... and any government corruption that you could look at right now and I don't know they claim they're running a I'm On corruption I don't know where I haven't seen an ad on corruption but if one thing but it\nMay work that you could promote if they wanted to get away ... or if they wanted to help eliminate any type of corruption or a wrongdoing and the process is a support voter id\nCertainly they're pressing for that right yeah I think they're talking government ... right I Know but you start with the idea that because that's where it comes you know you come down to all the voter fraud situations and you often have\nOfficials that are involved in a so\nBut the biggest my my point was the biggest ... the biggest question on corruption is the Obama administration and the FBI and the department of justice\nAnd our intelligence agencies it is on the uh the Pfizer court rebuke in the Obama administration for violating the rights of American citizens when it comes to secret warns those are the things that we used to view\nThe ... but when I say we [laughter] I meant we all but specifically liberals used to care about\nYou know up until about a month ago yeah ... well they cared about that since Trump spin off\nWell no I mean the ... if you think about the Russian collusion thing they cared about that all about among Russia right than it disappear I haven't heard anything on it right I mean they're not campaigning on on any of that now it's that Trump is responsible for\nA suspicious packages are and the synagogue shooting and the most evil and heinous acts\nThat and the ... when the ... the care of it ... but the current events Trump's fault that the by the way that's a beautiful white it's from all the caravan venue
