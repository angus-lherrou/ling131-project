pool of cold air from Canada has descended on the central us mainly the northern plains and the central plains as we get into the day today will only see a high in Indianapolis for instance for fifty six\nFor any first term of president their first mid term is crucial\nA so GOP affiliated voter sub surpassed democratic affiliated ones and early voting in Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee and Texas only in Nevada have democratic affiliated voters\nExceeded Republican affiliated voter so far in early voting according to the data key Senate races are underway in seven of those eight states\nAnd we'll prove pivotal and determining which party controls the or the chamber the latest data suggest robust enthusiasm among early Republican voters that could put a dent in democratic hopes for a blue wave in next month's midterm election remember I'm breathing verbatim from the NBC story\nA Republican or Republicans typically dominate a early voting by absentee ballots\nWhile Democrats tend to tell you the advantage with him in person early voting for example the entire early voting picture in Florida which has yet to be gone in person voting is in complete\nAh in Arizona were two members of the house democratic a Christian\nA\nCinema and Republican Martha mix Sally ... our neck in neck in the contest to fill the retiring Republican Jeff Flake a Senate seat forty four percent of early voters had a Republican affiliation compared to thirty three percent of the Democratic affiliation right twenty three percent of early voters were not affiliated with\nVoters had a Republican affiliation compared to thirty three percent of the Democratic affiliation right twenty three percent of early voters were not affiliated with either major party and that's a group as other in the NBC News from a a partisan analytics\nIn Florida where democratic Bill Nelson who's running for reelection in a tight race against Republican governor Rick Scott forty four percent of the early voters had a Republican affiliation versus thirty eight percent who had a democratic affiliation an Eighteen percent\nWho are not affiliated with either party in Indiana where a democratic US Senator Joe Donnelly is facing reelection challenged from Mike Braun fifty one percent of early voters\nHad a Republican affiliation compared with thirty nine percent who had a democratic affiliation and ten percent who are not affiliated with either party you know that's something to be looking at not just the\nNot just a voter enthusiasm of Republicans and Democrats which by the way is extremely important mhm because if you have more enthusiasm of Republicans and emerge mid term election like that that's almost unheard\nOf well especially when you talk about first day of early voting one one reason they take take a look at that as it because people are essentially chomping at the bet to to vote to to get there say\nAnd who was at which group is that that is more motivated to get their first that can tell you something\nAbout the the point I was trying to bring is not not the Democrat or Republican but\nIf you have if you know if ten percent or in the one case was that are in Florida eight Eighteen percent not affiliated were independence going right now where the polls on were independence live right now our independence being affected\nBy what has gone out now independence for the most part did not like what was going on in the cabinet hearings which may be a huge\nUh you know a driver to the poll of independence but we're independence going in this election I haven't seen a lot of you know election polling analytics on independence we've heard a lot about the enthusiasm Republicans and\nDemocrats but of course that's key because independence and most elections decide you know where the country's going ... and I just haven't seen much I'll do some research on it now yeah I'm going to do more research see what's out there on on independence but it just popped into my head right now\nWe spend so much time talking about were Democrats are Republicans are\nAre not realizing that a significant portion the the determining factor of vote in most states is still you know the where the independence lie mhm\nYeah you you get to the break down to the polls that we do have available to us and that number of I guess I'm not independence but undecided voters starts to become much much smaller and that's where that's why we're you know for me\nI'm anxious to look at some some of the latest polls because you go back to uh the Montana race or any of the other Senate races and if you've got numbers that are that are pre Kavanaugh that that's something very different though I mean it's it's something that because people will make\nThis this inevitably happens the closer you get the more the the fewer undecided you have\nAn any given race and it's crucial dust I think that it's the job of the pollsters to to show those numbers as close to an election days you can but you know again a and they haven't been as active as they were\nIn years past and you and I've been following that you know for a while maybe the\nAh they haven't been as active as they were in years past and you and I've been following it you know for a while maybe that's going to change in the in you know later this week\nWhat we know for example that the internal polling that was being done roughly two to three weeks out of back in in twenty sixteen\nThe Hillary people knew they were in trouble and the internal polling you didn't hear a lot of talk about that at all in in the general public but after the election post election that's just started hearing that they saw the you know that that's when they started seen in some of those districts in those states\nYou know when we're talking about Pennsylvania and and and Michigan in Wisconsin that's why they saw some of the change at that point ... and they said oh\nAnd you know they saw that swing at that point and in most elections as we see what you see in July is not necessarily what you see the last three weeks right now internally because they're doing the polling consistently\nYou have the political parties that have an idea they see where the momentum is going at this particular point 'cause we are just two weeks out now so for the last week\nEspecially if you went inside most political parties and say we're what is your polling showing you're going to have one or another say okay the momentum is moving our way yours and moving our way mhm we just don't have access to those particular polls at the moment\nYou know what we know afterwards yeah because the the ... the analyze you know what happened in a you know particular you know political election you know we'll we'll be analyzed after the election but it's what's happening right now in the internal polls are probably showing that\nBut when we look at so many of the polls out there so that that haven't been taken in two three four weeks some even more than four weeks out what was going on in September\nIs not the mindset of the voter of a significant portion of the voter right now\nRight yeah I mean it it's it's I think um it it will be interesting to see what the rest of the early voting turnout is like and and where those numbers comeback but\nBut ultimately you have to get down to those polls in each of those individual races and I just suspect we're not going to see\nYou know a a [noise] I guess an onslaught of those polls\nLeading up to that a leading up to election day or two weeks from today by the way so um but the early voting on taxes in Florida a you know will be interesting I think to watch but then you go to those tighter races I'm In Texas it's it's a war\nAnd and cruise cruise and latest poll has been ahead by at least in the latest two balls or by seven points or so and they are CPS average he's ... up by seven and he said over fifty percent and and each of those last two polls so\nYou know that's not one that I Would call at this moment two weeks out assuming those numbers are still in that goes back a little over a week ago assuming those numbers still hold that's not one that I Would call\nA you know neck and neck or or up in the air and undecided right now I'm you\nKnow too close to call if you will I think it's right now that momentum is with Ted Cruz\nA and if you look at if if the last poll for the uh was ... I don't have it here in front of me the last poll for or or work and Cruz was a week ago\nUh yeah it was a little over a week ago I guess my point would be that doesn't even include the last debate does yeah yeah that's and and that's my point is that is what I was I was asking you at the top of the hour or the or the crucial meeting I said you know because I Would I Would\nAnd and that's my point is that is what I was I was asking you at the top of the hour or the or the pre show meeting\nI said you know because I Would I Would think that you would have won and maybe maybe we'll see one or later today\nOr or Wednesday that covers the debate maybe they were waiting and and going through Monday to to have people digest that debate and uh you know I don't know I really don't know but I I expect we'll see some more polls\nBut they probably won't be as numerous as what we've seen and and um the last month or two\nWe have a line open if you'd like to get in eight six six Ninety read I\nWas very much and Carly ... radio [noise]\nJoin the conversation using the shell row tell a hotline eight six six nine zero seven three three three nights when I radio and shoveled tele making your hardworking journeys more manageable\nDance ski we have hundreds of flat bed and specialized million mile drivers blight because if you like driving for a local trucking company with national", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "23"}
