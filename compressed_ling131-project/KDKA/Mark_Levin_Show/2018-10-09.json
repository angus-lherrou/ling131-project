[laughter] that old thing is that you know he's a he's he really is\nUm and we we look at that and but you when you read the discussions the discussions changed drastically and those reports from the national Hurricane Center on Monday morning and it they started to show signs of that that ah Michael strengthening\nA and having potential to strengthen greatly late Sunday and Monday morning but then they saw there's apparently a sheer that's involved here that they said typically would mean that it's not going to be such a powerful storm but they said despite that share and I I read the ten pm central\nDiscussion on it and it said it defies all logic that the sheer is still in place or this this element essentially that would diminish the strength or keep the strength from growing I guess\nI'm despite that and they think maybe it's because of the size of the I thirty five miles I uh\nIt is it is showing great potential for strengthening so for our friends there are in the end the Gulf Coast in on the panhandle of Florida listen to the authorities listen uh to keep your radios on uh make sure you were up to date on the information because this storm\nAgain has the potential to be and most are calling it now or that they're saying there's a likelihood of a a major hurricane hitting the panhandle of Florida I Lived\nThere for three years and nothing yeah I was I was I was lucky but a lot of friends down in that area so uh well we'll have the latest to on that and the latest updates when the hurricane center or gives or update which would be another hour yeah are you going to know not to central is it yeah so yeah is it\nTo something that I Know there's wanted for central as well so we'll we'll ... we'll look at that as soon as we get updates and they may by the way uh it's I guess it's possible they may or issue a more information on in fact I'm certain they will or if it warns that based on a a a watch turning into a warning and items like that will keep you posted\nA case you're Cortez makes no sense of this from a couple of days ago but there are things we just couldn't get to because of the Kavanaugh for hearing and some of the things we weren't able to get to because of the cabinet hearings yes like the whole Russian collusion that people have been emailing me all the time saying\nHey what's going on what's going on there and drop it or they drop it no it's still going on in the latest on that coming up here plus Robert Redford says he feels out of place in this country and\nJamie Lee Curtis likens justice Kavanaugh to Michael Meyers the

very famous liberal writer [noise] alright heres they they just can't get over it they just can't get over this was on you know Kevin all speaking last night right in and talking about the female clerks that he's you know bringing in unprecedented ...\nBut I wanted to get your take on a cabin on outreach not to women ... to ... the female clerks and he'd hire 'em and when you eat that during his remarks tonight I mean the female clerk like at that great cave he's talked about that before\nI guess that's grace I Can't even if you lose your bedroom\nWas the Democratic yeah but I bring more women clerks anybody ever has before ... it was practically holder parade ... unless continuing here\nA little bit like ... and I said before there was not anything really new in the way he introduced himself and his very first are ended on maybe thinking back home to the shore scripted stick to the ... I guess it has worked but I don't know that it's going to work to make women\nWho are still upset about the treatment of Dr ... feel any better if it did help a lot like ...\nYou can [noise] they felt a lot like ... it's felt it\nFeels it feel it just feels\nThe facts don't care about your feelings or your opinion Frick frankly\nYou know ... it's it is the\nYou know this is this is the the last breath here on the cabin up there you know because all of it the rest of it will really go way they're going to try and make this thing last until about four weeks from today\nBut it's not it's not resonating with the American people well I've got a question here why would you and the Democrats do keep pounding impeachment ... that we're going to impeach know anybody who knows how the the system works and let's say they took the house they could impeach\nHim that doesn't mean he's out of all I Know that simply an impeachment ... and then\nDidn't you're never going to pass the Senate you need two thirds mhm so it would never patch it's never happened in the history of the country so it's not going to happen so why are you doing it because you're motivating the Republican base\nYeah if I knew what it meant it would be more interesting [noise] yeah that's it is that uh you know just kind of\nLook if you look if you go back to the history of ah of Brock Obama's political career who he was as a political operative and and there was a lot of jokes made about community organizer right\nBut the community organizer especially in the Chicago area oh look I mean in a number of things but politically it means getting people to the polls that's actually what it means a you know for politically or for any area not just Chicago but\nGetting people to the polls they they what they did is they grew that they nurtured that and they own that better than the Republicans in fact the Republicans didn't know how to do it\nIn two thousand eight and in two thousand twelve they beat Romney's team Romney was if you you and I were following\nThe post debate polls be the polls\nThat happened right after the debates between Mitt Romney and Brock Obama President Obama at that time\nAnd the polls showed that Mitt Romney or on the issues landslide numbers even the supposed yes and so massive massive numbers the difference was the organization guess what happened in twenty sixteen the RMC had been\nThe RMC had been working in the the DNC to see this because they were busy with you know the whole fusion GPS and you know Christopher Steele Russians and all that\nAh but the orange the where they were putting their efforts was much like they in fact uh some say that as they designed it\nAh after that model of getting people to the polls that's what it's all about you can call it what you want but at the end of the day it is getting people to get out and vote and\nThat's what happened with those states that that Trump ended up winning that nobody saw and it was that you know boots on the ground type you know community organizing the organization you know that she's trying to speak on\nIt it really doesn't apply internally I mean\nWhipping the vote is one thing the Democrats though have had a playbook for a long long time and will long after a Casio Cortez is gone you and I kind of touched on the other day\nOf kind of dismissing things being able to turn their head on a a Joe mansion you know and and not you know to the look the other way with a Joe mansion in certain cases and and not really worried about things like that when they can they know they can use Joe mansion for other things so\nThe\nThe entire equation is not going to change in fact I don't think the Democrats are the party would want it to change because on many issues or they'll do what they have done in the past which includes the kind of behavior we saw with Obamacare we need to pass it so you can see what's in it\nWhich includes lying to the American people about what's what it's going to do well\nAnd she was saying that we need to organize for the pressure's not within a you know the the the body which would mean the pressure doesn't come from you know whipping up the votes at the pressure comes from the outside electorate will that happens all the time I don't I mean that that that ... that that stating a are nothing new the other thing is when\nNow you have the excuses no she's not a leader of the party she's not a leader of the party you well you may not believe that she is and she isn't right now but the mainstream media believes that she is\nThat's why she gets on precedent did television time from the mainstream media\nAs a a candidate for Congress ... who has one nothing yet who was a bartender a year ago\nThat he has said is said you know they basically if it was the leader yeah the dmc has basically said she's the ... she's the future right I mean she may not she's not the leader of the party right now but if she's the future that's what that's what the media is going to turn to the reason the media turns to that is because\nThey see what's going on with a left by the way uh you know from the outside in who who's leading the Democrats right now and has been leading the Democrats what force what movement is leading the Democrats\nWhile its its overall if you were to term it collectively it's the protester it the extreme left but what's the problem with that\nIs that how many different protests are they're the reason right now that\nThey can dismiss someone tomorrow and they are a Beto O'Rourke does not need a a former president Brock Obama to campaign for I'm In Texas is because they're so\nOver you and it doesn't matter who you are\nWhite admitted though you know it's going to have an ... if\nIf a work loses Obama's going to come out and say he should've used my endorsement well that's what does he go party will say he ... he rejected my endorsement shouldn't be rejecting right Obama's a endorsement but really I mean that I'm I'm Glad you brought that up because that's something else from last week\nThat we really didn't get a chance to talk about but really that's unbelievable it shows you you know you and I you and I started working together Thirteen Years ago\nSo you know we were we were together or three years when Obama first got elected right and and we remember every single moment of it and we remember the the political I dollar tree for president or an Obama remember his\nYou know the the DNC speech from when they when they did it from the stadium with the Greek columns and everything else and people were falling over him and it was\nAnd I look at it today now out of it now I ... yeah our our\nGoal is to have the liberal takeover of a of a of Texas A M ... or ...\nNah we don't want writer years after he's out now we don't want 'em why because ... and that's it what what a Casio Cortez\nDoesn't include here is internally externally the political pressure by the way it always comes from the outside a that's a given horses and and it's always the people on it like we said yesterday about Republicans if if\nThe Republicans were jailed last year or as the president took office in January of twenty Seventeen like uh they are now after Kavanaugh than we probably would see if they were jailed on the issue of health care we would see Obamacare gone completely\nBut that wasn't the case and so that that there is one example of political pressure being\nA president in in in one year and then gone and the next\nWell with the left\nThe problem is is your political pressures coming from every different splinter group right it which moves in multiple directions tell me which direction you go when are you going to be with the feminists are the trends genders\nBecause you can't on their boat right now they're fighting with each other ... as we predicted right three or four years and and so that's the problem that they created they they basically over a couple of generations they were out a ... and indoctrinate in children and and and young\nPeople to believe that it was that it's right to wake up today and find a new oppressor find a new reason to be a victim and that might include somebody with that was with you and part of your group yesterday\n[noise] President Obama we're just not really into you anymore\nYeah I mean I wouldn't want to do was speaking engagements and that but that Iran take our but think about it shows\nYou how the political wins yes Ken Ken just blow the one of the probably the biggest political idol of my lifetime\nAnd make it so he's not even relevant two years after he's out of office yeah not even ... years are running right from him saying that don't need an don't need his endorsement here and that's because and and you and I've talked about we thought this might happen because we saw some of the science\nBecause the left believes he truly was into liberal right that he truly he was he wasn't in it really for the cause he was and it just\nBecause of the gig right\nBut he really wasn't in to doing what needed to be done to move the political lover as far left as they thought\nThey knew they weren't really his own party as closely as as many\nMany thought he was going to eight six six Ninety run by\nSomebody else was gilly much dimmer oh stand Carli Lloyd on the radio I\nListen to read I radio show wherever you are with our
