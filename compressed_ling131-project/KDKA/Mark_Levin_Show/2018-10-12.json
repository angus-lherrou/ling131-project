general which she only reason that you would send something to the inspector general and not released into the public is because you wish the inspector general\nOr without the interference of the media to do an investigation on corruption inside the department of justice based on the ... the application just throwing that out\nMm [noise] you know ... it's an interesting um it's an interesting time because you I\nI went back and I saw a couple of things you mentioned about Mueller mentioned about you know Russia and pro ... over the last few days but they weren't the stories that we've been seeing\nYou know going back to the um it was the day of the Papadopoulos indictment and the New York times when the president tweeted no collusion and then the\nNew York times wrote the story he was tweeting that as they were proving there was collusion\nWith an indictment by the way proving what the indictment had nothing to do with the collusion nothing\nAnd so that narrative became again they were writing it as if it were fact and I mean like\nA legal fact documented you want\nLegal ... go to Sarah a quarter dot com or go to you know uh when they were back or so or a quarter and and Solomon when they were you know back in ... news ah and they were releasing\nDocuments from the court those are legal facts but lately the ... ... ... it's it's really the the chatter surrounding the whole Russian collusion thing\nAs ... di ... said nothing there's nothing on it is handled yesterday and and the interesting thing is that seem to happen about the same time at the White House sent all that information to the inspector general\nEverything has gone quiet as if it never existed because I ... I wouldn't have predicted that move where he would just handed over to the I G\nI wouldn't have thought of it I guess yeah but\nWell there were some is direction there because we were talking about the fact that our allies don't want us to really write him of our allies writer for were given to the inspector general that didn't make any sense to us for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nSee that region today the Florida Panhandle the Big Bend area dry out under clearer conditions good news for the region from Mother Nature we can look at the entire deep south and the mid west today to see clear conditions cooler conditions\nThe kind of moves at Barry Sanders had when he played for Detroit but\nHis his career was a a a limited Gail Sayers also was just a a superb running back there's been a ton of good running backs out there I don't think anybody had the power what what differentiated Jim Brown was\nHe just had the power go back and watch some of the old films of Jim Brown I mean walking over ... plowing over linebackers bigger than him mhm and and just having incredibly ... power but he had great balance\nDidn't have the speed I don't believe or the acceleration of an OJ or berries Sanders and but he had the power nobody I don't think anybody ever came close to the power that he had but\nThat being said Jim rounds old Jim Brown is not a part of popular culture today ah you ask the average uh\nA a thirty year old if they know who Jim Brown is down on your ... you're talking about that the the the guy that you know they might remember the fact that you know he has worked with gangs before mhm uh you know Jim Brown comes into\nThe substance issue huge for anybody who's paid attention over the last Thirty years as to\nWhat he's been involved with a Jim Brown is not part of popular culture today with the youth and millennials like Kanye West is the left as scared to death of Kanye West because he's smack in the middle of the the culture that is expected by the elite liberals to be\nBe a liberal supporter mhm\nHe cannot have a different opinion and if he does have a different opinion then Trump is exploiting the mental issues that Kanye West had\nNobody was talking about mental issues of ... when he when you know he was at the award show where they no ... no no no uh nobody in a lump was talking about his ah you know his mental state when I he said that uh George Bush a hates all black people because of the country and I didn't\nWrite that that that that's not a because it again that's not a threat is something at that time politically they could use a not so much the Taylor Swift award show moment but the the uh George Bush comment\nAnd it was notable to the left but they didn't they didn't label him as insane ...\nIf you think about his demeanor because I I don't know by the way I don't\nKnow what uh uh uh what what do you call it the the hero voyage or or what whatever Trump is on right now\nI'm [laughter] I'm not I'm not sure what that means [laughter] ah I I really don't know ah ah well I\nThink you can you sometimes you can go through a lot of Cairo journey is what he said yeah you're you're there you go through a ... a lot of Kanye West lurks okay I understand this point I don't understand the sense at all why are they are and I do I have no idea what this means yeah get back\nKind of get back to you know I mean look look to the Beatles for inspiration she loves you yeah yeah yeah she loves you yeah yeah yeah\nAnd and all I disagree with you if you're looking for\nComplete and total accuracy in a song tax man mhm yeah oh sure also from the Beatles yes yes I mean that's accuracy is death I mean that that was come you understood that exactly what was in one for me\nWas that when they had the Ninety percent tax I was nine for you and one for me it was on yeah which was actually the ... right at the time you know and\nI think in the but\nIf you look at his demeanor and the way ... is actually taught I think he was on chemical things where he said a couple of things and listening to them it's like I was like if you don't look at the video you're like is that Kanye talking because he his demeanor was calm\nAnd straight to the point it wasn't the Taylor Swift moment it wasn't that it wasn't the moment after Katrina the George Bush um it it wasn't that it was something that the content of the comment\nReally couldn't be debated by the left so what do they do\nWell they go to the labeling and the name calling and then you know all of a sudden will now he's crazy which means he's not capable of making a thought at all you know this goes beyond the ... uh you know and and the comments were all over the place you know the the token comment a from a Thursday\nOr you know to the insane comment but the insane comment is well he's not capable he doesn't\nHave the facts wired to do that why is the ... why is anybody surprise that\nA a black man in rap ...\nThat's been in rap now for a couple of decades mhm looks overall\nAnd remember you know you're a\nOf rappers view themselves as a lot of old rocker\nAs a lot of old rockers did as revolutionaries ... and you look what are you looking for you're looking for where you believe\nManipulation may be happening\nOr if you want to look at manipulation if you want to look at bigotry if you want to look at intolerance if you want to look at an elite a stab which meant that is telling all blacks\nYou must think light or something is wrong with you I'm not surprised more male rap stars haven't come out and said well this is ridiculous\nMhm as Tanya is doing\nI think it's completely and totally normal that you'd look and you'd say wait a minute the Democratic party has been manipulate look we get calls\nFrom blacks all the time that said I finally woke up and realize\nThe ... now it's not the majority ... but it's growing mhm and obviously when that message just put out to any demographic that exist out there that you must act\nThis way you must think this way there's only one way to think and if you don't think this way you are betraying your race\nSomebody's finally going to stand up and saying you're full of it\nRight that is just naturally going to happen and that's essentially the point that Congress made on chemical\nYou know this this is ridiculous that someone can't think independently but they've got they've got to be a part of groupthink I mean imagine Trump had said that\nIt would be done\nThat not that all blacks think alike but they should think alike politically huh it would be over CNN would have a twenty four hour special report on it\nAnd and that's that's the thing they and and for ... it is you know it's the point\n... who he's always been he's getting attention you know because well\nThat's what he likes by the way I made a mistake of just you know mentioned a few uh you know running backs out there who I thought was great because wherever you leave out somebody's gonna and the list was not include was not inclusive\nOh would you leave at Walter Payton you know oh\nEric Eric Dickerson people or you know I'm going to bring a\nA you know a a that up and it's Smith\nYeah
