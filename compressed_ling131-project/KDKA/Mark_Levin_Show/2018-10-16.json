if you didn't hear it and we talked about the civil war we're now experiencing in this country between the left and the right\nIn my opinion for the soul of our country we also talked about how Justice Kennedy hearings were really not about his qualifications but a continuation of that battle when when you understand that\nIt puts it a little better perspective it didn't matter who President Trump was going to nominate and they were against\nThem in fact I don't know if you're a member of the placards of the protesters I don't even think they had a name on\nIt I don't know if they had an ex or what they have but it didn't matter it was all about making sure that the president couldn't appoint a ... his choice let alone a conservative and the chief aim of that battle\nRemoved President Trump from office the left\nThe Democrats and the media that's all the same as I pointed out before never accepted his victory\nAnd they're doing everything possible to undermine that that seems pretty obvious so in this segment I Want to talk about what I said this last night what a great job President Trump has done during his time in office despite the best efforts of the left\nNow I've set for months now I could care less about what he says and much more than what he does and in fact that's I guess it makes me behavior list that's how I feel about people you know they they may say awful things about you or to others but if they treat you well\nPoliticians typically talked our officers that's not a big deal you know we talk then you've talked to the Russians including a bomb and you remember Obama promising off Mike the things will be better when he got re elected but he you know make more stuff happened\nI've been a big supporter sessions when he was a senator but I'm disappointed in his jobs attorney general and disappointed his lack of oversight Rosenstein but more of that later\nSessions should have made amends by fire Rosenstein especially if he threatened to congressional staffers did you hear that he threatened them as they helped their bosses conduct oversight\nAnd justice disappointed by the way is the new FBI direct to almost nonchalant attitude about corruption and his agency that amazes me\nThis is all gotten way out of hand and it was clear to many people by now that Mueller's investigation is a witch hunt in search of a crime\nIf anything there was a soft coup to get rid of President Trump perpetrated by the highest that blondes of our government at the Justice Department and at the FBI and I'm not sure until all the dust settles lose my prediction if\nWe won't find President Obama's fingerprints all over the you wait and see we're we're never supposed to find out about the subterfuge because Hillary was supposed to win\nRight her champagne and our celebration I was a big boats the celebration is supposed to happen in New York City\nThere were waiting for her match the only one thing it never happened Donald Trump crashed that party and they're never going to forgive him for that and all of it would have been swept under the rug but she didn't win and that's where this tyranny and this resistance started if not sooner\nThe swamp must be drained by President Trump and this must never be allowed to happen again it's time to free President Trump from this distraction I Want to know you think it's time to free the American people from this distraction\nIt is time to free all the defendant smaller so foreign named in this witch hunt like Michael Flynn that never should have happened he didn't even know he was being under investigation I don't think at the time\nIt's all part of the resistance and it's got it and let me tell ya I I Want to go on but I Want to get your calls what I thought about President Obama we never

let's go to Jake in Quantico, Virginia yeah you're on with mark\nHijack a mark hey how ya doing real well how you do\nA good point I just wanted to make is that what you mentioned about all the good that a ... and she was doing with I'm moving the embassy to Jerusalem are recognizing conservative values of a nation of laws with one of the build the wall and all that despite of his personal shortcomings\nI think a lot of times we can see with the ah the recent interview that he did when he was asked a lot of those hard questions along with the first lady\nThat we can overlook a lot of these things despite his personal shortcomings of infidelity and such like that he still is fighting for these conservative values appointees Supreme Court justice is like you were a note in about a course touching a\nKavanaugh what is something that uh you would think would be something that would be condemnation let's say a and twenty twenty the next election if something came out\nYou know fighting against someone like Hillary Clinton in the last election with a you know her her personal server and breaking that sort of a\nSecurity law in that regard being part of the deep state having someone a was something that you see might come up to be the next battle that he's going to fight and the and the upcoming election\nWell I'll tell you what's going to be the next battle and off you heard last night we may very well I Hope we don't and people were cheering me up last night and I tend to be an optimist than we might lose the house 'cause every race stands on and so on and I know some reasons here in California that I never thought would happen like Dana Rohrabacher I mention his name and I know him\nAnd he's in trouble because they're spending millions of dollars so if the Democrats take back the house Jake you're gonna see hearing you're going to see subpoenas you see the attempt to impeach President Trump and Kevin off and make these next two years worse than the hearings for judge Kavanaugh that's the biggest fear I have\nAnd we got to be very careful great call thanks so much Jake\nAnd now we go to your national forecast for cobra electronics\nSeen the past couple of nights some freezing rain in the area of western Oklahoma northern Texas north eastern New Mexico and south eastern Colorado but that will likely not be the case today because the moisture source providing that freezing rain\nThat could be further from the truth the truth of the matter is and and I wonder why people like Hillary Clinton and and the all the so called a\n... a bad actors that they refer to know why they haven't been handed out subpoenas and why haven't they got to the judicial process the justice system\nAnd I have to wonder that\nUh well I'm way later probably well I'm very disappointed in Jeff Sessions he showed\nNo guts no no for a for us I mean what am I thinking of you know he's been so weak in in his position\nHe I was for him when he was named them but I've been very disappointed in him and by the way just to your point about Hillary civility that even the very I was thinking about this when you were talking the secret service they treated horribly who who who gives her life up for them\nOr she is and care what what you did the\nYeah and you know and then you take a look at Joe Biden you know swimming naked in the pool and and and so on and so forth these people they they're beyond the word despicable or Hillary puts it a weed deplorable a you know it it it it's you have to be totally\nBlind or just totally ignorant of the fact that you I mean just look at the facts\nAnd look up part of this country is falling in eight years we had we had a leader previous so our president so called president take this country down and I believe you set the racial relations and in our country back fifty years\nI I don't know the number of years uh Pete but I agree with you totally I mean saying if I had to\nI mean saying if I had a son the Trayvon Martin whenever he looked like me are always assuming that you know that and what was the guy's name in the other state I can you know hands up don't shoot all of a sudden there has to be believed\nYeah Michael Michael and he\nSent it back and a lot of people who voted for him because he was like thinking hey we're going to show we're not ... and so on and yet he he ... you're right I think it's worse now ... the animosity and this country's is worse since he was president\nAnd you know the the most disgusting part of the Michael Brown in Ferguson was a simple fact that if you look back and look at the history of ... as the events happened as everything went down\nHe walked into as I recall to convene a convenience store you push the owner around the store or the Senate and the store knocked the attendance down walked out with a budget goodies and then went on down the middle of the street looking for trouble the guy was wired for sound so\nIn some of minority it only as yeah yeah I Know there are minority leader\nSays that said it was the way the police officers simply look you're right on all counts or member Obama what was that I don't know how many days before the election said we're going to fundamentally change this country I live a friend on radio who said measure of you sent your wife when we get married I'm going to fundamentally change you\nKnow it's it's it's insane and this was the guy we as president\nAnd at the end of the day as far as the Ferguson isn't it ah it didn't take very a lot for them to ... to ... to respond and I'm I'm Talking about a ... odd Eric Holder and Jesse Jackson and\nAl Charlotte and it didn't take a ... was it a matter of a day or two and they ran to Ferguson to to to to ... to stir up to eight and discontent as usual and you know the what the amazing part of it was as they grow that Michael Brown and got into the the officers patrol car to retrieve the officers gun just showed him\nYou know you better\nSo so exactly but but so where so where are we as a country now the racial racial division in this country is a credible and it needs to stop\nBut they kept talking and driving home all this crap as nothing more than a damn smokescreen to make us look at the next issue that pops up and whether we like it or not the mainstream lame stream media is running this country\nAnd Pete I Want to have their ... said it it triggered a point that I think is very good on your side the less just goes from crisis to crisis to crisis right and most of it is nothing writes the the collusion with the Russians and what what are we waste two years on this stuff\nOr you name it and it's a crisis right now I don't want to get into the global warming there right now although uh it became climate change always from crisis to crisis in the world is falling apart but you as you said you've got a president now who's not letting him get away with this in fact my love what he said the minority community he said what do you have to lose\nAbout what's been going on the last twenty thirty forty years\nAnd you know mark ... another thing I knew he was going to win that election and I'm going to tell you why and I hope people listening will agree\nWith us maybe maybe I Am wrong\nI've been known to be wrong we all we're all human but the thing about it was a he ... his debate ... including Hillary smoked every one of them smoke them off the stage basically well and there was this guy has so\nBasic political affiliations he'd had never dealt in politics at all\nWell thanks Pete I appreciate your call very much yeah that's what I said in my opening monologue kind of the people the respect\nRespect the fact that finally you got somebody who didn't care about how he came across just said what are your thoughts over the top sometimes I you know I Wish he didn't say some things on you know right now things on Twitter that he does\nAnd I wish he would I say that I Wish you wouldn't respond to a lot of people but he ... this guy you know you get the whole package\nAnd as part of the whole package I think he's done a great job I just listen to it gave a partial list\nAnd far better than George W. Bush and in certain ways it can be to one of my heroes Ronald Reagan because he's he's done so much he doesn't get the credit for a lot of stuff he's done\nAnd as I said I don't care what he says I care what he does you know ... I'm just thinking about a on a personal basis what kind of surge in do you want someone who does a great job for you or someone I you know has a great disposition ideally you want both but the guy's been terrific in office and\nI think he's grown into it even better than I expected\nUm and here's someone else who agrees but I'd go to disagree to Marcus in broad run Virginia you're on with mark\nOh yeah [noise] yeah I'm here thank you mark and um [noise] I agree with your last caller and President Trump did not need this mess\nHe did not needed at all he was already a billionaire he was an elitist he he could have sat out there and and not worried about anything\nHe worried about the people of this country and their direction this country was going\nThey were going down the socialist staff they were going down we are going down so wrong path\nAnd he pulled us out he grabbed us and pulled us out and do left is going crazy\nRight and\nHe is right when he goes to the uh [noise]\nYou know campaign thing [noise] what he is talking is absolute truth look I grew up in\nA democratic household I mean lifelong Democrats only time my mother switched was where she voted furniture back in the sixties\nBecause of the anarchy that's going on and now we've got and archaea again [noise] all ...\nYou know capitalism socialism good I got kids in college that I agree with socialism\nThat lady hits in college now is ... good capitalism is bad and ah we have to change the system [noise] hey we're\nNot a racist country we elected Donald Trump I go to a black church I'm a white man\nYou know and really the Bible teacher the ... the [noise] the preacher and his wife and most of the other you know or or Democrats well they're all Democrats okay\nWait us wrap it up I Want to have a number of God\nGo ahead oh\nOh I was just going to say I appreciate your call just because we got to go to the break but uh you know I even love his style ... President Trump is pretty funny says you're going to get tired of winning so I mean who would say that yeah he goes over the top uh as we said you know and as a Twitter his tweets I should say\nBought the would ever say ... he's a character but he's growing into the job and I think he's doing a great job I Can't wait for\nHim to be re elected as a a ... although I shouldn't say that can you imagine their reaction I'm Talking about the left and the resistance\nBecause they're trying to get rid of them are I Know that's why the young man who called me at the beginning they are saying what do you expect is going to be the worst part the next two years I'll tell you what the worst part is if you guys don't go out there and vote\nAnd the Democrats win the house the Kavanaugh hearings are going to be nothing compared to what they do the next two years that's my biggest fear and that's when we got to work on and let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine seven three three three nine mark nicer filling in on red eye radio", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "16"}
