Lindsey back to what you just said you kind of outline the bowling were sharp thought was really good because the kind of put some parameters are so malicious intent mhm and\nDone over and over again we say to kids more than three times three times the imbalance of power what does that mean right so oftentimes students misinterpret that as well there's a big kid in a little kid so that's what it's like an down from power\nBut you can think of it um in terms of a student that might be a little more laid back or subdued and you have a very aggressive student who you know that doesn't have anything to do with their size necessarily very um it could just be that\nThat they are targeting a student that is quiet or that doesn't stand up for themselves or that is a withdrawn from other kids because we ... we know that students that have you know hang around groups as do other students\nIt's less likely that you're going to be bullied so when there's that imbalance power when it's one student versus several students or it's I'm a student that just doesn't stand up for themselves and another student is very aggressive\nAh that would be an imbalance of power that's away from side\nNote and what's interesting there is that you you start thinking you're okay it's one thing to steal somebody's lunch money [laughter] family still lunch money but the types of bullying that can go on can be much more subtle right\nRight yeah I mean bullies are looking for reactions they're looking for a student that um is showing some some way of um you know being hurt and\nAnd there are so many reasons why it happens I mean it gets very complex and so um that's why it's it's really important for all students to understand what they can do for others like you know we we really focus on the bystander because we know that there's some interesting data that suggests that\nAbout four percent of adults will intervene when they see bowling\nFor for for for him and that's all prophetic eleven percent of students will intervene when they see now you go back\nTo that though I I Would I Would argue that\nEducators and might not necessarily see the full picture at this particular study says there there's four percent I'm as teachers that will intervene at at some point when they see some kind of bullet but they believe to be pulling eleven percent of students than eighty five percent of the time\nNothing is being done it on and that really speaks to the bystanders responsibility so it's really focusing on all students to understand that responsibility and stepping in ...\nWe want to further the discussion to so if someone is being bullied what did they do we'll talk about that with Lindsay covert from team\n... we want to thank their own little receipt own Marcus receipt of foundation for introducing us to Lindsay and helping support your effort six forty\nFive kitty cat radio traffic on the vines powered by voucher Nissan Rob fifty one south on top of the hill AAA has caffeine burger in what it what do you see\nWhen I'm looking at the traffic on the ... look it looks a little better around the Carnegie interchange were backed by the fourth way down the far side of ... ended up ... tunnels and the Barclay north getting heavier now between camp on roe to Bellevue ...\nTwenty eight flows around R.

this game I think there is nothing dumber in the world than paying for these things ever but I'm like hey buddy\nHere's the deal you're ten\nOr you're going to have to make some decisions on your own\nAnd if you want to go out and you want to earn Fifteen dollars to buy a skin for your character for X. box that's a decision that you have to make right so he and my son other son Chris go
