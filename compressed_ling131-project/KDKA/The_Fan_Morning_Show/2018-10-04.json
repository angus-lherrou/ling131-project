still working\nI don't know that we need a text from um the president or the White House or whatever that that whole thing is the presidential alert um\nI I think it's ... there's probably something behind that and underneath that that we don't know but that's you know again that stuff that's coming out of Washington\nA there is speaking of things that are going on today that hopefully we'll get a chance to talk about is ah what's going on at the University of Pittsburgh\nIf you are a grad student I'm and ... who teaches you do research you there's other tasks that grad students do at the University of Pittsburgh and other universities around the country\nBut I'm a there's\nTwo thousand University of Pittsburgh graduate students and they are looking to unionize they're getting a hearing on this to see if they will be able to unionize the issues in front of the a weeklong hearings before the Pennsylvania labor relations board\nUm that continued yesterday at the Hilton garden or in in in Oakland um\nAnd they're looking to see if they can get in a union they they're saying this is something that we are grad students or they're being paid and so they're essentially on the payroll and they're saying that as employees of this university yes we are grad students but we're probably\nGoing to have a good chance of being full time I'm a participant in the school they would like to unionize\nAnd I'm In that regards health benefits that regards as their pension plans that regards of some of their pay plans I mean there's a there's a whole thing in that and they certainly have the right to do that now of course\nUniversity or if it has kind of turned grounds for your or my kids kind of odd by the way they are ...\nAre ... they're they're fighting this and the university ... there's a story here that says the ... the universities high paid lawyers are trying to take away the graduate employees right to organize under the Pennsylvania labor board\nSo they have that right it will come to a vote but it is something that should not be overlooked because um it is a ... the people who make their life and academia ah\nUh certainly have a right to do that and I again it's one of these things that seems to be\nGetting criticized just at the outset for saying we want to do this and that's not necessarily all the way we do things in America so we'll keep our
