mean good morning\nGet morning All right so let's talk about scouts BSA I mean we have a made a transition over the last year or so and there's been a lot of attention to the back the girls are getting involved in fact\nAs you know my son is an executive with the boy scouts in New York\nAnd I was standing in the trading post up his scout camp bound by took our cable on Sunday watching moms and dads buying uniform parts for little girls to become Cub Scouts so clearly this is catching on are you seeing that in the local area as well\n[noise] yeah we're what we're seeing really is sad to 'em right now the kids that the girls that are coming along as what we called the tag along girls\nWhich is what exactly what I was when I was a as a child my mother was a den mother and my brother was in Cub Scouts so I tagged along to all the meetings\nAnd so we're seeing is that the the young ladies that have already been participating in that going to the ... I mean these are really excited about joining 'cause now they can actually or the badges then we have areas that have really jumped on it um\nOf allowing having girls come and are we still have room for for a lot more girls but um it's catching\nOn All right so let's just spend a few myths about this uh ... girls are coming into Cub Scouts but as you pointed out to me on the phone yesterday that doesn't necessarily mean what we all we think is coed\nCorrect ... there's the family's scouting program is two parts the first part is the Cub Scout program um none of our programs are going to be co ed we've had coed on scouting and exports\nThe Cub Scout program um none of our programs are going to be coed we've had coed\nScouting and exploring and and venturing and valves have been coed forever but those are the older youth programs Cub Scouts is we have an all boys hack or an all girls pack\nWe have a path that has Boyd Dan's which is the smaller gray usually broken out by ages and then girl dance and they can lead as a pet but the boys and girls really never do their activities and things together\nWhat makes it is convenient for mom and dad have a one stop shop program that they could all go together and not have to drop off Sally\nAt one place and Suzie out another place and Johnny as it's not a place where they can all participate together as a family the older program\nWhich is has confused a lot of people 'cause we are still the boy scouts of America but the older program which everybody knows that the boy scouts\nUm starting in February of two thousand Nineteen um girls will be able to join in the program name has changed\nThe scouts BSA so girls may participate in the scouts BSA program from you know for tea or Thirteen to eleven to Seventeen years of age but again it's not coed will grow troops and boy troops\nOkay so there has not collapse there won't be a within the same troupe there won't be different boy and girl patrols and won't be split like that like it as an cubs\nNo okay now so they were more turns right all\nRight and if you've ever been to a middle school or in St girls and boys they're very different\nWell wow now we're breaking breaking new ground they are now there is a debate coming up with a gateway middle school and that is on a Sunday or from one to two on Sunday at the gateway middle school and William Penn highway where mom dad and the kids can come\nAnd get all their questions answered about this but from a standpoint of the Cub Scout program and grains getting involved I mean we all know about you know the meetings and doing crafts and those kinds of things but Cub Scouts also ah have a certain amount of outdoor activities involved as well right\nOh I'll live so we have\nCub Scouts date camp which is during the day of the summer we have we have a fishing derby is we have pine wood derby is we have\nUm we're going to have family camp next year and all of our camping property so um it's like an one overnight it's a lot of fun for the whole family to come out and participate\nSo there are tons of things they get to do archery and Bebe gun than swimming and sports and just\nAll sorts of things we've induced stem related activities\nAnd if you're a your biggest camping in the lower Ohioans council down his heritage you obviously you have freedom and liberty which are separate camps that are predominantly the boy scouts but then you have camp independence and that comes counts\nIt is Cub Scouts and there is we have a program features like mine and um I ... a ship and things like

first I Want to ask you about that was there another a spectacle bombing or something overnight there in New York\nIt was what we call just say a bomb scare I mean I'm actually right now this morning outside of the time Warner center ended up for a second time at least a portion of the time Warner center was cleared out last night about the entire center itself what happened was you know it's primarily due to a large extent a shopping center\nOn one of the floors there were two attended Fox is people are so much on the edge right now they got scared they contacted authorities authorities are being a big conservative cleared out the building turned out the unintended boxes contains some toys so uh turned out to be much ado about nothing but\nAt the moment people get scared and uh just to be ah\nJust to be cautious a better play a conservatively they declare out the building\nAnd and Time Warner is CNN's located right\nThat's right that's right they are all in the same building so this is a a focus of attention right now people are very amped up as far as being aware of what's taking place and even yesterday we had a news conference with a number of authorities here and they said the people that uh if you see any\nThing that looks suspicious don't touch it they'll move but don't handle it and that's what these people that they just reported to authorities\nYou know at four o'clock this morning the president tweeted out\nAnd went after again again went after CNN saying funny how lowly rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for the current state of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September eleventh and the Oklahoma City bombing she had when\nI criticize them they go wild and scream it's just not presidential that was at four AM that the president was tweeting this it doesn't seem that despite the threats are these the situation that the rhetoric back and forth is slowing down any\nNo you know usually when you have a situation like this both sides on the left on the right sort of tone things down and uh we've seen this happen in other administrations not this one though\nThe president or I guess he believes that the people are blaming him for this and there are some people who do blame the whatever the last a couple of years for leading to at least ah the possibility of these things happening a lot of the president does not like that and he responded\nThat Steve from a standpoint of the investigation looking into where these bombs came from a any indication of any breakthrough this morning\nWe do know and that's already have confirmed is a Christian a cure Nielsen the homeland security chief confirms this and we heard this last night from sources that CBS\nThat there is a focus or attention on a large mail facility in southern Florida just outside Miami they do believe that some of the packages were sent from that facility how many possibly all of them that we don't know but they do believe at least some of them were sent\nFrom that facility so they're trying to examine everything they can at that facility trying to look at security video can they spot perhaps the person the packages off a they're also looking at the possibility that the person may have used so what are these cell service\nAnd they spot perhaps the person the packages off a they're also looking at the possibility that the person may have used so what are these cell service chaos that you see a post office is now to a clip these the packages in the mail system\nI Know that there have also been questions being raised about just how secure is the mail system as far as\nYou know we hear the things are scams things are checked certainly people are trained what to look for a but clearly these things made it at least out of there and to their intended recipients but were intercepted before they got to the final person\nYeah I'm ... now we know that things can slip through ah almost any crack these days and are these things certainly did I'm sure the postal service is going to reexamine what its procedures are when you have a package or obviously not every packages\nX rays and they examined a whore opened up and this is something that I think we were going to have to be aware of that\nWill this continual this heightened security awareness continue\nAll depends on if we have more suspicious packages authorities say there may be more of these suspicious packages from the same individual or individuals in the system right now and again they're urging people if you see anything don't touch handle or move it\nYou know the life of a network correspondent is always interesting we're too on the world series a couple of days ago\nYeah what was in Boston for a game one and a a early Thursday they said to get to New York or we have a story that right that more substantive in the world series so I've been here in New York I may make it back to Los Angeles tomorrow in the thick of the series then but a real news always\nSure for sure absolutely it but I Want to ask you a question about the world series yeah quick since you were in Boston you know since they won and and broke the curse of the ban but you know many years ago and in one sense I mean does it have still just the excitement level that it did prior to when they broke the curse\nI mean it's a different level I mean if you're a Boston Red Sox fan probably yes but no I don't think so when you have that tourists going on since Nineteen Eighteen\nThey had never done it before they come so close before I Would they ever do it's a bit like the Chicago Cubs once you achieve this uh the school that had been going on forever and ever and ever seen\nIt does change things with charm does go away a bit less again you're a big fan\nOf the Boston Red Sox so I don't think you could never get to that point again both for the red Sox and the cubs\nAnd the Dodgers are open to turn the fortunes around in that series in LA have safe trip back
