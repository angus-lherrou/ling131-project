connections go all throughout the ball on the\nBefore we go to the TV shows or the fall or in last week's Kavanaugh hearing man did a lot of people tune in to watch that\nYeah it was you know every now and again even in this fragmented environment where people are watching a million different kinds of television a million different kinds of ways some times all million of those are ah are aimed at one thing and\nThis was one of those and you know not the first time the hearings have become something that have a grip the nation's or the McCarthy hearings way back in\nNineteen fifty for a made a very brief moment of a hit out of the old Dumont network who were playing all of them of course the Watergate hearings for PBS and ABC back in the um ah seventies even the Oliver North hearings and of course any deal which everybody is\nTalking it up and if you're going to have a nation or a grip on something these kinds of big hearings are I think are worth paying attention to\nWell it's certainly a was interesting from the beginning to the end oh\nBoy was it last week ... no doubt so let's yeah you're right it\nIt ... from the beginning as you point out with one testimony to the middle and then let surprise ending well I guess is that an ending but that\nSurprise closing of the first act uh everybody including the analysis ... an analyst didn't see that coming\nYeah and who knows what's going to happen this week with the investigation turning to the fall TV we are now at the end of the premier weak and while we're on the topic of politics let's start with Murphy Brown who came out of the box\nOf the box and you know my impression was if you are a pro Donald Trump you would hate this show and if you are anti Trump you would love it\nWell uh I think the first thing you said is true I'm not so sure about the second in that and I was prepared to really liked the show I thought the first one did some very interesting things was groundbreaking show took the Mary Tyler Moore show idea and updated it a few\nUh decades um and I thought this was the perfect time for Murphy Brown the comeback ... she had left or\nOr what only a few years into the MSNBC Fox News era so she was going to get to do all that\nSo I was ready to love this show and I have to say by the time I was done with it uh uh I didn't love it I mean I I I have no problem with a a comedy dealing with the Donald Trump Administration let's face it there's a lot of good material or to deal with but we see it done\nIn so many places uh the Daily Show and John Oliver and coal Baron all the rest of it ah that senior done again by a sitcom not that terribly well uh I don't know if there were moments that I almost cringed watching that they view\nWhat show surprise you the most\nWell a ... there's this manifest ah and that are played on Monday the very front don't have the whole season on NBC and it just looked like our last rip off\nA in this case instead of a plane load of people are finding themselves at a mysterious island the plane load of people actually land back uh uh uh on earth but it turns out it's five years later\nIt sounded like a silly rip off that sounded like one of those things networks have been trying to do since the age of laws um I've only seen the first episode that's all but they're so far um and that's one I actually want to watch the second episode of yeah\nVery intriguing the the concept that they take off and land five years later and where the heck and they'd been in between you know it\nSeems like we have I don't know if it's an overload but the the crime cereal drama\nKind of thing is is just pervasive\nTV I I think probably the newest one would be FBI on CBS rank\nRight there was one even before that uh the the ... magnum PI that that he played on Monday on NBC you're right the FBI or on on CBS and both of those were you know what I Would call completely competent programs they were\nUh not bad they did with they're supposed to do and of course those kinds of shows and C I F CSI law and order it consistently been the highest rated uh\nUh types of hour long drama shows for the past decade so I Know why people keep making them um I don't think any one of those shows are going to end up getting a Peabody Award [noise]\nBut you know for a lot of people sometimes after a hard day's work rather than having to watch a show where you need to take notes to figure out what's going on Westworld game of Thrones and stuff like that Frank just watching a crime play out get solved and you'd go to bed\nAnd it seems to be what millions of Americans most enjoy\nProbably one of the more interesting uh approaches to a new show and capitalizing on the social media craze is the CBS show God friended\nThis guy actually gets a friend request from caught\nGrades and we've had a God is actually made its way into a a number of TV shows even though it was always could be considered a kind of a forbidden\nFor ... a a subject to the good place which just debuted a third or a season this um this week also deals with those kinds of issues now I can only say so much about got a friend to me because I had my DVR set a but\nThe game went over so my DVR of God friend to me is leftover sixty minutes so I'm gonna have to wait till it's on demand to see the rest of us and of course this is us his back yeah OK\nEr into Louis but you don't sound like a friend of this was oh\nIt again I think it's a show that does what it does really really well and uh those first couple of seasons it's going to be interesting to see whether it can pull off another\nSeason but it was one of the big hits a network TV network TV means big hits you know the age of Netflix so it ... every time I watched it I I liked it it it's just I have a uh\nI I personally this has nothing to do with the overall quality of the show um I don't I like crying in movies but I don't\nFly in that kind of move your TV show by the\nWay a million or a little things that just a a debuted\nWhich everybody's calling a uh this is a rip off his got a lot of this is of a quality to it ah I don't think it's up to the ... of standards of this is us but then again it's

project so call for one to four nine to save\nYou know there are there are certain things that to make you wonder you know what is going on that's what I find your sports people have been crazy about this for for decades or about ten years ago a couple of parents ran down on a basketball court and beat the daylights out of a referee\nI just never get that engage in my kids in sports maybe because nobody's gifted I mean you know what I mean parents early on their kids are gifted and so then they really get engaged the coaches and then they think that they get personal trainers and coaches so they don't play enough they think it's the coach on the team's fault I just never saw anything like that and my kids were never got that engaged in it I guess I Know\nPeople who have coached and loved it absolutely loved coaching but they quit yes because of the crap they ring from the stands for parents and parents confronting them after practices are after game saying you're not playing my child enough why are you playing back yet that kids no good you should be playing ... ...\nIt's it's crazy what are we teaching our kids are your kids weren't jocks though right I don't remember no right so it didn't get you that engaged now I think\nI seriously I had a Q out my son because he had his shirt pull up over his head in his last game he was making science with this thing was an interesting he could care less than ... either either going to get engaged\nEither either going to get engaged you're not going to play anymore but I don't screaming you know I'm never say a word during the game I just don't think it helps them and all my father never did ... years\nNow he played baseball the ad out of yes well no no mom and dad did not screened from I mean they cheered but no they didn't yell at me or you know anything\nLike in a mansion John walking out on the field and shooting somebody by the way Apollo now you I I have there's something going on and who knows what could be a hundred things slip sorry about that folks where are you in your process Mardi Gras and now today this is the fourth week you're in the fourth we had chemo tomorrow radiation therapy I Will not have that I Will not be here all day tomorrow\nSo so you'll be in in getting treatment hail memorial Hillman you'd end by the way last week when U. P. M. C. uh announced their hospitals the design of their three new hospitals I went up to uh do an interview with the president and CEO Jeffrey ... went up to talk to him first thing he said\nHow's our ... yes but boy Romanoff yeah you're going to Mars or bud\nWe are and if you don't like that I don't care I'm not talking to John I'm Talking to the general public John doesn't mind that I'm friends with Romo there that people don't like him I think he's brilliant yeah he pointed to the gentleman who had just gotten up in the first really says yeah there's Maurice doctor right that Eris Robert Ferris yep um\nThe other thing that jumps out of me as the Steelers they look horrible they look like they don't care\nI mean I don't like hearing the second quarter yeah they\nReally well in the second quarter but you've got to weigh more than one ... no I didn't I didn't either I\nWent to bed feeling really good about the team at halftime because they come back they tied it and I thought OK momentum is on the Steelers side they get the ball first and the second half this was going to be a good night I went to bed and of course\nWhen I was about eight plays it 'cause I Know it's not that I've given up on the team I Love football [noise] it's just if I start watch it I Can't stop the adrenalin gets going and so I grew up the next day yeah actually you know it's fascinating you probably saw this on CBS did you see the dramatic several hundred percent increase in calls for the sex assault hotline\nYeah it's pretty amazing you know when I talked to the folks for with Pittsburgh action against us last week they were bracing for this because that was the day after the hearing and they they knew\nThat they were going to get flooded with calls it just happens it it bolsters people's um childhood us yes John in being able to come forward and talk to somebody\nJoey got slammed on air when ... you know you know John you know there's the powerful impact to talk radio in the blessing to be able to do this is that people actually call you they're Seventy years old and say for the first time talking about being raped when I was Nineteen [noise] I mean you know it because I Can't imagine\nWhat it's life to live your whole life carrying that and then you've never told anyone or I mean and in a horrible thing is because you've never told anyone and I'm not blaming the victim by any means the perpetrator never nothing ever happened to them\nOr are they live next door and they see their family reunions or someone in a house I had a woman call last week chat us all crying John raped by her father from the time she was six to sixteen never went to jail for it didn't tell her mother until she was a\nA like sixteen years old and and then her mother abuser as a result of her telling her because she was jealous it was it was a carbon copy of the of the movie precious was one of the cat Emmy Award or the girl was raped by her father and then was abused by her mother it's it's a life story that people live in\nFor the haters out there who think this is all I I I feel sorry for them as well this is real life stuff Chuck\nYeah and then you have the testimony of Dr Ford last week and now you have everyone doing\nAnalysis of her testimony and even the woman who was the quote unquote prosecutor Republican questioner comes out in the wall Street Journal today so there and says there's inconsistencies and you gotta you gotta you gotta wasn't enough evidence to build a way to yeah but this isn't a prosecution\nI think you make certain assumptions as a human but I think it's next to impossible\nBy the way the president says he doesn't watch Saturday Night live anymore okay even though the once hosted it he says I don't watch Saturday Night it was that ... with

you think mistakes were made I mean I Do\nThink you wake up in ... were Carey situations I recall a one incident that I regret and regret it to this day waking up you know as a young enough to drive and I was in a car\nAnd I hadn't gone to that ridiculous quiet night BS crap and by the way these are decisions that I may nobody has made these decisions for me would you kind of trying to want to be one of the boys and for ten bucks if you have a date seriously you end up eating a pizza and getting hammered\nIt's ridiculous\nI'm not suggesting that this is what Kavanaugh did every night obviously the guy went to Yale obviously he's a brilliant guy but I Do recall ridiculous stupid decisions I made in college\nAnd post college but for me personally no sources decisions twenty five years maybe Twenty years but but still those were decisions were made my life\nSo my question you should somebody be judged\nBased on decisions they make thirty five years ago regarding drinking I say no I said you know unless they still have a problem the issue is lying about it is that not accurate right\nSo should somebody be judged based on decisions I made regarding drinking from twenty five thirty years ago\nEight six six three and I went in twenty eight six six three and I went and twenty or can they be judged if they Iran easily misstated misstated the decisions they make in order to represent themselves in a fair like\nEight six six three now when since winning I'm very curious about where you fall into that 'cause I did I don't drink at all anymore it's not because I'm an alcoholic is is because I don't like it it's funny as an adult\nWhen you go to parties or events and you don't drink at all people look at you with a funky I you know and they think he's in rehab or using some sort of rehab poll program or some post rehab program so true I just don't like it and truthfully my wife might have a glass of wine and I don't want to worry about either one of us having to drive\nSo I drive who cares\nAnd my wife never drink more than two glasses of wine I'm not saying we're Puritans I'm not suggesting that were special people I'm just suggesting that this is our standard\nYou know what I mean\nYou know I personally regret getting blind drunk and I think that's how it would have been described in college\nWhere you would have this party with the ridiculous stupid ridiculous of noxious grain alcohol punch where everybody thought that was funny it's not funny when you're falling on your face\nI remember clear as day first year a first year and a half a coed dorms I remember distinctly\nBeing in the men's bathroom and seeing girls throwing up on the floor in the men's bathroom and the man showers thinking oh my gosh I Hope they end up okay I distinctly recall after one ridiculous decision of drinking what's called a McCarty one fifty one\nCan't smell run again for the rest of my life and that probably happens\nThirty five years ago\nThirty five years ago and I hope that all of us learn from the decision and I hope that we all don't fall back on those decisions and I hope that we don't have to end up there again we're back

without\nAnd frustration right [noise] um the coach was angry that is that because it was undisciplined and that's probably true that is a discipline but he's still a young guy but then the coach my understanding is became quite visible with him\nAnd was choking here man landing up against walls and getting physical with mark Salter Bruce all over the young man's body\nUnderstanding is this was witnessed by many members of the football team and the end of the day you know it's not a place of a teacher or coach to put hands on a child it's it's for the parents as well for them\nWell leaving mom and dad on a lot of beat their kid buddy they can't you can't assault my son\nNo you can't miss a blunt isn't handled\nStrangling among with your hand and blaming them against walls if you can't

chest he has bruises on his neck\nOr bruises on his face what are you being told is happening to this coaches there is there a police report as their police investigation was minor donate or\nThe police are certainly a had been contacted by um the child's grandmother who's the caregiver and my understanding is that investigation is underway\nOr did the did the kid and or his\nOr his grandmother file a police reports are\nYes that's my understanding is that they can follow pushing for the next morning the grandmother called in because she saw the parks and found out what happened and the police are investigating that's my understanding\nDavid obviously a lot of trees out do you end up with clients from a broad spectrum spectrum involving a broad spectrum of issues what can you in what are you doing for this so young men pertaining to this particular case or\nSo at this moment the first thing we have to do is establish exactly what the facts are\nAfter that we're going to make a strategy that's going to be able to assist the sound bad but the main saying that his grandmother told me that she wanted\nShe just wanted to draw attention to this type of behavior and doesn't want this happening to other children that's the main thing that she told me she's concerned about\nShe doesn't want other children being physically discipline like that and it's out of line of credit appropriate it's it's not appropriate for parents strangling kids are slamming case against walls or anyone else I met on how we manage behavior teenagers\nNo Hey David at what happened with the coach and see suspended was taken off the field is he never had a couple\nThings I heard it was taken off the field but I also heard he was happy with independent investigation that's why I was wanted to make sure no clue what the facts I'm hearing different ... different sources but I Want to make sure that that's correct I heard the word but I also heard that he was it so I'm not quite sure yet we're working on that as we speak\nAnd what would be a fair for you David what what would be a justice for you David at this point David stray you represent one young man and his family\nAlready did that for a young man and his family could decide okay um but I think like I said the main thing that his grandmother told me that she was interested in which is simply making sure this didn't happen to other young people Columbus been having a lot of incidents over there and eat it gets better control\nDavid you handle you've handled hundreds thousands of criminal cases over the years in your assessment at this point sir is this a criminal case\n[noise] certainly could be if the allegations are true and he's putting hands and strangling someone and grabbing them by black and based on simple\nYoung man a during his football helmet down and and make some comments and in my mind that that could be considered criminal conduct absolutely\nAnd and David have we cross the line in terms of engagement\nWith athletes and the significant split on performance have have you seen two tectonic change\nBecause the landmark for a long time so it's not just athletes it it it can be\nInside the human psyche and inside the human heart it transcends sports that trend than parents think get it's when people start treating other people with dignity respect impassioned that humanity then things will change if I'm going to do with football or baseball it's the people\nAnd the people have to change and when people can make changes in themselves that's changing society\nI completely agree when you have guys going the football games and the football game shooting another coach\nShooting in his motives because he wasn't playing his nephew we've crossed the line and by the way these are the same games if I'm not mistaken weren't told people so bad on these young kids frightened\nPeople or people are putting too much first of all not every\nKid is going to be a professional athlete then
