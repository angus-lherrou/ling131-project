Sunday ... let's go to Gary Gary how are you welcome to communicate radio good to have you back on the air\nOne morning I don't\nKnow why I'm I'm like you know I spoke to this time to move on my comment is in this law is at what cost\nYou ... it's a tremendous he can you can send me says you just the initial thoughts ... it's consumed me cause we have you know I approach a little differently every time things up don't you think\nOh yeah now approach it we have a cultural up people and it's a it's more than the politicians that's\nHow I approach just took a long term that's part of it I don't think we bought him I don't think we bottom up to you\nI I thought maybe but after hearing some of these callers today who really give me a good Paul from what's happening I don't think we have for\nI don't think the bottom ... as you say even more than that no I haven't bought out there and we haven't bought right you've picked up on you cook your thought process and I think that's right yeah I don't think we've borrowed a as a as a as a nationwide thing\nUh I think we don't know how to slow down and see if we don't we don't have the balance you know this is this disease is important jobs as you say if it's raining a splitting up there for\nThat also what's important is a culture that needs some go so I don't think we got the balance between money greed ego\nI think in a long long that's what's holding us I mean the short run and the long run every every run that's what's hurting us right now and I'm not yeah I'm just now you talked about uh you know a\nGood morning Rob I he didn't want to have any uh compliments I had to compliment you on your voice of civility and um [noise]\nAnd I just I'm I'm happy to hear of a commentator on a radio that is willing to stand up for what he thinks is is right and good\nWell I appreciate that but what I also love is the fact that people are calling and express their opinion\nTheir thought process even if they don't agree with me I just think if we could have some civil or obedience as far as how we perceive and handle ourselves in this country I I think that we even if we don't want to will find our way back to debate and democracy\nIn our country will continue to grow and thrive as a nation\nOpposed to being so really diverse of towards one another so hopefully communication will will ah tickets to a better place into that common ground that we all hope for\nAgree with that but I what I learned is that um with being a woman I just wanted to voice that I Am not angry and that I just get tired of hearing the women are so angry about what's been done in the past and um [noise]\nI just wanted to know that I didn't know that I really agree I agree with a lot of what you're saying\nSo let me let me ask you and obviously a wisdom I can hear it in your voice and you have been on planet earth for a while like me what are you at what do you think we're going to have to do to get back to that common ground and\nTo be more civil towards one another\n[noise] [laughter] my take on it is just the Christians has gone away from learning how to give mercy and forgiveness and to make more questions on the earth that's what I'm [noise]\nAnd I um I see that happening that we're not getting away from God just put it that way\nWell and I'll tell you some of the recent headlines or make it kind of tough to want to lean towards a God in your faith but you but you have to think of the devils work and\nYou have to think of a why we are where we are and you have to think of the human element and and you can't let go to that life preserver that is your faith and maybe it's time to cling to it more now than basically try to swim away from it right\nI agree with that yes\nAll right hey listen good call have a great day I appreciate it thank thank you you too are eight six six\nThree down one ten twenty so what have you learned folks what have you learned what have we learned as a country let's go to Anthony in Oakland Anthony good morning walk on the radio\nFor here's what I've learned [noise] okay my liberal friends need to quit whining about this issue they had an opportunity in two thousand six eight\nTo make the right adjustments to who who can be in the White House and they sat on our hands and can play while the Republicans turned down ... block Obama\nBlock Obama pick for the the Supreme Court married garlic and uh and McConnell and his crowd wouldn't even allow the men have a hearing so when I hear they'll talk about how unfair to Democrats have been acting now I tell them look in the ...\nBut you you you remember ... you get angry you didn't didn't vote for Hillary you so you voted for Jill Stein you voted for Gary Johnson and you were angry what happened to borrow money so you allowed to Donald Trump to about Seventy thousand boats getting the White House\nAnd what do you think he was going to do when he got in the White House appoint liberal judges ... it was going to put a point conservative\nTo you know to live to the to the victors older spoils so this this is nonsense are pulling out here now and this protest they look like foods because it had an opportunity and letting go ride and now there's going to change the course of time to change the course of two thousand sixty and you know\nIt's up to my liberal friends you have an opportunity again you have a house in the Senate coming up\nMay the correction allows some balance now\nA force Donald Trump into some things that you want done is in a way he's doing it now\nLet me let you in simple let me ask you this as a as a follow up uh I saw it one way yesterday and I kind of been convinced that maybe it's going to go the other way but\nHow do you see a ... off of this news ah it affecting the mid term election or if any or at all\nThat that's not going to change the Democrats are going to take back the house and hopefully back to ... that's not going to change this is this hasn't done anything as he ... his base knew he was going to get a Kavanaugh and there was no way the ... the Democrats for ... and the majority of people don't seem to want to understand\nIf you have you don't control the house and Senate similar to when Obama pushed through Obamacare the house and Senate Republicans could complain of wine and the stock but they couldn't do anything\nSo this is the same course was going to happen here so this was a bunch of nonsense that was going on\nIt wasn't it didn't matter he was going to get his pick for\nSo I could see with Clarence Thomas when the Democrats were in charge of the house and the Senate and pushed him through that should've been angry\nThat's when people should have been angry [laughter] the Republicans pushing throwing the Democrats the so said this is the problem with this country nobody remembers history they're just they get all psyched up and and and they just found out stuff no balance in the historic value to it\nSo this is how you make corrections this will change Donald Trump's behavior similar with the new Republican said when you come back the house and Senate with a block Obama your Tea Party\nThey were out protested they were doing their thing I hear all this stuff are they all do everybody whining about them or talking about them in this manner you guys are cheering them on calling the patriots so now you have some Democrats doing the same thing now they're they're bad for the country\nPlease frame it man I'm too smart for that drop\nAll right my brother hey thanks have a great day or listen jak state we're at because I only have enough time to give you a chance to say hello and get up on a soapbox or I Want you to be comfortable once you get up there and I've been waiting to hear from you or after this uh\nThing has finally at least for today maybe Sunday will be a fun day and we can put it all the rest and\nAh maybe be a\nCabinet family can actually enjoy a little breakfast together and have some sort of normality after what has been a very difficult week as as for the Ford family the same and for all of these senators and their family and the media and those even protesting it has been a world when so I'm hoping that\nThe cooler heads do prevail and somehow some way we can find our way from being so the diversity of in this country to getting back in and trying to reach across the aisle politically but more importantly across the country and start\nBringing this country to that place that I call 'em common ground and common ground isn't that we have to agree all of the time but it is that place where you can look at that photo or friend and that time when your political beliefs aren't in the same ballpark\nYou can at least say hey we have a chance to play the entire game and to wait for the outcome and you know it will be proven and the political arena who is right and as far as the political arena whether any of you want to admit it or not the winter is the Republican Party at least for today\nBut to give you an idea of how this line in the San has been drawn and now we have such diversity and and and just despicable feelings about one another\nEven less than twenty four hours after the process Raddatz course even an FBI investigation that I'm sure many of you were saying was in thorough enough\nBrett Kavanaugh now finds himself as a sworn in member of the Supreme Court justice and you know something that Anthony's shed that really made me not want to say this but I'm going to\nMaybe all of this stuff that you were so upset about those of you who did not and I'm not just going to throw Democrats under the bus here okay\nBut for all the debt and then I could even put myself in this category but I'm not looking at it that way 'cause I'm looking at the glass half full as opposed to half empty\nBut you were the ones that really didn't get your candidate into office\nSo instead of wasting all of this energy and anger on what we're dealing with day after day when nothing comes from it even a Supreme Court justice now a member of the Supreme Court that you tried to derail focus on who you would like to lead your party in twenty twenty and beyond\nSo you need to get back into the game and start thinking about the future and who will be guiding your team will be back in the morning if you call the attorney\nHigh on for the Tom Burke

I'm not a true friend I'm Sorry you're not able to call anymore\nWell regarded shouting at me 'cause this is science is something we don't\nTalk about in the in the in the trade every\nNow and there were sort of like the ... what we call it which is you know do take and they share you know I don't blame people for doing it because it's a long standing practice that people have done for many many years but it's really not in the best interest of the health of that plant\nBrett how how is your season been this year but how has your season been this year\nOh great great or were you know for your

sauerkraut and out of them [laughter]\n... will be over six for Sunday's paper where I\nGot some right on I'm a text messages a warrior recommend to put on the lawn this time of year a great show\nA compost if you could get it ... you know if you put a quarter inch of compost if you could just rent berating machine with your neighbors run the leader over there and just to a quarter inch or compost on there I mean I Know that sounds hard but boy that is the best thing um\nYou can drop spread or to to spread good quality finished compost too\nAnd people think they have to spread it by hand which you can do obviously on a smaller long but you can use that drops predator but if you had or not Congress and get that much compost what would you put up so I Would do um well personally I Do not I mean I leave my grass clippings lie and that provides all the nitrogen 'cause we have a lot of white clover in our law which is incredibly good\nFor the line because it's a nitrogen fixer and so when you when you cut your lawn and you let the trimmings ally with the mulching mower you're actually letting all the the clover leaves that are chopped up and the and the grass clippings are chopped up\nLie on the line and they eventually become organic matter and food for the good microbes which helps feed your lawn lawn so big you have to have a trucker to cut it really do yeah we ... we have a we have a launch tractor to cut it and it's obviously a mulching tractor so that\nWe don't ever have the fertilizer line because we just let those clippings lie to become a natural fertilizer but\nYou know if you for some reason collect your clippings and you don't have among more or whatever you could do like um the organic uh I I Love ... organic lawn fertilizer line and they actually have one that is a force that program that they do have that's completely organic it's you know no\nNo synthetic chemicals in there and they do have a winter rising formula so it would be the final step of the season that you would do this time of year\nIf you wanted something cheap to throw onto the lawn that was organic or harm nurseries got the ... which is a balance fertilizer not behind our nitrogen one mhm for fourteen Ninety five for fifty pounds but I I you know I already bought a bag myself I mean that's just the deal and a half you know when you go and get that's tough for us yeah no I ...\nTo get it yeah yeah and it it's good stuff it's not specifically formulated for the phone rising formula and I'd rather see you use that one in the spring was a three or four three right but I'd rather see you use that one in the spring and then you you just got to be\nI don't think it would be a bad thing but I Would rather see someone use a winter rising formula specifically that would really make good hardy roots and helping over winter better but for me I just use like let\nMe I don't put anything in mind either or what kind of track or do you have craftsman John Deere ... we had a John Deere for many many years and it ... and we had so much trouble finding someplace to service it that we ended up um we got to have a ... now that we really like you know Indian room\nTold me that uh all the universities are switching to electric and yeah commercial\nMore as an aide evil more you know the ones that were using on your ... electric Moran trimmer

anybody on that road Janet and Virginia we'll get to all of you coming up in the next hour half are ... trees talking trees for the final time the season associate gang I'm curious to know what are you thinking about planning winter rye grass and the guard\nI was just writing about that\nIf that was just reading about this winter rye is an excellent cover crop to use and a vegetable garden\nA couple of different cats one don't sell it to physically because it forms a super dance Matt that is very very hard you did that oh my God it was a big mistake so don't do it that way\nI'm number two right is Elia ... which means it produces these compounds that prevent other plants or seeds from Germany dating so what farmers will do a lot of times in the spring is they'll cut that ride grass and they'll let the trimmings lie in the garden\nAnd what you can do that in his plan your tomatoes and peppers and ... transplant right into that right grass and you know the the dead stems that are there and it prevents we'd from growing in there you can't plan seeds in it you can put transplants in there and it works really really well\nIt holds the soil in place a also good for Ben officials right yep yep and easy to find you know again I saw the bags of it in ... you know you could find that most nurseries and I put mine in\nAfghanistan right kind of why riots seed ride the field dry yeah that you want you don't want the stuff that people ...\nSays winter rye grain big seeds but I put mine in after I pull my tomatoes out so there's still time for I Believe it or not to the

to adjust rewrote flavors and taste with the seasonings that you use\nYeah yeah you definitely you you want to make sure you do what you what you wouldn't you like right now and and I wouldn't be afraid to overseas and if you're not you know I Know you want to taste the food in the background but sometimes not enough you don't even hands the flavor because what seasonings Airforce enhanced the flavor of it\nYou know give us something different personality to the food but it's an hands that you're not supposed to just taste the seasoning\nBut you have to have enough of it or you don't you know or your food ... taste bland you don't really get the full flavor doesn't enhance the flavor of the food and you don't get the full effect of the\nVery it's a natural way to bring the flavors that you want you use the natural ingredient\nYeah and when you get into more different different spices other than just salt you're able to cut down your salt but still have a flavor in the background something a little more powerful\nYou know it doesn't sell the way it used to it all and then it's a good thing is that Mrs gee I don't think anybody use them as gee anymore to enhance flavor of the way they used to uh that uh uh it's it's a\nIt's a chemical yeah it it yeah it yeah it's a it's a like a it's really came from the Asian markets is where it started\nAnd it's a version of salt so that you know and but it's a no people have cut down on a way of a whole lot I don't even know if we sell like just MSG ... or you know I don't even know if we carry any more I can buy I mean as a gradients weekend purchase that nothing which we do not now but\nI'm not you know what the trend have been to going towards the more natural see that's what I mean that's not created in the lab something that you can\nYou know just is it a good thing\nIs it a good thing sure it is\nOf course it is okay of courses when you look when you compare and you too or how they here compared to Europe you know people say you know while they tend to be larger than the United states and well if you look at what we're eating their eating stuff that's more natural more grown\nUm stuff that they prepared a they're they're not eating out the controlling what they're what they're cooking and when you come here it's more fast paced boxed meals things that sit on the shelf I mean you know you can get potatoes but they've been on this they can see it on and off for two years you know fresh potatoes cans to hunt for two years [noise]\nYou know so there's something in there to preserve it and the more we we eat that stuff you know there's gotta be something to where you know the health benefits\nOf what they what they have and some of the countries in Europe\nAh or around the world compared to here and you look at the way they're eating and how much they're how much learning compared to ours and you'll see a big difference and and you know you can start to recognize that and we are starting to recognize that and the ... and get it and it's not the manufacturers forcing us to that as the consumer which is a good thing that consumers forcing the manufacturers to\nChange their dictating the market yeah and they and they're listening yes they're listening\nI've been listening for about ten minutes guys are on a roll I just didn't want to interrupt you so basically it's this ad for

and techniques check cars techniques really a farm and has really changed and and part of that but other than that I I bet I bet you go through and you see the seasonings other than you might see some
