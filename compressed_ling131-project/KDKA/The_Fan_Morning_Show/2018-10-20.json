I'm at work because because it's really a bunch of for lack of a bill or were blown you it's not an entitlement\nAnd this is really where I think the listeners have an obligation and we ... we ... we always go back to Emerson self reliance where we we need to be self reliant we need to educate we need to have an old fashioned civics course and this is the purpose of legal eagles we have to won't tell them you know when we go into into meetings with individuals whether\nYou need to educate we need to have an old fashioned civic scores and this is the purpose of legal eagles we have to tell them you know we go into into meetings with individuals whether it's a union meeting or if we go into a a town hall meeting and we say folks what is that six point two percent being taken out of your check and what are you buying\nI rarely have first of all I really have anyone tell us that one out of the three things that are buying through the federal government through their own money\nOr I I don't ever see anyone that knows all three things that define what are you buying through the federal government to have this money going trust in your name and your Social Security number that yourself funding as a citizen\nSo that we're all protected so that we all take ourselves out of poverty for savings broken through the federal government what are we buy\nCorrect and you and you always are first to point out\nThat we didn't ask for that money to be taken by the way just was a man and it's like a taxes I mean I remember that one time I mentioned this before on the show where you asked that if anybody had to pay stuff and you showed the taxes that were coming out but they but they pay for three things the first thing they pay for and I think universally we know what this is ... Social Security retirement\nThat if you hit sixty two or sixty seven or even Seventy there's going to be among the benefit that you receive in in Social Security retirement I'd say most people know what that is the second thing we pay for Medicare which is a which is a universal medical insurance that is only available to people who are sixty five years of age or older\nAnd the third thing and and probably the least known of the group and and why you you know you you always coming and bite me on the show is to educate them about Social Security disability a third thing that we paid into it's a private disability plan\nThat if God Forbid there is a medical condition or a group of conditions that will that if forced you from the workforce and it's not a work injury let's say it's you've developed cancer let's say you have diabetes that's so bad that you can't walk\nThat you can apply for Social Security disability and receive a benefit and so you or until you can get back to work or if you can't get back to work you can actually keep that benefit into your emerald right into your retirement so those are the three things that you're buying that I think if you ask people on the street we'd say nine out of ten would not be able to answer all free\n... and I ... it's it's good to hear that and again to our listeners please\nEducate yourself educate your children educate your neighbors educate all of your family members about that six point two percent coming out of each and every one of your checks as to what you're buying a new port and solve it and the game changer in regard to life concerning future medical care when you retire or if you could disabled\nHaving a retirement plan that is guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the federal government\nAnd finally to apply for disability benefit if you need it which you have to qualify for which is the only thing it's not certain if you have to qualify for we need to know that show a Tom as always thanks for being\nYour my pleasure good stuff from time to your daughter was weak as the show continues the role on your sandwich talked\nLast week about starting to educate the listening audience are\nFrom different states outside of Pennsylvania last year we touched on the state of New York today we're going to touch on the state of New Jersey without a malamute for mouthing Martin associates the managing partner joined us here Larry Kimmel will weigh in and be your guest do for the remaining a remainder of the show Larry from Kimball quarter Roman ... O'Neill\nIn Delaware so covered Delaware but David Stern with us as well and then continuing\nA series will shift out into Ohio in West Virginia as we continue to expand and identify or isolate some of the differences under that big umbrella workman's comp here\nVery very important because our audiences in all these states although the majority of our audience is a Pennsylvania we cannot uh neglect or other listeners in on our sister states\nBecause our audiences in all these states although the majority of our audience is in Pennsylvania we cannot uh neglect or other listeners in on our sister states in New Jersey which Adam will cover in Delaware which Larry will cover a in a West Virginia which wouldn't have someone cover in Ohio which will have to cover a\nVery very important or do you want to understand as a as a basic educational point\nWhen they get injured at work or every state has a different scheme\nOr and they really need to know about the different scheme and how it works so\nWe want to get into I Want to turn it to our guest in our sister states we've had item on in the past we haven't had Larry on a and by the way ... you know David Stern and Tom cheered on myself for here we know the qualities of representation about a man I met from we know the the quality of the representation of the Kimble from um flowers great I you know we do is\nIs that just passed away was a giant in the state of Delaware on so many different levels both he's both a gentleman's are also very much this is very important\nAlso involved politically because again they have to be involved politically so we keep the courthouse door open for the working man and woman\nOtherwise it will be taken away by the chamber of commerce and insurance is nothing against the chamber of commerce insurance industry for someone's got to be there to fight to wait till so they don't run roughshod over the working man and woman to having said that I Want to talk about the different aspects of those states Joe to kind of have that conversation started\nLarry we've been talking about it in our first two segments in regard to Pennsylvania we were talking about the medical care\nAnd um you know if you could give us a little flavor of held Delaware\nA treat someone when they get injured in regard to whether or not they can get medical care because as David I Know being in the trenches for so many years in Pennsylvania\nWe know that if we don't have the medical care for our clients are not going to get better if it's controlled by the insurance industry of employer and we know that we're really not going to have anyone to advocate for them from a medical perspective in order to win or case or prove or ... or\nIs that that started me on a five dollar where it goes it's actually a bit safer workers' compensation because there is never crime and as far as following the employers lead of any employer directed healthcare so there's no waiting period you can go right to any doctor do you want\nOr the doctor has to be a certified provider almost everyone in Delaware the workers' comp certified provider as long as you have medical malpractice insurance and you apply for it you're going to be a worker's comp certify provider so you can really choose almost any doctor you want\nAnd then you have to follow certain workers' compensation guidelines as far as what treatment you receive overtime so these guys came around two thousand eight you talked about politics are very involved in Dover even though my office a woman to the new are down in Dover all the time do with politics\nMaking sure the laws are passed that aren't completely spotter and our clients in the presence of Delaware so we spend a lot of time down there in the law passed in two thousand they have\nCut back some of the rights as far as putting into the schedule and putting in some guidelines as far as trade goes but still it's not employer attracted you can go to almost any doctor you want as long as they're certified and it really gives our clients really the rights that they need to get the treatment ended\nBut that's wonderful how's it going out to be\nTalked about you talked about you talked about a new\nJersey in the past also about the medical care of New Jersey a little more difficult there I think\nIs so Sam thanks for having me back I'm your Jersey as an employer direct care state so in other words in New Jersey um if you get injured on the job and you could ... your human resources or your supervisor there are going to tell you where you have to go to get care um\nHe talks about politics and and you were very passionate and quite frankly you have my vote in the opening segment of 'em but when you talked about politics and you talked about advocacy and you talked about\nQuite frankly you have my vote in the opening segment of 'em but when you talked about politics and you talked about advocacy and you talked about um informant being informed and informing yourself I'm In New Jersey you really need to be your own advocate\nUm you need to uh treated as if you're in the hospital and somebody comes in and they wouldn't want to test you want to know what that test as well in New Jersey they will cut off your treatment\nBased on and I say the medical providers who are being directed by the employer the employer's insurance company based on what they believe in medical needs are not necessarily what your net medical needs are so\nUh it's very important to have an attorney in New Jersey it is very frequent that you will be cut off prior to being ready to go back to work and there's plenty of legal relief that can happen to protect your benefits and these are benefits\nAnd I'll use the word but I'm going to use it favorably to which you are entitled these are benefits to which you are entitled but if you don't fight for it you will not get them and\nJust I Want to talk for a moment because we have a lot on our agenda here to talk about a regard to pre existing condition repetitive injuries are we've covered the medical but I Do want to get into and and I want to come back and talk about the due process\nAnd uh everyone should understand what the process is is a very very important part of our constitution the constitutional right both under our federal government and under our our state constitutions every state has its own constitution or talk about that in the context of workers' compensation because we have a federal case\nHowever in Delaware at the state of Delaware has something called a second ... refund and that fund will pick up right where the insurance company left off and we'll keep paying that exact same check it'll come every other week usually had insurance company pays anyway again two thirds of your wages tax free and it will continue to come up\nUntil you have a hearing date so we caught a term hearing repetition for you that's followed by the insurance company we get a term hearing that's about four months out\nDuring those four months were scheduled heart doctor to testify that our clients do cannot work\nTheir schedule and their doctor to testify at the time it's fine and can return to work and then we have a hearing at that point and I usually by the time he gets a hearing for months out a lot of our clients can return to work or some form of work so they can it's not necessarily go to the hearing if they can we're finding out in front of the board but at least our clients got paid up\nUntil that ... of leads to a safety net system Joe duck\nLocal back I got a little joke doc withdrawing segment where we want to go out of the ... going to do your shopping on the bit to Sean in childhood you like to say\nWell this reminds me of the old you know that that the previous show we had where you know when I walked on the Walt Whitman bridge that there was a saying if you got injured on the Jersey side crawl to the PA side well now I Know that if I call the ... as you go right up Ninety five ... five south to tell where well you haven't heard\nAbout Pennsylvania because we do have due process of Pennsylvania and I want to turn it over to do either Jerry your day to talk about the back salary case\nAnd what that has to do in regard to supersede is hearing so I Want to start with Dave Dave what are your clients getting workers' comp same scenario I presented to item and Larry Getty workers' comp both the checks in the medical insurance company dog who says\nNot surprisingly that your client fully recovered ...\nWell at that point the insurance company that has to file something a and they just can't stop the ... correct there unless they file something I don't just mean like a piece of paper and that's it they actually have to get the case into litigation or usually clients who come to me that are receiving benefits they asked me Dave\nHow could my benefits dot stop and I tell them for ways a court order\nA settlement you go back to work making what you made before where you find something that you shouldn't unless one of those four things happens five dot you died okay well I guess if you die unrelated to your work an injury\nThat that that's a fair fifth I apologized and now I have to add that to my little ... I should not as ... well forever but it's that's the the the whole but people in the last one of those four\nThings happens Sam uh your checks continue or the onus is on the insurance company or to get into litigation with you\nKnow that first tearing jury that there's there's the Turks optical determination petition filed it takes a number of weeks to get in front of a worker's compensation judge in your county at that hearing there's something called a super see what happens to sell CDs than\nSaying we're talking about a super CDS request a and what's that mean it means what's it what's it again we're using a fancy legal word mean to stay stay or an interruption of the flow of the ...\nIs at this super CDs hearing both sides the insurance company in the injured worker are required to present documentary evidence to the judge and the judges to review that documentary evidence within fourteen days an issue a decision saying we're not going to ...\nBut in to the judge and the judges to review that documentary evidence within fourteen days an issue a decision saying we're not going to supersede your benefits were not going to interrupt your benefits you presented a primary ... defense that you're not fully recovered and typically what we do is you know excuse me\nWe present an affidavit from the injured worker outlining their work history outlining their injuries outlining the medical treatment that they're getting in a statement that they are not fully recovered an affidavit that they verify\nThat they disagree with the insurance companies doctor\nThat said after a two minute examination\nThat they were fully recover meanwhile we have stacks and stacks of medical records for the call you got to process in other words ... short company from you\nThat makes a decision in regards to your weekly check stopping are continuing and there can't be a state of the medical though that hearing correct well there can be deadly analogies that the appellate courts in Pennsylvania within the last couple of years did say under certain circumstances there can be a stay of the medical treatment as well\nWe have a lot to cover your job doc you want to chime in\nA David David stern said something really interesting in in the in the in the Fort waist now five ways that you can lose your benefits Dave I always talk about this um ... and this is why I always professed to individuals that are injured workers to get a cow so immediately having\nSigning something that you shouldn't signed um that it's always I I Can't tell you how many calls I've gotten from an injured worker who's saying oh my God you know they want me to sign this or it's an intimidation they're scared all this I mean one time I was actually text in David ...\nGetting a picture of the documents from one of the one ... one of the union workers so he could look at it at the game at the union leader was on the line and and we finally got it and and he said do not sign that until I actually we can read the whole thing of course he doesn't want to get in on\nAnything you never want to sign anything until you had a legal counsel represented look at it a clearly a especially if it's coming from returns company we've got a minute before the break I Want to have a lead into what we are talking about next I like to talk about\nPre existing conditions aggravation over preexisting conditions in in a different state and and whether or not that's a compatible injury and I think most importantly I don't really want to spend a lot of time there because we can only have a ten minute segment left let's talk about selling a worker's compensation cases how's that worked from Jersey how's that work in Delaware and how's that work in Pennsylvania\nThis is legal eagles

Brad show never done a crazy thing and my whole life and\nGave me that Ronald Reagan's radio can buddy Katie KIA [noise]\nFor that matter I was a C student but hey that's why they give you an opportunity for extra credit rating on the curve\nRight well listen this isn't going to be a curve it's going to be a fast ball is going to be right at your wheelhouse all you people who continue to tell me the president just doesn't do enough when it comes to Saudi Arabia after this story broke I was just a horrific story\nI mean decapitation literally mutilated strangled or just brutally killed inside the conflict is gamble\nTurkey now Saudi Arabia is\nTruly mutilated strangled or just brutally killed inside the consulate ...\nTurkey now Saudi Arabia is saying you know well no no no no it's not what you think but we may have a handle on it but we are going to confirm that he's been killed look I just can't imagine\nFor the life of me how these things do happen in two thousand and Eighteen but that is a frightening part of the world I've talked about it many times if it wasn't for Israel we would be in big trouble in that part of the world the only true friends\nAbout the only place I Would rest of my head ladies and gentlemen in Jerusalem Tel Aviv the only place that I Would feel safe if I was reporting on the activities that are happening in that part of the world\nSo the last week or so you folks have been hammering me about saying that this president would take a stand do any needs to do and will move forward\nAnd I was mentioning in the five o'clock hour\nWhy now more than ever because of this sad situation and yes it is a tragedy but it's another indication why these elections are so important when it comes to keeping people in office or letting the president continue to stay in a course\nCreating jobs and yes helping great energy industry\nFrom the nuclear energy industry to the coal industry to what steel is needed for and yes there's shallow petrochemical plant and the natural gas industry I'll be at a more shell as say shale coalition on Wednesday they have it on the convention center from nine AM to new and going to be in for Mardi Gras and\nWith the natural gas industry and yeah how because of the president the coal industry has gotten a bit of a of a vote of approval\nSo I think you need to really look at the significance of what your vote matters and you can tied into just about every headline every single headline from the Russian national issue gets charged with meddling in the two thousand sixteen election the only reason that that probably did happen\nBecause everybody understands the significance of a maverick like Donald Trump becoming president\nSo what would you like him to do when it comes to Saudi Arabia if it turns out there is more than just them saying yes it did happen\nEight six six three nine one ten twenty eight six six for them when ten twenty dollar bank instant access getting here when you're dot com you can text me on the right amount of my best deal in town let's go out to Oakland and say hello to Anthony Anthony how are you\nI'll always well well good well I already know he's not going to do anything\nBecause it it was going to do something to the Saudi he would have done that when they were dropping American Made bombs\nHuman and can killing a lot of the children and and and old folks\nAnd hospitals and schools in their country and that's not a piece for me that they've got rent any criticism of the body so why wouldn't you think that it just limit of a a ... a reporter and a con in a in a a Saudi consulate\nAnother country would make the president do anything\nI don't know I just think there's much more at stake here and I think the president knows the world is watching and okay so let me ... ... ... we we both agree to disagree on natural before you move on to the immigrant story and I think you're talking about\nWhat happened with the the crowd is being pushed back jerseys immigrants get back in Mexico but I I Want to ask you in in ... your thought process what should the president do and what would make you look at him a little differently if he did do it\nAll of course it would it would impose sanctions similar to what they did to the Russian when the Russians were involved in those poisoning deaths in Great Britain but he's not going to end the ... the ... of Saudi Arabia is the leaders\nLeaders are the head of OPEC ... their ... now allow the United States Russia or anyone else to undercut them and is in the price of oil the more oil we pump out from natural resources they'll just cut the price\nI did in previous years every time the United states will pump out more especially here in Pennsylvania that would cut the the oil price to under what they ... what ... what the United States could could muster\nAnd you saw what happened with the lay offs and there were there were all kind of it to the industry are kind of catastrophe through and this is just do it again they they've got a lot at stake\nIn the world under led a hit no pun intended I'm ... I'm not going to ever ever going to be under ... that's that's just not as well forget about it and they've already made threats yeah think puts Eisen they'll do it\nMm So they're going to have her they they're never going to be under\nCuts that's that's just not as well forget about it and they've already made threats yeah say puts Eisen they'll do break they'll take investments that they made this country out they'll probably a takeover Trump Hotels\nSo it's not gonna happen so let me talk about the immigrant is it OK on this one time I agree wholeheartedly with the president of the United states\nIs his main job would force our borders\nAnd I don't know why I'm a Democrat by the Democrats want to get tied to this issue so much panic so come out and the and the numbers that are Democrats need to win some of these elections\nThey've been the ones who who turn out little been solo in some cases they've heard Democrats said why would they want to get which to this story about these illegals and let's call them what they are traveling here for economic reasons which is not\nA an office which will allow you to come into\nThe country and ah he is every why is president the United states to protect our borders period so whoever wants to make it issue\nAbout that they're dead wrong because\nUnder Obama I Know the Republicans don't like to talk about this but what do the Hispanic population call Rocco bottle deport her and she why because he deported more illegals than any other than all the presidents combined\nIt's really caught it got heat from the Democratic constituency but he has Donald Trump the president has every right to protect our borders either that means the military you cannot allow this flow of illegal immigrants\nInto your country face close it wouldn't happen in any other country\nSo why why the United why would people here think that there is a this should be allowed it should not be allowed and you know the biggest critic of Donald Trump and probably on the face of this are but in this issue that's what his job\nWell let's let's let's let's talk about why the times are different today does do when they were coming through Ellis Island\nYou had opportunity you had that job process you had people who wanted to become citizens of the United states in contribute to our government and pay taxes and live in harmony in neighborhoods across this great country but when they come into this country today many of them become desperate and are unable to find jobs\nSo yes they do end up in a on the wrong side of the law but more importantly we after you've even though the depression was fast approaching the stock market crash of Nineteen twenty nine our country's a whole lot different today than it was that is correct for but\nThat's what we're talking about is a process versus a non profit but these people doing as a non processed\nThey're trying to circumvent the immigration laws and just jump over fences income in illegally so that that's where you have to draw the line and I understand the economic conditions in the country but there's a lot of countries are facing more and more economic conditions and you just can't oh when you're borders\nEven though right now let's be clear there are more jobs than Americans who are willing or able to work out a lot of them\nIn the country a lot of people interact passing background check drug test there's a a a multitude of reasons why they're not getting obtaining these jobs so a lot of these people coming over here for the scaled up to take some of these jobs well\nThere's a process they want to circumvent that process so it's up to the president United States for immigration laws and then on this issue Donald Trump should not be criticized for\nTelling me this why is it that we live in the greatest country in the world and so many children are still going to bed hungry hungry at night and we have more homeless\nWhy is it that we live in the greatest country in the world and so many children are still going to bed hungry hungry at night and we have more homeless than we've ever had before why is it\nBecause that was found to build their their parents\nRob point you can't you can't pass a year it was fun to do the as a parent or the person can the government it's your responsibility\nTo get yourself employable it's your responsibility to take care of your children are on which means if you have for the job you do you don't have his responsibilities off of the government or any other entity that you'll responsibility\nAnd and so here addicted to drugs that lets that that hurt your chances of finding work that hurt your chances of making money and I heard your chances of health and your children\nAnd if you if you haven't done little thing and you still don't want to take responsibility for your children that Germans possibility if something happened that they are incarcerated or whatever so I don't I don't look at it that way I see that as a father of four it was live and my wife was possibility take care of our children\nAnd if and there were times I had to work Fifteen hour days I did it\nSo uh so I Am not one death or a Harley on that question because I see it as it is it is your responsibility of the person to take care of yourself and your family not government\n... hey well said Anthony you have a great day buddy listen I'm we're going to get standing McCandless next but you know let me just chime in on what he said\nThe reason why we have so many children going to bed hungry and that is because of the disintegration of the American family a lot of it has to do is because the middle class is left this country is no longer a part of our daily language anymore it's just not\nBut we also had generation after generation who is used to the government giving them handouts and taking care of things in their home as opposed to going out and taking care of business themselves\nI Know a lot of folks who are looking to find people to work for them but they can't find workers so my question is how can you people not like what President Trump is doing\nAnd something else that I promise you at the end of our first hour today that I was going to talk about in the seven and nine o'clock hour I wouldn't be so sure to say that this election is going to go all democratic and I'm going to explain why when we come back stay with us Katie gay radio\nThat three eighty discount warehouse and Murray is now since Nineteen sixty five dean place lower little

this this is really not not good to see this kind of stuff on our we're not a third world country but these people try to throw us into something like that show I don't know\nHere's the thing stand you understand the president has to be saying to themselves and they told me the same thing in two thousand sixteen and I kept going out in the crowds were boisterous they were large they kept growing\nYou down deep he's got to believe that he's all in it I mean if if I were a betting man it would be hard unless I was getting some really incredible odds debate against this guy and you know

and they're on the outside looking in for the next ten Fifteen Twenty years so I\nI think they better start rethinking their attack planning when it comes to trying to take control of the house and Senate or maybe a better statement would be to reach across the political ow and try little good old fashioned bi partisan politics\nBut you know Rob how do you how do you overcome or how do you

I just looked around the landscape and I said why isn't there any brick and mortar people's you know officers selling health insurance there's a property casually insurance company on every corner in every city in every town\nAnd I said I'm going to open up a brick and mortar location and I'm going to be a one stop shop where you can come see who you're doing business with you can see every company's plants that's out there\nAnd get help after the sale historically this health insurance and Medicare's been sold out of trunks of cars\nIn your ... your kitchen table or dining room table or you get sold a plan the last thing you see as the guys tell like pulling away and you never hear or see from him or her again I didn't I didn't I didn't feel right to me I wanted to have brick and mortar locations where you knew that we were going to be and again that's it it it just took off and I'm\nHere we are we we we've got four locations and open up to more in different parts of Pittsburgh next year and um I make a living helping people and there's nothing better than\nThe real satisfy right yep or here's Mary Brentwood hey Mary how are you\nI'm fine thank you very good and I\nDon't care for them for a number of weeks and you are the one in a few people that talk about Medicare supplement can correct yeah\nAnd I kind of had an effect on my plan that I had been confusion and I I had to say that the advantage plans have out of pocket and I met\nYeah that Medicare plan you can and they can they not you can do\nNo in other words out of pocket limits on advantage plans or the maximum you somebody can be building a year's time and with us\nYeah and I like today match it to the ...\nThere's no in other words out of pocket limits on advantage plans or the maximum you somebody can be building a year's time and with a lot of 'em at six thousand seven hundred dollars so with supplements depending on what plan you have if you uh plan F there is no out of pocket because everything's paid in full so you would never pay anything out of pocket\nAnd if you had planned GV only bill you're ever going to get would be a hundred and eighty three dollar deductible and if he had planned and those are the three plans we show our clients we have planned the only bills you could get would be a hundred and eighty three dollar deductible up to twenty dollars at a doctor's buffs listened fifty at the emergency room and that's it so they don't have to publish an out of pocket\nMaximum because it's never going to be like I said after you're never going to have one gee it would only be a hundred and eighty three bucks and with and it would only be the hundred and eighty three dollars and how many times you went to a doctor to emergency room so that's why you don't see that published is that what you were asking\nThat I get something like a kind of like Medicare that and that little bit out of pocket extensively that same thing for the advantage plans we'll\nKnow if if something's not covered by Medicare it's probably not going to be covered by an advantage plan either now here's the good news Medicare\nThey cover everything I mean I I I get maybe one call every two years of ... somebody called me up and saying oh Medicare didn't covered this I mean it just doesn't happen to a fault Medicare pays first and ask questions later and that's why they're always being defrauded\nUm it is because they just don't you know that it's so broad of what they cover that\nYou're not really going to have to worry about I'd be shocked if you went through your lifetime and never had Medicare deny claim\nOkay okay so you don't really need to worry about that now with advantage plans it's not Medicare making the decision it's the it's the company making the decision so there's somebody on the sixty third floor of a skyscraper here and building\nBuilding going oh married been in the hospital three days and according to this code or the average stay length of stay for that code is two point six days it's time for her to go\nAnd and then you're a nurse will walk in and says oh your insurance company says they're not going to cover you any more we'll see that doesn't happen with Medicare because Medicare less the doctors and hospitals decide that\nThey'll marry you got to understand that your supplement whatever company it's with they don't get to decide what's covered it's Medicare that decide ... and then the law states that you're supplement company of Medicare pays they have to pay so that's another big difference that not many people talk about is when you have an advantage plan\nIt's some guy in a cubicle that's decide and when you leave the hospital and with a supplement it's ... it's the doctors and hospitals that guy that you know that steer the ship so to speak okay does that help answer your question so that\nThey had to make sure I'd even things and people could get that they're paying high paying for Medicare that can happen in order to what's going to have a dash ... separate from and pass it have to be medically underwrite\nIn Iraq not true that is correct so I just talked to a lady yesterday paying to hunt just paying a couple of bucks less than three hundred dollars for a PPO she's exposed a six thousand seven hundred dollars out of pocket\nGoing to meet with her she's going to get a supplement for half the price and not be exposed be exposed to basically a hundred and eighty three dollar deductible and that's it\nAnd she's going to pass medical underwriting so it's not that tough it's not like they're going to looking for blood pressure cholesterol little aches and pains and you know it it it's they're looking for cancer they're looking at if you had a stroke in the last two to five years a heart attack in the last two to five years\nYou know you have asthma and emphysema or CEO Patty hey so you know it it's don't be don't think you won't pass let's find out if if there's somebody out there that wants to\nAnd I kind of had a plan to add that I Am I work for the amount of Medicare that cats and ... and I'm On Medicare these ads and their tone ... and I can I say come as a hundred and fifty two dollars\nA year probably over paying a little bit um what company us\nBut after I think it's a hundred and fifty two dollars\nA year probably over paying a little bit um\nWhat company us Mitchell\nYeah you're probably over paying for that gee I'm by about depending you know by about maybe twenty or thirty dollars\nIf you could you know if you could pass underwriting um we might look to put you on G with another company or maybe plant and even um so I mean if you're interested you can give us a call we can look at that but I mean you're fine there if you want to stay I mean that's not unreasonable\nAll right let me give you the phone number Mary seven two four six zero three thirty four zero three folks you can call that number now they will have people in there at nine o'clock today here's Paul up next for errands oh broad Paul how are you\nYeah good I'm good thank you I'm not quite he just turned sixty five K. and I'm I'm retired military or carry on track here or in order to try to her life I have to sign up for Medicare part a and B\nAbsolutely and you want to do that I'd have done it a ... ... but I don't know how to try and care and Medicare walk\nIn it's awesome it's awesome you're you're blessed to have it and thanks for serving\n'em by the way and you deserve that try care um it works just like a supplement you can go to any doctor any hospital in the country everything's paid for a hundred percent\nYou've got great prescription drug coverage you couldn't be in a better position my friend you're in great spot there don't let anybody ever talk you out of it and you don't need to buy anything else other than have your try care so do not let an agent into your home to talk in anything you are in great shape my friend\nOK You're welcome\nThis and I can't go to break without try care so why are you so pumped on ...\nBecause it's great I mean it's just that fills in the gaps of Medicare and it's it's it's only certain veterans can get it my understanding is I think you have to have had some sort of rank and bend the military Twenty years I think I'm not a hundred percent sure I just know it's great insurance it's just awesome\nWhat about veterans right now as we approach in veterans\n... you know I'm I'm so sad that most veterans don't get the same try care same quality of care that this guy has that you\nKnow if you live in ... veil and you need something you've got to come to Pittsburgh if you need anything other than an X ray or a primary care doctor visit generally are blood tests you got to drive all the way to Pittsburgh to get your character VA I think that's ridiculous I think veteran should have the right to go to any doctor hospital they want to\nUm to to make some you know to make some eighty year old get on a van at six in the morning\nTo come down to Pittsburgh and spent you know three quarters of his day because he needed a CAT scan that's ridiculous he should be able to he or she should be able to go to his or her local doctor or hospital get that CAT scan and not pay a dime and meet people are putting their lights on the line risking their lives joining the military for them not to have\nA the best insurance in the world to me is is is is ridiculous\nYou know by the way that famous quarterback from that great community of ... Johnny ... Jack Lew jak I Love ... so I think it's one of the great places of western\nForget master ... who was in the Olympics\nOh yeah yeah with a Jesse ... correct and the tree planted in his name Yes sir I Love ... alright listen we got one minute\nYou had an opening statement about why people need to really look things over because what they are always hearing may not be the facts as far as from your point of view show just to kind of clear all of the Muddy Waters up and to make people understand why they need to at least take more time than just signing on the dotted line\nFor nothing else they should call and get an appointment\nThere's different co pays paying more money to not get doesn't guarantee you better benefits in fact most people who are over paying on these Highmark plans I mean they are grossly overpaid and they're not getting anything of equal value back you got to take a look at that and looked side by side at at what the ...\nYes Hi Mark plans I mean they are grossly overpaid and they're not getting anything of equal value back you got to take a look at that and look side by side at at what the ... competition can do for you\nOr we're going to talk to a ... next to you have a question for air and it's got to more segments he is here till nine o'clock college right now eight six six\nThree nine one ten twenty or call leave your information at the office right now they'll get back to you they are coming into the office at nine o'clock today Ardmore boulevard minutes from parkway east and in kennels built stay with us\nAre you paying too much for term life insurance\nThere's a tremendous price war among the major term life companies rates have dropped dramatically in the past few years for example a man aged forty five non tobacco user one million dollars of coverage Seventy five dollars per month level rate for the next ten years or a man eight fifty non tobacco can obtain five hundred thousand dollars of coverage for a monthly premium of only one hundred ten dollars per month\nGuaranteed not to change for the next Twenty years that's right\nLevel right guaranteed not to change but the next Twenty years if you're a smoker we have great rates available for you as well at turned busters we specialize in politics a five hundred thousand dollars and above if you're looking for new or replacement term life insurance called today for quote at one eight hundred five six nine fifty for forty that's one eight hundred five six nine fifty for forty you're probably paying\nBut go ahead to answer your question I'm Glad you called\nWell all of our doctors and hospitals of course you're with UPS shape because we are from the Pittsburgh area right\nAh I I I'm just completely lost with that they time work you have seen a walk take each other's plans to react or what I did I I called UPN say and talk to them mhm um they\nThey told me a ... show me a plan they told me to get into this one plan ... hero co pay zero zero and ... but I have to pay six thousand dollars\nOut of office okay so what you want to do is you want to sit down and you don't want to ever call one company because all they got all they can do is say their plan you need to sit down with a broker like me and you need to understand the difference between advantage plans because you may not want one you could go to a supplement\nAnd not pay anything out of pocket so they're not telling you that that's an option for you okay because they don't sell supplements so what you want to do is you want to first learn about supplements an advantage plans and decide which one of those is best for you which one do you want to do\nThen we've got to find the right supplements so again there's companies out there are other than you see that you can have access to every hospital in western Pennsylvania and even the Cleveland Clinic\nSo or if you don't necessarily you want to look at everybody's plans and UPN see may turn out to be the best option for you but you want to definitely see all of them and you want to get to supplement option for short on it was sent it so important that you get that option given to you and you didn't when you called you can see and I want to tell you something else\nThis deal is a blessing in disguise for you there\nAre so many people like you who have have some sort of Blue Cross Blue Shield forty or fifty years that for some reason think that that ... that emblem on your card is some sort of magic force field security blanket it's not just because you've had something for forty years doesn't make a good it just means you've had it for forty years\nAgo and I tell you when you see the benefits of other companies and you see what are you paying per month by the way\nI'm Me and my wife cost me five hundred and eighty dollars a month\nOh my gosh when you see when you see what you can get\nFor five hundred dollars less a month you're going to be shocked you can save six thousand dollars and almost get exactly the same benefits you have that that actually better benefits and you have now the same benefits are going to have next year and you can save six thousand dollars a year and go to both\nAllegheny health networks and U. P. M. C. and the Cleveland Clinic and get comprehensive dental benefits you're\nGoing to be shocked my friend ... this is a blessing in disguise for you I'm telling you there's tens of thousands of people out there in your same shoes that are somehow mesmerized by that Blue Cross Blue Shield logo [laughter] I'm Glad you called and I ...\nI Believe me I'm I'm completely I I'm not real real sharp when it comes\nNobody has don't don't think I don't think it's you that you're that you know don't think you lock intelligent you don't there's\nNo handbook for this these insurance companies have counted on you\nOr just staying on their plans for years that's why they kept raising your ... you know when you first started your plan was about fifty bucks a month ten years ago it was fifty dollars ... it's now finally oh it's now three hundred dollars\nRaising your ... you know when you first started your plan was about fifty bucks a month ten years ago it was fifty dollars it's now finally oh it's now three hundred dollars a month okay that they've raised your premium six hundred percent in ten years that's criminal\nOkay so that's so you like God please do you like to have your phone\nYes you need to call and make an appointment there'll be somebody in the office and Fifteen minutes you can set an appointment or the number\nSeven two four six zero three three four zero three six zero three

other great stuff he's not getting now\nYou think most people just don't investigate because they feel is going to be too much of a hassle that it's fear\nI'm going to tell you right now I'm Glad this guy called I wanted to bring this up there is a phobia of paranoia a serious mental disorder and I'm not making fun of these people because it's real\nThat they have and I've I've talked to two therapists about this about these people like like the gentleman who just called who have had a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan for fifty years since they were in the mail or when they worked as a police officer or whatever it is they've had it forever\nAnd they have it so one ... one therapist friend of mine described it as a paranoia that's her diagnosis another one I had in my office on Wednesday and forest hills who was a therapist said what happens is you have a relationship but that card you literally feel like you have a relationship and to leave that\nCar behind is like getting a divorce and when you get a divorce you want to do everything you can in order to hold it together okay and you justify\nMaybe somebody's not treating you good in that relationship but you justify staying in that bad relationship\nJust because the hold it together and that's what these people are doing they want to justify holding that relationship together even though they're being treated poorly and the lady told me and my office she says I'm suffering from that I'm suffering from I'm having a hard time leaving\nMy Blue Cross Blue Shield plans don't don't don't do that don't let that fear ... this is a blessing in disguise for people you know every almost I Would say almost every other person we talked to\nThat's calling like the last caller is grossly over paying these guys overpaying raw by
