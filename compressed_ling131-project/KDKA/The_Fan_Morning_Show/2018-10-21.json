I don't want to I wouldn't want them or something like that around my daughter\nBut at the same time this person is in place and has the strength to do some of the things that has to be done and I'm and I'm Glad for that be nice sometimes if it was done a little more um quietly and maybe that's not the right word\nOf it was a little more dignity that but you know something I mean sometimes it has to be done that way and if that's what it takes to complete the task than\nGod Bless them and and I wish him walk and I support U.S policy so like I said that's the part that was hard to describe the balance between the two um I mean I'm I'm a I was born and raised in a democratic home but the party is not now anything like\nThat was when my dad was an operating engineer\nAnd worked in build a lot of the city with bridges and buildings and smokestacks and power plants and damned that everything is the the party the party left us I didn't leave the party\nWas the end I mean you know that's one of the things that Russia and I were talking about yesterday when we did a little video that you can see on my Facebook and YouTube and Twitter and Rob Pratt you know this isn't the Democratic party that I remember it I mean I always tell people I'm a Democrat because I don't want them to think\nThat I'm selling out my party I'm proud to be a Democrat and now my father was a Republican my mother was a Democrat\nBut they understood when they got together even though they disagreed and voted differently at times what was best for their six children and that's how I Am looking at this and I don't see anything in the Democratic party that's going to benefit my children and I must tell you I Would not have a problem with President Trump being around my\nSeventeen year old daughter I mean I I just don't think people will give the guy enough credit and with the problem is Lee they look at it\nFrom a point of view of wanting to destroy him not even the Republican Party but because he is a guy who really upset the world by becoming the president of the United states and he's doing things\nShowed differently than a lot of people who are just traditional die in the wool politics politicians where people that follow politics they don't like someone like him who's doing things differently this maverick attitude and I think right now we need a maverick in this country because we have to get back\nTo what built this country and it was a lot of ... people like Andrew Carnegie Frank and Morgan we need to be thinking that way again if we want to survive as a nation\nI agree with you there and and like I say ... or ... in my opinion I think we're actually saying very much the same thing I'm just morning a little different I uh I support what he's doing and wish them the best I didn't like Obama but I support the office and ...\nMe too I Do and I said I think ... rocket bomber did a lot of good things and I again as I've said it so many times I Can't even count\nI Will always be thankful for him what he did\nWhen it came to the automobile industry which is truly the backbone of America so I look oh I'm living in the moment I'm I'm not one who lives in the past I like to reminisce a little bit about my family and the way life was and that's what you do in quiet times when you're getting older but I'm living in the moment politically because\nSo I like to reminisce a little bit about my family and the way life was and that's what you do and quiet times when you're getting older but I'm living in the moment politically because I Want my children to have the same opportunities I had and look I grew up in a country\nThat is the greatest country in the world and I have nothing but fond memories of being a child of the sixties and that little ranch home with my five sisters look if there was a hot tub time machine or way back machine that I could go right now\nAnd somehow bring my children so I could still hugging nurture them I Would go believe me it was the greatest times in my life and I know people all the time say well the good old days weren't as good as you think well yes they were and I'll tell you why\nBecause people had jobs people you know in fact airlines do brought who was in here yesterday guy that I have a lot of respect for who has a place called the health insurance store his father for many years a professor at Allegheny College a great place as far as education is concerned he\nLives in ... one of the most historic and traditional landmark destinations in Pennsylvania going back to the manufacturing era he\nSaid you know Rob I Love it there because I can walk down the street and people say hey Aaron how you're doing I can waved to them I Know them you know that was something that I had every day as a kid growing up\nComing off that front porch and knowing who my neighbors were and knowing that it was a safe place to live at night with the doors open you know the keys in the ignition with the car in the driveway and his corneas oh that sounds the reason we had that is because everybody had their slice of American apple pie the problem is\nNobody has a fool slicing for that matter what few crumbs we have left that apple pie everybody is fighting for the president is just simply trying to get us back to the basics he's a meat and potatoes guy who's got some ideas that if we let him do what he's doing just maybe\nI can see a little bit of us going back\nWith all of the bells and whistles of technology today but really the compassion that we had for each other because we all had an opportunity to carve out our little niche in America that that's that's all I Want to see I don't want to be Jay Paul Getty I don't want to have Bill Gates Warren Buffett money I just want to be able to have\nFood in the refrigerator and a roof over my head and be able to go to bed at night knowing if I Do what I have to do the next day I'm going to be able to hang onto it I don't think that's a lot to ask lady you\nKnow on them okay with me the grade level or is educate and all those rising up a rising tide but how do you get\nEither a conference type of education or trade my education to people I don't know how you doing I'm just throwing designed the out is that if a kid's get through and this\nIs this and I got to put you on hold because I got to get to a break I'll let you finish your

a great show um I agree with you who early on the jobs when Trump but let me just put things in perspective okay hum\nOf fear going on there on the Democrats are there and take your Medicare Social security look I'm sixty six I'm On Medicare I'm On Social Security and Medicare broker so that's a bunch of bull because two reasons number one they touch it to run out of office secondly it's unrealistic but let's get to the job this year though okay\nNow this latest\nReport that was out how the deficit it's very misleading here's why the fiscal year for the for the federal government runs October one to ... okay first three months of this fiscal year there was no tax cut and when\nThose numbers were in it takes a month for the ... the numbers in front of grandmother really register so that report that came out was about eight months of revenue for months not on tax cuts\nWhen the economy expanding there's more people paying taxes into the car or is it really didn't start taking effect most likely to February okay [noise]\nSo I mean I Know what McConnell said but that Trump's not going to do that he's not going to cut those programs that that's insane and that's just the whole democratic playbook they always say and every time I remember back when I was present\nThere isn't I have seen campaign signs out now that say you know save Social Security say Medicare that stuff's not at this and that anybody who would ever do that and use that as a campaign slogan and get in office and try to do that you may be out of office so I'm just saying of\nCourse it would be of course it would and here's the thing Trump increased Medicare considerably took the ... it's like a gap okay it's there it's it's gone in a month a year earlier and secondly the hard physical therapy cat Rob that use would be if you had to twenty two hundred dollars worth of physical therapy or not you're out of luck\nAnd and and and also Obama took eight hundred million dollars on a Mac or took away the best supplement Arthur F which is basically no money out of pocket so the miss just scare tactics\nPure and simple that they're using to try to win votes and and it it ... me to no end because I just know it's garbage and what you said is true too I remember when I was kid\nEveryone had jobs neighbors knew everybody it was a much different time\nThere was no garbage in the streets there was a boarded up buildings there wasn't syringes and needles on the ground on main street America and there wasn't murders listen we had one murder in and around the area that I call home\nAnd that was the only one and it didn't happen until I was well into my thirties so I'm just saying that she just was not heard of there was no murders are rapes are for armed robbery and listen I'm

instant access to give it a dot com you can text us on the right on I'm On the line best deal in town here Johnny ... hey Johnny welcome ... radio\nGood thank you how he was warning good doing good what's going on\nHere I Am from rather than drones and ... and ... they were paying him back in Nineteen forty and really huge um I've been trimming them back they were up to probably about Fifteen feet at one time I go down to about eight feet but [noise]\nThey just take over every year and I know it takes here from the blown to come back but I was wondering about putting them back and uh how little I can actually take them\nWell the first thing is here here's the thing about any rubber tree it's always going to try try and find its genetic height so it's always going to continue to\nTo try and work its way to being taller or to overtake as you as you said um you never want to take more than one third of the plant off when you're doing this and I think if you're going to happen to be doing this every year it's it's gradually going to put the plant and declined uh so you know and as you said for trimming now\nYou're you're removing those bugs or that will be next year's flowers so\nYou know\nIt's it's about where you can you know how much growth you can accept you know if it's if it's too much\nYou have nothing to lose because because you know if it's covering windows and that sort of thing that's people's space and so you've got you've got to cut it out and so you just got to make some choices as far as what you want to do with the plant because as I said it's always going to want to be it's\nGenetic height and width that's just what it's always going to grow and try and do so never take more than one third of and if it was me I Would only trim every other year that was that's just the way I Would do it\nYeah I mean I Would find on wait until the spring to do is\nYeah if you're a ... that's a case great because I Would just I Would wait till ... right after they're done blooming because that that's what I mean like right after they're done blooming that's when they're going to put on buds again for the next\nI Would wait till ... right after they're done blooming\nBecause that's that's what I mean like right after they're done bloom and that's when they're going to put on buds again for the next season and so now you won't lose those beautiful flowers and next year as I said take a you know about a third of it off be careful you know a printing as an art\nJust just take a cut step back and and just go careful and you'll be OK\nOkay the same thing with his alias or ... treated the same way\nOkay All right thank you so much I have a great day thank you sorry you remember our good friend Dr Marc Conrad\nMany years ago and his wife Jane and sweat
