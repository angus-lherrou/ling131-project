breaking news this morning Pope Francis\nMorning Pope Francis today has sent a letter to and accepted the resignation of\nCardinal Donald Wuerl from the Washington diocese and a cardinal Wuerl of course I Pittsburgh natives say you're Eighteen years as the bishop of Pittsburgh and during that time according to the grand jury report\nAh he was the bishop at the time that they identified thirty two priests who were accused of abuse\nAnd of course a cardinal Wuerl was accused of\nHandling some of those cases as transfers I'm rather than prosecutions even though many believe that he was on the forefront of getting the Catholic Church to change the way they handle abusive priests and wanted to get a reaction\nTo this story breaking news overseas one of the Pittsburgh leaders of snap an acronym for survivors network of those abused by priests ... Institute of ... new Zion friend good morning good morning\nAnd what is your reaction to a donor was departure from the Washington diocese them from the Catholic Church\nWell for me it's a mixed emotion I mean I think he should resign but I also think he needs to explain his part\nIn there I Need an explanation of how involved he lives in those transfer and I also think\nHe kind of ... ... what he did as he put his letter of resignation in\nAnd yes it was accepted but then where does he go\nUm what happens to him how is he taking care of and what about the victims he just walked away but the victims can't walk away and I think people need to get many many answers um he never apologized he never said his full part\nAnd he just kept saying he'll get his ride racket nation is that what people want by whites is his explanation and where is he going and that's the next question people should ask they keep going to be taken care of home late so city every sat down and that's just the way I feel about that friend\nLet me ask you this because there has never been to my knowledge and any accusations or insinuations that Donald ... the man was ever involved in any abuse of anyone he\nWas like wow what the the bishop of Pittsburgh and as I said thirty two of\nThese accused priests were under his ah his\nAdministration and and I understand that Iraq but at the same time she was not personally accused of any of these abuses so\nBut when you're in charge of a large institution like the Catholic Church if only person comes to you with in that institution and has only concern or complain or\nAnd involved in it scares me any type of sexual abuse or they're concerned about it or accusations for made about ... your ... your ... to report it and take care of it and remove those parties so they could not hurt another child and if he failed to do that\nThen he needs to resign and it's in the grand jury porch so\nHe needs to show what the records we need those names from fad reports the ones that were rejected it and I know that Josh if you're always working on that you could not be part of an institution in Florida the Catholic Church and\nDecide not to exercise your authority\nYour authority if somebody comes to you and there was a complain about a ... thing you do everything in your power to make sure that priest it never around any child again friends felt that\nThe free and he certainly changed the culture in Pittsburgh before he left as how these situations were handled and bishop but David ... big certainly inherited that changed culture in how these things were handled a\nTotally separate I totally disagree with that I feel that the church has chosen to put their reputation first nights that children's safety and\nYou cannot keep apologizing and stayed in that you didn't know any better any human being down that if\nAny predator any pedophile is near a child they will hurt that child and every one of us as human beings whether you're part of the Catholic Church whether you're part of the boy scouts or\nWhether you're part of the school and neighborhood if they're chauffeured near you and you sit back somebody that it can harm them even if it's from one time\nYou remove fat threat from that child\nAre you asking for bishops ... to also resign\n[noise] um I Would like to see that happen because I feel that if you are part of the Catholic organizations and not use your full part to remove threats from children yes she said resigned as well\n... one of the Pittsburgh leaders of snap survivors network of those abused by priests honor

the bishop of the Catholic diocese here in Pittsburgh bishop good morning\nMorning to Larry in morning he joined that are always good to connect with you guys in your life with a with\nA we have connected in a lot of better days than this one what is your reaction to the pope accepting the resignation of the cardinal the Washington DC and your friend Donald war\nWell we know that a couple of weeks ago the carnival said that he was going to visit with a Pope Francis and\nAnd ask that he uh except his resignation he offered a ... as as is required to bishops when we reached age Seventy five he sent this letter in three years ago in the in getting that you know one of the Holy Father wanted to accept the resignation that he was presenting a letter\nBut I think he felt that because of um a ... you know the the lack of trust in him and for the good of the church that uh he was asking for the cook up an obvious see we get the news today that the pope Francis has accepted his resignation\nHow do you feel about it personally\n[noise] well I think it's important to to recognize it with the criminal world said a couple of weeks ago to say well you know he doesn't want ah him to be standing in a way of people's trust in the church and more importantly people's faith in God and I think that\nUm the level of of anger that came out after the uh\nThe grand jury report and then that was compounded by\nThe criminal a character that that that he really felt that for the past took care of the people of Washington but he was asking Pope Francis to accept that resignation or whatever\nYou know happening in their conversation with each other a lot of the pope Francis herded and a trust that he um except that the resignation for the reasons why ... asked that he would for the for the sake of the people\nMiserable last hour we had a chance to talk to someone from survivors network of those abused by priests and she said that Donald world needed to come out with an apology and an explanation of his actions in a statement this morning\nHe said once again for any past errors in judgment I Apologize and asked for part and she also went on to say you shouldn't stop here and she ...\nShouldn't stop here and she mentioned that you should step aside as well what's your reaction to that\n[noise] well you know we see a a he had done earlier I had thought about that I prayed about that an awful lot uh you know about whether I should resign or not and I think in my prayer I realized that you know God is asking the bishop of Pittsburgh and and be the Pittsburgh at this particular time I\nCan say honesty that said I became bishop but thousands seven I uh have followed a the steps to really address the situation of the sexual abuse of minors uh\nUh I think that had been true to what's been expected me I'm not perfect you know I think when we had our service of apology if a couple of weeks ago I\nSaid you know that I'd be sorry for any mistake that I made one of them for example or is that uh you know I held a position for a long time that I was released the names of priests defenders public\nRate but I did do that with the attorneys general uh and uh you know what I maintain that position for a while you know we get really said\nOn August fourteenth and uh as I look back I Wish that I Would release those names a lottery or so that would have been one of the things that I Wish it were done done differently but I think\nEvery move that I've tried to make in my ... especially around this particular issue you know I've tried to do that out of a concern for victims\nAre concerned for the for the church so as I prayed over that uh you know I I feel that I I uh that I Need to continue to be the bishop of Pittsburgh in to try to help the diocese\nAnd all of its people to move on for he and like\nWhat is currently being done for the victims in this region under your watch\nWell you know I think we're still continue to reach out to
