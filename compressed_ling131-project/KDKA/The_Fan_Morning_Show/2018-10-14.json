to throw extra caffeine in me to to listen or even call in in the morning against a watch my blood pressure grow apart and what it actually is that you know now I'm Serious I mean I've I've got to watch out because it's it has\nNothing to happen to you so do what you got to do I'm Sorry I don't want nothing to happen you do what you have to do\nWell I I appreciate that but like I I Want you to know that I'm Out here rooting for you All right buddy 'cause you're you're the only ... that ah you know these things the way they are in the way they should be well I appreciate that so well on\nOn on the a federal level as far as senators and representatives are concerned okay we've already heard Maxine Waters unnerved impeach forty five and ... forty five and ...\nWe've seen a with the Kavanaugh situation how down and dirty the Democrats can get when they want to in terms of trying to get their way and I really think Rob if they got the house of representatives not only with this Mahler investigation go forward and now they're going after Jared Kushner and his family as far as taxes\nI have no doubt that they would go after a a a pinch as much as they can you know the I heard the other day that uh somebody was looking into 'em and talking with Stephen Miller now he's in the Trump admitted administration I don't know exactly what he does\nBut his third grade teacher\nAnd one that hit you know no a bottom and she was saying well you know he was a loner and uh uh he was a type of person or a who well he ate glue\nActually use ... funny Katie KIA far I'm busy morning getting radio lots of folks trying to get in on this conversation\nAnd don't forget Rebecca talking Tuesday night uh we have got some great guest lined up as we continue to look\nAt the mid term

Madonna of Franklin and Marshall is polling center at nine thirty right automotive text messages are coming in\nFast and furious the best deal in town\nUm says okay Rob we don't need a war over a reporter being killed also at every Trump rally or he points to the assembled media and bellows that they are the enemy of the people don't you think he's juvenile athletics uh antics have consequences Saudi\nTerrorists for Trump love on educated voters I really don't like President Trump\nLet me say this I feel sorry for him and what the country's going through Spiro Agnew resigned because he was about to be charged with tax evasion\n'em down so that's the latest as far as what we have from the right on the move text message\nAligned you can text me what you were thinking today if you want eight six six three nine one ten twenty best deal and talents go to I'm Joe in North for sale Joe how're you doing good morning walk 'em to Katie K radio\nTo talk to your route\nYou know I get a caller earlier talking about the whole impeachment thing and and folks just get all excited about that on both sides but it's just such a hard process I'm sure you're aware and you've explained it before\nIt would take to actually impeach the president to uh you know have them removed from office it's well it's never happened\nIn fact in our entire history there's been only eight people every move because of impatience impeachment they were federal judges out of how many hundreds of ... there's probably served so you know even if the Democrats do when the house and I don't think they're going to win the Senate but I think that probably one of the house\nBut even if they won the Senate you'd have to get so many geo pay to to vote in favor of the articles of impeachment you're talking about what would it be Seventeen yeah you need sixty seven votes it's just not going to happen uh unless they be charges a where so\nSo agree just that you know it was a no brainer and I just don't see that I tell you what it's really troubling and and I'm not a Trump fan I'll be be flat out on us about that what's really troubling is how bogged down even with\nA him having a you know the Congress or both sides being jailed pay a bogged down things or Washington\nOr with all the you know just over\nSo many things this investigation whatever it is when will end there's it over with if he's done something wrong then you should face consequences every house let's move forward and get the country moving so you know I'm with you and most of your callers on that or or whether whether I like everything about Trump burn up\nBut don't you agree with me that if any politician and especially with the headlines and this is just another in many headlines including what Tom was talking about the dislike for us from China and what's happening with Russian and in Russia and all of these accusations of collusion and last\nVery pleased with us as well do\nYou really think this is the time if you're serving the country as a public servants that you want to impeach a commander in chief who actually has a a little bit more courage than most to stand up and do the right thing protecting this country I mean to me that would be a very self centered ego maniacal thing to do\nI don't I don't see it happening unless it comes out but there is something impeachable at today I haven't seen that a and you know but I Do say that there'll be ... you know many people in the ah on the Democratic side that'll try\nBut uh I I just don't see it going anywhere and ah I also don't take your one caller asked to worry too much about as if Trump was were ... would be closer than serve up the term I mean we have a a orderly process in place\nAlright listen great call thanks for calling you have a good day thank you\nJoe and north through so let's talk to Steve somewhere in Pittsburgh on this Sunday Morning hasty welcome to Katie K radio ... Sunday Morning\nThe morning and Rob or\nI Would give that rotten that shy man and a practice at all or I'm Sorry about that reporter that guy ... got killed uh but I think we're talking about the wrong thing\nIf you turn on the weather channel is say are at the structure and got him for a guy and I'm thinking that this country at you know everybody says take care number one\nAnd we should take care of that people down there that are worrying about the the reporter is Enron fights or\nAnd or if we go on vacation a shop like pay the consequences other I'm Sorry that that the way I feel\nOkay fair enough yeah that is a\nHorrendous situation in sadly Seventeen people still one is enough but it's a amazing that Moore weren't killed because of that horrible hurricane to hit landfall a hundred and forty five miles an hour Anthony opening or the last call in the morning the morning thanks for holding on and the stages yours go ahead please\nRob we he talks in previous times about those people were told to evacuate and refused to eat\nAnd nearly ... ... more alive lost to people's lives in danger because they refuse mandated or does I mean if you if you give someone a mandated order then the ... some for goodness sake\nI can make any sense I have an iPad death tolls cause people to talk about they're going to write something out [laughter] makes no sense man\nI agree with you so hey thoughts about what's happening with the Saudi Arabia situation\nYou know when we cozy up to to to to dictators\nYou know this is what happened I mean you do hear anything talking about the Saudis and what they're doing a Yemen made a killing children every day in Yemen dropping bombs on American Made evolved yeah that's hardly talked about it a loss of this reporter is because it was so blatant but you've allowed the Saudis do\nFar more atrocities and looking the other day because of money so\nThis is what happens when you take yourself with money people do horrible things and can it could blow back on you have a blow back on the Trump Administration well that's what he gets when you ... the dictators in the evening and killers it happens every day\n... well it's obviously I think significant if it does turn out that they were they are going to be held accountable so what what can he do if anything do you think against the death lawn Saudi Arabian government that many people have been saying he like other presidents won't do anything\nDo anything it's not going to say it's\nToo much money in oil involved they've actually on military weapons he had too many of his hotels\nAnd borrowed too much money from the ... through a phase is contaminated with them and he knows that that's why he's playing this like it is in the hopes that doesn't get exposed how much\nCorruption have went all over the years between ... and the Trump family he hopes that the reporter stay out of there but it's going to come out now because they have no other choice because when you start killing reporters now people wonder if that's the gate and found out just how co-op Donald Trump and his life for what the body was hoping it\nLet me let me let me let me add another twist to this thing and to prove that did a little homework here in Washington Post is owned by Jeff ... those who owns Amazon and we know the president has been at odds with him and isn't it ironic that if it does turn out\nThat because of this Washington Post reporters debt that they start investigating President Trump who is a ... a self made billionaire entrepreneur at a as his Jeff Bezos or that you know once again as kind of like ... so it's it's it's as I as as strange isn't it\nChris Rock once they're Oprah is which is rich but Steve Jobs is wealthy but that's the difference between Trump and be the Trump may be rich but beans are healthy baby\nOh are they no comparison between the two\nI mean you're talking a hundred and forty ... billion dollars so\nYeah that that you know and that's a that's a flea on al ... high up\nBut I'll be honest with you man I wouldn't want that kind of corn and people say I would not me man good luck home asking you if you get that kind of coins or buy me a hamburger I'll be happy man nothing\nOut I'll give you enough money to take care of beaver county\nHey man I'm not good for that that'd be great if they hired me every day by a love Anthony man you know even though we've we've slugged\nIt out though to do I ah I I really do enjoy a my time with him All right listen I got to step out here to take a break\nAnd catch my breath it's been a very a wild and wooly morning but then after the great father Tom Burke takes care of business of Catholic education plus love that program I Will be back at it much more solar come today on Katie K radio stay with us good morning\nPie on for the ... Catholic education plus on Katie K radio we share inspiring stories about Catholic schools pairs fate formation youth ministry an adult education\nCatholic schools help lead young people into a relationship with Jesus for getting them ready for life\nThe formation prepares children for the Sacramento and they become lifelong disciples joined me for a Catholic education\nPlus every other Sunday Morning at six thirty on Katie K radio\nHeroin mixed promises but all it really does is take heroin can take your job your house your family maybe even your life\nA while everyone likes um health and says that but the science is that how difficult a for middle school or do you see there's a growing interest in that with your your students\nWell it depends on the day [laughter] change of ah um yeah absolutely but no I I definitely see an interest um and we do a lot of extra science things we do the PGA as than we do a science bowl and\nYeah I definitely think that there is a growing interest um when I was a student you could not get me to do extra science after school instead of a sport\nBut you would not believe like how eager students are just after school to work on a science project and oh they love it um and so it's it's heartwarming for me in a lot of ways you know and and complimentary um that they're willing to spend that extra time\nTo continue their science education\nHere and do you want to talk a little bit about what makes thing Gregory school so unique especially a faith formation and academics obviously in a Catholic school um the classes are reading writing arithmetic you know obviously the math and sciences health\nBut the faith is a key thing can you tell our listeners a little bit what makes them Gregory is very unique and special to blend to face with the academics\nIt makes us who we are you know I'm a big believer that if our students are coming to school feeling loved her and staff and even myself if we're feeling love and comfortable we're going to be growing and we're going to a growing academically and spiritually most importantly to spiritually\nSo we infuse our faith into what we do I tell the kids all the time I don't want them to just pray I Want them to be prayer you know I Want that to be who they are and who we are\nAnd I think throughout the day like you said we ... we were teaching the math and science and language arts that if we're infused with our faith at all times we pay for class\nAnd we pay for class um you know throughout the day we have church music and of course mass every Friday I'm In addition to all of that we read from a book called Jesus Calling I decided to do that last year because I really wanted them to\nSort of reflect on scripture at their level so many times are listening to scripture and we don't really understand\nAnd I think for our kindergarten or all kindergartners all the way through eighth grade they're able to\nReally listen I'm daily to that scripture and then how can relate to their lives so we interrupt the day to talk scripture we we pray and like I said it's just who we are and I think when the fact that we're fostering this really healthy loving environment it's just a beautiful thing and people want to be a part of it are finding out about it and that's\nWhy the parents or their exact having their kids get a good quality Catholic education and you start the day off with prayer a midday prayers are with lunch and then before you go home before that bell rings yeah and the day with prayer it's kind of like a beginning middle and end but that's part of\nThe faith and formation and then you teach the kids you plant that seat it a little young age and then when they walk out your doors a after eighth grade you instilled that routine so to speak you didn't do you find that to be helpful to see the kids grow with\nA lot of gas originally that kids that family I Am so proud I actually teach the eighth graders confirmation and I've been doing it for a long time and I love to see how genuinely excited they are about their face and I like to plant those seeds so that they're not getting it now you know in their spiritual development they may it may click when they're thirty or make like when they're forty\nBut they're excited about their faith that you can tell and we we had the strong academics we have to you know we want to be a strong I'm Catholic school in in regards to the academics and also with the face\nYou know I was told by our eighth grade boy one time he said in his his hair is you know think rags has wonderful face you know and and I was like I Can't believe this fourteen year old boys telling me that he feels the faith in this building so I was I was a great moment for us because I Know that what we're doing is working\nIn for a big school two hundred and fifty kids is a large number for a Catholic school and but even with a big school the kids are still it's still family so you still keep that\nSmall hometown atmosphere inside your school even though you have a large number right how do you keep that balance\nRight yeah I often say that the parents that are coming in for a tour I'll say it sounds a little cliche but we are a family and it's true\nAnd I think everyone feels that way whether you're a staff member of your parents or your your student um we are big family and not too big you know we're not a huge school but we still like mad and mentioned earlier it's still that small Catholic school atmosphere\nAnd uh it's you know it's just remarkable really is\nAnd the northern area of Butler County or northern on Allegheny county southern Butler County that there's a lot a large public school district's up there so you're a big Catholic school but your small we're it's you're not just the numbers they don't they don't get lost\nIn a shovel it's a big strong healthy Catholic school but a small family and everyone kind of knows each other that's a million and they feel that and I saw the for sure the best of both worlds right yeah\nAnd in just driving past a sin Gregory ... over the years to see the old school building the original school building and then the

Italy\nBut yes I Am I Am taking people to Italy I've been taking gardeners around the world for years now and we've had so much fun and it's just just fun to get everyone together I see people all the time like oh we were in London together and ... it's just so much fun we're going to be traveling together from April twenty fourth through may fourth next year\nExploring a lot of the country or it might seem a like a long time for an hour but I'm only taking forty people I'm already halfway there to signing a everybody up for the seats [noise]\nOne of the highlights is going to be seeing those

a ... to experience the food again we have a local guy that comes with us\nFrom the time we land and helps us all the way through this every step of the ways speaks the language and those places to eat and the the whole bit it's an easy way to travel we always discover new gardens during their free time at every step to if you're interested want to find out more\nOr or something ... something to specially for ... flower dig it in next season I Would consider maybe mulching\nWith a just a pure compost\nAnd I I think you'll be okay or no real issues with using and it's all of you know routed down ready to go won't burn it or anything like that so I ... I wouldn't worry at all and get those flowers and get them established and then those are going to be blooming for you for years to come at that's awesome great plant\nYeah I'm looking forward to it\nThanks John's hey one thing I mean are checked your real quick we were just talking about Anthony ... parts unknown and during the final episodes\nYou know what it means to me when he traveled throughout the world how many people still their gardens were there only substance of food and ... a nutrition and in a way to to stay alive you know and I was a ... a yesterday afternoon and you know the harvest is in and all of this stuff and just beautiful and bountiful\nTell the folks who are cleaning out their guards if they've got an abundance of produce don't forget your favorite place to come\nIn and yeah that's right and and you know of I was actually just down in Washington County or talking to the food bank down there about their guard and what they're doing and in Washington they have forty nine different pantries that you could uh donate to\nSo it you don't have to drive to the actual food bank that there are local places close to your house you just need to find them whether it's a church a little pantry that you could donate some extra produce if you had it and there's nothing like it for people you know you've got to you've got to have\nYou know foods that don't spoil ... and that sort of things for for people that that yeah these foods but to get something fresh you know when you give it to them they're gonna turn it right around and they have a garden down in the back of the Washington County food bank a that is just amazing you know raised beds and now they're they're taking shipping containers\nThey've got like four big giant shipping containers that are going to convert into growing hydroponic stuff out of a there's a high school down there that doesn't trinity does it also and they donate a lot of the protests that they make out of that high school hydroponic program\nSo food banks in general are always looking for and trying to figure out ways to have fresh food do do we have them throughout the region oh yeah yeah oh yeah yeah ... yeah oh sure sure there's a lot you know they want they want the pantry to be close to your to sue the you know\nA client's house you know so that you don't have to drive so far or or are we going to take what might take a bus\nTo get the food if you how do you qualify for the fly\nEvery food bank it a little bit different but usually it's just you know you fill out a form that you just have if you have need if you ever need you can get the food that's basically what it what it is good you know this is a you know again I don't I Want to keep harping on this but this this is\nThese are working poor or kids these are seniors these are people that are trying to make it but and this isn't all they're usually isn't all their food is just something to make ends meet and\nIt's important that we as a society we we help that out and as I Know gardeners want to do that\nYeah we all have an abundant ... let's go to a Susan in Verona for diagnosed or Jessica while as her off today the organic gardeners go ahead Susan\n[noise] hello thank you for taking my call thank you for going back to the morning\nEarning a ordinarily I wouldn't ask this question that I Am late to share it too late to

planting Bob's all the way up until the ground freezes and that's how I'm getting them cheap ah you\nKnow ... by ... ... yeah I Know\nBut you know actually for the ground you know we might get a frost on top but for the ground a free solid that's not usually till December and so there's still plenty of time to plant just\nRemember what's your tulips that's the favorite food of deer in the spring so take that a under advisement but boy daffodils nothing's going to eat your your daffodils and they're Thirteen different divisions have daffodils um I I Love planting daffodils more than anything because\nYou know I'm Glad you're planting Bob's because people aren't planting balls as much as they used to I talk about this all the time I just\nIt's not instant gratification but the gratification you get in spring is just unbelievable to see those beautiful flowers are not around that long\nYou know but if you plant it outright with daffodils you can have an blooming right after the crocus all the way into your your tulips are blooming so good six weeks of bloom with early varieties mid season varieties and late varieties go to your local nursery\nAnd find some cool varieties

eight inches or I use a ... I Love fall bloggers it's just this little drill bit that fits on a\nOn a drill you might not have a lot of ... I'm I'm doing a thousand a year\nOr so on and with your retaining what you might have nice fresh easy to plant soil you could just dig\nYour Bob's end but this glorious not once you get those start is

Sunday Morning at six thirty on Katie K radio [noise]\nThis flu season one ... shot him make a world of difference you can protect yourself though you're close to ... how\nWell it's hard to tell why it lost the leaves but my I could only gas and say it's probably some kind of fungal issue which is very common and crab apples are but it's also there's also a weather issue here\nUh we've seen some some plant starting to bloom before they should you know in fact actually when I walked into the church yesterday for the change of heart gala I saw rhododendron getting a throwing a couple of blooms not the whole thing but again a foreign crabs are tough as nails uh and so\nI'm guessing you you had some ... a fungal issue because we've had such a rainy season last the leaves and now the plan is trying to with the warm weather or trying to pump out some new\nNew growth and then new flower in some flowers too but I wouldn't worry about it I Would just let it now that things have cooled off it's going to slow down\nOr it's going to do its thing and just keep a close eye on it next spring as I said they're they're just so tough that it it's not something to worry about\nOkay I just could never seen anything quite like it for\nA while it's kinda weird weird season really weird how to use All right All right thanks thank you but I find\nSo how do you shut the garden down for the for the year\nYou know I've learned a lot from Jessica about doing this yeah uh\nI never cut mine all back like she used to you know ... when when she she tells the story about teaching it Phipps a way back when Twenty years ago Fifteen Years ago that dates are huh [laughter] ah [laughter]\nHi they would say to cut everything back make it pretty ah but as a a you know a bug person and uh you know trying to allow nature to do its thing the conventional wisdom for perennials\nA and grasses things like that is just to leave them out but in the the vegetable garden\nYou know I'm removing anything that's tender and so actually tomorrow all those tomato vines will come out in my case at the end the seas and most of my tomatoes had succumb to fungal diseases are all I've got left her vines those aren't going to go into the compost pile those go into like a separate area you know a lot of people will burn up\nYou know a lot of people will burn a bag of them because they have diseases they don't want to put it in the compost pile but\nI got plenty of other stuff that looks healthy that's you know pepper plants are are at the end they'll take all the peppers off and I'll just compost the foliage are yeah and then I like to end the vegetable garden I like to put a nice layer of compost and those beds and then a again a nice blanket of straw to hold that compost in place\nIn some parts of the garden up plan a cover crop a cover crop holds the soil in place and it becomes a green minorities and cut it down and then uh put it back into the soil ah so getting the annual is out for me is the most important\nThing so yesterday and thanks to another great journalist I never forget this day was the anniversary of ... hitting a home run for a show about the war check of course who had truly one of the biggest selling papers ever for the wonderful Pittsburgh Post Gazette when he did destroy a Nineteen sixty pirates but this is where my mind goes I was thinking about\nThe ivy on the wall okay and and Wrigley Field as well now\n... and there really was a thought process when they were building new stadiums as far as gardens and is it the grass and all this stuff that goes into it\nIs as beautiful as these ballparks are today the grass is one thing but they don't really go above and beyond like they did back in the glory days of baseball I don't know if you take a look at PNC beautiful\nYeah but first in the outfield they had some pine trees out there there you go they didn't make it so now they've got to like a hedge out there that is trimmed to say pirates\nBut if you look at the outside plant things around ... pretty awesome you know that's a tough area to to landscape is it because of the the soil because of the river now it's because all the idiots walking by trying to cigarettes\nPipes and they're all as it is it's ... you know when you have how many thousands of\nPeople walking by it becomes a problem to keep your landscaping looking good and said that so they have a lot of tough plants growing around the the stadium that are beautiful you know uh I don't I think when you had to force field and a regular field you know just like\nA water we got to put in here how about some ivy nothing kills IBM okay but what's to Miami and hey it looks pretty good after a hundred years grown up the wall that for now you can find the ball though but [laughter] once I start it just doesn't stop\nThirst year it creeps no first year at sleeps second year creeps third year at leaps\n[laughter] [laughter] oh right but you know back in those the fifties all of these ranch house as my parents they all had 'em up going up the side of the gym and he ... he was like you know I think by the time I left the house the we had come down through the gym in the end of the house like Santa Claus\nThe thing about ideas or we lost so much of it when we had that polar vortex\nAh about five six seasons ago we had a really crazy winter and this thing called a polar vortex came in and I envy that which had been growing for ever all around Pittsburgh and neighborhoods and such a was killed off\nAnd we'd never saw that before it just shows you the anomalies the tests that nature can throw at us as a as gardeners you know the it says every few seasons we have to have the lesson that Mother Nature is in charge\nSo so I have to ask you because you and Jessica such advocates got about a minute before the break so global warming there saying as soon as like Thirty years we could start to feel some major effects\nYeah it's scary it I'm things changed\nKnow again it's for the scientist is not for some guy like me to ... to tell you what's going on but it is science look you know it it's something's changed you know on Jessica's talks about the bugs moving up\nUp to our area that haven't been here before when we have these ... this weird weather patterns in such\nUm it's it's definitely it's definitely scary I saw a thing the other day on National Geographic about killer bees and how they have kind of where I get those I Hope we don't but I mean they're like ... and do our country Texas and moving up yeah I don't think they can take the cold though\nYou could good they're great pollinators though I've heard really again and they make good honey so you have to die for [laughter] you know\nWell I mean to me that little stuff like that you just ... it is kind of makes you know even ... even the stuff that Jessica talks about about these bugs that have moved up that are on her tomatoes now than ever seen that we're no we've never had 'em here before\nShe has changed a change in the\nIn something when when you see it and the animals that's when you know\nThat you know something is changing look on the ticket problem too

simply calling in with their potato recipe I'll start off with pat in West Pittsburgh and she's got blended potatoes good morning pat how are you\nI'm fine thanks and good morning everyone get more

very very good I remember the first time I made at that as strange but I'm going to try it but she adds a lot of ... lots of potatoes um any kind of early as I can just go in to yeah you know the onion soup yeah [laughter] so happened that day when I'm going to get a Steelers right ...\n[laughter] bad bad I thank you for the call eight six six three down one ten twenty so that should be a pretty rockers atmosphere out there today I'll watch ... I think\nThe Cincinnati has a better chance of beating the Steelers and they have in a long time 'cause that every year that we've come I I think they've beaten out that I Would still be in Cincinnati\nWhile he joined Frank how 'bout distillers or two and a half point underdog as of now that could change before kickoff see their favorite a few days ago weren't they yeah not now so my question is how long has it been since they've been the dog been a while to\nTo to the bangles probably never\nWill we could change before kickoff but that's what it is now hey listen eight six six three down one ten twenty dollar bank has had access to give it a dot com Texas on the run in the middle of my best deal in town and it's all the best ways to use potatoes all the different ways someone's going to take on that gift certificate before the hours up well dry lucky listeners name at random but you got to get a recipe in here\nThat we were talking about the Bob Evans and are incredible product these value added meals so you can have them as a main entree or you can add a little bit to your entree whatever it may be maybe a meat low pot roast what have you talk about why that's become such a significant part of what you do it goes market\nWell you know ... years ago whenever I'm the I'm where they call value added salads came on the market of pre packaged salads with all the ingredients in there in the price you know if you look at the individual radiance they're\nMore it's more expensive to buy it that way\nSo I asked a woman that was working in our office she was young he was like maybe twenty eight twenty seven twenty eight years old so she and her husband and um whenever they first came on the market were bringing them in that we're starting to bring them in the stores\nI think if they would you would you pay this for this product so he or she says because he was for me it's a lot cheaper because I don't have to bite each of those individual ingredients that I'm probably not going to use the rest of them and they're going to go bad before I can use them and that's that's the beauty of of the prepared ... one of the beauties of prepared products\nYou know the quality has to be there but the fact that you can get everything already in there it without having to go and buy each individual item and fill up your refrigerator with them which you may or may not use later on\nFrankie don't you go ahead Frank and jumping on that\nThen for the most part I mean you used to being on the best selling let us was really the iceberg lettuce and now the bag styles that have taken over that you know a lot of the ... the iceberg as a as a base but then they end up all these different lettuce is a lot of people never tried before too\nAnd that's also another benefit now they tried him in the south than a lot of time for some and the ...\nAnd they'll and nobody would let us over there for a different route defeats they wouldn't have thought before\nYou know I mentioned the potato pillar earlier and by the way potato recipes all the different ways that you use them in recipes we'd love to hear from me maybe even a potato salad recipe eight six six three down one ten twenty dollar bank and some access to give it back on you can Texas on the right amount of land the best deal in town\nBut I mentioned the potato pillar earlier Joe and you know I remember my mom standing over the sink even long before there were a garbage disposal isn't just peeling away peeling away\nPainstakingly peeling away but with these value added meals a lot of that has gone away but what I see a lot of people doing they'll take that you know container of Bob Evans mashed potatoes and turn it into their main course oh this is real\nSo this is really evolved as far as a big part of what you do but what people need to understand compared to what it was like in the sixties as opposed to now you know you've got to pay check households two people working so it's got to be convenient but you also still want to have that time with your family at the end of the day\nWell number one if that'd be a quality product if you're going to replace it with your own making your own but um yeah you're right it was it the ... people just don't have the time and it it it's it's a value to them\nTo just buy it already made as long as the quality there and it's like we're talking about Bob Evans it's a French product it's a it is there is there have been frozen I mean it's um it's medically field so that I'm a it holds up and it's just um it just opened up a new market for that is\nYou know when you think about the potato Joe and you've been in the grocery business or close to a half century that I think you understand it still is very big as far as what you do and you know whether it's from Idaho or it's a local farm it's in a band it's in a bag and the produce department\nThat's always one of the staples especially if people are doing it every two weeks that they always seem to go for first because of the the shelf life that consistency you can have them in your house for more than just a a week or two and you can still find something to do with them even if you use them as home fries right Cher\nCher they hold up that the date is a it's one of the things that that it doesn't need refer it they they don't need refrigerated and they're they're hardy and they they just hold up under it and a storage\n... one of the ... one of the great things about potatoes too is that I I feel is the fact that they don't get enough credit when it comes in nutrition it really comes down to how you prepare them and what you put on them but for the most part uh baked potatoes is nutritious unhealthy for you Joe\nSure before you put anything on it you start putting in a sour cream and and and butter and and it's and it's so then that that would add the calories but the potato itself as well and calories it down or if it is it by itself but it's the way he agreed to use with it too to enhance it\nThat add to the to the calorie count\nAll right we're going to take a very short break we'll come back we want more of your recipes your potato recipes all the different ways to use potatoes we've got all of our lines available we're going to be in the home stretch when we get back we got a couple of more segments

Katie\n\nWelcome back to your money and you present to my friends are legitimate bread and my name is Jamie Meredith Marianne seabird is in the control\nBoth Jim Meredith is off today for our quarterly investment advisory review and with that we've got a a semi regular guests to the show Brian koble Ryan is ... is director of research Brian is a chartered financial analysts and your Ryan Lochte on robs a shows of ...\nIt's politically but I I just really wouldn't see any big changes to the stock market maybe one exception would be if a if the Democrats did take control of Congress or you could see them and President Trump or worked together on an infrastructure deal but again that's all a speculative at this point\nAnd the final point I Would make her as Jim likes to say that the final final\nUh for as long as I had been at this a when a client has raised a concern about the federal budget deficit I've said to ignore it\nOr the deficit is big but it can get a whole lot bigger and so far that's been good advice and I still think that's the case today are but we are at a situation now where there's really no fiscal watchdog\nLeft in Washington and deficits are just a ballooning and I'll make a prediction that at some point over the next decade uh this is going to start to matter a foreign investors I wouldn't worry about it now but\nIf you project current trends out to say twenty thirty you know unless something happens at some point you know this is going to to matter offering investors in some shape or form and we can talk more about that as the show goes on Jamie\nAll right thank you Brian a few things are just want to update folks on uh before I started picking your brain and again number here in the studio eight six six\nThree nine one ten twenty eight six six three nine one ten twenty we have our advisors standing by off the air as we do every week you can reach them before one to\nFour three four zero nine nine nine that's for one to four three four zero nine nine nine or some exciting new Social Security of folks on Social Security should be excited\nA big jump and the Social Security payouts a to point eight percent was announced a for this year that's the largest jump since two thousand twelve\nSo that should be a nice welcome news for Social Security other good news for folks are on the health care exchange or there was a\nNo the ah we see this a lot the article kind of the\nUh the dramatic ties this a little bit but it looks like a the costs of premiums are going down the average rate for ah some of the more popular health plans under the health care exchange\nDown one point five percent so that's also welcome news unfortunately between twenty Seventeen and twenty Eighteen those costs are up by thirty seven percent\nOr so not as good news but still it's a it's good news about unfortunately Medicare premiums are expected to go up next year I'm about two million a Medicare beneficiaries of this is from CNBC\nA estimates there are costs will go up by three point five percent of the premium on part the\nUh will be a hundred and thirty five dollars and fifty cents and twenty Nineteen I'm so ah folks are are going to see\nA some benefits on the Social Security side um but uh some cost increases from Medicare side um but other\nForms of healthcare hopefully will be going down so few more things to get sued threw out the next hour and a half Brian but in the few minutes before we have before the half hour um\nWe've got a lot of questions Brian [noise] you know with this the ... and we we see the drop that we had last week or two very violent days mhm\nBut they wasn't long you know when it seemed short in duration anything you can read into that you think that's a sign of technologies the world different today than it was before\nIsn't it was before or was this somebody slim the brakes on and that just had to cycle out of the ... the ... the row of traffic and and things moved on yeah\nWell I I Do think that volatility as a regular normal part of the markets and sometimes there's a lot of noise and it's hard to divine a signal\nOut of the noise I I Would say that this came a little bit out of the blue and as we talked about on the show in the past ... there is a lot more computer trading in the markets today and I think that causes the markets to move on in the short term\nA ways are very quickly and in unexpected ways and I I don't think that's something to worry about if you're a long term investor because over the long run fundamentals went out and good companies\nOr you know we'll be rewarded by the stock market and ultimately\nOr the price of the company's stock will follow the amount of ah earnings that that company generates but over the short term\nI think with the increase in computer driven trading you can get these ah these are strong spasms and the market like we've seen and I think the key is don't overreact because I don't think they're signaling anything to us at all\nRight and and I I've got a feeling that that's the new normal\nIt is uh just going to have to start getting used to that so if you think about the history the markets the the marginal buyer and seller used to be an individual\nThat moved a pension plan right that moved to a mutual fund saying the eighties or nineties then it moved through the hedge funds and now today you know it's these computer traders that are doing the day to day buying and selling it kind of removed from the day to day experience of the individual investor\nAnd I think a lot of those computers even the best and brightest take awhile to digest information whereas computer could process dreams me to in a much shorter period of time and really set that in and out\nAh now it could be wrong that doesn't mean that it's right but I think they're much quicker to react so we're coming up against a break but the um one of the things you mentioned interest rates are one of the potential\nCauses for this and we're not exactly sure why or somebody slams on the brakes but interest rates did\nJump now we're talking a few basis points across the yield curve it wasn't a dramatic jump\nBut we're starting to see bonds not quite be that heads to stocks so you you would think that when stocks go down bonds grow up with that we didn't see that so we need to take a break number here in Studio eight six six I'm thirty nine one ten twenty eight six six three nine months and twenty we'll be right back after this\n[noise] I'm a veteran we hit a line in Vietnam as America's veterans face challenges ... there I think the didn't never given up hope ... helps veterans of every generation to get the benefits\nThey earn I finally admitted that might be asking I wasn't doing well\nSo veterans can reach victories great and small\nNow I Wish I'd found any sooner [noise]\nMy dream act enjoying each day\nSupport more victories for veterans go ta da di di org\nNot a crumbling economy but maybe a a view that growth rates are slowing huh hum it seems like investors are abandoning safety and and chasing growth\n... seems like they're going after those those tech names and a while they they seem to be priced very high except for this week a man but a lot of them had recovered it that seems to be the kind of the the flight to safety almost a flight to to growth but to me that that's pretty risky\nIt's an interesting dynamic so are coming into this year\nA volatility or what I should say volatility has really increased this year versus last year and at the same time the most expensive stocks stocks with the highest PE ratios I've done the best and so there's a little bit of a disconnect there if there is more volatility more worry were unexpected investors to funnel into\nThe riskiest stocks and I think there is some are idiosyncratic reasons for that one would be that investors are really looking for companies that can grow despite any economic concerns and so that's why they've funneled into companies like\nAmazon or like Netflix but then also uh with the trade wars going on a investors were looking for companies that were not impacted by trade and what would that be well a company like Netflix for example or Facebook or that isn't doing a lot of importing and exporting\nHowever I make this comment\nIn terms of the threat of trade wars investors did move towards stocks like Netflix and a Facebook in a way from industrial companies like ... engine or caterpillar but now\nAt a pillar but now that the trade war is a reality\nInvestors are now moving away from the tech sector\nAnd uh companies are are that are in the tech sector because the tech sector tends to be so linked into China and semi conductor computer chip manufacturing and their supply chains and so now I think that whole dynamic has has reversed and actually become a little bit of a head went to the tech sector going forward\nVery interesting All right so we're gonna pick your brain on and that's why we have you here for ah those those wonderful\nDeep insights into the markets complex insights with the Bloomberg really likes to call the second derivative talk of a of the markets\nAre so let's go to our phones are they from Bethel park has been on hold patiently waiting for a while Dave thank you for the phone call David good morning around ...\nMore [noise] earlier in the year I purchased a bank of America regional banks [noise] now even the rates have gone up these two are still underwater mhm any recommendations\nSure I Would stay tight so uh interest rates have risen\nAnd uh in theory that should\nAllow these banks to be more profitable because they can lend at a higher rate of interest and earn more money now the challenge has been\nShort term interest rates have risen faster than long term interest rates and that's squeezes the profit margins for banks because it means they are now paying more on deposits in our checking accounts I'm In a relative to the amount of money that can make on their loans for\nMortgages et cetera now I mentioned earlier the hose dynamic if you listened so the Federal Reserve raising short term rates and that or\nA cascading across the interest rate structure even to long term interest rates and so now that long term interest rates have broken out and are rising more quickly I think that's good news for the banks\nAre I still think they're reasonably valued I think they're benefiting from less regulation and with the economy performing as well as it is I Would say on a twelve month Eighteen month basis that uh you know these banks should continue\nOr or I should say they should perform better going forward\nAnd and then I figure on your research crime there there tends to be alive even even those short term rates have climbed\nUm I don't think a lot of listeners out there when they open up their debt bank statement really have seen their money market rates doubles that\nYou know the the the the short term interest rates have I mean we've seen jumping the treasury rage but I don't think that she had been translated into into bank\nYeah why don't they are dying and so I don't think banks are um\nYou know falling all over themselves to raise those rates on deposits so they you know the Federal Reserve raises interest rates and and I think the ... the banks gradually raise interest rates because they don't want to pay more than they have to exactly would attract deposit and today you know short term interest rates have been so low for so long\nOr that even a modest rise in interest rates are you know suddenly seems like a you know you're you're you're making a lot more money it's like the old country songs said uh been\nDown so long looks up to me [laughter] and uh so you know banks you know art in a hurry to raise the rate on deposits because people are funneling into a a checking account savings accounts um as it is\nSo be patient they have a we think that with a banking stocks of better times are ahead Brian we've all you mentioned this in your opening and then you know what let's let's take a break or we've got a a dollar bank instant access ... a question\nAnd in that I think it's a very well with something that you mentioned in the opening we'll get to that on the other side of the break your number here in Studio eight six six to three nine
