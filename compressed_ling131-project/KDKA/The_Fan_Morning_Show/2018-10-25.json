season\nWell actually I'm going to answer it for your first so talked hope for the first [noise] believe it or not the holiday shopping season starts October the first for online shopping and already but these are out there\nAnd you can imagine with the explosion of online shopping that means deliveries and that means job security for court everybody medication specialist Jackie fight at UPS on our disc Institute of Pittsburgh News I'm Jackie good morning\nGet morning Larry and John\nSo how many packages will UPS deliver this year\nI Will be delivering about eight hundred million packages this holiday season\nThat isn't in and I was only I'm not kidding I mean this online shopping boom has boom you're industry and a UPS has never been busier right\nThat is correct\nYeah and a lot of ah the packages you deliver if I'm correct doesn't Amazon ship just a lot of stuff through you as well\nAnd it's on at one of our customers yeah\nYeah I thought so well on the beginning of this week I was out of Adam's township where someone was following a delivery driver now the police are trying to investigate this at this point they're not sure who they were following they don't know whether it was a UPS truck and Amazon truck the postal service who they were following\nBut they were picking off a Amazon boxes off the front porches\nAnd going through the boxes and if they didn't like the context they would a rip off the mailing label and throw the box out the window which is how the police got into this because they found all these boxes laying in the road out in the Adams township prompting\nThe call to you and to the other services as far as how do you protect it so let's start with UPS and and your choice program exactly what options do I have to get a package put in a safe place\nYet so if customers have concerns about their job everything you have options and one of those in the UPS my choice service and they can sign up for this for free at UPS dot com\nAnd they'll get a text message or an email ... for their package and scheduled to arrive to the customer's going to know when the packages delivered and then you'd be at my choice members can use this service to help them decide how and when they're packages are delivered\nThat is really a something that people should consider because the proliferation again of of so many of these packages with the good comes some of the bad uh I also thought that there's the the new technology that people have the cameras at the door bills\nRight where they monitor where at least yeah that you get notified on your phone if someone comes to your door so for UPS driver was delivering a package you know a exactly when it was delivered and then any unscrupulous person might know they see a camera\nMight think twice about trying to take it\nAnd that's also have the option if they're not going to be home they can have the package shipped to where they are rather than where they aren't so maybe they have it shipped to where they work or they could also choose to have things to revert to a relative our neighbor who is home during the day\nCan you do things like say voted beside the garbage can next to the house or can you be that specific or how silly\nYet we can talk to our driver and kill them where you'd like your UPS package left and like you said for example in the shed in the back\nHow early yet you can talk to our driver and tell them where you'd like your UPS package left and like you said for example in the shed in the backyard or behind the garage and then our drivers can enter that information into their hand held computers for future deliveries\nAnd your drivers are trained to watch where people following them right\nYeah our drivers are trained uh when they are higher and they're also trying to make sure that they leave those packages out of sight and protected from the climate whether\nWe're talking to Jackie by with UPS while we're on the subject of higher your drivers you need more people because you're getting ready for the busiest season of the year\nSo we are getting ready ready for that busy season and and the greater Pittsburgh area we're going to be hiring around twelve hundred seasonal employees um so we've already started hiring process and we will continue that uh throughout the next several weeks\nI Know at one point you needed eight hundred just a newsstand that the package distribution center where are you there I mean how many more unique down there\nHow we are continuing to higher here I Apologize I don't have a specific number on where we are but a hundred whether the goal that we were looking for this year in our new stamp facility to get us through this holiday season\nHow much can John make part time while the\nStarting wage ranges between ten dollars and thirty five cents an Eighteen dollars and Seventy five cents\nAnd what kind of jobs are we talking about\nSo we're looking for a package handlers and those are the folks that work in our distribution sites sorting and and loading the packages drivers and our driver helpers and the driver helper to the ones that will go out on route with a driver and help him or her deliver their packages\nBecome Christmas the job's over\nThese some of these seasonal jobs actually sent in January because we see a continuation in volume because of the return a after the holidays as well as folks I get a gift cards for the holidays and they buy online as well\nOr if I like it and I want to stick around as a fulltime employee\nWell I Will tell you a thirty five percent of the people that are hired for seasonal package handler jobs were later hired into a permanent position when the holidays are over so about one third of our companies us workforce or whether the seasonal employee at one point\nI think this is really encouraging for John So if you want to fill out an application or get more information about security I'm going to guess UPS\nUPS jobs dot com and they're they can find out which physicians are available in their area and they can fill out the application\nAnd I can even scheduling interview yeah and we should mention of course it and Jackie excuse me for talking about the competition for a second but Smith ex delivery manager is out there a USB us informed delivery and Amazon has their lockers and ways you can secure your packages as well and delivery

a husband wife for the husband just walked out and says I don't want any test I don't want to know and he walked out of the ...\nAnd his wife stood there and looked at me and said I Want to test so

so\nThe dog's appear to be very sweet always wagging his tail but we guess has never been to house train the door to the dog house does not have a flap over it we're concerned as it gets colder well it's twenty eight degrees right now\nWould would you speak up in other words asking you would you say something if we had a neighbor\nI Know how hard that situation is because it's usually the neighborhood that is that\nThe new every neighborhood has one of those neighbors and tennis shoes a neighbor that's very difficult to approach and that yes I I Would speak up to answer that question however that's not appropriate for everybody to speak up my mother used to be one of the people that spoke up so I'm following it her first steps but\nThey do because a dog or the dog house doesn't have a flap on it that is what concerns me I mean some dogs like flap some dogs hate a flap right important thing is the placement of that dog house off the ground you know as insulated you can put ... bills a straw around it is it waterproof\nAnd that can they stay warm a lot of these dog houses have little partition wall in them where they can go in and go around it laid out\nAround it is it

would block the wind in the draft that um you're worried about that dog flap so I'm not sure that the flap loners what bothers me\nBut I don't think it's wild asked I I don't think it's far less but I knew dogs that would share that slapped down his shows a owners reported after ... wherever spinal whatever they put up it was a toy\nAnd so they didn't want that flap down and some people can I can put a window in the house we laugh at me but they put a because one of my neighbors to this one was a kid they put a window in the doghouse then the dog flap below the dog just like saying\nOkay our own up so it was kind of comical but um so I Would say something I Know that's a very difficult situation I don't want anybody to put themselves in that and if I'm curious situation because sometimes that can get vote\nNo tell me what to do yeah mind your own dog my dog pound you know it's\nLike they they they are responsible for humanity and so I mean you mean keeping our pets and it's getting

Democrat from Pennsylvania is fourteen congressional district Mike Doyle congressman good morning\nTheir morning guys you know as an analyst on CBS this morning said whoever is doing this is probably\nEnjoying the fact that they have New York and DC on edge [noise]\nWell I mean who's ever behind it or you know whether it's one person or for several they're sick people um I don't think uh\nI and I think you know every every package they send us an additional piece of evidence a and I think you know the hope by every one is that it leads to a discovering who's behind this and and that that\nPerson or persons are are brought to justice and spend a a long long time in jail\nYeah I think one of the reports this morning or was quoting Justice Department investigators is saying whoever did this was pretty sloppy that they are getting a lot of evidence off of these envelopes and things that they have confiscated\nA good forensic evidence that will lead them toward suspects and let's just hope that soon but last night in Wisconsin\nThe president addressed the growing anger and the bombs in the concerns in this country in several different ways to take a listen\nThe media also has a responsibility to set a civil to stop the endless hostility and constant\nNegative and oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do that language of moral condemnation and destructive routine\nThese are arguments and disagreements that have to stop no one should carelessly\nCompare political opponents to historical villain those engaged in the political arena must stop treating political opponents as being morally defective\nYour reaction congressman Doyle\nWell this is a president who personalize has everything I'm big because he has this\nNarcissistic tendency and and that he sees everything through the lens of how it affects them personally um but I I think look I I think everybody needs to step back\nAnd say that that you know that hateful rhetoric\nWherever it comes from on on both sides uh needs to stop people need to to think a little bit before they say things\nUh the the temperature in our politics today has gotten way too high a I Know I don't like that\nUh but I think all of us are Democrats Republicans independents from the president on down to every elected official in the country\nOr just just needs to step back and and and say to themselves or you know is there a better way to say things or we we all need to to contribute to the cooling down or of our politics because I I I just think it's gotten to a point where um\nYou know with it leads to incidents like this where somebody out there who's mentally disturbed\nOr you know here's these things differently or and then people act out on them and and uh so both sides you know all of us have a responsibility\nYou know here's these things differently or and then people act out on them and and uh\nSo both sides you know all of us have a responsibility of those of us in public life or people in the media uh every one I just think has a responsibility to to to just reassess their own self look in the mirror and start with yourself and and see what you can do to contribute to\nA helping to bring this country back together instead of further dividing it\nSo you think at this point both sides are equally culpable\n[noise] well I I don't want to I wouldn't want to put the equivalent to what I think everybody can can determine you know where they they think that behavior needs to stop and and certainly a a the president of the United states has the biggest megaphone in the country\nAre so he could do a lot if if he wanted to\nUh to to cool down the temperature of of the political rhetoric you know a lot of a lot of what you see in the media ends up being responses to what he tweets at yes especially if the tweet has no basis in reality\nA or a fact and I just think that you know the the biggest megaphone in the country is it in the White House so it starts with him but it it but we're all responsible\nUm you know I don't want to say it's an it's an equal thing I just think all of us individually or have a responsibility to reassess our behavior\nUh and and try not to contribute to that type of rhetoric that leads to this kind of division\nWe have uh just about ten days till the mid terms and I think everybody's focused on that in politics and then after that what's the most pressing issue that you face right now as we get ready for the last couple of months of the year\n... I think a lot of the terms it's going to be determined by the outcome of the election a Congress goes by the concession on November fourteen we still have seven appropriations bills that need to be passed and\nThe farm bill needs to be reauthorized a those are probably the biggest things are in front of Congress are and depending on a you know whether the Republicans hold control the house of representatives or Democrats take over the house of representatives I I think will determine what that session looks like\nSo it's the if the Republicans considering maintain that control they move ahead with what they're trying to do if\nThe Democrats are going to get control in January and then we're probably going to be seeing a stalemate until the calendar turns\nYeah or you're going to see the house Republicans tried to pass a every piece of legislation that they want to get out of\nThe house a before January before the before the session expires or not whether or not they can get any of that through the Senate is another question uh\nBut I think you know the the schedule and the pace of the schedule is going to be determined by whether or not they keep control of the house of representatives so uh you know I don't have a crystal ball on my hands I like where we are right now but it's up to the people and uh on November sixth I think that'll go a long way to determining what we are going to do in the lame duck\nUnited States Congressman Mike Doyle we appreciate your time this morning congressman thank you and stay safe have a good day guys\nForty five radio traffic hours by bouncer Nissan relatively one south\nOn top of the hill sunshine greets you this morning just rolled out of bed and now Gabby murdering grades you\nDrive around for infants they're counting on the east side of entertain them any less Martin County we have an accident approaching left and right around mile marker fancy in east bound lanes are currently blocked off for you and my point is Johnny and downsides ...\nWe have an accident approaching left and right around mile marker fifty in the east bound lanes are currently blocked off for you if I quite eased on the downside backing just about to welcome to spring now in your parkway north heavy fund the camp on an on ramp to Bellevue su doing pretty well and you had down through the street valley and all that traffic in front of the veterans branch has cleared out\nBarclay was for the top ... hill twenty eight so pretty busy right around the edge to bypass crippling traffic on the rocky my day for our next report it eight fifty five and the Presbyterian senior care network traffic center\nI'm Cathy Parker news radio ten twenty Katie KIA sunshine\nToday with a high of fifty and right now we're twenty nine degrees and overnight will go back to only thirty seven so it'll be warmer\nIf you don't dispose of the unused ... prescription drugs in your home they might from the new one they get into this place stolen was willing to do whatever they can do the the dealer keep them clean them out in ... at the U.S drug Enforcement Administration wants to know prescription drug tests on\nSaturday October twenty seven and ten am to ... to find a collection from the ... that term that I take one term\nForty seven naked gay radio ... says there is Jim come right thank you guys morning every one of the penguins are Calgary\nTonight I saw him and happy it's any Crosby finally scored a couple of goals last game and Sally equally plays a pack recording quiz was also finally rewarded with two goals\nHe brings a level of simplicity as a straight ahead guy goes to the valley area's wall you know there might not be a better guy on the front of her\nFace off just after nine o'clock tonight AT and T. sports has it suicide against Cleveland Sunday had won the bronze often so it's going to look different and figure maybe better now than in week one with rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield running the show but Shawn Davis says hey the sewers defense is better to\nHope they are they weren't ...
