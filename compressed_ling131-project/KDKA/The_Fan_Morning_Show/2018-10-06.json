you know just a little anecdotal on the injury part of it my father also after thirty five years my father was able to designate his pension because my mother pass first um to his children\nOf knowing that if he had done that and he lived he would have not been able entitled to his pension after thirty five years and I want to tell the story a little bit if I may Joe I'm so he did that on his deathbed in the hospital um and he died about ten days later\nAnd the\nGas company refused to honor that designation\nSaying that it was not effective because he was not alive the first day of the

scholarship fund\nOr for the boys club where I grew up and we've had that for almost Thirty years based on my father's pension money having said that will be less about me I Want to turn it over now who want to talk about the beginning how a case starts the workers' comp\nAnd what have we have Jerry Lee hockey or we have de stern we have Tom cheered on oh a these are upon the hockey eastern cheered on and we have the whole crew coming out in the beginning of the three part segment that hopefully will be able to have three parts we may finish it earlier we may get it that we have we might not\nWe've got ... hockey participating by phone you heard that clip by ... jury\nDo you mentioned about starting from the beginning\nSure helps him when I when I pitched the idea to you on my my thought process was\nThe ... the rank and file those that aren't attorneys knowing what to do because like you said so many people were afraid when they get injured the fear factor is unprecedented because of the scuttlebutt and and and the misnomer and all those things I mean from the point of injury ... what do you do from the point of injury what\nHappens in the first Ninety Days the need for an attorney and why\nThe shenanigans that that you along with the panel doctors and the insurance company providers wire sixty Seventy five percent of all injured workers to not to discriminate their benefits before they actually\nA recover from her injury so let's start right there because you just threw out a lot there's a lot there just in those opening for state I'm suicide and let's start to get in touch on on the panel dollars I mean\nI wouldn't have Jerry in and day stern chime in and start with Jerry if I may Jerry Seinfeld is about the you know the Joe's point is well taken point of injury what happened someone gets in order to orange or on the job what happens next and what should they do next\nThe most important thing in injured worker can do\nIs report the injury that starts the entire process rolling and if you don't report your injury you're going to be found that you have an injury\nSo it's extremely important that the injured workers do to their boss go to their supervisor and say hey I just did something I was lifting something and I found a pain in my back\nFor a something fell on me or I was in a car accident delivering something and I I may or may not be injured I don't know for sure yet but I I wanted to record it\nBecause I Want to start this process I'm going to fill my obligation under the act to let my employer know that I've been hurt so that they can then start their process Jerry require miss their obligations started ...\nJob let's give it a list there specifics in regard to the law I get into today I told her second\nI hurt my back I Walk out of the of the factory I Walk off the job site I forgot to give my my former in a notice of it or maybe I've had pain from lifting is at noon and I just finished the day went home how many days by law do I have to report an injury\nSam under the Pennsylvania workers' compensation act injured worker as one hundred and twenty days from the date of the injury to report it to their employer and that's a long time\nAnd we've learned doing this for thirty some years that the longer you wait to give your employer notice more apt you're going to be to have your claim denied\nSo even though you have a hundred and twenty days we always advise our clients report the injury right away if it's if your boss isn't there at the end of your ship or something\nIf they end up your shift or something reported immediately the next morning or soon as you can possibly reported a you know now technology is the way it is you can send a text to your supervisor says she have their numbers you can send an email to your age are department when you get home let him know what happened\nThat's the most important thing because then the employer has an obligation to start investigating if they have an insurance company to have to report it to the insurance company\nSo we can't stress enough to even though you have a lot of time we don't want you to take that\nTime the meat or let let me know if I may let me have Dave I'm sure\nAnd if I can even make it a little more nuanced Sam um [noise]\nIf you want benefits as of the day you got hurt you actually have to report the injury within Twenty one days\nSo if you want benefits laws waste benefits from day one you have to report your injury within Twenty one days now if it goes beyond Twenty one days you can still timely report your injury or all the way up to one hundred and twenty days is Jerry you know correctly dated\nBut once you get past that twenty first day\nYou're entitlement to benefits starts as of the day you gave notice so\nI Would even stress greater urgency than the one hundred and twenty days and say as Jerry said do it immediately but absolutely within Twenty one\nDays off one of the things that as a worker\nAnd and this is one of the things I Want people to quit from that standpoint as a worker how many people are trying to take it for the team and say you are you know I don't want to start trouble\nOr one of the reasons when when Jerry ... and and David says you know within the twenty first as I as a as a worker having an injured workers program and have a say in union workers get\nGo through all kinds of stuff if you don't mention it the first day I Can't tell you how many from my experience how many employers workers ... say you could it could happen to you went home and what\nHappened then is is Jerry mentioned if you get into trouble because then it becomes a credibility issue and they say well why didn't report it you must have been playing\nBall on the weekend or you must have did something at home and you're you know working on your car or whatever it's it becomes more problematic alleged to have a little summer here starting on notice as Dave said you've got Twenty one days to report the injury\nIf you want your benefits to begin as up to date you report it okay\nAll right so if it's October second you've got to October twenty third if you go beyond that Twenty one days\nYou can still legally gave notice what if you give it after that period of time let's say the sixtieth day your benefits will begin running for this from the sixties day you'll lose the first sixty days of workers' compensation benefits\nIf you don't report it within a hundred and twenty days jury you report the hundred and twenty fifth day what happens\nIf you don't have a claim Sam okay you're far temple you're done you you're you're ... under the act so as tape correctly points out ... and you stress as sort of why don't we do not wait\nFor the whole number of reasons that we've just discuss so immediately reported point of injury a media reporter we've got the law they are now\nI reported today October second I'm On a job site hurt my back lifting heavy generator or my back goes out I report it to my boss my immediate supervisor\nHow many days and we're going to get into the medical care at such what how many days they've does the insurance company I have to make a decision about my case once I give notice\nIt you you can have a a medical condition that has any calls whatsoever it could be something you've done at work so if you've done it at home a disease you've you just happen\nFound that you can get Social Security disability for medical conditions no matter the cause does not have to be work related but you know going back to work related injuries I think\nWhere you where you Jerry Dave and and I know self serving here Joan I Apologize state yourself support from everyone else is that you consider Social Security for disability for each and every one of your clients\nTo let me ... that's a great segue to my question that they have someone that the client does go get the ... and right after having injuries to come in and feed a stern when they come in to see you Dave are you looking at\nYou know I'm assuming you're not we don't look at them in a vacuum we look at them holistically in regard to what other benefits that they were on a job so I Do they have\nOther legal matters that they could pursue workers competed pension long term disability there's employment case do you what do you do in regard to looking at all these other other legal\nFor sure yeah I I tell all clients that I'm thinking about their tomorrow's and I'll take the backing off I'm Tom ... segue there I I absolutely look at a Social Security disability or for clients uh for for him\nUh for for a handful of reasons number one\nUh didn't almost every circumstance or you can receive Social Security disability benefits in addition to your workers' compensation for some people have some economic losses which is hard to get into in this\nFormat but has some economic losses when they're out of work receiving workers' comp\nAnd they can get Social Security disability on top of their workers' comp and that makes up for their losses of the other thing is once you're on Social Security disability for two years you're then eligible for the medical program which are as you indicated in the introduction it's called Medicare uh so it'll be a medical benefit\nFor workers that are not working and don't have perhaps healthcare benefits anymore or to be able to take care of medical conditions whether it's their work injury or anything and then finally looking at the picture holistically\nThere's going to come a day where the workers' compensation is going to end maybe in a settlement whatever the case may be\nIt's really comforting for the injured worker to know that when that workers comp benefit is over there's going to be an income from Social Security disability that they're going to fall right into let's go let's talk about someone on\nA ... I gave it as they are an\nExample of someone being hit by a forklift let's say some things we had a teamster that goes and makes a delivery with his truck\nTo a a slight warehouse and pulling off a powder for truck ... from another company hits him and fractures his leg\nDoes he have any recourse does he have another case besides you had to work injury entering the job hit by a forklift all going to be looking into Social Security eventually depending on age et cetera does he have another legal matter\nWe absolutely and and that that is what we refer to as a third party case a when you're injured at work\nAnd your injuries the fault of someone other than the employer\nOr than you will have a legal cause of action for negligence against that third party and in those cases or you can receive benefits are such as punitive damages what you asked me about before a pain and suffering things that aren't available in the workers' comp system\nNow we start developing the whole team and looking at the other benefits and as a column about we start getting a benefit analysis and now we have ... on his team and Social Security disability ... we're going to have a third party attorney in their team\nWorking with days workers' compensation team I'm of developing the workers' compensation case\nSo let's just let's just step back and I want to just kind of get people in understanding at the beginning of this journey after having to work injury very very important\nIn exchange for giving up your right to sue ... in a therapy or employer for damages if they were negligent you get worker's comp foot part of that deal Joe part of that deal this bargain this grand bargain up giving up a constitutional right\nWas that injured workers work to get the liberal construction of the law in their favor\nBorderline interpretations horse to go in the injured workers favor\nThe humanitarian purpose of the act in other words the overriding theme is that the act as a humanitarian purposes to help injured workers and their doctor the injured workers doctors testimony or report should be given greater weight\nThen the employers one time doctor's visit these basic tenets as we called the basic foundation pieces have to be understood by the injured worker and giving them the confidence to pursue their case we hope you're enjoying the conversation on legal egos radio\nSam pond every Saturday morning right here on Katie KIA\nResults made very not a solicitation for legal services if you owe the IRS back taxes payroll taxes for them not filed your returns the IRS will get you they can take your property take you to court even put you in jail with one call to wall you'll never need to talk to the IRS again our average\nClients settles for about ten percent of what his old we offer free face to face consultations in your local area call eight hundred Seventy seven zero for three three that's eight hundred Seventy seven zero for three three\n...

I I mean OK okay go ahead yes what\nWere the other question is can should go from a PPO plan to regular Medicare medic ...\nYes she can um you know it gets a little bit more confusing with many gaps now I just said that there's no matter you know there's no underwriting everyone's accepted when you go from one PPO to an HMO or vice versa or from advantage plan to advantage plan now when you want to go from the mayor's plan to Medicare supplement\nThose supplement companies do underwrite in other words they're going to ask a series of medical questions um you know to determine your eligibility in cost\nOh can't can answer those medical questions and and her age I Would put her with\nA. R. P. probably and they don't ask very many questions\nSo there's a good chance she could get and she could get a supplement for close to the same price as she's paying now which would cover all her medical bills so I'm absolutely\nOne thing she doesn't want to do is keep overpaying so she's going to want to switch regardless from either the plan to she's on to a lower priced advantage plan or to supplement and those are the two options that she ... you know I Would recommend that she that she look into a\nA to Z a errands oh brothers here coming up or just a couple of minutes we're going to break at the bottom of the hour gets ready for some CBS Radio news then we'll come back with a whole half hour and\nWe're just gonna keep taking phone calls as much as we can this hour to try to calm the nerves of a lot of folks were wondering what their step will become open and Roman time October the fifteenth here's a let's go to Claire for seals clear how you doing I'm Wondering what can they can get radio\nCan we can get radio morning I'm On a one dollar a month advantage plan and I'm thinking about going with a supplement then Medicare yup and I don't know what the lowest I could pay for good ... well\nAt sixty five year old the lowest price you're gonna pay in our area would be eighty five dollars if you were sixty five year old female and you were married and had somebody else who's taken a supplement if you're not married the lowest price is about I think Ninety One dollars the ... the ... the older than you are then sixty five to ... the price here they get so you can add to that\nOkay well that's right and so as I say at thirty bucks to what it's about three dollars for every year that you're over sixty five the kind of the rule is that three bucks you'd be looking at about a hundred and twenty dollars for a supplement\nYou're going to also have to add a generally have to add prescription drug coverage which starts at Fifteen dollars she'd probably be looking at about a hundred and thirty five dollars which is only fifty fifty fifty four more dollars and you're paying now and that may sound like a lot but what's your eliminating\nIs you're eliminating the three thousand four hundred dollars that you could be building a year's time\nSo with a supplement you're basically not going to pay for once you meet a very very small the doctor bowl of a hundred and eighty three dollars you're not going to pay for a blood test an X ray a CAT scan an MRI hospitalization a surgical procedure chemotherapy radiation skilled nursing you won't pay for any of that so we're all of those things\nGo to a Cleveland Clinic if I go to add to supplement their he asked what opened up a ... laments can\nGo you can go to any doctor hospital the entire country okay any doctor hospital in the entire country\nYou can go and I will tell you though although next year your plan they did strike a deal with um with Cleveland Clinic that you that will they will be a network for Medicare Advantage plan holders a couple of companies and you have yours is one of them okay but that doesn't mean I wouldn't tell you to consider consider a supplement okay\nYou you need to get educated on that so don't think because you can go there you know everybody should have that option and look at that supplemental auction\nOkay everybody should and if we have time we're going to I'm going to tell you a little bit more what why and if you read my newspaper column and the post ...

P. M.
