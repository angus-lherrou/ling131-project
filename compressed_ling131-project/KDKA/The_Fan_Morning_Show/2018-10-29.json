ledger\nWith a volunteer chaplain at one of the U. P. M. C. hospitals\nPray for those who are recuperating and in particular Dan ledger\nWith a volunteer chaplain at one of the U. P. M. C. hospitals when my husband was in ICU for one month then came many days and prayed with us he brought Sabbath candles to last a light on the Sabbath\nHe was so kind and here we are praying for him yeah I mean life just goes around and cycles they say and a good day to go on punished I I don't know but we just have to pray now harder for those that they recover and we don't have any more\nAdded to the eleven who already perished and that I wanted to put his name out there to pray for his recovery he's very critical right now\nAnd and it's important don't care for listening yes it's ... it's important\nThat we joined together in that regard and I'm so grateful for you and Diane you bring up an excellent point we need to\nTalk about these people if you know the injured if you know these

about Pittsburgh obviously the Steelers are a big part of our identity it's who we are now this gentleman wasn't trying to capitalize on that but the star of David fitting in there it speaks to and universally connects\nPittsburgh and I think that was it and he was also then connecting people of all faiths I that's my point of view so I'm Sorry that you see it as something other than um [noise] something that was benevolent and I believe that his intentions of course we're not benevolent\nI think that's what his intentions may offend but I just think that it's it's [noise] it just feels
