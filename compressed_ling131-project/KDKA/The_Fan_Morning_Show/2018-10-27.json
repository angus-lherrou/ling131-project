P. H. D. and in Pittsburgh on your home town radio station ... this is legal eagles radio with Sam ... is a middle election special\nIs very influential special guest who are going to provide some clarity as we go into the mid term elections while fighting some vowing salmon the words common sense and I come to you and say hello to you and welcome\nProtect your last we were\nUm a week out a little bit more than a week out and we're going to have her second segments next week in regard to the election uh we have an all star cats to talk to us about\nThe mid term elections not only in the state level but in the federal level we can also talk local politics they show is about as we'll remind our listeners and we were starting to get more and more listener so you know what it's about the new listeners need to know that this is about educating yourself through this platform of without the legal rights which\nTo educate our listeners exactly what gerrymandering is redistricting and what's been the consequences are now in the federal landscape center\n... jumping and thanks Sam for for having me with with these are\nTwo very powerful and important public figures for for many many years\nYou know we ... the Supreme Court I started with the back of the conversation for Supreme Court here in Pennsylvania oldest Supreme Court I'm In the country on the nation's first Supreme Court said that way um made a decision or in or out of the the midpoint of this year I Believe it was in may June that timeframe if I remember correctly\nUm to uh adjusted wrong that was done I'm almost a decade ago and have a congressional districts were drawn in Pennsylvania will be just as a contact Pennsylvania has one million more\nA democratic a registered Democrats than Republicans are but I'm the congressional districts that were drawn ten years ago are resulted in a I guess Thirteen Republican\nCongress people and five Democratic Congress people the districts were drawn in a very partisan fashion\nAnd from a legal standpoint as your as as as you and these two gentlemen are are are attorneys or the whole the whole one person one vote or a rule was violated based on the way those districts withdrawn almost ten years ago so the Pennsylvania Supreme Court um made a decision\nEarlier this year a to redraw the lines to make them fair make them equal or make them in many respects nonpartisan but make them more representative inconsistent with the ...\nUh to redraw the lines to make them fair make them equal or make them in many respects now part of some but make them more representative inconsistent with the one person one vote situation\nSo now Pennsylvania has a very competitive a congressional election cycle that we're going through whereas the election cycle for Congress people beforehand under the old mines was not competitive because the way the lines were drawn and that's when the federal level and that's that's the federal not that's not applying to the to the not to the level that will come sooner and outcomes of John chime\nIn and out what the thing that's interesting is that the people have to realize the inter relationships between who they elect to stay past members in state senators as well as the elected governor and how that affects the congressional races reapportionment is on every ten years and those that control the house and the Senate and of course because again we were trying to educate wise it on every ten years\nConsensus yes that's the ... the center on everything here so they do they do I wish there was consensus [laughter] they do the census every ten years and then they and they base or ... something about reinforcement is that if the Republicans control the legislature and the governor the effectively control\nThe way in which our our congressional races or a portion\nNow you know it's one person one vote but there's also supposed to be a part of the law some sort of commonality of interest so what you see now is Madeleine Dean running in Montgomery County because if you live in Montgomery County you're going to have the same commonality of interest because you live within that county has before Congress and boiled so part of it you had some other people taking part of it\nAnd if you looked at those districts some twenty thousand feet in a plane\nIt's absolutely amazing how they would draw the lines\nTo keep the same amount of people in these tests are but there was no relationship between where at the end of a congressional district was as compared to the other end so now we have districts where there's like ... or a light collected officials and an a commonality of interest that we can then say hey be she's going to represent Montgomery County\nAnd you know had I had a ... year do some research for me about gerrymandering just about everyone understands that\nThat you know we're looking at this term that came about back in Eighteen twelve they started to uh some politician started to pack districts uh and and it and it the definition is diluting the voting power of the posing party supporters across many districts\nAnd packing concentrating the opposing parties voting power in one district to reduce their voting power another district\nGerman or and they also be used to help or hinder a particular demographic\nSuch as a political ethnic racial linguistic religious or class ... we've seen that in North Carolina where they built vi did this on racial lines of nice that the United States Supreme court came out unanimously very rare and said this is clearly racially based it's discriminatory but what we have we have German drinks we basically have\nThe politicians telling us how to vote as opposed to voters having to free will to vote right I mean that's what's happening here so we've now got this genes that if you look at the new congressional map\nBased on what the Supreme Court did and I'm being objective you're bipartisan mhm\nIt's fair it looks normal it makes sense the other thing looked like a list ... it was like any sense desert again you're packing district so that despite having a million less voters you can control the the English as a legislator districts for for those boats both on the federal level in the state of when we sweep\nCured it on the state level wreck what has to happen to to fix it on the federal I owned a federal law what needs to be ... the curator of the state level up\nThe the first thing that has to happen is um I obviously a an ... an extensive and a strong voter turnout on November sex um which uh we we all do better when we're on voting or a group of country has better communities better when more people are engaged in a voting process so strong vote on on on November ... important\nThen as you talked about earlier with the census\nCommunities have better when more people are engaged in a voting process so strong vote on on on November ... important then as you talked about earlier with a sense this Sam a in a twenty twenty and there'll be an effort to uh do a census which is a count of every person in the United states of America every\nPerson in the United states of America or gets counted and then I'm In twenty Twenty one I'm Will go about redrawing the lines at the legislative level now the legislative level in Harrisburg we had a commission\nAnd the commission is represented by for caucuses are represented from each of the four caucuses cannot be ... it has to be a a person that the leaders of each one of the four caucuses in ... Democrats as Republicans and Democrats than Republicans and the fifth person just chosen by as the chair the person's chosen by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\nFor so that that person will make that'll be the commission the commission will review lines that we review districts are and then they'll make a determination uh based on a plan that are submitted to the commission of what the legislative districts look like but it's ... first and foremost on the sense that if we don't have an accurate\nAnd this is extremely extremely important we've had this conversation probably before if we don't have an accurate\nUm aggressive thoughtful count where everybody is pulled in and everybody is counted and everything that follows from there will be essentially corrupt will will not be exact\nAnd that is very problematic because resources are determined based on that\nUm businesses are set up based on a census numbers on the percentage is five on funding for education or for economic development or whatever businesses use the census data\nTo make their decisions about where to locate and what kinds of businesses that everything is ... it's been bought it and it can be very hard to get an accurate count\nOr I'll give you an example in in in twenty ten oh you have President Obama had mayor Nutter here in the city of Philadelphia both individuals who were thoughtfully working hard to get an accurate count\nThe first pass for the city of Philadelphia Mayor Nutter said that doesn't sound right that number doesn't sound right something to be offered that that um so they created an overlap organization that went back into communities and found a hundred and thirty thousand that's where this you know people on\nTop of the first count that was done but that significant was that it was that a negligence who was that some people even touch it is it is what will you had to shut down it gets going on here I just I don't believe that I Believe ... hours for leadership [laughter] well I don't believe there's genetic is because you had to individuals the president President Obama in Marietta who wanted an accurate count they wanted\nEverybody thinks they're okay and thank God they did\nAnd then when there was a question there was an opportunity to\nTry to fix that makes you go out one more time\nAnd go deeper into various neighborhoods and find folks and so they said they did that the problem that we have right now as you're wearing your listeners aware\nComing up than twenty twenty we're sitting in in a presidency a will there's a lot of pushback\nOn on this whole issue of accurate count is that the commission are being funded appropriate level to have enough ... out in neighborhoods alright\nAre they asking the right questions on on on the paper a document that goes out to every American citizens are all of that is out there that's why ... that's why this election is it so important because if you have the right folks in Congress and the right folks at the state level then you can force a system that goes and gets an accurate count\nWell let's get John was talking about the shenanigans let's talk about why not the funding what what's the purpose of not funding an accurate census in light of it's important why would it why would why would a public official not want to have an accurate sense of\nWhy you know if the if the other part is in control of the the state a place like Philadelphia Allegheny county that are predominately Democrat\nBy you know if the if the other parties and control the the state\nOr a place like Philadelphia Allegheny county ... Democrat\nBut still the less of our census a less money we can actually get from the federal government when it comes to education quality of life probably Human Services oldest social programs that we attempt to get through grants and initiatives with this Harrisburg are a base of based upon the percentage of poverty population that we that we need to control and help\nAnd move forward and then if if I if I was Donald Trump would try to break it down to zero so you have you know a very small amount of people that are going around doing interviews\nFish is legal eagles radio which Sam ... is a legal eagles political special when Philadelphians awkward you twelve to end up you PHD and in Pittsburgh when your hometown radio station gay KIA\nHeroin next promises but all it really does is take heroin you take your job your how your family maybe even your like\nSarah when once you can get hooked visit curb the crisis dot com to find a treatment center near you and to curb the crisis dot com I\nRemember thinking mom had ice in the back of her head like or a superpower which spot in trouble before it happened well now it's not enough to protect our home and family and spotting troubles way tougher\nWell I think that the salaries and former controllers go down to the brilliant job I was just sitting here of absolutely are by their intelligence or perception and the way they explained it to people and I remember that [laughter] irrational easy to understand the form and if they did a great job so you might be excused [laughter]\nThey\nThey called me at all I just have to make one correction only because I Know standpoint being one of the greatest lawyers maps ever live in a column of or he is dragging about accuracy within those states splits their electoral college votes\nMight've percentage of ... and the election\nOr two states that divide there are electric college votes by congressional ... Nebraska and Maine so that you can in a main let's say you win the popular vote in the state of Maine but you lose one of the ... congressional districts will your opponent gets model that go vote\nAnd you get to choose that you've when from carrying the state plus the London rational district three to one in Nebraska gets the same extent never ask as a for a for like ... or was that was right so that that's important in that is true actually but Johnson's I doubt suggested\nWould make the electoral college much more fair and representative\nFor example Donald Trump bond as you are or call are hosting the and the two other end I guess well a recall that Donald Trump won Pennsylvania with about forty eight percent of the vote for Clinton got forty seven percent and the to\nA third party candidates split the remaining four and a half percent\nSo it is that as al ... getting it all uh Eighteen of or a\n... electric car shows excuse me it was funny at the time all twenty of our electoral college votes he would have gotten nine and a half Hillary Clinton would have got nine and a two third party candidates would have like a ... half of a truck ... textiles and that's fair because\nHillary Clinton would've gotten almost as many college votes as a [noise]\nTrump received and she wouldn't have lost all twenty votes given the fact that she lost to save [laughter]\nNow that would only work if it were there was a constitutional change required to every state to have that it would have to be in a foreign if every state at that system the electoral college but more closely reflect the popular dogs that are in fact I've done the math on this if that system where in effect\nFor a Clinton would have gotten a plurality of electric cars first\nTwo hundred and fifty six electoral college votes more than ... are certainly more than a third party candidate but not enough time to to seven days if the constitution requires to be elected president so that election would have been sent to the house of representatives and that's nothing anybody would want to see either so it's not so easy to get rid of the electoral college\nVote some people say well why forget about the electoral college just have a popular vote whoever gets the most votes wins [noise] All right let's let's suppose that Hillary Clinton\nInstead of being on top of the popular vote by three million she beat Donald Trump in the popular vote by seven\nLet's let's suppose that Hillary Clinton\nInstead of being on top of the popular vote by three million she'd be Donald Trump in the popular vote by Seventeen thousand votes that would mean you would have a recount in every precinct in America [noise]\nEvery precinct in America would have to have a recount because remember you're counting all the votes to every vote in Maine every vote in Nebraska every vote in New York\nAnd you wouldn't know who the president would be until the following march so it's going to a strict popular vote is not so easy either [noise]\nSo what do you think is a real need for the electoral college now I mean it's I mean there's there's ... there's some history there's some history debt debt debt tags the um the way we see the electoral college right now which comes out of as more folks got engaged in the electoral process is the franchise would extend it to women African Americans and all of that\nThat there was a movement to move towards the electoral college since actually disenfranchised all these new folks coming into the system so opulent vote as I said the biggest problem is going to restrict popular vote as if it's close he's literally have to recount every precinct in America\nAnd that would be horrible fiasco can you imagine in the current vitriolic atmosphere [noise] having a nationwide recap because one candidate got Seventeen thousand votes out of\nSixty eight million more than the other the electric cars also supposed to force candidates nationwide to go to areas that it may not normally have gone to the argument as the argument is that you have to go to a smaller state that has fought electoral college votes or three or whatever\nWhereas if it was just the popular vote you concentrate on the Big Ten or eleven states but the fallacy of that argument sons and there's there's you know today\nWith some states being certain Republican states\nAnd other states being certain Democrat ... had\nAlready no one in which the TV ads on in California or you know all that was set up as they are not going to the opposite right let's say if they actually the state's governor and a lot of money than I guess I'd have to keep the ironic thing that the constitution was set up we didn't have political parties I didn't want political whatever it was sort of small states now no one's going to California who's this guy\n[laughter] too but I'm from\nAlmost got [laughter] we're just trying to do the birds which I Would be different [laughter] nothing the presidential election is conducted by eleven states\nThere the other very United States the Republicans are going to win Texas Democrats are going to York so that when campaigns in those states anyway so that's a fallacy of that that was the original thought of that ... that by giving each state some electoral college drugs would force the presidential candidates campaign in that state we don't see that anymore now\nBut if we had the ... electoral college I have to you and the very least suggested I thought of it in my mind it virtually that's what I think I think the greater injustice\nMaybe maybe having two Senate representatives\nFrom each state and when you look at Wyoming having two Senate senators and California having to you know ... to say that the ... the million or eight hundred thousand people Wyoming are going to have the same voice than to forty million in California but that to me doesn't my yard is problematic because we really are not getting representation\nFor the forty million times or you know less thirty nine million in in in Wyoming\nAnd saying let me give you a graphic example of that which of course senator used in control is I don't know [noise] when rock Obama became president in two thousand nine the Democrats control the Senate and House Democrats had I think a fifty fifty six senators are Republicans at forty four\nBut because of the filibuster rule sickly needs sixty votes so in those days the Republican up against or anybody could have stopped it legislation\nSixty votes so in those days is the Republican up against or anybody could have stopped legislation happening\nIf forty senator forty one senators who represented Seventeen percent of the nation's population where against say that again because I think\nOur listeners need to hear that once again in regard to our constitution is structured and the consequences now because of what we have in a way of population said again\n[noise] they could have stopped any proposals that President Obama put forward it forty one Republican senators voted for it and those forty one representing states accounted for Seventeen percent of the nation's\nPopulation eighty three out of one hundred Americans wanting a certain policy it's going to be stopped by the minority of Seventy percent now do we want we don't want we we were basically driven by majority the majority will the majority of the folks are going to drive all we have him in a way of laws um but\nThis is this is intriguing I first of all I think we need about five hours to call it is to turn into the house races which will govern the house of representatives which are governed by population\nAnd we have a family who are we going to let me say that the farmers that some wisdom and what what they did was because of the areas that sometimes the majority of the population\nCan be driven into a frenzy and and and before somebody in their purse very destructive for example the

in the mail renewal time let's just pretend right you open it up when you start reading it what is the first thing you do\nYou know it was before we went to a commercial break we're looking at things that just perplexed us and summer's gracious enough to take us back to insurance when I Want and I think that the key is when you put those things out there that's not that back into reality for you because\nThe assumption is always and I think you understand that were covered no matter what ... what goes down were covered 'cause we had a policy right so when it's the definitions of your policy and what you're covered as where we get stuck\nAnd I've gone through since working with summer I've gone through I've spent time I look at it policies I look at the little lines in there that mean absolutely no sense but I Know they mean something to you\nThey mean something to the attorney who wrote the most is who they mean something\nYou can define it ... it's just not in our DNA to to assume that we understand all those pieces [noise]\nThis this simplistic things are when you're opening up um and looking at a policy and I get we ensuring that person for their own needs but some of the terminology it really gets you ... you sent me over some show notes and I'm looking at just the auto ... let's just the auto\n... what do you look at okay well the ... I I think we can handle\nAlthough let's let's talk about the duct cells is that some things that um\nYou're it's going to be money out of somebody's pocket right so basically for automakers to Dr ... there's one called coalition and that's pretty self explanatory right you hit another car you hit property another person\nYou cause damage the others comprehensive damage the comprehensive you've asked all your car catches on fire a tree falls audit you run into a dear\nYou break a windshield driving down the parkway somebody vandalized says your car why not half of the duck pool for that the euro that your trunk company pays a hundred percent of it that's that's what I Do for my clients I don't think many other people do that for their clients\nWell there's I'm Glad you stop me on it that's that great point you know God Forbid if you're in an accident and the cars total or this or that and you think okay what's that going to pay me everything I can get me into a new vehicle okay so I started looking at you nuts\nLet's just talk about that so yesterday I had a customer\nIn ... she was in car when she hit hard to\nHard to hit cars three three and four and four was the boss um [noise] so now she thought only responsible for the injuries for any of these people but she she's possible for the property damage for all these people\nMost people do not have enough property damage on the auto insurance it oh ... what do I D property damage or well there's an incident where would you hit somebody else it's their property mhm and\nThey could this woman had three hundred thousand dollars worth of property coverage a because between the bus\nA BMW [laughter]\n[laughter] the super route [laughter] yeah yeah ...\nUh because between the bus a BMW [laughter] [laughter] the super route [laughter] yeah yeah a a ... day she needed it yet but she was texting yeah and I didn't see traffic stops in front of her a clearly a hundred percent of the fall\nFor going to have that on a show and that's a whole nother peace and I would have we're going to somebody from the last sit down and talk with us know where your show we're going to get into all that with the texting and driving a call so we're ... we're going to get to that let me go back to this topic though what is a new car guarantee replacement\n... again or something popular on TV they guarantee if you buy this coverage this new car guaranteed coverage will pay\nLawsuit appreciate it cost but the cost of a new car so basically when you drive the car your car off the dealers lot\nThe day the moment you hit the pavement is has gone down in value it's it's appreciate it so maybe it was a twenty thousand dollar car\nIt leaves the parking lot now maybe it's worth Nineteen thousand 'cause it's now a used car\nYeah you drive ten miles and you have an accent you total the car\nSo the advertisements and we'll we'll pay you twenty thousand dollars lots of Nineteen thousand dollars if you bought new car replacement there's always some if right it's not included in anybody's base a policy but you can step up to\nA better policy and get new car replacement and normally I mean every ... different normally the car Dietz less than a year old for them to offer that coverage gee\nHey are you know that's what you do ... and I know I take this line from Rob you do what you do really well and that's why you've got that title and you're looking at yourself you're saying you're Pittsburgh insurance specialist because you do\nYou're looking at your taking our our most prized possessions I mean things that we need cars auto possessions in the inside life\nIt's all you and you do it really really well and I want to tell everybody\nSummer honest honestly I Am amazed this man goes north south east west called his office he answered the answers the phone not Everytime I'm a staff there but you do you get on the phone you're willing to talk to people he'll answer the question if you can't doesn't know where he's back actually he's given a T if he\nDoes what he does he doesn't really well with that being said you can reach him at his office in green tree it for one to four eight nine six four four three\nYour website fabulous he keeps things up to date he's there whenever you know we're talking about the weather situation this that and the other take ... take a second get to know summer visited site\nOpen our insurance agency dot com that's oh B.

live and that's where we were saying you know put some thought on your house look in a few houses take your time worried about price range all of this stuff she can do that's why she's the Pittsburgh property diva um you're saying three to four areas you should pick the living\nJust because you see a place you like the community or you're from no you grew up there the school district is good at least exhale breathe a little bit and what you were real to take you to some other places and pick\nThree or four that you wouldn't want to live in and then you sit down and digest all\nOf the information and make a I think much more qualified decision\nRight I I I couldn't agree more and I think to a lot of people will say to me I Want to live in one particular area that way inventory of you out and you need to live now\nAre there some other areas you will consider that have just as good a school district and maybe the taxes are a lot of that law where or is it a better commute for you\nAll of those things when I'm Talking like the client are important to me because I don't want you moving at your house and six months later yeah say\nOh I don't like this at all it takes too long to get to work\nOn my kids don't like the elementary school you know all of those things are important to me and it should be important to my clients to pets really think about\nUm so I I gather as much information as I can any any guide and best way I can\nWell all I can say is if I Would have said to my parents I don't really like the school district you know my dad would away excuse out or you are you in this conversation that I did I ask your opinion you know he I mean listen\nThere's so much joy that should come from this and let me just stress this too and I'm going to give you a chance to talk to your expertise\nIf you're a young couple and and you know you're putting thirty forty fifty thousand dollars into a wedding God Bless you didn't even have that kind of resources but you know the old adage some wise man or woman would always say nurturing parents look I'd rather just give you the money for a down payment on a home now this is my thought\nProcess take the money and get a home or I mean that's I I mean I I I agree\nThat there's no there are no there's no shortage of big beautiful fabulous wedding so\nI mean basically you can go celebrate somebody else's or wherever everybody over and and and share you know in in your house and get a house warming gifts and\nKind of take care of everyone was just the ability to say hey we welcome you to our home it's still the greatest opportunity and privilege in this country\nTo be a homeowner and I don't know about you but I've been a homeowner and there is nothing more satisfying when you say goodbye to that real or the paperwork is done and you simply lock the door behind that person and call it a day and when you're in that house for the first night\nAnd you've got your you know your fingers are basically clinched together behind the back of your head and you're looking up at the ceiling and the whole house is quiet and things are settling down for the day and you realize that you are now the owner of this place that you call home\nOf your head and you're looking up at the ceiling and the whole house is quiet and things are settling down for the day\nAnd you realize that you are now the owner of this place that you call home and all of that stuff is going to happen in the journey that lies ahead I don't think there is a better feeling other than the birth of your children in my opinion in the world I mean being a homeowner has got to be one of the most rewarding feelings anywhere\nIt it it is a very very very exciting and I like to take the nervous laugh out of\nBuying a house I Want you to be excited but there are a lot of steps that go on you know from from the beginning to the closing get those keys and you walk your door for the first time all by yourself and\nAh there's a lot of stuff that goes on metal so my job and they thought as easy as I possibly can trap\nYeah we're going to talk about what to expect to happen after you write a contract and what is required to closing time but there is a lot but remember I said there's a few months back and I'm going to say it again because I admire your expertise and there was no more of a nervous Nellie than when I was going to become a homeowner for the first time\nAnd and it's so true you want you and for no other reason other than this big responsibility but you're spending money for rent or or a mortgage and it's better to say well I've been here ten years in that money that has been on that mortgage is my money and it goes towards the value of the home so what people don't understand that moment even if it takes months to get the deal done\nIt it it it feels like an eternity but it won't feel that way once you're in your home you will turn around and you will say to your significant other hey we've lived here for five years already you know we've been here for ten years already so I Am\nWe have actually yes exactly and if you want to help you can do that where you want to just get to the finish line with that property you can do that you want to remodel you want to add because every time you put money back into your home it basically goes into your pocket if you're ever thinking about selling it so no matter what you do with owning a home it's a win win\nIt is as long as you take care of it that's what I tell people you take care of it and you will get a return on investment that you have to take care of it you have to take care of it like a baby\nIsn't it amazing that what you learn in it it must be just ... you don't even realize it but it's stored in your brain you know your father all of those years\nYou get the filters checked in the furnace this time of year you check the roof this time of year you make sure that the the property line you do this you check your ... your electricity you put all of your bills you make sure no you paint this first and you do this maintenance here first\nAnd how you start following that same timeline and you go as the seasons go you go from fall to winter to spring to summer and things that yeah he did done you have done during those periods you\nGet done and it actually gives you some responsibility and the last thing you want to do after you put all of that sweat equity in your house you don't want to take a step backwards you want to continue to improve that house\nThat's right that's right every year there's something to give every scene and just like you said and we can talk about why and now you know when I'm ... I I Do have a punch list and scenes and all things that people should get every year\nOne of the things you should always have in hand a number of a reputable plumber and their stuff she'd go right into your smartphone or wherever you put your contacts\nYou should have an electrician you should obviously have someone that can handle your HVAC problems just as important as your lawyer Dr Denis you should have those three and more handy show you know who you're dealing with and you build a relationship with as you grow in your home now when we come back\nRiding that contract what's expected closing time all of that stuff now you want to call in it's real simple eight six six three and I won ten twenty dollar bank instant access\nWhat's expected closing time all of that stuff now you want to call in it's real simple eight six six three down one ten twenty dollar bank instant access can get radio dot com and you can Texas on the right amount of my best deal in town Lauren Klein call my banker Marysville more in a moment\n[noise]\nI'm voting in the mid term elections because my ...

architecture and Pakistan networks very nicely with that\nIs that something that the heart but for people know about like how do you [laughter] know are they going to do that you would\nThey can guide you um or you can just look in some like look on line and look at some magazines and each day in ... it is actually pretty easy to to pack 'em\nBut you want to you just want to make sure it slows with

a good morning\nOr good stop listening did all sorts of a response on the program today dollar bank and ... says Lauren I have a bathroom in the\nBasement where shower vanity toilets this is an overflow bath and not primary bathroom showers and fiberglass stall will be a smart investment to replace the shower with the customs ... hour north shore if cost of replacing will ad\nDollars meaning value when I go to show\nProbably not because it's in the basement um I Would say if this is the bathroom is clean and neutral and definitely usable I Would focus more on the bass knows that um are the main bathrooms\nOkay no okay\nYeah let me let me before we take our break and come back and finish for the last two topics\nOne of them out to do with what you do a closing time\nYou know what do you think the thought process was your dad would probably be better dancer this because he'd been added a lot longer and that is why basements in western Pennsylvania and all of a sudden\nYou know you are a lot younger than me but my generation in the sixties everybody said you know instead of just letting those basements have concrete walls why do we do something and they give us extra living space and we know we had six children in the family so my dad puts them telling the force of pedaling on the walls\nAnd we got all sorts of extra room in the house and they push for us to really entertain and celebrate\nShow the whole basement thing do realize even though it may not add value to that sale it really has given people in western Pennsylvania an opportunity to grab Maura living space and and really essence ... raise to where they get more pleasure out of being in that home\nThat many of them have said well maybe we should go and try to find something bigger but in essence they get to stay right there because of somebody previously remodeling adding on or they take it upon themselves to or do something about those concrete walls and floors in the basement did they call them\nYeah we'll talk about that next the finished basement as a huge is a huge deal to people um especially the people with um little kids so somebody everybody wants to place to go in a lot of times we call that the man cave [noise]\nSo ah finished basement do add value and you want them to be done properly so um professionally finished basement is a is a great idea\nYou want him to be done properly so um professionally finished basement is a is a great idea\nOr so before we take a break come back and talk about what's expected you of clothes at closing time just an overall on what we learned for the first part of the program today lord\nWell it's important to get at your pre approval if you're looking to buy a new house\nOr interest rates are fluctuating every day as they always have um so you won't lock your interest rate until you actually go under agreement and make far more applications I get your pre approval together it's free and it's very very easy [noise]\nUm I also like people to think about where they want to be and how um where they're living and where they're working on all of that will come into play on what's convenient for you what kind of taxes he and I sit in pain what's the school district like\nAll of the things that are important to me when I help my buyers and um\n[noise] take care of you take care of your credit okay if you're thinking about buying a house in the next year or so pay attention to your credit pay your bills every month or don't have any late payments you want to keep that credit and and in perfect order\nWe show take a

Helene is vice president of Medicare with ... pm see health plan and there are a number of things that we still need to go over and one of them is water some of the extras that Medicare Advantage plans offer\nOkay um as I stated earlier a part this party part B and put the\nAnd all of those uh coverage have gaps you they helped cover it but they don't totally covered with a Medicare Advantage plan it fills in all of those holes as well as it really gets a lot of extra benefits such as dental preventive services routine hearing vision\nSilver sneakers um you hear what you see we have you can see anywhere care um in home safety at twenty four seven nurse line\nAnd always personal service to help that member navigate through the system over the health care concierge\nAround snow for an individual who during this open enrollment period ... mix of choice and then things oh my goodness I may have chosen wrong is there any option available for them\nSo when I'm doing a pie the annual enrollment period which is up to a Fifteen through December seventh member makes a choice of their health plan to start January first\nA January first um if they choose to change their plans they may change their plan one time between January first and march thirty first\nI think that if you choose your fiancee for health um for life and if you talk to one of our Medicare advisors you probably won't be making those using that I'm open enrollment period which is what it's called but certainly those members or there's been a Medicare beneficiary who want to change and change and that's\nOK let's say somebody makes a decision at the end of October and then ... says they want to make a change because life experience or just whatever and something happened and they want to change before the end of December can they do that\nCan change 'em during that period of October Fifteen to December seventh\nSeventh ... and it can change as many times do they feel they need to basically yes but yeah hopefully though they can change but hopefully ah they've spoken to a medical advisor they really understand their choices\nAnd um they're able to stay with their choice right but certainly during that time because the effective date is not until January first okay and then after the ...\nThere's a couple of months to be like and they would make it change on the the January second and it would become effective February first\nOkay now I also for a couple of other here is their help for people who are Medicare beneficiaries who are having a hard time paying for their health care costs\nYeah so there is extra help for people with part D prescription um need skips in drug coverage and to see if you qualify for that extra help using called Medicare one eight hundred Medicare\nUm you can also call the Social Security office um or you can call the medical assistance office\nThere's also paste or pay snow which state program to help people pay for their um prescription coverage and they all say maybe the benefits\nWe can't and if you call the Medicare advisor or you meet with the Medicare advisor or we can help you navigate that says\nOkay now what about people who are on Medicare and Medicaid okay\nSo the um those people have Medicare and Medicaid Medicare says red white and blue car that you have and a Medicaid is usually that access card we do have a special program a which is called UPN fee for life Joel and um it is a program that has medical\nHospital in physician prescription drug drug coverage in extra benefits\nYou're the extra benefits a little bit differently have dental and vision hearing we also have an over the counter benefit so that those members who wanted to go the funk pharmacy and get over the counter items they can um purchase those your transportation uh meals a day diet tree as well as a\nA personal um emergency response system is available\nMarsh now a lot of seniors are very active not only active in their community there are ... they like to travel around the country sometimes even overseas as well what about the issue of those who enjoy their travel time what considerations they have to keep in mind okay\nSo um they ship peace of mind when they travel and if a member ever needs emergency urgently needed care that's covered\nUm we also have a travel concierge program where the um we do have a network coverage of four states that western Pennsylvania to travel to such as Florida Georgia North Carolina South Carolina and Tennessee\nWe also have a worldwide emergency assistance or called assist America and they provide twenty four seven help when you travel um within a hundred miles away we've been in other countries\nNice very nice ... no one more question\nThere are a lot of options that are out there would be bored being inundated with information from one of the roots of commercials or what they're seeing on line or things being sent to them in the mail [noise] why should someone who is in need of Medicare\nAnd they're going through this open enrollment process choose you ...\nPm see is a Medicare Advantage plan that has been providing coverage to Pennsylvania western Pennsylvania is over Seventeen years um we are about a hundred and Seventy five thousand members strong and continuing to grow leading the I'm\nLeading the market and our members have peace of mind when they join us so much though that Ninety seven percent of the members stay with us that means that only three people in Ninety seven people out of a hundred people um stay with us year over year\nThat's pretty remarkable what is it is really remarkable and um it is because of uh\nPeople out of a hundred people stay with us you know a year that's pretty remarkable yes it is really the mock and um it is because they have a high touch high service and good value that we provide 'em and and the security to know that we're here today and tomorrow\nRight and so you have wonderful hospitals doctors and then the ability to also cover people whereas there traveling as well from when they're outside of the U. P. M. C. facilities it makes it wonderful too\nAnd it's also important to note that ... and not what you think just limited ...

P. M. C. dot let's talk about the programs that are available at U. P. M. C. and why they're so beneficial\nAs we discuss previously we really focus a lot on on eating wisely we also focus on um\nOn physical activity are we ever several secret sneakers program with regards to physical activity what happens it's silver speakers I think what what we try to do is is stimulate that idea that you don't need a large amount of exercise is just it's just exercise on a regular basis\nAnd it also deals with what does that exercise looked like as you age\nAnd the exercise has to do with basically three main areas\nIt's not only strengthening and ... and and and some mild strengthening exercises that you do it also has to do with a robotic activities and as we talked earlier about walking some people will continue to bicycle or any area like that that that promotes about twenty to thirty minutes of daily exercise\nBut then in addition to that as a population as individuals age was\nEqually as important as balance and there are a number of balance exercises that can be done our health coaches at U. P. M. C. helps him\nInstruct individuals' of balance exercises they can do at home they can do in group settings a lot of times you hear of aerobic exercise that's not only in in in or pool based aerobic exercise okay uh and and that exercise not only is provides some strengthening\nBut it provides balance sickly for individuals who have a difficulty with balance give me an idea of what we could do at home for balance there are a number of of items holding onto a chair\nBut lifting one leg off the ground and standing with someone like off the ground but supporting yourself what we don't want a ... a senior individual or an elderly individual to do is to um try to do more from the balance standpoint than they're capable of\nBut standing holding a chair lift him one leg off of the floor taking one arm off the chair that just adds to the building\nAn unbalanced on this one leg okay so there are number of things such as that getting in and out of a chair the way that you would get out of a chair and the balance that you need as you stand up so there are a number of activities that are health coaches can assist individuals and\nInto whether it's a home whether it's with groups of individuals or if they just need a active they want to do with a with a with a family member\nNow when I think of an annual wellness visit the first thing I think of is just going to the doctor for that annual checkup kind of go through the motions there's more to it than just that isn't there\nThere's definitely more to it than that and we promote an annual wellness visit because there's no cost\nTo the Medicare individual okay there's there's there's it not only is there not a cost from a copayment there is no deductible\nThis is this is part of a of a wellness type benefit so what we're trying to do is get those individuals and this is not a head to toe examination physical examination like what you think of this is more to look at the important\nComponents of healthy behaviors\nIn Medicare age population and let me explain some of what that is so okay I'm a I'm On Medicare member and I come in every three months to see my my physician because I have some clinical problem\nWe still want them want these individuals to come in for an annual wellness visit because it's a longer appointment", "show_name": "The Fan Morning Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "27"}
