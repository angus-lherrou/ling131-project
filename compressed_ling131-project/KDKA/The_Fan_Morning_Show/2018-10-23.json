but Monday nights on kitty ... radio we have Dr Christian county\nWho's with us this morning another disc Institute a ... for news on Zach good morning morning guys doc\nIs we are watching especially in the political climate that is going on right now it just seems like the civility has gone out the back door in this country\nWell I think you're really accurately because people who have allow themselves to as angry\nAs they want to get and say anything they want to get without a filter\nAnd I think we can attribute that to several things one of them is where a lot more than that we can communicate eat more easily but we could do so for many people anonymously so they could have girl out really insightful statement but get people heated and\nPart of the problem is all the things most people teach their children not to do name call a you know the bullying\nAnd the anger level and all these things that are happening we see daily in the adults that are supposed to be running this country in business\nI think you're I think that that that that ... that we teach our children don't do worse than the adults do so somewhere along the way adults have given themselves permission\nThat's it ... the things that we would teach our children don't build we're seeing the adults do so somewhere along the way adults have given themselves permission to go against what they know is right\nWhat I Would love to do and what I Try to do all the time is get people instead of focusing on the outside world and how the world's wrong and what they can shout about the world focus on yourself and figure out what you can change about you in other words if you're a parent out there and you'll never\nAllow your child or be proud of your child if he or she called somewhat a name then don't call it named by example don't call someone a name but it's getting back to being able to take responsibility for themselves\nWell from from that standpoint I mean let's talk about that I mean if you are a frustrated by what you are seeing in the news or or what's out there and\nYou just react to it and I mean you don't think about that the kids are hanging around I'm not talking about curse words or something but you know if you call somebody a fool or an idiot or whatever their case may be on whichever side of the political spectrum they may be I mean you don't think about your child sitting there hearing you call somebody an idiot\nRight the ... those are probably the key was that we don't think about it but the truth is our children are watching our ... our behavior so one of the statements I say all the time that is a really isn't an impactful statement as people see your accent is not your intentions\nSo you might say well I don't mean to be negative I don't mean to be a really poor role model for my child right now but the reality is that if you're doing those things you are so it comes back again to not a shark and your responsibility and saying I'm going to put her on someone else\nAnd come back to me and say wait my children are watching how I speak to someone about someone\nWhere with dogs are Christian county and and to further back part of it doc is once it seems like people are OK with\nWhat has now been nor the name calling and all the other negative stuff that goes on and what ... what ever happened to be unable to disagree with somebody without it escalating to near violence\n[laughter] right right so you know it's interesting because I had co founded the center for people convicted of violent crimes out in California before I moved back\nBack east and one of the rules I Would set down right away is I'd say you know it's unfortunate that as an adult I have to lay the roll down but there's going to be known name calling and the reason why is the moment we give ourselves permission to call someone and may\nWe've objectify that person and months we've objectify that person it's easier for us\nTo really go at them a lot harder so to have to say that to adults is it's unfortunate but it's the reality so I Would call all of the listeners out there right now that say\nBe mindful of calling someone a name like there is a great concept in philosophy called ignoring the question so in other words in it's a philosophical fallacy so if you're talking about a particular concept\nHey are you for a you know children then puppies yes well wait a minute what about you and you went to that concert last week will it has nothing to do with it so if you stay on the topic rather than doing things like ad hominem attacking the person\nOr just talk about the topic I think if you get a lot farther\nCourse politics wise in the face of everything you're saying and that you can say one thing about someone today and then tomorrow say well you know that was just in the heat of politics\nWho writes again when we are I Would love to if there was a way to get together and\nIt's just in the heat of politics\nRight again I Would love to if there was a way to get together and say let's\nGot to rewrite the social norm and and that's why I Love what you're doing with it but they are I think the world are you guys I mean does it stop it because\nIt'd be good with conversation is likely to say are we lost civility and how do we get it back well one way we get a factory begin to take responsibility for ourselves and we said I Am going to allow myself\nTo just give my say whatever I Want to say it has to be a poet\nOr save those types of things\nAnd how have you enjoyed taking calls on Monday Night Sarah kitty cat radio is there have been a femur of thread that people seem to bring up and seems\nTo resonate with folks that want to call well\nI absolutely love it I'm really a super grateful to be able to do this show at

cheese or lose like Wyoming friends who are losing relationship over the so I Love the dialogue I Love being able to have the conversations with people is really a lot of fun\nAnd we enjoy having you

years and the Donald Trump no was it a phenomenon a that I'm suddenly emerged when President Obama was president something that keeps growing now that being said there's been anger in\nPolitics as long as there is one politics or let's say for sure of\nYour show to fuel Roman emperor ... et cetera but the issue is what we are what we do about this and what's happening here is the rhetoric has
