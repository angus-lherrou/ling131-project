beautiful area is\nThe man behind the brand\nStrict ... good morning Rob\nHow are you I'm good how 'bout you spectacular now your wife is not here because it's a busy time of year she's got some new listing she got some news when it comes to the pirates of the penguins in something else too that she's very proud to promote pet so fill us in on that stuff with\nUm well yes uh first of all learn wanted to say hello it's uh it it is it's a busy time of year we just got back in last night from\nUh what feels like being away for months but um she's a she's I don't know if I could ever call her exhausted because she just worked so hard all the time but she's arresting\nA and catching up on some work so anyway she has some listings some new listings that she wants me to mention [noise]\n[noise] ah and I'm reading from notes here and she does have beautiful handwriting but you know she was scribbling them furiously this morning so uh I'm going to try the best I can I'm Sorry honey if you're listening or\nShe has a listing at fifty fifty beach or which is Fifteen acres it's a it's a log home I actually know this lifting I did a drone video for it\nOr [noise] and it's a beautiful property or secluded fifth or Fifteen secluded acres out past ... or she has a listing on one twenty Kelly Court\nA and it sets a fantastic event\nUm it gives a the people in Pittsburgh western Pennsylvania an opportunity to visit on a weekend\nOr a lot of these older historic buildings and and some of them are newer in modern but they get a chance for behind the scenes tour of a lot of these buildings over the weekend um I took my daughter Celia to this we had a great time took a lot of pictures we we actually ended up walking most of the north side which I'd never done\nA and it was a lot of fun but we we saw places like the new hazel theater um uh there was a a calvary United Methodist church right and um [noise] what else could we see the alphabet city building\nA and a which is now called a city of asylum which is a really cool place got a great little restaurant in in a library and it's like a gathering place for artists um this is all just on the north side stopped by the primary for a little bit I'd actually never been in the primary and that\nI've been there nice Scrooge ... huge and you've got Mexican ... which really was the first wave of what we've seen happen to places like Lawrenceville and yeah you know the record factory downtown what have you had a yeah a lot on the north shore\nIt was a so that that event was was fantastic and and you're right about ... walking the Mexican war streets the architecture the homes on that side uh I was I was a in a teaching moment\nTrying to teach seal you a little bit about where we were in and uh you know how that the north side actually was a years and years ago as city called Allegheny city right and it became part of Pittsburgh\nAnd at the time it was the third largest city in Pennsylvania now we're talking in the Eighteen hundreds but um you know these are the kinds of things that that really make I think what I Do with Pittsburgh beautiful so interesting is that there's there's just there's you just can't get enough\nOf the history of Pittsburgh and as you as you dig deep into it and you walk through these neighborhoods and and go to these events like doors open Pittsburgh uh and immerse yourself or in things that you never knew\nUm existed it just it starts to draw more and more out and that's what I Love about what I Do with Pittsburgh beautiful is that there's so many people that grab a hold of this and enjoy it and then contribute their own information their own stories their own pictures and um\nIt's spreading and it's growing and and I I just couldn't be more grateful for that and um\nUh you know there's there's one thing I wanted to mention about the doors open Pittsburgh there's two churches on sixth avenue downtown right across from the Duquesne Club and you know you drive by um how many times in your life have you driven by him\nAnd I'm One of those people and I I got to go in the first Presbyterian Church I was part of doors open Pittsburgh and what an incredible building as soon as you walk in there you forget\nThat you're you're you're even in a city it's like you you look at it from the outside and it's big and it's a church but it's surrounded by the skyscrapers and then you walk in and and you look at the structure and and I had a chance to three D. scan and they were gracious enough to let me do that but\nIt it it was just incredible and I'm so that that event next year they haven't announced a date but doors open Pittsburgh if a if you haven't intended it they sell general event tickets they're very inexpensive they've they've gotta\nThey've got to pay for this somehow you know we've had people ask why isn't it free and all that kind of stuff to look there's people that donate a lot of time and a lot of effort I mean the coordination of this kind of thing is just ridiculous er I I Know the woman Bonnie who coordinates ... who who runs it\nAnd uh it's it's it's a it's a passion for her so anyway the tickets are inexpensive it's a great it's a great way to get out with the family and we can and do something so\nThat's part of what I've been up to I'm\nA recently if you if you go to our website Pittsburgh beautiful dot com um steps is this is there a hundred and twenty fifth year right even or not uh and uh my one of my writer's eke a attended because Lauren and I were out of town he attended um\nI guess the you would call it the unveiling of the palm court restoration\nA couple of days back and he wrote a piece on it it's on Pittsburgh beautiful dot com they're a hundred and twenty fifth celebration gala is Thursday night\nUh I actually have something already planned but uh I think we may have some people from Pittsburgh beautiful there they've invited us there um but uh ... what an incredible institution you know we have here and and the history there you can ... you can find it on Pittsburgh beautiful dot com you can of course got to fix his website\nOr to see this kind of stuff but I did not know\nThat twenty five thirty years ago that that ... was\nA in trouble I didn't know that and\nBuys eat going to this event I I guess the mayor was speaking there and he was talking about it\nUm I guess uh and and I'm going to research this a little bit more so I Apologize anybody who knows the history because I don't but I had no idea that fits had gotten at falling on some hard times and and the mayor or so the mask off had stepped in I guess and was instrumental in in helping to revive that keep them around and you know thank goodness for that because\nIt has grown into one of the most incredible places a so those are just a few of the things that that we've been up to\nHear but as always uh people are sharing thousands of photos on our Facebook page or on our Instagram page and I do everything I can to try to re share those because it's really about what you know what everybody thinks is beautiful about the Pittsburgh area\nKnow here's what you have to understand about Pittsburgh and I was talking about this and the first hour today because I was trying to make people understand why this election is so significant as far as creating jobs over the next twenty five years\nWe were at one time as big as Silicon Valley where of course Microsoft and apple have made their name\nAnd we all know and we heard stories about the population growth and the growth in real estate commercial buildings in of course you know wondering where Amazon's next quarter headquarters is going to be apple they to looking for another location further second headquarters in what it was due to really jumpstart the economy\nReally jumpstart the economy obviously right when you go back to the industrial age people like George Westinghouse Andrew Carnegie Henry Clay Frick J. P. Morgan\nGrand street was like Wall Street it was as important as the bulls and bears are in New York here in Pittsburgh\nThese barons really set the stage and you were talking about opening doors we open doors for many businesses that spread across this great country and it all started right here a lot of urban living people living downtown you were talking about the north shore\nOne time known as Allegheny the grade history of the Allegheny General Hospital some of the most important things in the history of medicine began there and as you walk from the garage the western avenue and of course ah\nAlong federal street if you walk in there were certain court or is it the hospitals have pictures that will take you through a timeline and it will show the significance of medicine and what they did and how it started but those names that I mentioned just moments ago are still a big part of who we all are Carnegie library Carnegie museums\nSo I think people need to understand a lot of folks are seeing and the mayor is out there kind of leading the charge this resurgence if you will this renaissance which goes back to Sophie ... and Richard caligiuri\nAnd it's just as a ... place to be and I think because of what you're doing people are having a chance to see Pittsburgh and places that they haven't seen a long time like a fits conservatory that they're saying\nStill they're still shining still Pittsburgh beautiful\n[noise] yeah I I I agree with you I'm ... and you know the thing about ... steps is growing\nAnd um you know they they've they've taken a lead on on having green green and sustainable architecture and and they've really become\nA an example for a lot of ah other institutions and and I think even some corporations looking to construct buildings and gardens and things like that they've they've actually turned ... from what I understand for\nFor some help on this and and and a little bit of a lead on this and you know that's Pittsburgh's still innovating right and I think you know yes there there was a time when\nYou know things look bad and um and and and the ... the city in the region and and I have to highlight this all the time you know Pittsburgh beautiful is not just about the city of Pittsburgh it's about the region so\nAll right we're going to do are going to take a short break and I'm going to know Marie so of course Caldwell banker and I'm going to tell you about a significant individual who has been a big part of the landscape of business in Pittsburgh who happens to be joining us later today on kitty K reading I'm going to kind of tying them a lot of the things that Chris was talking about\nAnd why Pittsburgh has reclaimed its beauty and it's continuing to grow like all of those beautiful flowers that fits so I Hope you'll stick around for that but again why you find Pittsburgh to be so beautiful about maybe a location thing\nCertain heritage of different community I mean after all the city of neighborhoods that doesn't get any ... better from the north shore to literally any place in the city of Pittsburgh heart the golden triangle you name it a Bloomfield the south side absolutely great will be back stay with us\nDon't know what I'm hearing more commercials for politicians replacement window company it's definitely the season for both\nHi John Maggie and just wants to hear from a fault him into a company we can't help you with your political decision but if you're in the market for a place in windows we need to talk metropolitan hadn't been serving in greater Pittsburgh region for forty years roll family owned business with a plus rating and we're the only replacement window company in the area\nThey carry infinity for modern fiber glass windows fiber glass windows are eight times stronger than vile so the frames are slimmer and much more ...\nMuch better insulate I didn't mind\nYeah I I I agree I mean in in in talking about all of that all those names you mentioned in the past\nUh and then bring that into the future and talking about Silicon Valley I I think here in Pittsburgh that ... that were on the brink of of having another set of those names because there are a lot of start ups there are a lot of tech companies that are that are here and\nIf it ... the reason that they come here at this point other than the the things I already mentioned is ah the you know there's some basic economics at play as well\nYou know go buy a house in Silicon valley right okay I mean price tags a little do can afford that yeah I mean it's it's it's ... it's actually right right which is why there while he's in Seattle but grass enough buy a house in Seattle you know I mean if we want to kill this a little bit back towards real estate and and and talk a little bit about that\nHave the ... why do you think it is from a guy dealt in finance\nA card carrying member of this great organization that is the real estate professionals the multi list everything that we talk about every week why do you think we've been able to have such a huge bump as far as the economy shovels in the dirt infrastructure lots of things taking place there's still that big political divide obviously coming up\nBut obviously coming off of two thousand sixteen election mid term elections coming up but the housing market has read really remained more competitive why do you think that is\nI I mean if you're talking on the national level or you know here in Pittsburgh yeah well I I think I think there's there's two very basic reasons I mean first of all the affordability of living here you know that the cost of living now I Know and and and like ... like anybody else if I'm Out to dinner with friends or\nYou know sitting around with the guys where does that conversation go it goes to\nPolitics taxes you know what what things cost and all that so I get it I mean you can make that argument just about anywhere I mean show me a tax free environment okay it just doesn't exist now and it's unfortunate but that's the way it is but on the sheer scale of\nAffordability of housing in this town even in the areas where you have seen some some incredible appreciation for for Pittsburgh because I I we do get this a lot of you know try to buy a house here it used to cost this now it costs that\nComparatively it is still incredibly affordable to live in a in a in a neighborhood anywhere around this region or if you're going to compare it to you know what's funny almost any other city in the country right now I mean there are some other cities that that has some pockets but\nUm I just the sheer affordability of of what's going on and and speaking from a you know from our backyard out in the east um\nWhich is a significant part of Pittsburgh that first suburb with of course east Pittsburgh and Westinghouse and turtle crate these places are essential forest hills Tokyo to Pittsburgh and they have come back full cycle\nOh yeah and and the surprising thing to me um about this the region and and and housing in the region is that\nThat area is so incredibly affordable as compared to some of the other areas in Pittsburgh I think and I'm I'm just making a prediction here that could be wrong\nBut I think you're going to see that area really start to move soon because you're talking\nYou know like you just mentioned forest hills what any credit I mean I I drove through the streets if ourselves the other day\nAnd and and this is no this is ... and it no disrespect meant about Lebanon I Love about Lebanon and it's a beautiful area and there's actually no area Pittsburgh I don't think is beautiful no matter what my Lebanon's ... melt Lebanon is beautiful so\nI I'm I'm I'm doing a drone for for a home that my wife had listed that she sold right away to brag that way so big it's sold like within two days much good well I'd like to think it was because of the drone video but actually I think it was because her but uh um anyway long story short I'm looking around this street tucked in the hills and forest hills\nAnd I'm and I'm thinking to myself this I I Can't believe\nThat that you can ... that you can have this beautiful neighborhood with these Britain tutors and old stone homes in tree lined streets\nAnd that the prices here are what they are so I took a quick video on and did an Instagram story and you can do polls on Instagram so I took a quick video of just the street and I put a poll on that said is it smelt Lebanon or is this forest hills you know Seventy percent of the people guess it was meant Lebanon\nAs a compliment well that's because it looks like Mount Lemmon and yeah I mean it's forest hills so let's not get I don't want to do anybody get mad I may just\nTell you this and we're going to take a break and come back and wrap up there but please check out Pittsburgh beautiful and see what he is showing to everyone and the world via social media Chris Klein and if you're thinking real estate think lower inclined Colwell banker Marysville but when you think of shady side scroll hill rank and Swiss fill\nAll of the ... when we've seen with John settlement is done there I mean if there is so much good and it's funny everything that is a ...\nA new really came from that rich past of course that each Pittsburg at first major suburbs so ladies and gentleman I think you're going to see a lot more Pittsburgh beautiful in years to come and I think one of the most beautiful ways to make it beautiful and can send you to be just that\nIs to create more jobs in as he mentioned a lot to be start up companies are doing just that

Brad show never done a crazy thing and my whole life give me that right [noise] he was ready\nOh Ken body Katie KIA\nLadies and gentlemen how are you today Welcome back we've got open talk I'm going to really kind of I don't know slap you around a little bit verbally the shower because I'm very upset to the fact that I Am going to spend\nThrough Tuesday and I pretty much reminding the significance of this midterm election and voter turnout\nSomething that has to be significant I think for us to be able to continue to move forward with this mission of creating jobs first jobs last and helping the middle class people return to the prominence at once again I Believe needs to be the foundation to keep America upright\nComing up Tuesday night I just want to remind everybody what's going to be happening or going to have Jim Rada the former head of the Republican Party and of course the very first chief executive in Allegheny county and amazing entrepreneur at nine o'clock\nYou can have a rare opportunity to spend a couple of segments with him focusing on the significance of this election when it comes to job creation it's not just about\nThe jobs there will be created over the next year next few years or even if a President Trump gets elected into a second term and twenty twenty\nThis is about jobs that are going to be happening over the next twenty five years and uh another gentleman who's going to be on the airwaves who is highly intelligent when it comes to talking business and he happens to be right now he's state representative in Harrisburg until the end of the year\nHe's vacating that seat after his a failed attempt to get the Republican nomination for US Senate but he is a young man who was driven a W N J graduate he has a dear friend who has a beaver county native is named Jim Christiana\nAnd I think he's going to be a shining voice for young people for many years to come whether it's in the private sector or if he decides someday to return to politics but you're going to hear him on Thursday and friday noon to three and I hope you will definitely tune and he's also now running the Republican Party in beaver county but I just want you to understand\nSays nothing to do about the Republican Party I'm a Democrat and I see what Republicans are doing that are actually making a difference and I had people telling me to turn in my democratic\nYou know a card and you know how can I be pro union when no Republicans are pro union well I totally disagree with that\nYou know I've said this many times President Trump has worked with some of the biggest labor unions in the country during his time in the real estate industry which goes back to the seventies so that's as far as I'm concerned just a a flat out false statement okay\nAll right we've got a ton of a right out amount of text messages and I'm going to just kind of take care of some of these before we get to a your phone calls and I love to hear from you weren't open talk up until ten o'clock today at eight six six three and one ten twenty dollar bank is an access kitty cat radio dot com or I could lay a track\nPick and shovel to enhance I guarantee you a job I never did never had a real job in his life listen Joe Biden has done\nAn incredible job serving the public and listen I think if the Democrats have any chance they cannot recycle Hillary Clinton and I don't see any shining star on the horizon I think Joe Biden would be a formidable opponent for President Trump and I at least think\nBecause of both men we wouldn't be talking issues and that would be a good thing also happy birthday to the U.S navy two hundred and forty three years of age so I salute or members of the navy says Rob Love your passion for the president I could listen to you speak for hours about\nGood that he's doing for the country listen I think folks should know what he's doing for the country folks\nTalking about the red tape must stop 'em both Party Republicans a bit more a western Pennsylvania are still not getting enough done a ... this is a good one and I'm going to give it to you from Danny Says Rob did you ever see any Republican politicians ever carry\nA trade union banning the Labor Day parade well if that's the not if that is the case that shouldn't be the case in here's something else Republicans need to start to make statements that they do support union labor if I'm missing something here\nYou know what if you want me to really continue to promote your cause of putting people to work then I Want to hear you say if you're a Republican candidate I support\nUnion labor that simple lesson one other thing I invite you to ah subscribed to my YouTube channel or check me out on Facebook we're going to be as we have been very busy leading up to the election my mission is this one I'm not here\nI'm going to be out and about interviewing different candidates people talking policy talking really what this election means as far as job creation of the next twenty five years\nTalking to Democrats and Republicans alike we have a very busy week coming up on Wednesday we're actually going to be a in middling Pennsylvania talking to some people at a function that I Hope you'll tune in for that so I'm I'm\nAll hands as far as wanting to stir things up enough to where at least it knocks the cop webs out\nAnd you start thinking about the significance of what really matters look all of this sinister stuff that's out there and I think these personal attacks against the president and all the tabloid headlines and all of the horrible things that are happening our country and there are a lot of them\nSome of them okay that Saudi journalist such a tragic story recording his own death I mean there there are things that really just are overwhelming but you got to try to stay focused she got to try to lock you know why this election so important as far as jobs are concerned so do you understand\nAnd argue for or against the president as far as his mission I Would love to hear from you the shower it is eight six six turnout among ten twenty the best way to reach me or dollar bank instant access getting hit radio dot com where you can touch me on the right amount of wind best deal in town a shutout to Oakland and say hello to Anthony Anthony walking the KKK radio morning\nWarning with llamas thoughts Democrat I'm not going to vote for Republican I Know exactly what they're about ... there might want state pushers they don't really care about unions they they they are more for the chamber of commerce\nAnd so that's not even a ... a star there with me and of course on one corner land and take care of law is and I want the weapons didn't Republicans to go down the drain also because I Want some balance\nAnd and ... in Washington DC I don't you know when you have a a a a Congress and the Senate who allows Trump bomb on the President Trump to do whatever you want without any any a backup or hold up to anything is ridiculous\nI Know what the Republicans want to do as far as what would they deal with those tax cuts they're coming after entitlements\nAnd I'm going to say now we all know what what that's all because they have to mention he paid for and you can have the most rural about the economy which you can have it it's still not going to make up to the deficit\nBecause you're not bringing in as much taxes\nSo no I'm ... I'm On the stalwart and now as I told you a couple of weeks ago if you want to\nPlay this Republican talking point then you might as well leave the party we hey you know this is your title but don't sit there to keep telling everybody you're a Democrat and all you're doing is pushing the Republican talking point after that [noise] that's disingenuous well\nThat's your opinion is what that is and I think you're flat out wrong about everything you just said and let me explain why I think you're wrong\nBecause you understand you are simply voting for change for the sake of change and you said that yourself but guess what you're going to put this country back to square one and I know you may not like the tax cuts but do you understand\nThose companies are the reason why people are getting paychecks and if we lose any more companies in this country\nIt could be fatal blow for this country Anthony I Know you want to believe it's ... it's going to continue to go on the matter what happens in a lot of this is just bluffing on part of the Republicans\nBut that's not the case but I Will agree with you on one thing maybe Republicans actually need to do what I'm doing today and start promoting union labor as opposed to me believing that they support it even though they're not out really are on the stoop promoting it burble eight or physically overseeing at first dance\nThey need to embrace union labor and if they would do that I think that that could push their agenda over the top that's how much I Believe that the majority of people see it every day when they look in their paychecks or check out their quarterly statements as far as their four oh one case\nWell here's what they say when they look out at the fate you at the higher health care calm the higher gas prices were eight and I'm Talking about the regular public corporation\nBecause corporations all getting tax break 'cause they they knew how to maneuver and an expert in all the lower their tax so he did with just lower even more well\nI'm Talking about the regular Joe and spending more gas but more clothing more food and health care which is really\nWhich is really been in the killer but you can sit there and your little fantasy fantasy and don't think they're not coming after entitlement programs shows me you don't know what you're talking about because there were public march\nListen you're not allowed to have hers person that's told me that I don't know what I'm Talking about I've been knocked off his show box a law a lot of times when I got the bruises to prove it but I'm not going to stop what I see what's happening from where I'm at\nTo where we're at in the city of Pittsburgh we talked about a lot of it last hour and you see people that are jumping into this political fray who\nDon't need to what they see an opportunity for real change and they understand what good this country can do for people\nIf they're in the right position to do something and honestly right now corporate America understands that maybe it's time and I think it's because of the president's forward thinking\nThat we start building things in our society again they ask you what are the same generation you're a few years older than me we remember when televisions were made here and if you just keep telling me for the sake of change you're going to make change\nThat you don't want to start seeing more things building this country then you know what then you really don't care about their generation is going to come along after you and I are gone and they show the last load of dirt on is\nThat on that because the higher paying jobs are going to come in the tech industry and calming environmental if industry that we that this part of the faith climate change doesn't exist so\nThat's why he got leaking a ... a carrying a regulation that kept them safe from radiation that let's say from the past that he will all all these things back into the environment because he says in the name of business\nSo that you want to live and that's fine but I'm a Democrat I'm voting for Democrats because I Want somebody to stand up for this man when he's out of control\nAll right well let me tell you they should go ahead and do that and when we lose more businesses you won't have to worry about a rain tree\nOr rain for surviving cause there won't be any people to actually enjoy it and the society that we know will no longer exist if you don't build things in a society you don't have a society and if you think we're going to go back to the stone age when it comes to air pollution and\nWhat

turn away because you have a right to speak your mind and that's what this radio station this talk format is about and I respect your opinion\nBut I'm trying to make a point rehashing in going over all of this stuff that happened with the president or join the Brock Obama administration and giving the great president that he was credit for what's going on now does it make sense because we're missing the opportunity that lives in front of us\nAnd I'm a big enough person\nTo accept that a member of a different party is making a big difference because I look into the eyes of my children and understand without jobs\nThere is nothing here and do you realize how many people that I knew growing up that don't live here anymore that got just place because of all of the jobs that were lost I just want a better day\nFor the future and people here I Want Pennsylvania to be relevant that's all I'm saying I'm not going to disagree with you because obviously you do your homework too\nBut I just want to believe that we're headed in the right direction that's all\nWell you know what I'm ... ... ... ... you can talk jobs jobs jobs but at the moral fabric of the country it's just\nIt it's just common part then you're you're not going to have a strong country in the long run and and that is what the Republican Party is cultivating and more over\nUh they're trying to stop people from voting all over this country the Republican Party how does that square with you being a Democrat\nI heard about the story in Georgia and that's not ... ... doesn't make me feel good I Know that but\nWhat I have to do when I've got to do everything in my power to keep my eye on the prize and that's continuing do realize the veterans in this country and how they're getting short changed him what they need and and we have great health care in this country despite what people think we're so lucky to live in the shadow of\nThe Allegheny health network and Hi Mark a new PMT and heritage valley where I'm from we're fortunate we have good schools we can have better schools but the way that all of this stuff moves forward\nIs by creating more middle class jobs and if you can tell me the Joe Biden if he is the the front runner can do a better job I'm going to listen to you I'm going to sit down and I'm seriously going to put some thought into it\nBut I just don't see anybody else out there that's going to do it better than this president has done and\nMany of the Republicans that are in the Senate and house\nBecause they're working with him it took them a long time to come around to lend it really did and you know what it's not just that he's faced opposition from the Democratic party the\nRepublican Party has been so welcoming to the president at times either\nWell you know Joe Biden is is not the answer a people and has a generation they they need to step aside and let the Conor Lamb come forward\nI like Conor Lamb ... let me say this word let me say this publicly he is refreshing there's no doubt about it that is what you are that's what you want for your children someone like him but am I willing to say he should take over for Keith Rothfus and put\nThe place that I call home because the most of that ... district Seventeen district isn't beaver county to put us on the back\nTo put us on the back burner I'm not willing to go there quite yet but I Will say this

doesn't make any sense to anybody and I don't even think he won her status so okay uh I'm outta here Rob\nOkay I have a good day say you're out of here while you're comeback I put the coffee on the
