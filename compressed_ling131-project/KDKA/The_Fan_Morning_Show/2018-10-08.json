at the University of Pittsburgh and as you probably aware there's been a move for a long time to not celebrate Christopher Columbus day\nTo the point of taking down statues and a lot of other things what about that city in Ohio above Columbus Day parade in Pittsburgh\nWasn't until the mid Eighteen hundreds that Italy is the country we known as today was really a bunch of little kingdoms correct\nAbsolutely and his career in many ways that's very common for the time period he was there in our he grew up in a family as much as she was a skilled sailor who was trying to sell his plan to any monarch\nMonarchy that would support him he was turned down by Portugal but he found willing supporters and the Catholic Monarchs a Spain who are in the middle of their very um\nExcept for powerful a sort of Christian crusade to re win control of their cake and the Trump is there like a and how they can and they were\nFully in support of somebody with a vision for I'm finding a factory to market\nSo he comes to this way and winds up on the spent fuel or a which is an island that was inhabited by the is a piano Indians is that\nWe buy you know how you know tight you know Indians and in a matter of a few years two hundred and fifty thousand native tight town oh Indians are pretty much wiped out right\nYeah there were I mean there were lots of different indigenous people living in the Caribbean on a variety of islands and it was a really powerful and and damaging combination that effect certainly there was violence certainly there was a slave like but there were also there was just the almost unimaginably catastrophic effect of diseases that\nAre indigenous American will have any immunities again and the combination of violence disease and probably the air\nReally a killed in some places like heavy at up to Ninety percent of the population very quickly and and everybody at the time observing it I saw that this was happening I'm at a lot of that again it was a cocktail of factors there was a it certainly with European violence and and slave linked together it was also a disease environment\nThat nobody understood particularly while at the time you\nKnow they could possibly known that quotient but yet I think a lot of people wonder well when you come to a new place what gives you the right to sleep with people that are already there [noise]\nYou know certainly that is the case and there's you know to understand the mindset of Columbus and the folks that were sponsoring him and he was selling with you really have to look at\nThe history of um the concept of just war ideas about who could be in play and the conflict of really idea of the crusading Christianity that informed his sponsors the Catholic um monarchs and Spain and Columbus himself he said don't deal for Christianity and his belief that perhaps\nHe could gain funding to win back a Jerusalem he was a he was a mess I Am a Christian himself and these ideas informed\nWhat they thought was possible and legal and just ah regarding their treatment of native peoples on their ideas that we don't necessarily agree with today but we have we have to understand Columbus hitting his contacts in his time period\nYou know and he was put up to be the person in charge and would ship will is credited with shipping thousands of these natives from his friend you'll to Spain many of them dying before they ever got to be in slaves but also in the Dominican Republic or what is today the Dominican Republic\nThat he they said had a ruthless a monarchy or whatever you want to call it and actually would kill to make a point\n[noise] yeah I Know there was a lot of terrible behavior by early European are rivals in the Caribbean and it was extraordinarily violent period and it was also just a extremely I'm disorganized period so Columbus all self ended up\nVery very quickly falling out with his fellow uh shipmates having thing disagreements or ending up in real trouble with the monarch seat originally sponsored him it was\nNot the image I think some people have some very organized to radical Spanish Empire on the contrary it was a very messy period there was a lot of infighting a and it was it was an unclear time everybody's authority was being disputed and Columbus himself\nDied feeling really resentful that he had been a accused of mismanaging that critical early period\nSo Professor today and anybody that has a Microsoft a calendar there's Columbus Day and there's also indigenous people's day\nA bit showing up both today what do you think what should we know\nI think that Columbus his voyages inaugurated transform a transformational period and world history and that's about it is a bad is that is what happened when it's in this country in particular I'd say we like to tell stories that revolve around\nA single man a hero or do and and I think in reality the story is much more complicated to blame all of the hardship that came in the wake of his wages on himself just doesn't make sense I think from my own perspective\nWhat makes a lot more sense to look at the amazing history of the Americans and to marvel at how many people survive that hardship survive that suffering to think about the world that was built in the wake of those voyages Columbus himself is less important than what came after and what came after is full of beauty and full of pain\nAh but that's really to me the way that I think of what his voyages unleashed a world\nWages unleashed a world of tremendous complexity of global important\nYou know the irony is that Columbus really never made it to what we know is the United states now and you've got the James don't call me in the Plymouth colonies that obviously did and yet we celebrate Columbus as being the person who found\nExactly and I thought it was saying I mean it's you know this is probably like to cook story the like the element of single individual buddy when you really hot and think about it it doesn't make sense Columbus\nColumbus with a single man who had a sort of singular a mountainous coach and he just he he had an adventure to get an aquifer completely under the arts and so everything that came after\nIs much more interesting I Would say in the south for missing that's the main story if we focus too much on Columbus instead of thinking about what happened in all the complexity afterwards\nProfessor of history University of Pittsburgh Molly worship fascinating I'd sign up for your class if [laughter]\nWell you might see long pleasure thank you so much Molly thanks so much

a good day for Gulf so much so I mean the sun is literally coming up over the golf course here\nAnd it's already hot you know so we ... let's put up a tent so we put up attempt to shield us live from some of the sun 'cause it's it's pretty intense but\nIf you're a golfer and even if you're not in South park you're playing golf somewhere today\nHumidity is high you got to high temperatures so you know what you got you got perfect day for golf because the ball will carry will carry because of the humidity and the heat oh just use the biggest club in the bag\nAnd just tap it and it'll go three

and speaking of golf\nI Am re energized about the game of golf which I which I don't play I play golf but but usually it's as like hey we want to do this but um I don't really play 'em but there's something about being on a golf course early in the morning ... you may not like it\nBut the smell of cigars early in the morning on a golf course baby I'm telling you that is that's that says\nTime off that's ... that's his holidays so and that's exactly what's going on here but we're also going to talk of the during the course of this program and we're not going to take all of your time talking about uh the wonderful people with a cane foundation\nLook at pictures of our families and stuff and we see people that were probably you know ten years younger than we are now and they look like they're Twenty years older than we are now back then if you look back at pictures in the fifties and sixties even the seventies for that matter\nBut you you you now have a the community living centers where you have people that and I hate the word retired but people who have have taken that made a change going on a new path in their lives um so you have these these uh community living centers\nBut we used to call them all folks homes you you wouldn't dare say that now a because you find\nThat there is care and concern for the residents who live there\nAre so much so that you know you can have pets and you can have a ... that they have performers that come through radio show was that happened uh there's outdoor living space and this is I'm Talking about the king community living centers\nHit ... yards and and gardening and in books and newspaper magazines and subscriptions that the residents don't have to subscribe to but they have access\nTo a within the uh the center of cultural sporting events of museums and shows it take people to and what not so I I mean it really it really puts the residence in focus and at the center of the activities um that uh the the Cain living centers do\nThat sixty years of experience I mean they started out as a hospital and in you know back in those days back in Nineteen fifty eight\n... medals were hospitals and now it's changed into tearing and grows and and keeping people comfortable and happy for all their lives so I'm Glad that we're part of of this today and we're out here really to salute these men and women\nThat have put their energy into this kind of a company this kind of a situation that that not only obviously helps them and their bottom line but also helps\nResidents in our area so uh we'll be talking to bill on later on and and I'm also be talking a little bit of golf to them and ... run a golf course and I don't ... what are your cars but ah it it worked out OK and worked out fine\nIt's Columbus Day it's

wherever you are\nAnd you know in the balance of this in by the way when people um contribute a hundred percent of contributions to came a foundation goes that came out on Beijing\nYeah that that is correct the the board is a nonprofit organization the board are\nReally they're volunteers and we take advantage of a lot of volunteers yeah or provide services for the population and uh it helps us to to do are able to do for all of our as sure this is the\n... we're talking about the residents but this is the thirtieth annual directors golf tournament how many people are employed uh within the community center a bottle Evan hundred I'll employees ... you know and that that also says something for the community in terms of of jobs and people working\nYet um but when we move but we take care of by most of our residents yeah ah yeah it it it's a it's a large organization but we're happy to be able to do it for our uh our community\nAnd this seems like something that is not on the end of time but really gonna you're gonna probably more more and more we're going to see that\nMore than that that is correct that as we none of secular over the last several years we've we've known we've we've seen that the needs as I said the needs of changed and we we have special units that to care for the residents who have those special needs\nUm the interesting thing is it it must be I mean as you executive director you really have you have to juggle a lot of a place in the air because as you mentioned you have the recreation but you also have the education and you also have the medical facilities to to deal with\nA whole wide range I mean it really is a community it's like a little city we need to all of our senators\nAnd it it is um and there are four senators by four senators all work together and ah [noise] what they do is that they care for the residents they care for the whole whereas in not just the medical needs but\nJust the medical needs but all the needs the social the ah ah keeping them or keeping the reds and so they live their life to the fullest and a and R throughout their their life or do what\nYou went there and in in the center is if we were talking about I mentioned it at the outset of the show the Glenn hazel in Ross township setters which offer senior living and you've got the uh McKee's port and Scott township properties as well are there plans for um for\nMore [laughter] before centers we've ... there were probably always before centers that are no plans for more centers but within each center the plants they're constantly changing is the type of services we provide within the centers where\nIs it all started from a hospital in Nineteen fifty eight and start from a large hospital in Nineteen fifty eight to ... well\nIt it you know ... and no one in those days I was saying earlier when you look at pictures from people in the fifties um our grandparents you know you look at them and they look ten twelve years older than we are now and yet they were probably ten or twelve years younger than we are\nNow when you when you look at the pictures from back then that's that's what you notice a lot of changes over the years a lot of changes in the demographics of the folks who served in the ... type of services we\nProvide well and you know ... every study you see now we we talk about a country that's divided in politics and all this you know all that and of course this is talk radio so we're constantly going back and forth with people but they say one of those things that really keeps people young and energized and involved\nIs community is it is a social life and not Facebook and Twitter and all those kinds of things but face to face conversations that people are able to have and I I think that's one of the things that's important about the ... community centers is that\nYou have people you you have places where people can get together and talk and argue or just go on and on and on and and that makes a difference just holistically in their health\nIs the one thing that I noticed the times I have I been executive director is that when you go in the age of our facilities there is a sense of family ah the residents become family members to the staff members and vice versa and\nUh it really shows in the in the in the centers and in the care that you provide because that does I said that's a big part of what\nWe
