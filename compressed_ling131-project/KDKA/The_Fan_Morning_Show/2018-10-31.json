Seventy four nine three for the for for six seven to four nine three for\nIncredibly appropriate time to have you on because I think a lot of us are dealing with this throughout the community or the magnitude of what happened the tree of life and our children are seeing this they're hearing about it they're talking about it in schools among friends\nSo where do you start to try and put this in perspective and help your child through it\nYou know it's understandable that everybody has a reaction to this ah everybody's impacted by it probably across the world certainly across our country and particularly here in Pittsburgh um people will be talking about it and I think the most important thing is to talk about it\nUh we have all kinds of emotional reactions to this frustration and the fear anger\nUm and uh the best way I Know to to to deal with those kinds of things to talk about it but people that you care about if you're an adult talk about it with your friends um but if you're a parent you may need to talk about it with your kids because they're going to have some of the same reaction do you do\nAnd as a father of nine children or what did you say to your kids\nKnow I actually went with one of my kids\nBut when we first moved to Pittsburg and uh I reminded him of a a you know his exposure there what this community has been a it's such a wonderful neighborhoods such a close knit neighborhood and I wanted to show them that it was still a safe place to a good place to be a wonderful neighborhood been\nCan apparent run the risk of over answering questions or when a child asked for instance why would somebody walk into a church and shoot people\nYeah I think you have to be careful with that I think the first thing you want to do is ask what are your child already knows about the situation\nUm listen for a what they're saying listen to what they're saying and if they've gotten misinformation or they've got some sort of misconception or some other underlying fear you want to sort of addressed that you know the answer kids or with the question that they have\nAnd stop there and see what their next question might be a I think a lotta times when we're anxious stressed we want to sort of talk a lot and again that's appropriate for adults to do but amongst themselves and with your kids you're going to have to approach them from where they're coming from and what their understanding is the situation\nMore with Dr Gary ... child and adolescent psychiatrist in Allegheny health network DACA uh outside of this obvious or the magnitude of this horrific incidents put on a daily basis the news is pretty hard to swallow for adults let alone kids yet it's\nSo much more difficult in this day and age with technology and social media to\nInsulate your kids from what they are exposed to\nIt is you know the kids in school hill that teenagers were well aware of what was going on they were getting together on social media um and they were able to organize a vigil very quickly so that they were ahead of the adults in terms of being able to get something I'm going\n... I think you do want to limit or electronic and media exposure for kids especially young kids\nUm you need to make sure that if you're watching the news it's a and your kids are around you have to sort of make a decision about whether it's appropriate for them to hear that or not I think in most situations are for younger kids in particular they don't need to hear that news\nUm that's the sort of thing that it's uh not appropriate for them but teenagers they're going to hear about that sort of stuff for sure\nAnd you want to going to be available to talk about it with them we get stressed watching the news and we also need to be able to turn it off at times a week and role model for our kids that we don't have to be stuck on our electronic media sucking in all the news and [noise] and ah trying to process that we maintain some time to take a breather\nYou know dark this has affected a lot of people very deeply and it's a motion for our community but if you're a parent of a teenager and you are emotionally involved in this and caught by the magnitude in the tragedy\nAnd then you see your teenager whose flip about it or not really reacting I think there could be a tendency to go don't you understand what's going on and I have a feeling that's probably not what you should do\nEverybody react to these things differently some people keep their feelings in some people's sort of want to flip it off and end to the extent that somebody's wanting to try and feel safe that may be that way of sort of dealing with that um is it a healthy coping mechanism we use humor a lot to sort of deal with difficult situations\nUm and that's\nYou know criticizing somebody for a particular coping strategy isn't necessarily the best way to go about it they're dealing everybody's doing the best they can to try and deal with this sort of thing um and I think that if we think hey you should be much more upset about this you should be angry you should be sad you should be scared\nThing um and I think that if we think hey you should be much more upset about this you should be angry you should be sad you should be scared that's not what we're trying to do as an adult we're trying to model for our kids how we deal with our emotions appropriately and everybody has different kinds of feelings and those those kind of\nA feelings may not come out immediately may take days or weeks before somebody is able to acknowledge that\nAt what point should parents seek professional help for their kids\nYou know where a lot of times when there's been a trauma or some sort of disaster like this\nUm people do have several weeks where they have to process it and I encourage folks to do that again within the context of their family their friends their close a loved one because that's how most of us cope with things and most of us will get through without any kinds of problems\nUh our community is going to be very resilient I'm sure each individual child and adult a has a great deal of ability to to cope with these kinds of things\nAnd we want them to use the the coping strategies the work best for them if it's been a month two months and they're still experiencing a anxiety psychological symptoms or those kinds of problems\nThen I think it may be time to sort of talk with a profession\nDr Gary Swanson Allegheny health network child and adolescent psychiatrist for one two

the story in the post Gazette is saying today good morning\nOr good morning\nYou are you you mentioned uh at at the council meeting yesterday that Pittsburgh is going to be where the new star search for Pittsburgh to take a stand in for us to show the rest of the country perhaps uh how was that received in um where are you this morning on this\nUh I'm so same way you know or or obviously very emotional and our community we had another peaceful walk a last night were so attending a funerals throughout the day is and um [noise]\nYou know I think it's time I mean the the way fans have occurred all across our country for a decade plots now and um you know I think it's time we and we're not going to rush into a rash decision tomorrow\nI'm but we're going to have meetings collectively between the council\nA neighborhood groups I'm meeting with all her life there and saw this afternoon ceasefire PA and obviously the mayor's office has been talking about issues like this as well and I just think\nYou know now's the time for us to take a lead and we can't do it alone um you know the federal anti war we're not going to see any support so I think what we need to do is call and other cities across this country to do the same thing at the same time\nAs you said now it's time for Pittsburgh or take a stand partner with other cities and pursue legislation that address is\nPowerful firearms like the A R Fifteen fired inside the tree of life plus the three blocks that he also had a in his possession or our our ... this is the opening discussion on this is this is this how how it's beginning with you and and everybody involved [laughter]\n[noise] uh this this is not going to be anything that's thrown out next week just to do it right uh you know we want to make sure it makes sense and that it makes sense across the country because if we're going to ask leaders from other cities to do something\nWe want to make sure it's right and you know we we try as a local municipality to do ordinance there's like this and we always end up in court\nAnd you know we know we're going to end up in court um but you know the the issue that we're going to say is you know if you're going to take off the court take if the two hundred to two hundred cities across this country who want to stand up this violence like this take them to court and now we're all fighting it because\nYou need some common sense here and I even think\nGun owners will tell you the same thing\nCouncilman Corey O'Connor is with us a\nLook and not necessarily looking for a fight but I think you know there's going to be a fight and um you're walking into this with both eyes open a ... of course you being so close to the tragedy that occurred on Saturday\nHow is the neighborhood I'm doing as of this morning a few days later now\nYeah I mean it it's going to be a long process for all of us here I\nYou know it it shows how close knit community is uh how close knit the city of Pittsburgh is

you know we're we're meeting with with almost anybody and everybody can I we're starting with the students um but if people have different ideas that they want us to look at you could obviously contact her office or should have a couple of emails were out in the streets all the time so you know these emails\nThat are saying well how 'bout that angle I mean\nNot that it's a grassroots

welcome decay decay what's up how are ya\nIce done any hey hey I I Am a comment a it got to start with kids you got to tell your children if hearing around people that have this much hey\nYou know you're hanging around the wrong people I was told once you are who you hang around so we have to tell our kids out and make sure they thoroughly understand it and the other thing is\nWhen you hear some of these terrible hate crimes\nIt's not always the case but you hear the person that it had a criminal background and some of the things that they tell you you wonder why they're not presenting longer or you know things like we get people out of prison for some pretty bad crimes too quick\nPlus you know people that have mental problems ... you hear all these mental hospitals are closing and I just think that all contributes to it so I'd like your thoughts\nI appreciate your and you you make a good point and you know it's it's all been said before thanks for your call Bob I appreciate it um it's been said before that you know people that term and people fall through the cracks\nUm we used to have more facilities that were more able to help people and you know economics and time being time that that has kind of unfortunately changed and in perhaps that this is the time to get back to that\nThe time being time that that has kind of unfortunately changed and in perhaps that this is the time to get back to that and I wanted to go back to that last call from a Bob in Florida\nWhere he was saying a ... he was berating um the ah ah as a mayor or built into it on our governor\nUm ... they said they were not going to be there and I thought ... very clearly stated what his choice was and I understand the president's choice to come here\nThat was fine but I think by them not meeting with him it made it less of a political stand and more of the president wanted to come with members of his family and pay his respects and so he did that\nAnd so I I don't think that they needed to all stand on a day us together and and and uh and and do what you would think would be kind of a political showing\nSo and you we heard from people in this city of that is divided on those feelings and that that ... by that I don't mean that we are a city that is divided like the north and those kind of a thing it's like some people feel\nThat the mayor had a a a writer and did the right thing by doing that others feel otherwise some people didn't like the fact that the president was coming here to town other people thought it was great that he came to town so let me let it be that's that's what happened Tony is in a Jeanette and let me get him a pardon me for the\nDelay here uh Tony welcome to Katie K what's up my friend or\nGood morning like everybody else does it talk about what what's going on and what I've seen I've noticed grocery stores gas and things like that today\nTony Tony Tony ... I'm going to ask you to call back ... when you're cutting in and out and I I really want to hear what you have to say but it's impossible to understand so just hang up and call back and it will get you back on I'm going to move to a gym in the north hills Tim ... thanks welcome to Katie\nKay how're you study how are you today I'm fine what's up uh\nI just wanted to say this listen okay Pittsburgh had an excellent opportunity to set an example for the for for for the whole uh United States of America or in the world watching they had the chance to act like a class act and do things differently than all these other cities do\nAnd they failed in what way wow in what way is because of all the protesters showed up it was about a funeral wasn't about protesting that's two separate things that should have been two separate things\nAnd that lady that was that they keep showing telling the national news it's embarrassing this lady that stand on a sidewalk yelling and screaming we don't want your hair gone\nI mean that's trash it really is\nWell that is when that happened um and there again there are people that have very strong feelings about his hand and those and those people did have a right to protest it ... there was a vigil you know Saturday Night\nThere was this yesterday and and I it came with a lot of warning and that there were you you heard so many people saying they did not want the president to come here I I say he wanted to come here he came and I thought he ... he did what was necessary\nTo do what I think he did what he wanted to do and so that's fine I don't have a gripe with that uh some people did in and got out on the street and said you know I we don't want you here and you know it was all within earshot of the president so surely he heard that yes but I don't I don't think the Pittsburgh representative so poorly\nIn that I think we showed this is a very engaged\nAnd emotional city at a very emotional horrifying time in the city\nAnd I think we showed me this is a very engaged and emotional city at a very emotional horrifying time in the city\nWell if anybody wants to point fingers and yesterday is my opinion was a bad showing I blamed built around and I'll tell you why he insights anger and dissension in this city\nBill ... absolutely in one way\nHe's the one who said for the president not to come yes as soon as he said that everybody started a uh making signs and and and planning a protest I mean of course there would have still been people there but\nThe data showed of supported the president and he didn't have to be there with him shoulder to shoulder I don't care about that\nBut he's the one who he gets up and he talks about having a unity in in in setting examples in that and and getting along together and working together but he is the one who sets people off and he hates\nThe president he hates it the president or the Republican Party\nHas I don't I I don't I don't know that I mean that's your opinion I don't think he hates the president and he did say why don't you come next week and also as the mayor he's got to look at a city that in an area of the city that was torn apart on Saturday morning\nAnd so he's he said these are funerals going on there are things that we need to take care of in our city so I don't think he shoved him off and said you know way in hell that I'm going to show up with you Mr President\nHe said could you please come next week and of course that couldn't be arranged so so that's where it stood ... excuse me I got to go to traffic right now but thanks for your call man and thanks for your opinions I appreciate that we got a call waiting it will get to you right after the traffic Tripoli traffic on the ... let's get to it right now it kept
