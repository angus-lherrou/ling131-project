defend something like that when it happens the way it did\nBut the great thing is because of the brave and then some of these officers who went in as you heard chief Schubert say just moments ago with

where we all know celebrity ties the criminal afterwards we don't educate them properly or quickly enough and we\nPay your lawyers and then deal on it goes on for years and years and it's been forgotten\nWe so divided our society with all of the ... on a case of personality that we allow people to have these trips on their shoulders to be offended by everything in life\nAnd and then they react to them and the most violent ways\nAnd when they do we find excuses for the action and then we have these lawyers defending them for years and years\nWhere we have to stop it I don't care if they're not ... alcoholic drug addicts or whatever when they get to the stage\nPunish them yet but yet the trial is over with quickly and and do it must be done and when district attorneys\nA Donald Trump supporter has just saw a little southern go out and walk Blitzer all day everybody was interviewing that's the only question good out do we know these are all if you support for\nWell turn turns out that he doesn't so they were wrong\nYou know but it's just disgusting as you mentioned about today is not there to be political no shirt it certainly wasn't Arabs who was going on\nBeing political and something needs to be done as you guys have been working in the media thoughtful seeing that Scott sticking ...\nMm well I think everybody needs to step back and take a hard look at what really happened here\nAnd other hate crime in a world full of hate and sadly many of these people are neighbors and they live in this country so how do we stop it we are more people in places where people are seeking sanctuary or at their weakest and\nWe start dishing out in our court of law severe punishment for committing these heinous crime it's that simple\nThat's ... that's what we have to do thank you for the call let's go to the gym or who's calling today from the south hills Jim welcome to Katie gay radio\nGreat talk or Rob um I agree with Bill ... um the police hauled out in the car root causes and I'm cruise you I'd be seems to be your ... you get one trial one time that you ah get to appeal it you may every year or two and then you're executing I mean I can name\nOne trial one time that you ah get to appeal it every year or two and then you're executed I mean I can name three names that it\nIt it's simple you write three names and overall no Charles Manson how long did he live out in California too he dies Michael ... and how about your bag with Alaska Nineteen eighty\nStill going to still going yeah no\nNo I mean they're getting cable TV and we're subsidizing them you know I'm not saying if they shouldn't have a ... a pill fine but once you're on one appeal\nIt used to be down in Texas until about ... or early to thousands maybe three or two or three\nThat you there about three or four years into what they were they were executed [noise] they were [noise] um it [laughter] that's how it was in in the Old West if you remember do you watch it on Washington's they will go to church and want to go to hanging out\nWell listen it's Iraq I mean I'm not sure well oh God I mean don't I don't know no no no no no\nNo you're fine but this is ... believe me this stuff doesn't happen in the middle east\nIt doesn't I mean you they they they they they they take care of it I mean I I just I mean the goal I mean if someone who does this gets arrested after being wounded climbs out and surrenders first off many places they wouldn't have a chance to there would be no surrender\nAnd then once again and I should make remarks I mean come on my means enough enough\nAll right I think it's going to be our last call let's go to Marie and penny hills and for those of you that we didn't get to a I'm sure you're going to have an opportunity to later date and\nWe'll be able to look at this in a broader sense for today is just focusing on the heart of the matter let's go to Marie Marie how you doing what can we can get radio\nGood and it's always glad I'm always glad to talk to you I'm I'm my heart goes out to everybody in the squirrel hilly area I\nWithin member of Jaycee said for many years and it was such a great experience the people were very loving and yesterday I listen to Samantha vinegar at a ... political commentator who serves as a national security analyst for CNN [noise]\nAnd she said she thought that something very very important you said you know one of the first step and I I Will have to say one thing about her is Samantha venting grad both of her parents are Jewish and her father was a Holocaust survivor\nAnd she said the social media when they see the ... they need to report this can replace the owners of these social media companies they need to set these people down report it to the place and other people who are paying\nThe information they need to report it in something needs to be done but this guy was on and on and nothing gets done\nNothing gets done and and you're right but here's the thing Maria think about social media and how many millions of people are interacting all of the time you think that there's even a possibility to be able to police all of this stuff\n[noise] I think more needs to be done I think they need to shut the people down at least shut them down and you know and that information to the police and they could decide what needs to be investigated and what not to be investigated\nWell you know ... well ... ... and I'm going to take it to to another level and I mean I Know people have said many times there's too much government but maybe we need to\nYou know ... well ... ... and I'm going to take it to to another level and I mean I Know people have said many times there's too much government but maybe we need to create another task force altogether I mean one of the reasons why the FBI was created for so many years so many years ago was because of what we were dealing with\nAs far as a crime across the country during prohibition and even you know when you look at the CIA and the secret service and all of these major government law enforcement agencies um the ATF all of them may have been brought forth for particular reasons but I think now we're in a situation where there's so much hate in our country in so many of these crimes being committed\nThat it really has opened a completely new avenue for us to discuss and is there enough people able to keep an eye on what is happening with all of this hate and as you mentioned all of the hate messages that are being put out there every day we need to take a closer look at it\nI think that what having a half for it like it I think that that's what my idea well they could go through all this and identify\nPossible shooter like this guy he Corning that math and then a grant for weeks and she said that he felt that there needs to be more\nPeople looking at what you're doing it and possibly think stop them before something like that happened\nHow much more though Maria are we going to have to witness before somebody gets it\nI mean how much more I mean do you understand it's getting to the point now where this stuff like that I mean the set last Seventy two hours alone\nShould be more than enough for you to understand that I mean that the time for like pushing the panic button this come and gone I mean it's reaction time and and ... and I think this is another reason why and not political but for the guy who we have an office I Believe\nHe will do things a whole lot quicker and make a Boulder statement than many in the past so maybe this just will be the catalyst that will give him an opportunity\nTo do something that can change the face of these hate crimes and and I think that if we start doing something now at least maybe our children and grandchildren are going to have a chance but if we don't do something soon then they're not going to be a chance for anybody to do anything because society in the world as we know it will completely be\n... ... a center right it it will be gone forever I mean we've lost so much of our core values in our beliefs and\nFaith I mean just take a look at the headlines over the last year I mean I I don't know how people are going to be able to gather again in a place of worship and feel the same way not only if they are safe but what they're praying two and four\nAnd and and can prayers really help and is there some solitude to be found by even going there and what's good will eventually happen more and more people are going to start living a cocoon lifestyle to they're not going to be going out and not doing things to where they socialize your interact with people because of the fear factor and especially people\nSuch as people of the Jewish faith and sadly we that are not Jews should have handled this a long time ago but now as a country I think we all need to handle this because we're all being affected by it and yesterday was a good example Melinda wrote her next to the news\nYou think excellence and senior

to jump up and help them and just small things like that that show that they do have this level of respect to share with everyone\nNow is in a just a little history or to our listeners this morning about north like Catholic assumption academy began as thinks they're old Alexander school back in Nineteen thirty ... that you were there a new school building was constructed in Nineteen sixty seven this is all before I was even born [laughter]\nTony eleven I think ... the school merged with cardinal right regional school and it was raining or psych Catholic\nAnd you arrive two years later back in twenty Thirteen\nHow do you help bring the school's together because you saw cardinal rights and the north side I think ... come together and now nor psychopathic an assumption have come together how how can you look at this is a good positive model\nI'm so when I first came to North side Catholic school I think there was still a lot of um [noise] I don't know disparity are not disparities not the right word but there's a difference between how the merger was going and how this merger seems to be going um\nIt still seemed like a merger and that was two years later that I was coming into onto the scene so with this merger I've really\nTried to make everyone feel more welcome I'm\nFrom the sign on the front of the building making sure that that was changed before the kids ever got there on August twenty seventh grade I I'm Down to having you know that half of the faculty coming from assumption and half from North ...

for many years and um I Know the show is about gardening and it will never be about politics and we will never allow that to come into this show but um as we know gardens or a place of peace and their place of nurturing for many people\nAnd um I Know that certainly the case for me and so I Will be spending some time in my garden today to recollect my thoughts and um\nAnd and think about the city and you know yesterday as everything was unfolding I could not help but think about Fred Rogers Mr Rogers I grew up on Mr Rogers I watched him\nEvery day and uh you know scroll hill was his neighborhood and that was where he lived for many years and I kept thinking what would he think you know his big phrased was find the helpers and in a time like this you find the helpers but what I Would like to import to all of our listeners today is\nDon't just find that help has to be a helper and reach out to somebody who is different than you whether it's physically or spiritually or who they choose to love\nA reach out to them and be a friend to them and be a helper to them in in whatever way that you can and so today to all of our callers I Would like to\nWelcome you as always to call in with your garden questions because I'm here for you to answer anything\nAbout gardening as usual but I don't want to hear from you about a time when your garden or a garden helped you to heal from something whether it was um physically or mentally or you lost somebody you love and and you turn to your garden is sort of\nA part of therapy for all that because I think when you're a gardener you really do look to your garden for ...\nYou love and and you turn to your garden as sort of a part of therapy for all of that because I think when you're a gardener you really do look to your garden for peace and as a place to nurture yourself and nurture other living things and so I Would love to hear\nFrom our listeners about a time when you're a garden really helped you to heal and helped you to get over something because I think a a garden is a good place to be on a day like today and so I Would invite you to do that and yes Rob is right there is lots to be done still in the garden despite all of this\nDreary weather that we've been having here in Pittsburgh um but the good thing that all of this rain has done it it is it has made the soil nice and soft and very workable and as Doug and I have told you for many years fall is an excellent time for planting\nWhether it's ... or trees or shrubs and certainly spring blooming bulbs assist the time to do it\nNow this ground is nice and soft because of all this rain that we have had and it is an ex excellent time for planting and in addition to all of that obviously a lot of our nurseries local I'm independent family owned nurseries you know they don't have a place necessarily to over winter a lot of nursery stock and so\nThey put their plants on sale this time of year and so you can get a really great deals on plants and\nUm you know I have some gardens that I used to take care of and the whole community for many years I had a a garden maintenance company for ten plus years\nThe number is easy to remember one eighty Ninety eight twins that's eight eight eight Ninety eight twins sugar robe itch gender robot should Bush when they got your back not your wallet eight eighty Ninety eight twins\nAnd if your

casino for black and gold ... market black and go on the show so ... is on the mind of Jessica will show\nThere's so much on the mind um again I invite you to call with your gardening questions also with stories of how your garden that's helped you kill 'em and has really been a a a place for you uh to to sort of let some things out right physically mentally or or whatever reason but\nHere's the other thing the other reason why I garden and it's not just for me and and the joy that I get out of it but it's also for all the wild creatures that call my garden home and years ago when I first started teaching about gardening it at the time it was it the Pittsburgh civic garden center it's now a part of steps conservatory\nAt but when I started teaching that we we were teaching this class about putting the garden too bad for the winter right and I would teach that everything had to be cut down and all the leaves had to be re dad and we had to pretty much treat our guard and like it was our living room right we had to put it make it up clean and pristine and and for years that's how the fall garden cleanup was treated\nBut now we have all of this research and um some of it is pretty jaw dropping\nAbout how uh connected our gardens are to nature over all and with the loss of habitat that many insects like er butterflies in her native bees and uh and fireflies with this habitat loss and pesticide exposure that they're suffering from\nUm our gardens really become a that\nHabitat that's been lost so collectively all of our guard make a huge difference to these creatures and so\nWe now teach people to not do that type of fall clean up because these creatures over winter in the leaf litter they over winter in dead stems and in garden debris so in your flower beds and you were a perennial gardens instead of cutting it all down and raking it all up and cleaning everything out\nLet's leave it go let it go at all winter let it stand and do you clean up in the spring and a ... society which is society for conservation of invertebrates\nUm they recommend that you wait until the temperatures in the spring turning into the fifties a fifty five and then you do your spring garden clean up and that is what I have started doing in the past five six seven years\nAnd it's made a huge difference because well people might not um you know think about these little creatures that are over wintering in our gardens they are and probably the one I think that\nGets people the most interested in not cleaning up their gardens in the fall\nThink about these little creatures that are over wintering in our gardens they are and probably the one I think that\nGets people the most interested in not cleaning up their gardens in the fall is the butterfly because everybody loves butterflies what's not to love about butterflies but did you know that as we give so much attention to the monarchs and them migrating down to Mexico to over winter well we do that\nThere are the rest of the species almost all the rest of the species of butterflies here in Pennsylvania that actually spend winters in our gardens\nSo butterflies like the morning cloak and the comma and ... they actually over winter as adults um they over winter in leaf litter or in the fissures of rocks or tree bark\n'em and they need a place in our gardens are there are some that over winter is a chrysalis which would be like the ... family so those beautiful black swallow tales or tiger swallow tells that you see flooding around your garden in the summertime they over winter is a chrysalis it's hanging from a dead plants them\nUh and and if you cut your guard down you could very well be removing those ... as well so leave those stand and then there's other butterflies like the red spotted purple and the ... that are actually are caterpillars through the winter and they rolled themselves into a fallen leaf\nOr they um talk themselves down into the seed pod of one of their host plants\nAnd they spend the winter in our gardens as a caterpillar and again when you cut down all of your gardens and clean them up and make them clean and pristine you're removing habitat um for those butterflies and so I sort of employer everybody to just stop doing a big fall clean up in the garden and then said\nLet nature be and let it have a place in the landscape a lot of people are relieved to hear this because they think\nAnd you know fall such a busy time to begin with and it's nice and I you know be nice to be told that it is you're doing a good thing by being quote unquote a lazy Gardner and letting your guard and stand through the winter um ... it's a really good practice\nOther parts of the country for just a moment if we can you know the full for sharing your research and bring it up and works its way down\nIf you're in a place where the weather is harsh or you know we're really been kind of spoiled here in my lifetime especially the shuttered after my life for the weather stays a whole lot more when you can blame it on a number of things but\nThere's cold weather crops and things that you can do for landscaping and even things you know in your garden that will survive a frost if you live somewhere in front of the New England can you actually target your gardening for the weather that you live with on a day to\nHundred percent and that goes um surprisingly true for winter as well um my good friend and business partner Nikki Giovanni lives in Halifax Nova Scotia um and uh another business probably lives in Toronto, Ontario and they're both year round a vegetable gardens in fact Nikki wrote a book called the year round vegetable gardener\nAnd she talks about the ways that you can extend the season to uh allow yourself to have fresh produce to to harvest all winter long and up she shares a lot with her neighbors and with her her family members as well and she grows and cold frames and ah they just put up a high tunnel which is sort of like a [noise]\nA a half circle a greenhouse it's covered in plastic but it's not heated\nAnd so she grows a lot of coal tolerant crops there's a lot of greens especially that are extremely tolerant of frost and of cold temperatures and even here in Pittsburgh with the cold frame you could be growing those cold tolerant greens\nPretty much all winter long I declared the snow off the top of the cold frames to make your harvest but you certainly can do that\nYou know there's there's also a lot of root crops that can be stored in the ground through the winter so if you grew carrots or beets in your garden or you can harvest those all winter long turnips are wonderful winter hardy route as well and what I encourage people to do with it\nYou grew carrots or beets in your garden or you can harvest those all winter long turnips are wonderful winter hardy ... as well and what I encourage people to do is if you haven't dug all your carrots up out of your vegetable garden\nPut about five six inches of straw or shredded leaves on top of that planting bats that to insulate those roots\nAnd keep them from freezing solid and then you can go out on your you know Christmas Day go out to the garden and clear that mulch aside and wholesome cats out for your Christmas dinner so it's it's surprisingly easy to um you know with just a little bit of effort to have a year round harvest\nObviously it's harder and it almost impossible to things like tomatoes and peppers and eggplant that are really warm season crops\nThat are not frost tolerant at all or those you would have to have a a heated greenhouse or you know be able to dig you and I know people that do this they dig that pepper plants up and put them in a pot\nAnd rather than indoors I have a little girl light set up for them and they will you know pretty peppers and they're actually true perennials in climate that don't get frost so you can sort of grab them as a house plant as well\nOr what we're going to do are going to take a short break

well you're\nVery very excellent question and I'm so glad that you ask it uh for those who are just joining the program before the news break I was talking about how uh our new recommendation in the past ah five or six years has really been to leave your garden stand through the winter instead of cutting in cleaning everything out um especially in perennial gardens\nA it's really important to do that for habitat for wildlife and so the question about the grass is always leave grasses stand if you have ornamental grass as\nThey always stand through the winter um and I've always recommended that of the very beginning of my career and horticulture\nAnd and they're excellent outside a lot of winter interested a garden out the wrists foliage as a whole other can of worms and here's what\nI was just one of the only plant perennials that I Do recommend that you clean up in the fall and this is because the Irish bore which is I'm a moderate loses egg on the iris foliage and then it turns into the scrub lake creature that tunnels\nAnd this is because the iris bore which is I'm a moderate lays its eggs on the iris foliage and then it turns into the scribe like creature that tunnels out the roots and really can be quite destructive that the eggs actually over winter on that foliage\nSo what you want to do is do you cut down and clean up and get rid of your German bearded iris foliage and it will greatly reduce your um you know tendency to develop Irish sport so that is one plant that you do want to clean up in the fall\nOr number to do to be able to program matrix external
