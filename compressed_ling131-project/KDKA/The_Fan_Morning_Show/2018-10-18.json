Pennsylvania can achieve greater downstream opportunity through now having some of the most affordable energy resources on the planet of study called forge the future\nThat the charts a path of how our reaching can develop sixty billion dollars of new GDP Growth over the next ten years with the right policies in place here in the commonwealth\nSo gained a lot of people you know translates this into very simple things is is it's saving me money on me energy bill and then far they're gonna be additional jobs I'm I Know many have been created a what's the future looked like for the region fund that front\nYeah absolutely where it's a great question first of all as as a benefit consumers in our region\nHugely ever think about back in two thousand eight the prices natural gas in our region today or Seventy percent less than what they were ten years ago I Can't think of too many products that you go to the store and buy today that it's that Seventy percent less than it was ten years ago but that's exactly what's happened in natural gas pricey\nHere in Pennsylvania as a result net gas is now being used in power generation a power generation you know historically has been a pretty significant contributor to\nAh to air pollution and as a result of using natural gas in our in our combustion we now I've read\nAbout twenty five year low and carbon dioxide emissions reductions and sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide particular missions are areas now cleaner than that it's ever been\nA you know it this has been a huge winter for consumers and on the job front\nI just talked about that sixty billion dollars of GDP Growth that we've gotten our region that study also as we can land in another another hundred thousand new jobs in our region if we're if we play the cards correctly here in the commonwealth to encourage development used by natural gas\nWas talking about the the plant because I think a lot of people look at the plant that's being built along the Ohio River and say okay now that's going to be a great job opportunity is actually an ongoing job opportunity right\nJohn it's pretty incredible I think I'd like to share before we were on the air here that I was out there the other day there's thirty one act of cranes on one side I guess I don't remember a time in Pittsburgh history where we've had thirty one cranes on one single site\nThere's six thousand jobs it's going to be about six billion dollar investment over the next five years\nOr the great part of that is that we're developing the feedstocks there for plastics manufacturing you know we've spent the last four decades talking about you know reductions on the steel manufacturing side while I think for the next three decades we're going to be talking about new job growth\nFor decades talking about you know reductions on the steel manufacturing side while I think for the next three decades we're going to be talking about new job growth\nIn plastics manufacturing take at thing one of the products being produced in western Pennsylvania and under pressured area of the shale it delivers liquid hydrocarbons like eh thing panting butane ice a butane propane\nThe eh thing pieces one that they'll steam I and I think to produce ethylene then secondarily heard it from apple link produced polyethylene plastic pellets that can be used for everything from planes decoding to see on the tires\nThe wind deciding and the vinyl plastics that we see every day that low density possibly for like the plastic the coverage or close when you pick it up from the laundry or\nThe high density plastics things like milk jugs and and the rigid plastics\nYou senior cars and things but its plastics touched our lives and so many ways we're now going to have the first the first ever plant north of the Gulf Coast in our region so that's a real significant winter and I think it's going to generate new downstream manufacturing jobs in class where\nWith Dave Spiegelman or president the Marcellus Shale coalition getting ready for shelling site two thousand Eighteen state a lot of people want to make sure whatever we're doing we're doing it safely and environmentally a according to the laws are how is that being addressed\nThat's a great point we've got the the new acting administrator of the EPA there I mean he made it very clear to us as focus is to cleaner air and clean our water and encourage technical innovation\nI think he is seen some of the technical innovation being used here in Pennsylvania was barely impressed on the work that we're doing we're very much like focus I mean we all live here I grew up in central Pennsylvania been here my whole life we'd like we'd like to hike in bike and hunt and fish camping\nDo all the things that other Pennsylvania it's like to do we want to make sure gets done correctly we've fought for\nRobust rules to make sure we have a high bar for development in Pennsylvania I think we're all like minded on that we have a technology showcase at this conference or to me very much focused to probably over eighty different ah\nAh companies displaying at our at our conference again in a lot of its technical innovation environmental enhancement or\nOpportunities and one thing that's really cool was one of our operators donated their exhibit space\nTo the flight Ninety three memorial so hopefully folks in our industry can help us raise additional money\nTo support the work that's going on with the ... our voices and the and the investments that have been made over shanks do we think that's a great way to to show our support

morning gentlemen\nGood morning Larry you know I talked about is the I made before PC amazed the professor convention management association and they are an important convention for us coming this January in that there'll be bringing in about forty five hundred\nIndustry leaders many of whom can actually purchase conventions from Pittsburgh in the future so we're bringing in a convention full of our customers so it's a great opportunity for us in Pittsburgh too so we have for future conventions\nWelcome to Pittsburgh sheriffs heard a lot of good things about you a\nThank you Larry of great to be in Pittsburgh and it's great to be on with you this morning just quickly I Do like Pittsburgh are we at peace here may have a choice we could have been anywhere in North America with our conference and we chose Pittsburgh and that speaks volume of this amazing city\nWe certainly appreciate that Pittsburgh is a city that shines no matter what time of the year by maybe a little biased\nThough I'm sure you are biased but lifting Pittsburgh or have a lot to be proud of not just in sports I mean you all know the super bowl and you know but uh hockey this city has undergone such tremendous transformation\nAnd I think that Craig and his opening remarks pointed to who we are we consider ourselves the super bowl of the business of events industry and so we're still aligned with the city with a great tradition\nBut also what transformation is happening here is what's happening in the ... the things that business event\nDue to propel businesses and on social good in communities is exactly what Pittsburgh is all of a\nAnd let's start with that topic Cindy and Rob Portman bridge are beautiful little dachshund is scheduled to have a dental procedure to clean the tartar offered to eat because of her stinky breath our vet mentioned that some of the teeth may need to come out\nAnd that thought is making us hesitant to have the procedure performed are there any other options except removing the teeth we want to do the best we can for ...\nYeah I Love that question because actually very very common um event that ... that occurs in veterinary practice so they get this charter on their case which is\nYou know ... bacteria basically and we want to remove it because we don't want that bacteria getting into the bloodstream and causing kidney disease liver disease lung disease heart disease so it's very important to clean those teachers like in his own people\nHowever a lot of times when you remove that harder it's like holding or it's like cast material holding a an infected to them and when we remove that harder sometimes if you find that their teeth below them they're very loose also take X rays you can see that infection gets up into the world so\nWe always recommended removing those infected teeth now a net doesn't necessarily mean a lot of heat coming out but you don't want to leave about that would be bad advice so um they're not vain like we are so\nThey don't care if they were feeding and processed food uh but if you were really concerned about that there are a veterinary dentists um that we'll see if they can preserve\nThey don't care if they were feeding and processed food\nUm but if you were really concerned about that there are a veterinary dentists um that we'll see if they can preserve peace and it but most veterinarians can give you a really good advice on that because it's a very common procedure we do in our practice I Would follow your veterinarians advice on that one and I would remove the teeth of my own dog if they were in fact it\nYeah I worked with uh these two guys one of the insults was one called the other pond scum and the other was dog drool\n[laughter] nice you know\nYou know it's it's one of those things that I get Cindy in Rob's apprehension I Will tell people the same thing this is to use in Iraq if it and then when we remove tartar sometimes all the teeth are fine their sparkling underneath there\nSo we don't know until we go in there to take X rays and dogs will hold their mouth open and hold that you know X ray and the mouth while we take a picture so they have to be and that's\nThe time and they still eat\nFive yes they can eat fine because of processed foods [laughter] ... senior that is true story my dad caught up and said well bart had his remaining Fort teeth removed so now he has no ... he was sixteen years old\nAnd I said are you getting himself food now isn't that school and he said no he ... he always has but when I went home I had to see this bar and I were really good friends that I was younger\nAnd I went in there and sure enough he's still in the eldest food I don't think he ever to that\nBut it's uh it's okay if they chew\nIt obviously but you can soften it up a water or you can get themselves if they seem to be having trouble but most dogs have no problem with that whatsoever\nBy Lyndon Carlin Newcastle dear Dr my conscience in our Fifteen Fifteen year old cat\nHas been diagnosed with arthritis in Tibet thinks that is why she is having accidents outside the litter box he prescribed a drug free inflammation very difficult to give her because she hates being handled except on her terms\nYou have any tips are tricks to share\nWhat I I guess if we talk about arthritis and cat sometimes it can be hard to notice unless they're limping\nBut one of the signs and and the vet picked up on is that they have trouble jumping they they can't get into the places that they used to so even getting into the litter box can be difficult for some of these animals sometimes we recommend cutting out an opening for them to make it a lower step into the litter box something to think about but\nAs far as getting medication that cat um they have 'til pockets sometimes that helps\nSometimes you can crush it up and so you have to ask you if that if the wet food I'm not sure if that's what I'm if that's possible with that particular drug and then there's some natural things I Love um things like closer cornered ask Quinn which are glucose meter ... fate that wild cats a lot and\nOccasionally laser therapy helps him and sometimes we give them an injection of that helps out of a chronic called the attic one which we use for arthritis into nutrition nickel which means it's not going to cause any bad side effects and sometimes they'll give them great relief\nDoctor my men and Dolly and bridge bill want to know are twelve year old dog Lucy was diagnosed with a high calcium value two times in a row are men is concerned about cancer even though Lucy is active and happy\nWe understand that a blood test is performed in an outside lab to determine what type of cancer it might be our question is would you recommend that we follow through with that test at her age and her level of activity\nI guess that question is do we want to know information about the animal and I always do is about I always want to know because I feel then we can deal with the best we can give you the best advice so I Would say yes\nNow I understand if you don't want to find out something bad or there's no real blood test that tells you what type of cancer it is it just tells you if that calcium is perhaps coming from the parents will calcium comes from the pair thyroid gland there's four pair glands along the throat called the ... glands that help why you like calcium and phosphorous\nWell calcium comes from the pair thyroid gland as for paired lambs along with throw the pair of glasses ... phosphorus and sometimes it's just a little bit night sure of that gland that can be removing a chair that condition ... there's a lot of reasons for it I mean\nYou know kidney failure and cause you to go up any kind of diseases deteriorating bones could cause it to go up certainly cancers can cause it to go up and and other problems with say glands like a major glass or body cause that too but then sometimes heavy metal poisoning but\nI'm not I'm overly concerned about finding out because there's a lot we can do that if we know what it is\nWow next week I have to follow up on somebody you just said and that is that some people don't want to know what their parents what their pet has we gotta talk more about that will do it next week is where all the time this morning that's fascinating\nThat sounds great I'm told I told

I'm Talking about why don't\nYou know that here twenty thousand American by cancer are searching for their life ... can you believe that\nI mean people Merrill you guys and we have our we can help it's really really for all you have to deal with ... and then go to give their life narrow registry\nTell anyone can do it\nAnd they're wondering if your alarm donating a lot easier than wherever you are\nOr how ... got a gift of life dot\nOrg and get a free kick from here at home or find a donor drive in your area for the ... and ... it's only a minute it yet but it can get from one arm\nMy story long and short I when I was Twenty years old I was diagnosed with leukemia and there was no family history a kind of blindsided me and there is\nOh ... years went by and I had changed my major to social work that's when I found the cancer carrying center and later on as when I founded the young adult cancer support program under the cancer carrying center\nSo it is a program for Eighteen that thirty nine years old or young adult cancer survivors any type of cancer during and after treatment there welcome to join the group um and it is for anyone to western Pennsylvania really has been diagnose\nWhat was in your own experience when you say there was no support and obviously you have no pride to fill that void ... what is it that was missing but you really could have used that you are now providing to people who come to your support groups you got a bunch of them going\nI Do thank you yeah I mean just peer support I mean you're in the hospital and you're on the treatment floor and you're by far the youngest patient on the floor there's just no one who can relate and when you're young adult when you're in your twenties and thirties\nYou're at a time in your life when you're just developing into an adult you're finding a job you're graduating from school some people are still in college you're trying to raise a family you're trying to build all this up into your next chapter in your life and then bam you're just hit with cancer\nAnd it just put a halt on life so there's really you know you talked about someone in middle aged or even adolescent they can't relate to that yeah and so you're stuck in your life and you're seeing all your peers develop and and how the families and get these awesome careers and just when you're ready to do that\nYou have a diagnosis and I had to take a year off from from college for a year\nSo just coming back and having chemo brain you know that's hard to take notes in college when I had physics and organic chemistry at the time I wanted to be a pharmacist before a diagnosis so it's just the whole world of issues um that we face as young adults that really no other age population can relate to and so for me I Would have loved to have\nThe support group to just sit around and talk with others who can relate you know talking about getting back into relationships and dating and even trying to fill that gap and as you with your loved one if you're married it's\nHard after coming after diagnosis has been made after treatment\nBut that's another part of your story that's very good you bet somebody who's really supportive he's pretty darn near and dear to your house [laughter] yes he is you're out of the power couple of hope in this city for young people\nI've been pretty lucky my husband and I had met him it was within the year of starting yeah acts\nAnd I had introduced it to him and he thought it was so dynamic of what I was doing and he just supported it from day one to the point of he found it inspiring and motivational to do some fitness events where he would also raise money for the cars\nYeah what was that during the we talked to a larger story or walk right you know he was doing pushups or like he's\nDone push up contests he in January we were in Australia and he wrote a bicycle for to for twenty four hour what it was yeah he rode two hundred and fifty miles any raised forty thousand dollars for the young adult cancer support program will and that\nKind of thing is so critical when you're doing something or is it isn't like somebody's sitting on the sidelines saying oh yeah that sounds like a great idea here's a bunch of money you're constantly having to feed the need\nYou have to because if the program itself finds a these patients who need it so you know the the three components of the program is the support group meetings\nAnd then once a month I take the group out I give them some hope by offering them some social activities so we've gone to pirate games have gone kayaking on the river is just in last month we did an overnight camper a trait up I Can't ...\nDuties so we've gone to pirate games have gone kayaking on the river's just in\nLast month we did an overnight camper a tree up but can't kind of ugly no fun so and then the third component which is so important is the financial assistance sure so we raised the money because these young adults they need financial assistance more than you can imagine when you say financial toxicity\nYou can imagine how much it impacts them because hey listen we don't have a four O. one K. to to fall back on or a lifetime savings that we've been working up\nTo and what about the wig out tonight of tequila ... going to go nuts is that what you mean by wig out\nSome do oh yeah they want to get out as a noun verb so\nUh it's a night from six to nine pm we are going to fill tequila cowboy with Halloween wigs so literally everyone who comes to the wig out whereas a Halloween leg some people go all out and were costumes and we welcome that of course too because once you put the weight on you feel like Marcel match or leg\nForty I'll go to John I just walked in looking one myself in a row tickets across the

... role in this\nWell ... has been a great partners so ah we for the month of October the cancer carrying center actually now partners with young women breast cancer awareness foundation\nThat
