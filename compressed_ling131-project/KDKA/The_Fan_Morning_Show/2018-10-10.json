whatever that makes me get that is there something I can change my diet or do to avoid it\nSure well we know one of the biggest threat factor that's not the biggest threat factor for developing policy which are quicker than the colon cancer is the age so a starting around eight fifty a lot of people\nWill start to develop pilot so that's the biggest risk factor and the second biggest threat factor as a family history of colon cancer by play into it uh in in ... when we we are\nVery friendly with our patients uh regarding a high fat diet a diet low in fiber I'm lowering calcium I'm right in the zone that things that\nI can predispose uh and and and getting it out and rent for colon cancer or if I if I die goes\nUnfortunately for my family my father died of colon cancer that metastasize and complicated so naturally my siblings and I were encouraged immediately to begin the screening process\nAnd it seems to me though and it may surprise people colon cancer is the third most common type of cancer and the second leading cause of death from cancer for both men and women so I guess if you're not directly affected like I Am when should you begin that Colin\nProcess the screening process\nCurrently the guideline for colon cancer screening for what's the best cast a at that time\nThis time a is calling off because he is age fifty if you have a family history obviously this occurs approximately ten years earlier so at age forty or ten years prior to the index age of your family member so if your\nMother or father was forty five when they were a diagnosis you should get your foot for calling up at the at thirty five\nAnd there are of course other hereditary syndromes which you know rock on the you know\nIn which the guidelines would indicate that you should have them even sooner um but that is currently the guidelines we are doing research a across the country or across the world actually because we are starting to find colon cancer in younger patients\nAnd so they are looking at this and all of our national societies but right now the current recommendation is still age fifty\nYou said earlier ages the main thing and that with age pilots are going to develop those Apollo developing necessarily mean you're going to have cancer\nNo in fact most\nMost pilots are benign or and or pre cancerous um and if they get removed\nA you know you're essentially preventing any risk and that is going to grow into a higher risk ... which could then become cancer so the majority of politics will not be but all of colon cancer starts in a pilot\nAnd I understand that like any help network is set up Saturday screenings that\nWill be from seven thirty do live in a starting this weekend a Bethel park health and wellness ... billion north shore\nA McCandless in Ross township and ah you can go to the website and get all the details of future screening opportunities to but we're not talking when we say screening we're not talking about colonoscopies what would we do there is\nIf we wanted to go and start that process\nSo so so for the Saturday screening they are actually a a colonoscopy oh there are being\nYes so we have actually been lucky enough to have several physicians in Allegheny health network as well as nurses anesthesia staff and I'm\nAncillary staff help us in opening our centers up on a Saturday morning from now until the end of the year or two actually perform colonoscopies I'm so we will be open and doing that and we definitely still have some openings\nUh for some of those weekends including this weekend I'm so yes we will be actually doing the procedure itself\nSo how do you ah get signed up for the\nUm there is on the main Web site or a direct number which is lifted it for one or two five one five to seven to three and that strictly for this initiative\nYou know and let's just say that for those who have never had a cold enough to be in the idea of it is scary or whatever\nI mean we both been through it and it it is not that bad of a procedure for the most part you're kind of in a twilight or during the first part and then you come out of it as it's being done as it's being finished and it's almost over before even realize it's happened I've had to uh and honestly I tell people it's not that big a deal\n[noise] sure and on our on our website it'll take you to a link for our video of taking a patient through his experience last march which was colon cancer awareness month and he tells you all kinds of about\nHis experience and what you go through but essentially um you know this procedure is highly

a category one what twenty four hours ago yeah and now at a category for what the storm surge of upwards of Thirteen feet\nAnd to imagine that much water being forced to end the level of destruction and devastation and then I was following were this cone of uncertainty is and it's going right back over the Carolinas again\nAnd those poor people who just dealt with Florence are going to be dealing with more rain and my guess is slowing down a little bit as it hits the mountains that are going through the Carolinas and just that it it just horrible just horrible\nAnd in spite of the uh the strength of the storm the one plus it is is moving much much faster so they're anticipating where'd you say in the Atlanta John Atlanta\nThey're only expecting one to three inches of rain because of how fast it's going to move through and the current projection a according to a rundown done by the Washington Post it just hit is three to six inches of rain in South and North Carolina and again Robert it's because of what you mentioned the speed of this thing is it's going to move through an off the coast\nAnd fortunately it in the Atlanta area\nIt was when as to where there's still a life threatening situation even that far inland\nHow much do you think our gas prices are going to go up forty percent of the refineries on the Gulf of Mexico have shut down because of this storm how long will it take before that shows up in our gas pump\nThat's a really good question to ask now considering the storm's going through so quickly hopefully those uh supplies will not be shut down for a very long\nConsidering that this was also a Florida Panhandle issue and not necessarily a Louisiana issue we don't have to worry about the refineries as much as we would otherwise\nSo hopefully it's only a couple of days\nBut it will be interesting to see because not only the issue of the gasoline the oil but also natural gas production tuna fortunately we have a a lot of her own but once you take out the global supply you're going to see a global price increase\nUm other than the storm uh what else are you going to be talking about today Robert\n... de ...
