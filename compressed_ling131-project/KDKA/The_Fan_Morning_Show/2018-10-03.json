... who are you are a lot of the site at a wedding shows up you know\nIf in wedding incident when well he told by the steering may file or from the SPN he's coming back week seven and he wants to retire a steel or potentially still not given that thought out what do you think\nWell if he wants to retire as dealer you should retire today because I don't think the Steelers are in his future after this season I'm just you know they're not going to go through all this stuff and get I don't think\nAnd he's not going to lower his demands and they're not going to certainly raise their\nUh offer so that's got to be that I wrote this today Larry and John um there's so many scenario still that could happen um first of all you have to believe him that he's coming back um after the you know goodbye week\nFor the week and um you know he said things in the past that didn't come true so uh but just\nAs has been said if it was\nKnow it's really strange about this that is that there's this feeling\nThere's this feeling about lady on right now among the fan base that you want to tell him don't let the door hitch in the at the same time you want him back\nOn the field because of what he can do\n[noise] yeah you want them on the field I'm a mid season form unfortunately it remember last year took um several games to get in that um the the the the swing of things if you will and um\nYou know how ... how long is that going to take them\nSo are you going to break him in slowly or you know now that you have James Carter I think that would be\nThe um [noise] with the way they would go rather than just do what they did last year just start giving the low ball all the time I think they would have ... ... split some time with them so that may be the best way to do\nWhat you get the sense that everybody's kind of fed up with this ah Mike Tomlin yesterday and his press conference\nI have not talked to lay beyond and I really have no Les beyond update or like I've said repeatedly ours is the best approach for us to stay focused on the guys in the here and working\nYeah and I know I don't blame him for that one about the guys who are working by James Caan or\nI like what what James have given us I'm particularly in the passing game or he's been really consistent in that area and\nBand echo that too so what are the issues are as you see it I mean you've been around a long time this is a team that went Thirteen and three and the regular season last year what's going on\nYeah and struggled to go Thirteen or three let's not forget that either Larry I'm I think there were eight games of a touchdown\nOr less if that were decided\nAnd they won all but one um [noise] you know my first of all my must be really thrilled that lady on announced\nA that he was coming back to Jeremy file or rather than someone like the Steelers someone leaving named Mike Tomlin uh that that has had to really throw him so he's got a lot of uh\nFences demand here I'm sure that uh you know these guys will accept him because that as you mentioned earlier\nJohn I'm he could help him win and that's what they want to do so but what you know what what what are they can do if he comes in and they lose these next two games and he comes in what's that going to be like that's got to be toxic I think yeah because they're going to look at the reasons him as part of the reason they're one for one I Would think\nUm it's ... it's just not really a good situation at all\nWell and and you're looking at Sunday you bet the falcons coming in and they had a high powered off fans going for the first four weeks of the season I mean they've been been tearing it up and the Steelers haven't exactly been able to stop teams like that\n[noise] no they haven't and I'm you know I thought last week against Baltimore was going to be higher score a there was this was certainly is somebody's got to score a lot of points and if they both though it's going to be a run away because\nI'm of the falcons you're the falcons have scored thirty seven thirty six the last two games at hold without a turtle over and they lost both of them\nThat's unheard of it's like really you forty\nForty only fourteen on that's happened four times and they've done it twice in the last two weeks\nOh my gosh I I had no idea and so it should be interesting to see because Steelers a user you've really strong and home losing his home really is an extra kick\nYeah you gotta\nYou got to win at home and then as they say five hundred on the road you're you're you're in good shape and the the Steelers are playing one on one on the road or their own two at home so that's a good and they're also ordered one gets division of oh it's your that's coming up after this game a lot of\nWell

next kid is October and things are turning\nYou know doc every year we see the crowd the gathers for the race for the cure and we see all the cats and and the people who are breast cancer survivors and it really gives you a sense of how prevalent this is across society what are the numbers how big is breast cancer\nWell breast cancer is the most common cancer among women on and it can develop an early age it is actually more common in later age that women of all ages are diagnosed with breast cancer and of course\nWe all have a mother and many of us have sisters and daughters so I think breast cancer is sort of a family event I'm ... now that the good thing about breast cancer is that although it's\nVery prevalent that's also very curable and more it's more curable than than a lung cancer for example which is the second most common cancer and when\nI think a lot of people wouldn't be surprised by the lung cancer part why do you suspect that might be\nWhy it's more curable well probably because breast cancer can be picked up and it's very early stages so it since\nThe last fifty years or so enamored grams have become much more\nPrevalent and much more common uh many women are diagnosed with very early stage breast cancer in the past breast cancers weren't picked up until a somebody could feel alone and we know once you can feel it we know it's a it's a higher stage and less likely to be cured now we're\nOh we're picking up very tiny tumors they're treated and the odds of being cured and never having to deal with breast cancer again are very high\nLet me go back to something you said almost at the beginning from\nAn early age your detecting breast cancer in women how we are we talking about because I Do think that most people have the end you're talking about forty fifty sixty that's where you have to start worrying about an hour early on about\nWell I have patients in their twenties or even late teens although that's very uncommon it's more likely if you have early stage breast cancer at an early age that it's\nAssociated with a a genetic abnormality breast cancer gene for example ... one or two so\nIt's uncommon but it certainly can happen in the in the twenties you're absolutely right the most common time for breast cancer to be diagnosed is later in life usually around the in the sixties fifties sixties or the most common and then seven days but even eighties [noise]\nSo what are you should somebody gets shot I mean how are we should use torture them\nWell I usually recommend that um as soon as I'm a young woman develops brass and and becomes a more mature that they learn to do breast self exams uh so that they know exactly what their breath feel like so that if something changes\nUh they can alert or their health care professional or in general we say that a woman should start mammograms that age forty or if\nThere's a ... a history of breast cancer in their family roughly ten years before that family member develop breast cancer so if your mother had breast cancer at age forty you would start\nMammograms at age thirty does it have to be every year there's there's a lot of debate about that and some\nUh say well you can start early and get them every other year some people say no you don't need to get and nobody needs them until later but the recommendations are um started forty or ten years before the family member develop breast cancer whichever his earliest\nWith all the technological advances in medicine for him we call them treating breast cancer\nSo I I think the landscape has changed dramatically since I started treating breast cancer [noise] um we have\nNew targeted therapies that are extremely effective um and the late Nineteen nineties we started looking at something called her two new\nWhich is a a a receptor on the cancer cell that it when positive indicates a more aggressive breast cancer so initially all we knew was that those were bad cancer so we better give more chemotherapy\nBut then they've developed targeted therapies monoclonal antibodies that actually go right to that receptor and enabled us to kill off those aggressive cells so\nThat now those hurt too positive\nBreast cancers actually are more curable and have a better prognosis so that's changed things dramatically we also have new um targeted therapies that target estrogen receptors to new class of drugs called\nCD case for six inhibitors these are pills that we can give toasts\nWomen along with an anti estrogen pill and the help control the disease and women with met a static estrogen receptor positive breast cancer and now we have clinical trials looking at adding these drugs\nAnd the average of and setting that is women who've had their their breast cancers removed they've been treated and now they're just on I always call it insurance treatment with an anti estrogen pill so we had this new type\nOf ... the decay for six inhibitor and hope that adding that will\nFurther improve our

the up a heads up on the opioid crisis long before it became popular to talk about in the politicians got involved and\nRight that's true the damages the damage whether they classify it as a tornado or not but in talking with accuweather yesterday afternoon a date Bowers especially what surprises I was there were talking about tornadoes and a weather system like this\nAnd it's October and one of the things that he was mentioning was that we are dealing with humidity levels that are more tropical\nThen they should be at this time of year rainfall amounts that effort what Fifteen inches above normal the weather is just acting peculiar and yesterday we felt that\nWell the ... the weather's actually peculiar and so is the world of politics everywhere you turn on last night for the first time the president and went after Dr Ford who is the accuser of having a\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the highest I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't\nKnow [noise]\nRobert de ah a lot of talk about this this morning\n[noise] a lot of talk and considering that Republicans in the Senate wants to stay clear of saying anything negative about a doctor Ford or there's one person left that can make mention make comment to rally the ...\nTo rally the Republican support across the country\nAnd its President Trump and it's the issue of what does a doctor Fort remember what does she remember and the way he handled it was just stereotypically President Trump and the way that he does it\nBut for his supporters he brought up a lot of points that are causing them to scratch their heads how is it that you can remember that you only had specifically one beer but then there are so many other things that are still left up to uncertainty and just not sure of it all\nYou know and it's interesting too that he also yesterday in that speech in Mississippi kind of distance himself from judge Kavanaugh by saying you know I really don't know him I've only known him for a few weeks which seemed kind of strange\nYeah I was a little surprised that I think he is recognizing that there is a likelihood that judge Kavanaugh is not going to survive this and one of the reasons why is that you have the three Republican senators for the most part deciding to go this together\nAnd uh with that\nSenator Jeff flake said yesterday that if it's found that he lied to the Senate\nDuring that hearing then how do you put somebody on the Supreme Court\nThat lie under oath that spent an entire career punishing people Who Lied under oath and then would be on the Supreme Court and needing to deal with\nFactual testimony um they put a big cloud around that so I in fact I wouldn't be surprised if that's ultimately the issue that brings cabinet down not that there's such evidence that more people grow convinced that he was the one\nWho assaulted and Dr Ford but that he wasn't being completely honest and truthful when he gave his testimony last week\nIt took me a second but I found that soundbite with the president talking about a judge Kavanaugh\nI don't even know how to view weeks ago I don't even know I don't want to protect my friends I Want to do what's right for this country is\nInteresting stuff so what are your infant Henri man ... there are a number of things will be taking a look at today one of them is the
