we thought we would have been in the old that eighty eight there someplace\nI Would imagine that probably looked at George Romero and said you're nuts nobody's going to do for this\nBecause George and

night of the living dead I'm not sure that I Would like you know how he is is\nUm the museum of modern art has judge that as a classic or the national film registry of library of Congress has viewed it as a classic\nI Would hope that Pittsburgh turns out and see what they're missing don't put off by the title it's actually a good show\nIt really is a great film and congratulations that's tomorrow
