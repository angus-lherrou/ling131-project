your news was breaking and and ah [noise] as soon as I realize what was was was going on in the magnitude of what was going on I think like everyone else uh\nUh I I got dressed in ran down to the scene and um\nYou know when I got down there ah rich Fitzgerald and the mayor and Corey O'Connor and Dan Frankel and a Conor Lamb and keep for office I mean just I I think everybody just want it to get down and see what if anything we could do 'em\nAnd someone told me that um a friend of mine Michelle Rosenthal was was there and a car\nAnd I learned that her two brothers were in the synagogue [noise] and uh at that time you know nobody knew their their status [noise]\nAh and um so I went into the car to see Michelle and and to try to comfort her little bed and she was obviously I'm you know distraught and then not knowing\nUh if her brothers were okay or not and sadly uh uh this morning I'll be attending that service uh\nFor her two brothers that were shot in the synagogue it's very sad thing and and these were these were two\nTwo brothers that um that I've come to learn more just loved by people in the synagogue over to Jaycee said one was a greeter at the door um\nThey were both living it achieve a house a Center for the for people were intellectually disabled [noise] um the the sport too too bright lights in in our city um that that were stuffed up by a madman and uh [noise]\nYou know today as you said in the intro a family's from Pittsburgh will be bearing their loved ones and so it's just really sad day and and that they are I think that we're all gonna just reflect upon um and and um\nYou know and see how we can all do better or an end to help rebuild that synagogue in and help the families um to to for them to a in some way returned to some sense of normalcy although I'm I'm sure that's going to be impossible [noise] um for a long long time\nWe're with the United states Congressman Mike Doyle\nWhen we should point out as we were speaking about the David Rosenthal he's fifty four was fifty four years old and his older brother Cecil who is fifty nine years old and an congressman we as we have learned the personal stories of of each of these victims what strikes you is that these were\nStories of of each of these victims what strikes you is that these were sweet people who did\nSo much for people around them all\nThe way up and down the list and\nWere if you will the most innocent victims coming into a house of worship it has certainly prompted so much discussion across the country about security and the houses of worship in places where we gather\n'em and you know it's I think a number of people have said you can't control the actions of a madman\n[noise] yeah I think it's true um [noise] people talk about ah seems like whenever these tragedies occur\n[noise] people talk about arming people and and I really don't think that's the answer um when you look at this particular situation\nUh this person shot for police officers are highly trained police officers who knew how to use their weapons uh and we are trained for situations like this two of them were swat officers\nUm the idea that you know some security personnel ... to stop this I don't believe that um and I don't believe the answers to arm every American uh you know that we have to all carry firearms to to protect ourselves against a situation like this [noise]\nUm I Do believe however\nThat if these military style weapons weren't so prevalent in our society\nA it's hard to have a mass murder a when you don't have a weapon of mass destruction and these military style weapons is a are Fifteen that the shooter used it's designed to do one thing\nIt's designed to kill people quickly or it's a it's a human killing machine that's meant for the military uh not\nCivilians and there's no civilian application for such a weapon or other than to kill a lot of people quickly and for the life of me uh I don't know why we permit\nPeople to own them in this country uh I don't think most other countries a permit that\nI Know that's a controversial thing to say but I've always believed that and and I continue to believe I don't believe it's by the way the total answer to the problem it's a piece a the answer to the problem but it's a lot tougher to do the kind of damage that we've seen a here in Pittsburgh now\nAnd in Florida and in Las Vegas and in Connecticut and it just pains me that we have so many cities where we can save is a bit the common denominator in all of those incidents was was somebody with a semi automatic weapon\nUm so I like I said it's a piece of the it's a piece of the puzzle a mental health funding is another piece of the puzzle\nThat we've done a at a horrible job funding [noise] thirty days of treatment cures nobody uh and and now it's time that we put our money where our mouth is in terms of funding mental health programs to [noise] um that's another piece of the puzzle\nBut then there's there's like you said there's other pieces of that puzzle that no matter what you do uh you you sometimes can't stop a sick person who's a you know hell bent on on causing destruction like this person was\nOne fortunately wasn't known to police and people didn't pick up the signs on the social media or worse\nWas warned fortunately wasn't known to police and people didn't pick up the signs on the social media or where he was spewing hate and and that that's where we can all play a role when we see somebody post something that's going forward threatening we need to record it uh\nIt's it's we we just can't assume that somebody blowing off steam a because there's guys like this uh who you know mines are disturbed and who's hearts are filled with eight\nA and sometimes they let people know that uh and most of these guys do it on the social media platforms\nAnd and they they need to be looked into well\nWe appreciate your willingness to join us our sympathies to you as well congressman uh thank
