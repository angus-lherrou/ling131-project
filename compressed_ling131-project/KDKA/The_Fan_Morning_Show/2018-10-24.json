and co director of the end of vascular a division at Allegheny health network dot good morning\nGood morning duck is a stroke primarily an elderly problem\nThat is true um you know the chances of a someone having a stroke increases as we age and traditionally taught to be a disease of people above I'm sixty and sixty five but um you know leading a bad\nLifestyle you can you know you can have stroke at any age and the radius seasons of stroke a than the traditional part of you know I thought it was go to a hardening of the rest of those savings younger patients younger people can have books\nDoctor what is a stroke describe what that is medically so people have a clear understanding\nStroke is basically if I didn't know logical this function of the brain um I a spinal cord and it basically assumed that started all of a sudden a and they're unpredictable as it can happen at any time and there's nothing that would predict when you're going to have a full of stroke\nBasically if symptoms that start all of a sudden a and they're unpredictable so it can happen at any time and there's nothing that would predict when you're going to have a stroke [noise]\nUm and that is basically um oh what a stroke is\nUm there are two types of stroke when is the more common one is the ischemic stroke which is because of lack of blood flow because from blood clot in the blood vessel causing lack of blood flow to the brain and the other one is going to have mirage extra which is\nBecause of rupture or you know I'm a bleeding of a blood vessel that causes bleeding in the brain\nLet's go back to the cause you said a bad lifestyle because it overall what what do we do to ourselves that increases are risk of having a stroke\n[noise] not factor that you know we dont teams are like eating all the genes that we receive\nBut there are things that we can change and that has to do with lifestyle so you know leading a good lifestyle like taking care of your you know if you have high blood pressure for civil identifying high blood pressure\nTaking care of it being on the right medications are going to quit smoking a leading a good a healthy life with exercise and diet I'm as well as if you have you know high cholesterol diabetes\nThose risk factors goes a long way in reducing risk of having that for stroke\nWere with Dr Russell's ratio with Allegheny health network neurologist Dr what is the first sign of stroke and I understand time is absolutely or the essence once you determine something is going wrong\n... that's ... so\nYou know the American heart and stroke association has you know a made a very beautiful demonic it's going to be fast and it stands for beef stands for balance F stands for I of vision\nOf the eastern for Iowa vision F stands for face\nIn stands for 'em or leg weakness an egg stands for speech\nSo the these are the kind of the crucial symptoms that he should look for um you know if you haven't said onset of facial grouping or difficulty with your speech or your arm or a leg is gone the week on one side um those are symptoms that you should be aware of and you could be having a stroke\nThat the in the beef far stands for time and time to call nine one one [noise] um it was very crucial if you see somebody having a stroke or you yourself are experiencing a stroke\nOr do you do not drive yourself or your loved one to the hospital but to call nine one one right away so that the professionals can you know better address the situation and assess the situation and take care of you and do what's necessary for you\nThe first thing you said was balancing the night vision from a standpoint of if you're experiencing this yourself what what impact on your balance in what impact on your vision\nSo you know the visually if you're losing one half of your vision or you're having double vision or you're just you know all of a sudden you feel like the room is spinning or just you lost your ballot that\nCould be a sign of a stroke and so it's very important you know if you're having any of those symptoms are the constellation of symptoms you need to call nine one one right or\nHow much better are we with the medical technology at addressing once you determine someone is having a stroke to mitigate what it can do permanently\n... so that's the way the question and you know that there are a acute stroke therapies that we can do today and we have two of them one is an ivy drug medication called ivy TPA which can be given within four and a half hours from the symptom onset\nBut today and we have two of them one is an ivy drug medication go ivy TPA which can be given within four and a half hours from the symptom onset and the other uh got sort of based procedures maybe ... from the growing archery from inside the ... all the way up to the brand to open up these blood vessels\nWhich we can do up to twenty foot us how the both of these appear to be a time sensitive that means the foster we can get it to the patients the better we can limit the damage of the stroke and prevent them from getting worse\nAnd that's going to help them lead to destabilize from the stroke\nWorld stroke day is Monday a lot of great information you can go

jobs and I just want to take some time to say\nThank you for all you do because I have many friends in eastern Ohio in the panhandle of West Virginia\nLike do you think the average person realizes what's at stake here as far as the jobs shelf over the next twenty five years and I alluded to earlier today I mean it connects to everything railroad industry the trucking industry\nPlease talk about long term what this will do for the economy and for jobs good working class middle jobs here the tri state [noise]\nGood morning I I appreciate you being such a big cheerleader for us we got the last year we love you for it but to your question yes\nWhat we've always said is is this isn't about of raw this is about jobs this is about dance lessons and ball gloves so the idea is that the folks that

when he was a radio and listen to us anytime anywhere\nWe're back shell inside two thousand Eighteen honor to have my child to be here director of public relations for the Ohio oil and Gas Association you're also going to be hearing a name quite often direct energy one of the signatures sponsors so\nAll hands on deck because I like to say when it comes to this region and what this industry can do for us now let's talk about the significance of why they're going to started coming to us\nFor this product because a lot of folks worldwide are going to want to continue to find ways to energy well too you know ramp up energy and they're part of the world and save money at the process in the in the process and this is the way to go so they're going to start coming to us for us to export this product\nThroughout the world to right absolutely and not only that but not to make light of what's happening right now it's a matter of fact on the Gulf Coast but when you're talking about anything cracker plans right now they all exist on the Gulf Coast\nWe don't have hurricanes in eastern Ohio and Pennsylvania and again not to make light of the very serious situation they're dealing with all of that is what major problem it is and so the opportunity to build and maintain these facilities up here you know when their their ability not go off line with a weather event\nThat's really attractive finale folks here but to your point across the nation because then we can quickly shift that to the east coast over to our friends in Europe so we can get away from that Russian gas a little bit there's a lot of geopolitical opportunities there as well\nI got to ask you to not to turn this into a political form but the mid term elections coming up and I've been out doing a lot of social media videos and we're going to continue to do with them and talking on the radio why this is a significant issue\nCurrent administration in Washington pretty friendly on his arms that if they are as a matter of fact yeah so it was and how that makes your job a little bit easier but listen it's all about jobs first jobs slashed and even the president understands if you want to continue to move forward as a country with energy independence especially when it comes to\nDefense as in you know you know the military but more importantly you have no foundation unless you have middle class jobs and this has middle class jobs written all over\nIt absolutely does in fact President Trump was here just a number of years ago speaking at this conference on that very topic natural gas is not a partisan issue\nThis is not only what keeps the lights on in the economy moving but you're probably about middle class job that's exactly what's employing people right now in eastern Ohio\nThat's all the opportunities are either directly or indirectly and so while it shouldn't be political issues sometimes people talk about it that way but the idea is that natural gas is benefiting everybody on both sides the off\nWhen you look at the future and I didn't expect it to happen this quickly but from that early stage back in Washington County that first drill that first well if you will and then farmers obviously getting a chance many of them to hang onto their family farms which were in their names and family for dinner\nWell if you will and then farmers obviously getting a chance many of them to hang onto their family farms which were in their names and family for generations did you think it would really ramp up this quickly\nMike or I don't think anybody did I mean in Ohio we if they're producing natural gas and crude oil since Eighteen fourteen and so we're a long history all the way down back to the Rockefeller days were Ohio was once the world's largest crude oil producer but\nYou know we have some folks move in Chesapeake Devon and ... and there were poke around and northern Ohio and central Ohio southern Ohio okay maybe this could be a twenty county play I became a ten county play but what we see now with some of the best wells and not only\nOhio or in the Appalachian Basin but in the country and at one point last year eclipse resources have the longest on short lateral in eastern Ohio over Nineteen thousand feet explained that's what's what's that mean so the idea is that for a hundred years we had been poking holes directly down thousand feet three thousand feet\nWhat eclipse and other things that have figured out as if we go horizontally and\nNow it's simple and there's a a diminishing return but what they figure it out as if they go Nineteen thousand feet down and then out so that's a couple of miles of that way\nSo really what you're seeing is economic benefits because that lateral is crossing county lines that's causing ... school district was and so everybody's getting a piece of that because those taxes now\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but one of the things that my dear friend the late ...\nWho has a form that actually connects Washington beaver Lawrence Lawrence but I'm Allegheny county altogether I remember him taking me out to a a drilling rig site range resources and he said the beauty about all of this it doesn't affect the lander underneath so we can basically still do the crops all the things that he needs to do\nSo that's another thing that a lot of people are always concerned about where we're going to go and you got the EPA man himself coming here later today they're worried about the environment this this industry is more user friendly than people realize it\nReally is and to your point about land surface impact right you know when we had our conventional was we love our legacy producers but what one horizontal Utica will can do replace thirty two vertical wells so instead of having thirty two different one acre parcels we can only have one five acre parcel was six or eight wells are please replete reducing all of that surface in fact\nThat's why there's and I'm going to keep him one more segment because I Do want to talk about\nWhat is next to him what does he see\nThe future other than the show petrochemical plant what Mike see coming next and when you think about Ohio and Pennsylvania and West Virginia what is their future economically going to be like when it comes to job creation over the next twenty five years and is that\nLast statement that I made earlier farfetched about a number of

not directly connected inside the natural gas industry but as well on the outside right\nAbsolutely and it all goes back to that rock so we've been producing crude oil and natural gas here for generations but what those y'all just figure it out is if they go a little bit deeper and go into that source rock that Utica Marcellus of bowl\nGames on and so the idea is that these wells are so floor effect that they're going to be producing for generations and there's a lot more ahead of us than behind it\nMight tell me about it and my friends had are no who's in the ... this wonderful oil and gas business from West Virginia he's been preaching this long before shall we came here because he's a big proponent of the coal industry as I Am as well and we were talking about how this could kind of you know lift all tides if you will you know my question to you is though\nWhat's the difference between the wet gas in the dry gas explain that the Utica Sheldon Marcellus Shale so she'd go from\nEastern TA through western PA into Ohio you move from what is known as the dry gas pure methane that will you burn in your furnace over and says you get into Ohio the wet gas that sugar cane speak taint propane ethics and those are liquids those you can burn them but as the old saying goes friends don't let friends burnout thing\nThat is much more valuable because of the cell phone I'm holding right here right you can essentially turn essay into polyethylene into polyethylene and turning to plastic plastic so yes you can burn it but no you should\nSo the idea is that that's what makes it so area so attractive based on commodity prices folks can drill in the natural gas window the wet gas when the dry I guess when do the wet gas window and so that's really\nThe based on commodity prices folks can drill and the natural gas window the wet gas when the ... I guess when the wet gas window and so that's really ... the geography at play here\nYou know what else I think people need to understand is the fact that these companies have invested way too much money to where they're going to do something that is going to really\nTurn around and bite them in the end as far as pollute the atmosphere the landscape\nFor and more importantly not do what they need to do as far as their due diligence before they put shovels into the ground and begin building these amazing facilities like the show petrochemical plant I I think people's minds need to be put the ease that there's just too much on the table for somebody to take a risk\nWell let's ... boys that an easy one yes they've got investors and shareholders and they need to be responsible for yes they have federal and state permits that they have to be held accountable for but more important than that that's where we live we have no interest in during our water or our air because this is where we live in this is where our kids with\nThe Ohio laborers that have spent over a million work hours working on pipeline project from southeast Ohio with another ... now a million workouts\nSo the idea is that they're working in their own backyards building these five ... they had every incentive in the world to do a great job and you know what they are [noise]\nYou know what what would I think people need to understand too is and first Allegheny county chief exec former head of the Republican Party Jim Rada you're not talking about there's all the time we were on the radio just the other night\nYou want better healthcare you and I was going to public school yesterday kind of making the connection to shell insight jobs more tax money\nPeople moving into the neighborhoods stronger schools all of the tools that these teachers need to educate their students and also places like community colleges and branch campuses and pick Carnegie Mellon all of these schools having an opportunity to train people in this industry directly or non directly\nYou won all of that stuff to kind of roll into your favor you want Marcellus Shale\nOh yeah absolutely ... will too so it's easy to point to see that right there at the ten billion dot Crocker plant that's an obvious one but the ones that are not so obvious and I'll just using Ohio example here part of the permit that our guys get when they drill a well they have to repair that road\nSo we did some public records if I'd have to repair the relative Heather oh 'cause there's a lot of those come on now heavy traffic\nAnd so as an example that many folks may not think about in Ohio in the last five years through no taxpayer dollars\nOil and gas producers have pay six hundred and thirty nine miles of roadway\nTo the tune of three hundred million dollars and so that's just one example of something that you may not be aware of all you know is the road got paved probably don't know who have but it's not taxpayer dollar dollar taxpayer dollars so that's just one example that we point to is something that maybe is unknown so that's an investment that we're making in the\nCommunity and see it one time that would have not been a part of industry basically they would have went and did what they had to do and create jobs or move forward but they weren't cleaning up behind them so this is another indication to where
