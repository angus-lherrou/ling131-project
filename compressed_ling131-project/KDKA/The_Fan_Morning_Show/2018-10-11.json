Institute of Pittsburgh news on and some very exciting news if you haven't heard dandy I don't want to steal your thunder\nHey yeah I I'm really jazzed about this exhibition that we just open called destination moon and its straight from the Smithsonian Institute\nThe light of history that every day I think Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin is names are you know part of the fabric of the space program but poor Michael collins who stayed in that command module and circled the moon gets forgotten that he was there to\nYeah you know I talk to Michael about that he said Michael\nCollins is still around he's he's smart he's got a great sense of humor and that people always ask him about that how do you feel while\nNeil and buzz or a walking around on the movie ... forty seven and a half pounds the moon rocks and getting all the glory\nHow did you feel about orbiting the moon and he said you know\nOr it could have been any one of us assigned to that job\nHe was the best that talking and command module pilot and and so he felt very much a part of that first successful moon landing and has no regrets at all but he did\nHe was some graffiti inside the command module that we have at the history center right now and that we've done\nA high definition photography and you can kind of maneuver your way through the inside the capsule and you can see Michael Pollan's graffiti and he wrote\nThat this is the best ship ever to come down the line God Bless your Columbia Michael collins command module pilot and he puts the date on any he scratches that into the wall of the\nInside of the command much\nThat's tremendous that is cool where would they and they may say president CEO of the Heinz history center talking about the first time that this government has allowed outside of the Smithsonian in Washington for this capsule to go anywhere how did you get it\nSo you know we are an affiliate of the Swiss army an institution at the history center and they consider us one of their best affiliates and they chose their for best affiliates in America to get the special privilege of of the command module and all the other moons flown material from Nineteen sixty nine\nAnd it turns out that the scientists the center of the Pittsburgh is the only venue east of the Mississippi River\nThe others are in the apple Houston and St Louis so this is really a special privilege for Pittsburgh there's kind of hope they all come down to to the the real deal right after they watched the movie with Ryan Gosling first man and a you know really get the whole story\nYeah and you've got the author of the book to the movies based on coming\nThat's right a James Hansen interviewed a Neil Armstrong he was the only one that Neil Armstrong would ever talked to a he was a very private kinda guy and James Hansen was the co producer of the guys who I mean I'm\nA first event and he's going to be here on November first get seven PM at the history sensor and so you can get all the inside scoop not only on Neil Armstrong that Ryan Gosling too\nAnd one of the things Pittsburgh or Islam is you've come to learn Andy is we love to know the connections in the first and there are many Pittsburgh connections to the innovations of Apollo the pro Apollo program in a bottle eleventh\nYou are so right Larry ... you know if\nIf it weren't for Pittsburgh we wouldn't have put a man on the moon in Nineteen sixty nine of Pittsburgh company North American rock well fill the command module how cola made the aluminum for the lunar lander and the skin of the Saturn ... rocket ATM by US Steel\nMine safety appliance made the uh breathing apparatus for the astronauts unions\nWhich in signal made the fiery relays that blasted off those are rockets and Westinghouse made special cameras had brought to the world live without the moon walk the scratchy black and white images that some of us remember from Nineteen sixty I\nThat was those were special cameras\nAre made by Westinghouse because they had to operate and two hundred and fifty degrees Fahrenheit or a hundred and fifty degrees below zero and so Westinghouse knew how to harden for military contracts or electronic devices and that's why what's the house with those cameras\nSo as you go to see this display of the Heinz history center keep in mind the bravery of the men who did this who went up in this thing not knowing whether there was a guarantee that they were going to make it back\nAnd trusting of bravery in technology of the men and women out here in Pittsburgh to put a lot of this together that's that's something we should all be very proud of Andy may say residency although Heinz history center is destination moon the Apollo ... mission until February Eighteenth\nTwo thousand nine teams can't wait

L. restriction or legislation or even discussion about having armed guards at the game that gains\nYet I ... and that's the whole thing we don't know ah our superintendent actually wrote a letter to the deputy I Am looking how to look into this matter because her children why are you subjecting our children to more problems that we didn't costs\nNow where parents were patios parents notified the for the fact that this was going to happen or did they just show up at the game and he buys with guns\nWhat what I was told they were off the coach with at right before the game and a coach didn't have a problem with it and then uh that was it that the parents definitely had a problem with it because like I said our kids are supposedly the victims here why why are we being pot where our kids being punished\nThe other thing ... being timid aided\nAbsolutely now you said you know their kids their kids so give me an idea because from the incident that happened at the game\nThrough armed guards showing up at the next couple of games\nA has got to have an impact on those kids on the field\nAbsolutely I agree totally and that's why our superintendent wrote that W. P. I. A. L. asking them for clear and you know ... vacation of what we're going to do here\nNow would and I'm guessing ... in there with me 'cause I don't know the ins and outs of this but would there be any situations generic scenario where pantyhose would say you know what hey we're not playing ...\nYes yes and we already have done that and the WBAL stepped in and said well you don't play than you forfeit the game why why you're hurting our children are things that we didn't do\nWell that's the other name because I understand from their investigation they actually said they've found the testimony of the pantyhose players to be credible they believed there was at least some racial slurs or racially insensitive comments ed but\nThey believed it was an isolated incident so really you use racial slurs but only one time\nRight that that that that's the whole thing our kids are victims here and they're still being used as a victim somebody needs to step in the W. P. I. A. L. needs to step in and say this needs to stop or ... is done\nHey Aaron and I got to take a break for traffic and yet it with me for a couple more minutes oh I'll do driver that you're listening to

these were school security that came with the with the team on Monday nights but they\nActually were as scoring players to the restroom kids to the rest room because they wanted to keep them safe I Can't imagine how I Would feel as a parent if there were this imagery of ah kids\nBeing escorted by guards because they weren't safe and I also can't imagine what it feels like to be a parent of a
