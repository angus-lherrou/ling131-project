there's a little bit of um speculation I guess we are the best thing you could say I'm ... you know some of it is to the centers to ah you know let let her do know that that book is\nThat much or buck city area [noise] um but there's also some the thought that it might be to try to ward off or\nAny other younger bucks it might be wondering new intrude on that territory\nSo um but yeah they they they make those scrapes they leave a sent 'em and and there's some a thought that they may even be leaving a sense when they make the uh the buck rubs on the tree there's a there's a small ... you know I knew there I\nUh you know in their face that uh that they can leave a little bit of a cent with Israeli so yeah there's still some of the there's a lot of fascinating um\nYou know research has been going into that and uh you know\nSome thoughts of change on that over the years\nSo damn it it seems like when you see the deer out grazing and these days in right in that dusk our you see a lot of them out you see a lot to do but you don't see a whole lot of box do do the males females way out number males as far as the deer population\nUm in in some areas they might ah especially this time

including onto the roadways even more than usual right\nOh yeah yeah are you there again especially at dusk as you mentioned in the early morning hours\nLike grown now if you're a drive in order for dawn I'm really need to be alert and one of the big mistakes people make is if they see one deer across the road there\nOr you know their eyes follow that they're and they're looking at the ... that just cross but the problem is is there's usually another one behind it and that's that's the one that a little gets you so you know you just need to be alert and they'll stay focused on one that that runs in front of you\nAnd I think the number of the state farm has something like twenty five hundred dollars is the average damage to\nA vehicle from hitting a deer now you say that right now there's

P. M. C. children's hospital of Pittsburgh Dr John Williams good morning\nGood morning do you understand that this scares the daylights out a mom and dad\nI Do as a parent and as a pediatrician for over Twenty years I understand this is very scary\nI think when parents hear things like paralysis and weaken as a young children these are terrifying to all of us I think people need to keep a couple of things in mind about that though and that's the rarity of these events\nYou measure polio sixty years ago before the polio vaccine which is of course invented by Dr Jonas Salk at the University of Pittsburgh\nThere were ten to twenty thousand cases of paralysis here in this country and young children the cases now are less than one in ... show it's a potentially serious disease and it can have a serious effect on the children and families affected either remember it's extremely rare\nSaid that Ninety percent are too\nSerious effect on the children and families affected either remember it's extremely\nRare that said that Ninety percent our children the average age is for what would parents looked for initially because the common cold is just that it's so common and and I understand it's out of that that these other uh symptoms present themselves\nThat's what we think in most cases of al ... the CDC and we hear and other doctors looking we have not found a cause but when we do find that cause\nThe most common cause or viruses and just as you said they are common cold viruses and we all know you know how many colds and stomach virus as children get and yet most of those don't turn into a a ... so what parents look for is\nNot the colder the stomach virus the runny nose or cough or vomiting or diarrhea\nWe all see that in children all the time\nBut if you see a child who's having weakness especially if it's in one arm or leg child he's having trouble feeding themselves are playing with toys with their on maybe they're not walking well that's a sign of potential ask them and then the parents should contact their health care provider\nYou know the dock whenever you see this kind of thing I I think there's a natural tendency on the part of the parents just say why my child and what what did I Do wrong that resulted in my child getting this awful situation\n[noise] it's a very natural question for every parent asking I think we've all ... things like that and the answer is as far as we can tell there's well there's definitely nothing that parents did wrong and we think it's probably just randomly some shelter and get it you know even\nDuring the days polio when I sat there were those ten to twenty thousand cases of beer\nThat was only one percent of all the children who were infected with polio virus ... only a small small fraction of children infected with these viruses develop these a weakness and paralysis problems we don't know why that is\nFar the effects or is it too early to tell a permanent [noise]\nIt's hard to tell and it depends on each child in each case\nMost children do make some improvement some make an excellent improvement but just like with polio there are some children who are left with long term weakness and uh the recovery and the rehabilitation can take weeks months in in some cases\nBut we should point out that the the\nWhen this can be fatal are very very even more rare than the disease itself obviously\nThat's exactly right and that's in one way that it's not as bad as polio far more people died of polio of a a found in the last couple of years and\nReminding you there there's only been a small number of cases compared to the millions of children we have in the usa a hole in the last four years only one child has actually died of asked\nHim why we have you Dr Williams uh last year we heard staggering numbers of flu incidents uh eighty thousand I Believe was the number of people who died from the flu obviously concern with children this year uh\nI Know you recommend vaccinations for ... for every one for that correct\nThat's correct and and you couldn't make it better point about comparing risk asked them is very scary but it's extremely rare as you just mentioned flu you know tens of thousands of ...\nComparing risk ask them is very scary but it's extremely rare as you just mentioned flu you know tens of thousands of American children are hospitalized every year from ...\nSeveral hundred American children die or the flu every year and most of these kids were previously healthy and they were mostly unvaccinated show yes the flu is a much greater risk to our kids ban\nAFL him and I have four kids they've all gotten the flu shot every year their lives I get a flu shot every year I recommend it for everybody\nOkay so you can get a flu shot to protect yourself against the flu but give us some sort of take away of what you can do to protect your children may assume\nWell it's hard to protect kids from germs and viruses there a natural part of childhood and everybody knows how often kids get sick and that's part of building a healthy immune system along with vaccines\nHowever almost all germs are spread by hand contact and so you know if somebody is sick coughing and sneezing into their elbows important instead of spraying those terms out into the room and especially hand gel or soap and water\nAway we spread these things is not for me coughing and sneezing in the middle of the studio which for me having a cold I touch my nose I shake your hand you touch your nose and now I've successfully infected you You're welcome\nThat's always it seems you know repetitive absolutely true I think we should outlaw handshakes and just do the fist\nBump Dr John ... yeah go ahead Doug\n... now I I I think we we all should be careful about that people don't realize is each of us that she's our face about twenty five hundred times a day\nWhat really or ... or ... yes people have measured this we're not even aware of it and we're constantly touching her face on it to make sure it's still there\nIs getting older\nI'm not sure why but uh yeah so so being aware of that and just ...
