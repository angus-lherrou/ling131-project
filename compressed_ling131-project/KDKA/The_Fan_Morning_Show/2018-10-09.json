it\nAnd who should have everybody who is six months and older should get the flu shot especially those who are around infants\nAnd elder adults or anyone who is immune compromise should absolutely get the ... the flu shot on that is to facilitate herd immunity so surrounding those who can't received a shot by those who are protected with\nThe flu shot now I was reading something from the CDC this morning that said that the youngest ... sometimes they need more than one of these\nYeah is there room yeah our our youngest population so the six months and older when they get the first flu shot they actually get two doses to boost their immunity and that are sixty five an older population I'm due to weaken immunity as we age their flu shot and does is actually a\nMuch more potent than the regular one that the rest of us get because they get a better immune response\nNoses all done at one time\nYeah so the yeah the young kids it's four weeks apart but are sixty five an older it's one shot you're done for the season\nAbout the devastating news last year was just how deadly the flu was a cross this country are talking about those numbers because I understand it was one of the worst in decades\nIt it was from from what I've been told Dr hacker I'll be able to speak to that a little bit more but um you know medicine is an inexact science there trying their best every year to get a good match in and sometimes we have better matches than other\nNo when you say match we are talking about what matching up the vaccine with the real flu that are out there 'cause I was one of ...

going to get sick\nSo the flu shot actually contains both AM be strains so it protects you against them both and so when we talk about the match that's exactly what we're talking about its its best production based on what we saw the year before and an opposite hemispheres\nSo it's always just trying their best to match it with what they believe will be circulating ...\nWell before you

told us that it's a challenge so thanks for making the effort to be here\nSo let's jump right into this doctor hacker ah with the question that Larry us just a couple of minutes ago how deadly was the flue last year\nSo last year as you've probably heard there was some national statistics that suggested that we lost\nUm I Want to say something like eighty thousand thousand you know it's wrong road to here in Pittsburgh we had a I think it was in the thirties and more than you know better than I but the point being we definitely had more flu cases than we have had in literally years and a\nYear prior to that was a pretty benign flu season so I think\nFlu season so I think it it gives us a false sense of security and then we go into the next season and it can be really bad\nThis may sound like a real remedial question what is the flu exactly I mean in in why is it so rampant at some times and nodded others\nSo the flu or influenza is a virus and it has a habit of changing shape a little bit each year and said the vaccine that we get\nA is adapted to what they predict to be the flu circulating flu or influenza each year sometimes they get it right on the money and sometimes they don't and that's always been our to Alan Moore may sorry not as bad as it is is do we know\nIt's I Hope a legitimate question because you wonder well who are those people\nRight though these are scientists right is legit but again you know you're doing your best to predict based on what's circulating in the current year and so they generally are making the flu vaccines in today will be great

shows the number one a lot of confidence in the future of of the region that that the region's growing again but when you think about places like children's hospital\nFor for example where people come from miles around hundreds of miles around to take their children for treatment\nUm while it's certainly the the great you know humanitarian part of of of of healing children there was also an economic impact of that when those folks come into town that's money that comes into this region to pay for a lot of the things that we have whether it's around spending a hotel room for the doctors

us this morning big change coming to Pennsylvania sideways\nAnd joining us on our disc Institute of Pittsburgh new Zion, Pennsylvania state Senate minority leader forty third district Senator Jay Costa senator good morning\nGlory guy on there\nYou know every every year a senator we go to a press conference with the state police and Penn died and\nIt said usually in the spring to encourage everyone to obey the speed limits in work zones and they talk about the people who are in jeopardy uh and every year we hear about issues within the work zones this is something that they've been pushing for for a while in the legislature write\nBetter correct It's been around for at least a half dozen your early career port legislative session and um we've always gotten any or through the house and it but never been able to go to Chet ... on the final product\nAnd that we've done that now are they the governor and my understanding your governor both on the legislation that cameras and I work out and we'll begin that process put it\nIt implemented going forward probably early next year is going to expect to see us bring him next year won't expect to see cameras maybe on the highway\nYou know I Am the impetus of this is safety for the construction workers are not workers and others who are contracted to do that work in very dangerous situations in many cases so I get that\nBut then away from that a lot of people say bull this is somehow unfair when did you say that\nOh I don't I don't think it's unfair I think first and foremost as you said that about safety or the workers on a highway you know last year we experience I think Seventeen hundred uh events that took place on the highway and works on areas crashes into like a Maryland so I Believe in Ninety percent reduction the number of incidents along those lines\nAt the end of the day you know folks know this limited work shows is fifty five miles an hour the they're given given eleven mount grace period co reply and people who works on what people are actively working and that's one of the requirements that needs to be posted there clearly you need to have conspicuous information about what's going on in the workplace if there'll be a camera there and in fact people working so\nUm yeah that's what I Would say I mean for the first time you get a warning\nA second time you are or what we see a citation in the mail for Seventy five dollars and doesn't involve any points but it's an attempt to try to change the culture of people driving to work so it's recognizing that there are a that's a dangerous situation driving through the Congress center that this is one of the ways we can do that\nYeah accidents and work zones increase for a number of years last year there was a little bit of a drop in the fact is there an awful lot of ... and let me play devil's advocate here for just a second because in will use the parkway north as an example the parkway north construction zone is marked at forty five miles an hour\nAnd that forty five miles per hour speed zone is set up in a lot of areas where there is no work going on\nI mean fair is fair but at the same time uh it seems like in the year penalize seemed to drivers or making them drive slower at a time when there is no work going on and you know there are no workers insight\nWhat John the stats and requires that they must be an act of work so and the\nArea that that it can be within the Akron works on will be clearly marked\nSo you may have a two mile stretch of a forty five mile an hour work being done\nAt that place but it's only going to be the year that they're working I think will be the reef the conspicuous length of space and time that you would be subject to the cameras at the end of the day I Can't remember and that person who's going forty five miles an hour you know works on\nA band the law but even if somebody you could go faster that it's eleven when I went away so theoretically they could go fifty five miles an hour or fifty six miles an hour and still not excited going forward so there's always that uh again to slow you know take your culture traffic driving patterns\nAnd habits and protecting workers and that's what we're trying to achieve your it'll be convenient particularly for a while the folks to get used to it but at the end of the day I think it's going to be beneficial for a couple of motorists than all support workers\nSo this is a done deal right\nIt's a done deal once the governor signed it and then ... and ... up together and put together a program\nA and then implemented I Believe probably early next year it's an important thing to remember is we have so much to do so much more transportation ... so many more transportation projects going on a way of oil resources in the transportation would fix you more and more roads and\nSome more opportunities for these types of things to occur at the end of the day the money makes its way back ... back into the funds that go back to the local state government and local government soon find money does not go into the general fund\nJay real quick it will there be a warning sign that this\nThey're warning sign that the speed cameras set up\nAbsolutely yeah it requires both when it's grown up and then one event well\nOr if you're here for better go driving through the amount of area it'll say the work the camera in Portland area and you're going to be subject to the forty five mile an hour speed limit but I won't be cooking hammer\nAnd you don't anticipate the governor a turning this down you you ... okay I really\nI think he's going to sign it kind of or a really a bipartisan and ... driven and finally got if you're American earlier private contractors who do who are working on our way or if the court

in a high get it I like it it is a mix of Lady Gaga bad romance and classical pieces from the baroque era\nI Hope Lady Gaga happens upon this show truly amazing wow that's nice\nUh thanks for that this movie was\nShort of fantastic and I mean it ... because obviously there's been a three versions prior to\nAnd prior to this of a star is born going all the way back to Nineteen thirty seven I think\nWith Janet gainer and Frederic march of star is born many will remember the Nineteen fifty four version with Judy Garland and shame my son and then the one that is most contemporary\n... was the Nineteen Seventy six movie wow that was Nineteen Seventy six with Chris christopherson and Barbara Streisand and that was really really good and that was the last time it was done and so I'm gotta give big thumbs up and kudos to Bradley Cooper who produced this this movie\nHe takes a classic that has been done by some of the biggest names in Hollywood and the most recent was it was a huge success with Christopher sending Barbra Streisand and and he puts his he stars in it and directed\nAnd brings in Lady Gaga and she I mean she was just fantastic I mean I I I've never I shouldn't say ... never been a fan of her music I've just never gotten into her music at all and I'm certainly aware\nOf her and the stuff that she's done with Tony Bennett and the you know the ... the meat skirt or the meat dress whatever that thing was uh I I get that and I know that but uh as an actress\nShe's wonderful and as a director he was terrific uh it was it's not a piece where\nIt was like I'm directing so I'm going to get all the closeups he was very generous in the way\nHe chose the shots and staged the shots and told this story and there are few updated I'm a mixtures to it um that brings it that really sets it in the music industry\nOriginally you know it was set in the movie industry and the big award that I'm\nA she gets that alley gets in in this movie originally was getting the Academy Award and you remember James Madison just walking out ... drunk out of his mind\nAnd falls over and it's just most embarrassing moment for a Judy Garland in that class of you're Nineteen fifty four in the same thing with christopherson with Barbara Streisand winning\nThe you know in the movie winning the Academy Award a and he's you know just drunk all over themselves\nAnd uh but this is based is set in music industry\nSo you you really get it really it that's where I think John was saying it really gets the appeal\nTo ... ... men I think a lot of times although it doesn't make any difference to me just a fantastic movie he's a big uh start kind of the country leaning but more like a like a Keith Urban maybe you you know that that kind of ... that kind of a I'm a ... camera\nAnd he discovers her in a in a I'm a gay bar [laughter] true and it it does show takes off from there\nAnd he obviously his star is as high as it can get and then her started begins to rise his begins to fall and therein lies the conflict of the movie a it also\nIt also makes a very big statement I mean obviously there's a statement in a star is born about ... music but this also makes a very big statement about alcoholism the disease of alcoholism\nAnd that's an interesting twist to that story they even have a few lines in there about a AAA\nTraffic on the fives back to it again let's take a
