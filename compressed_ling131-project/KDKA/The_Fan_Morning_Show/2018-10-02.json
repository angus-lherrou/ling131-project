in hall joins us on our disc Institute of Pittsburgh ... she is the executive director of the Pittsburgh action against rape organization Alison good morning\nMorning\nHave your phone lines seen a reaction from the hearing last week\nYeah they have 'em that way during the day during the hearing I'm gay and straight doubled\nAnd I'm over night um I Would say there's an increase that not necessarily got old and I'm very different is that a lot of art therapy clients who have been coming in you know to deal with heroin assault I'm where\nI'm being triggered from the intensity of the hearing and therapists had to and from time um you know helping them um talk about\nCoping and you know refreshing them on on what to do when it comes up on a daily basis and frequently during the day as opposed to um the random times that if they can they be triggered\nYou know overall all of this going back to Bill Cosby and who is now in jail for what he was a convicted of doing to one of sixty nine women who accused him of ...\nIt was too much similar things but he's in jail it seemed like that started this whole Campbell Cade of ah\nPeople being accused Ninety nine percent of the men obviously are in these issues over the years and now a Supreme Court justice being accused of rape is a pretty serious attempted rape is a very serious charge and Dr a Christine Blasey Ford\nWith her credentials is probably one of the most when you when you look at the accusers somebody who has you know all these very high level credentials and yet I can see watching this how you know some people are trying to vilify her so my\nPoint to you as I I understand maybe a little bit of why anyone would be reluctant to bring charges forward or to talk about it because the victims often vilified\nCorrect um you know aside from you know even before a victim would come forward what goes through in their head and what they internally deal with\nIs the self blame of of the same questions that some other some outside individuals would ask you know why why did this happen to me what could I have done\nTo prevent this and the reality is is we really need to you know stop focusing on what women get wrong and focus on you know why men\nPerpetrate rape why individuals prey on women um you know we just had that the Catholic Church issue with with the priest\nUm you know where you don't focus on the offender we always look to find something wrong with the victim and the reality is is you know women if we want to look at what they could do to prevent raped the reality is they could do everything right and still experience a sexual assault\nAlison and we're talking with Alison hall from the uh Pittsburgh action against rapes\nThere might be someone listening to us right now who was the subject of a sexual assault in ... years ago with may have been recently\nBut one way or the other uh they're holding it in they're not telling anybody they're keeping it to themselves what harm do they do to themselves by not airing it\nWell I'm sure they feel very isolated I'm you know imagine carrying one of the most traumatic experiences say you have um keeping it secret\nHill isolated you feel like everybody else there is um major issues of depression anxiety if you look at victims there's increased\nRates of suicide eating disorders drug and alcohol issues um dysfunction relationship issues um\nYou know what you like to say is if people develop you know maladaptive you know not healthy coping skills to cope with it as opposed to you know seeking help so they understand that they in essence getting nothing wrong and you know that was perpetrated upon them and\n... help people sort that out in addition to learning how to cope with the triggers people think you know rape is something that you experience and you know over time you forget about it you don't you don't forget about it you learn how to cope with it\nYou know everybody thinks you know once you report to the place that you know everything's fine any forgotten about it and you ... you know it's not the case you're still living with that the trauma of that and the isolation of feeling victimized and then when you look at what happens in hearing\nAgain where victims are vilified\nThose are vilified you know you feel betrayed you feel betrayed by people who still continue to blame that them it's it's really sad commentary\nReally mud has this whole illumination of the issue helped allow people to reach out to you have you noticed an increase in calls to ah Pittsburgh action against rape\nWe have absolutely people have called 'em again it's it's pretty much doubled during the day people who have called victims themselves had called in addition to family members\nOr support network of victims to say you know how can I put my friend how can I support my child or or my wife who is experienced it\nSo it has brought awareness and um people have reached out which is a good thing that is what we want we want everyone who has experienced this or know somebody who has to reach out and find out how to support them\nAnd what is the best ... what's the best way to do

of the pirates in the community both guys really left their hearts and sold on the field for pirates fans uh I suspect each will explore free agency but we certainly won't close the door on either of those players coming back and you know\nComing back and you know is kind of fun download stretches pirates at a chance to play spoiler so they did they do have an ally mess with the division and it ends up Milwaukee about them on top and now Chicago has got to have that one off game\nGreat season for the Milwaukee Brewers gray season for the cubs as well I think the cubs wish they had taken one more game from the pirates in Chicago ah obviously we wish we would have taken one more from them splitting the series to two\nAnd a you know if the brewers don't make the run that they make and winning I think the last eight games of the season ah they don't make the play they don't win the division because uh the pirates had their number this year so while we had the brewers number this year uh we didn't play nearly well enough against\nFor instance National League east and we didn't play well enough on the road to when\nI'm so congratulations to the brewers terrific season a cubs are now they play to essentially one one game a playoff series or and or it could be very difficult to move on from the whoever wins between the Rockies and the cubs now has to go into the division series\nHaving played to winner take all games that's tough\nTo play also be very interesting to watch so let's talk about twenty Nineteen I had a couple of coaches who were let go yesterday announced that they're not coming back ... let's talk about the the L up in the room if you will will Clint Hurdle we back\nClint we'll be back no question or claims part of a our leadership team and a key part an important part he has made us better and let's I I'd like to go back to two thousand Eighteen and really quickly recap the season and I think it was from my perspective\nA significant step forward for the organization but obviously at the end not nearly good enough we need to be better in two thousand and Nineteen we improved in two thousand and Eighteen in many areas were excited about the team that heads into two thousand and Nineteen but\nWe have a real ... in that we need to be better our goal and objective is to win the world series and we fell a well short of that this year while we moved up into the top half of the league in terms of\nOne last record or we're out of the playoffs and we finished fourth in our division and that's not good enough\nMoving into two thousand and Nineteen Clinton will be a part of that moving forward we need to get better across the diamond or we start with a very very exciting starting pitching staff with Taiwan Williams\nArcher must grove and nova players pitchers who all had success this year tie on and Williams in particular a had tremendous success first time since Nineteen Ninety nine that we had to think Nineteen Ninety to excuse me since we had two fourteen game winners each of those young men really took his significant step forward\nThe bullpen is strong with Vasquez Crick Keller Rodriguez even with the loss of Santana\nA and the cornerstone of any baseball team is starting pitching\nUh obviously we need to get better offensively we we were a average if that offensive team with low power we need to find more production across the diamond\nBut we're very excited about the players were coming back uh Gregory ... long ago will work hard this off season he had a very strong year before he went out with his injury\nStarling march ... had a strong year but there's more there we know it\nIs I'm Francisco sir valley at a very strong year dealt with a lot of injuries but\nBattled back from those consistently to have a strong year Corey Dickerson had a terrific first year with the pirates some inconsistency there that he's looking to uh even out but still a very strong year and we know that while Josh bell has had\nA success both in terms of ...\nIn terms of ... the ball success average on base percentage power in two thousand and Seventeen we know that there's more there as well and we think the colon ran had a good rookie season for us but there's more there too so we're excited about the growth\nThat we can help these players are finding two thousand and Nineteen and we'll see what additions we can make to the personnel of the organization to help get us better because we need to be better\nSo it's like a giant ... puzzle you all sit down and the war room and you got all these pieces to interlocking as president it's more for you know the just the\nPlayers and individuals you're running the whole organization too\nSure of the systems and the the process sees and how we look at players how we look at players from our organization how we look at players outside of the organization and how we scaled how we develop scouting and develop in development will always be critical to us\nWe're excited about some of the young players a like a new man and a re us and Kramer who got their teeth cut cut some teeth this\nSeptember and in games that were meaningful a meaningful to us at the beginning of the month and a meaningful throughout the division for the rest of the month\nAnd got some great experience and we look forward to them being a part of our team as we move forward\nYou know the question is do you need to spend some money and bring in a big bat\nLarry it's I mean the giant it's never up just about money you look at the Oakland A's this year they start at

Fifteen dollars minimum wage\nThere are a lot of people in town who are going to benefit yeah I'm curious if he knows how many\nAre influenced by working for Amazon and whole foods yeah we got over there in those over there are a lot of people\nRich\nHow many people will this affect directly in the region do you have a number on the Amazon employees and also those that a whole foods\nI I Do not um you know we know that they have a few thousand employees here or in the Pittsburgh region\nOr many of which are you know some of the software engineers they have their obviously you're making making more than that but for the warehouse workers and then of course when they took over the whole foods operation a year or so ago that will affect those workers but I think it also sends a signal that one of America's largest employers\nUm is is doing this and then putting out a challenge for others to do that and again we actually get the same thing about a year ago you know along with the mayor and and you say to\nTo to encourage everybody because look if you're working full time if you're you know in a what's the older you know work hard play by the rules you deserve the not the live in poverty to have a a a decent lifestyle and and for those folks that get up every day and go to work\nThey deserve it at the very minimum to back you know that type of wage\nKnow one of the things that Jeff ... says the c._e._o. of Amazon said a winning announcing this this morning saying we're excited about this change and we encourage our competitors and other law\nAnother large employers to join us know if I recall correctly when you and the mayor did your increases you also challenged others in town to follow suit and do the same thing has there been much response locally to those challenges\nI think there has I couldn't quantify it right now and would probably have to try to check some of those figures and check some of the ... the data on that but\nIt was it was received very positively um and again as you know ah UPN said at the same thing around that same time so it really was kind of the private sector or the public sector and you know with heard that from the Allegheny Conference with us from our labor\nCommunity the AFL CIA oh you know we've really heard that that this is a fairness issue it's an economic development issue it's a community a development issue so again the fact that it's still seven twenty five\nAt the national level quite frankly that it's embarrassing the Congress hasn't taken this up and move this along at our state legislature Governor Walker has pushed for this for for Pennsylvania or to do this so there are an awful lot of people that said that believe it and that's the thing that should be done\nAnd and I applaud Amazon and Jeff Bezos for also stepping out and doing this\nRich while we have you are looking at the job prospects as we uh get into a new year this region after the announcements from Allegheny health network and then you PM see about their expansion of their physical plan so hospitals jobs the\nThe cracker plan and beaver county power we poised for the new year\nWhile on a job as a standpoint we're poised extremely well\nAnd just last week just on friday a couple of big announcements Philip prosper onyx talking about Fifteen hundred new jobs in east liberty where you know and and Facebook made the announcement that they're going to do as many as four or five hundred jobs done and the strip district that follows on oracle announcing that they are going to\nPut out an operation here it was a cracker plant a lot of people would dissipate there might be a second cracker plant\nOr along the Ohio Valley river so our challenge right now I think is to to get the skills to get more workers with the skills to be able to do these jobs and quite frankly we're gonna have to bring in more people from outside the region to do all the work that that's going on and uh it's gonna be going on in the next five years\nYou know you mentioned the cracker play which obviously isn't beaver county urban outfitters an outsider's announcing they're going to do a thirty million dollar facility in Indiana county\nHow much of this is a competition between ourselves for these kinds of places 'cause I Can't imagine than Allegheny county didn't say urban outfitters well we got a place over here for you\nTo be honest with you John we we we work for is a region and and if a company\nWants that to you know come to this region whether they want to be in the urban core or maybe closer to the airport or across the line and cranberry or beaver county or South Korean or as you mentioned Indiana county that's good for all of us you know I I think that is\nYou know dividing lines that you know some people talk about I really don't think it's just that much because most of us\nLive in regions where we don't live in an area where we don't work and family members that do the same thing or we have family members who live in West Marin County so in ... that says that may be located in ... county there will be doing work\nAh it it it Google or doing work it over so I think the way we cross lines in in our economy and so as long as it's coming to the region that's really what I care about\nWell the bottom line is this is\nThe news for everybody right it is\nIt really does lift all boats and that's part of the challenge that we want to make sure that you know everybody enjoys the prosperity that works very thing here in the Pittsburgh region right now and we want to keep that momentum

for today and the FBI as I\nUnderstand it does not form an opinion they simply present the information they find in their investigation but it would seem to me that it's going to take a while for the
