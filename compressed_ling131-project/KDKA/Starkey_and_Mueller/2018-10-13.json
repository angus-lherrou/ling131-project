stories the one question came up as you know how meaningful is your life so I just shared my stop I think you know for an immigrant coming you're a lot of good stuff but\nI Want to share one story of one of my friends there and you listen to us for a long time when I got a master's fan Steve runs a biotech company back there\nBut his real passion is he's taken in these old friends um I'm off the street and he's got a much podium them that there is sort of supporters and\nYour reputation is absolutely Stalin and your passion puppets orange is so deep [laughter] you know I found the go to the scores of articles but here's what I wanted to start\nThe one place I couldn't find a great deal of story was about the ... take days\nAnd it it looks like a fairly Nineteen Ninety two thousand for like ... years fairly short span for men dressed success so can you share with our audience a Bob you know the ... story from you know your point of view\nBut you know ... that goes back to Eighteen sixty nine started here in Pittsburgh and the important part was\nThan the old days traders used to be going there was a break men on every car and flag burning up on the front and on top of the ... the flag man would signal to put the brakes on every car the break room would turn the wheel and put the brakes on until the train finally stopped\nThat you can picture what that would be like how long you can take a train number one number to one of the stormy in dark out\nAre you seeing those flags and or do you turn that wheel and how about when you come to a tunnel so these are things that\nGeorge Westinghouse at the age of like Twenty one or twenty two so felt the automatic air break in this revolutionized all industry and now what we do is we have a compressor in the locomotives with air that goes through the whole train\nWhen the air is off the train stops one error is on the train keeps going and the engineer in the front of the train he someone decides whether the ears on or off so it's a great thing is is a failed proof system\nA and that I think has been the catch words of ... break from the beginning never an accident never anything that could be a system which could cause people aren't\nUh makes Herrera is one of the safest\nGathering today in the world now that's awesome so when you got started how how did you know what was that process there\nWhile I worked for Chrysler for a a number of years and I came as a financial head to a ... break here in Pittsburgh and that was in Nineteen eighty\nAnd in Nineteen eighty the uh the overseas market got tight Pittsburgh was in a bit of a recession and during that time [noise] uh and it was it was tough ... break was the part of American standard toilet people [laughter]\nAnd uh and it was interesting we did a a a management buyout in eighty four uh four\nA for American standard where they had a a ... a ... and what we did is we leverage the company up\nAnd when you were able to then by out all the shareholders that are good price and then basically we gave all the people in the company a chance to own a piece of the rock and we uh June is what's his signal in Swiss fail\nA way of fluids power and we had was the house here break those were the main energies in this area uh then about\nNineteen Ninety\nAh American standard was trying to pay down some of its debt in order to pay down has said it had to sell some units\n... was never ... co at that time was never planned to be one of those to be sold for bank check had some problems are unions switches signal had some issues and so a lot of units that were to be sold couldn't be so they put Web go up for sale\nAnd we did our best we had a group in England the Lucas curling was going to buy at a everything went well right up until the end uh when we had a few problems in our European operation so all of a sudden they just said well we're going to cut the press\nAnd when they said that\nAmerican standard came to us and said\nWould you like to buy this is the man is renting a management and so the management team then had the opportunity or working with the Swedish or break company to buy\n... and then to actually focus on doing what's right to make it better than us as we were very small company we were probably three hundred billion in sales\nBut you know we had we had\nThree main issues or one we were just North American or European orange had been separated and given the Swedish or break people we were mostly\nOriginal equipment so that meant you know if the business was good with a lot of cars are being built\nThan our business was great if is this was not so good in cars weren't being built or locomotives not being ... than we weren't so good and so we had a lot of up and down by him\nAnd then third we we're a rust belt American Company so those are the issues that weight to and as a team I\nTackled a our CEO Bill Cassidy was still a good Pittsburgh resident that uh he he started the system of cousins and owner was the head of Toyota and I don't know I had a a system to try and goes through and\nBring every product down to his smallest element and solve it so\nWhat we did is we started to have these ... or you have a group of people that come together in a plant\nMaybe five six people to look at a product and the study and map the product out come up with the spaghetti shards of how it moves all over the place and then some of the next two days they move liquid ... to put everything in one cell one area\nAnd then I prayed for a day or two and all of a sudden is one piece flow it's pick it up so that down complete\nThere's pride by the operators and it there there's a racks put right there with all the tools and he's so becomes very fish and the operator a is very happy with how the product comes out and\nYou end up where you need no inventory it's it took millions of dollars that we had stacked through the plant and vigilant trial away but number one fest\nJuan ... is a took lean times from six months down to two weeks ... now the customer if he wanted something he could get ... yeah and he got it with a lot of pride of the ... the a union people we were all union and the union shops actually first more concerned\nWith as they solve their lives got better\nAnd it wasn't a job in packed\nIt was an impact on even Atari right\nThere were all for it and I send the union members actually started joining in and they found we paid attention to what they said\nThey were a big part in solving the problem for where they worked and it just became something every plant adopted in our efficiency more than tripled and we just kept doing it planned after plant year after year an account and in today you'll hear people say your mood waist\nHigh sounds do a monthly continual continuous some pricey and so that's solved are run by a vote America\nOr what it did even more freedom a lot of cash so that now we could buy other ... and we went we found adjacent companies that similar kind of products but a little different\nWe moved into the ... business in a long way we moved into the repair business going along with it can still dealing primarily with Israel but now early problem went away we we're no longer dependent on just car buyers we now had\nWill translate as we all knew was counter cyclical when ... this is doing well in the economy\nFor instance kinda low keeps going lo when a business goes down government makes up and shy so they became Andy Stern us a call and repair is always a good despair and the last twelve months a year so now we basically solve our elite pro\nSewing and I'm Nineteen Ninety we were about three hundred million\nAnd that the next twelve years we build up with these acquisitions internal improvements to be two billion in sales and then during the next twelve years which brings us up to the day we then focused on buying international competition growing internationally and now we're four billion dollar company\nAnd ladies and gentlemen we need to go to a commercial right now um and uh you know the next step of the ... the gene integration they go from four billion ... billion Phil headquartered in Pittsburgh so stay here where we're going to be a ride back and ladies and gentlemen\nHow many of you know somebody at the at the management and own level of eleven billion dollar company knowing mergers and acquisitions and grow like he'd like like Bob shared with us from three hundred million to ... billion\n... billion and then be going to go into story on on you know sports franchises and his public service so all of this coming right out ah say to every game\nRemember thinking mom had ice in the back of her head Lakers superpower was spot in trouble before it happened well now it's not enough to protect our home and family and spotting troubles way tougher\nThat's my parents pressed blink blink video cameras are motion activated so placing them around your home is like having ice everywhere\nBlink cameras or wire free set up in minutes and run on two deadly batteries last up to two years ... technology\nAnd finally the fourth is called culture the Cancer Center [laughter] you know the symphony of theaters live theater so we have all four\nAnd that's what it takes to sustain companies because engineers researchers are people want to live where they have all of those advantages and values for their family for themselves and that's why\nPittsburgh can be a corporate headquarters there and we need to stay focused on making sure we have all those an offer great things or I just got my sympathy took a ... a [laughter] that's great\nBut I you know it seemed to me if you take baseball and have it move out of the city or hockey and have him move algae or that much less atoll around the city or\nMaybe we could be a ... a man that I don't think we wanted to be that we want to be Pittsburgh\nUm so so you sort of you know invested with the power of states sort of you know not have the ... and then the penguins when they were facing the bankruptcy or care and situation there and then your your your your company or broke sports group zones a number of a minor league so I\nHave a couple business related questions show on you know since I was just curious here when you have these superstar athletes and it's going to be true with any business too\nBut with any business to what is the management style to deal with these because these people like the prima donnas in some sense that in a bad way but you know how well you know they're\nThrilled team it's great but it did not pro team and makes it very difficult ... wondering why do you have what our listeners who and they may not be a pro steamed maybe if there's a rock star ...\nWho they you know who calls the shots\nOr you know that I think part of the biggest time for Pittsburgh was when we had been the bonds and uh you know we had ... ... are still lives in Pittsburgh today he was a main\nSource of management that understood\nThe high needs and companies we have a way of engineers really take a lot of maintenance or just like the ... but it's good maintenance as\nHis team building and if you can fill those members not only being a producers on the field but locker people and leaders in the locker room\nNow you have a real team and I think Pittsburgh's had some great\nPeople in the past uh uh you know cuts was a great yeah and I remember I was with my grandson my grandson has his shirt on number twenty two in the back\nCountry comes over and he says hey I've got a number like ... ... that's the kind of people you know most people to come to Pittsburgh are down there in Marysville we have a miracle ...\nAnd this miracle fill a said Bream I tend to call the is named bill ... bill comes to these guys will come out and they they said please don't advertise for going to be there and they have all the team members and they play catch with them they\nThey work with them or they make it real and I think that's the other things worse teams with ah they've sold us and the the bans charity a baddie pages and the virus charity\nSay reach out through the community and do so much good or there's no books for school or it's a you know really building playgrounds they do it all yeah\nAnd other things sports teams does gives a channel for the kids you know instead of getting in trouble gives them some aspirational goals to it you know whether it's minor league are major league gives them a channel out there and that sort of builds a society at large\nTo have slowly not only that but they get a chance in many cases uh to go to college on a paid a scholarship because of the skills they've gotten as they work their way up I find that\nMost athletes in the in the high school and graceful they're really spend most of their time folks that that that keeps them out of any kinds of mischief\nBut it's the same time it develops their skills are team building and their ability to actually go on from there\nLet me ask you this about sports teams and I really don't know this arena all all that well\nIf they're sort of a challenge between sort of like especially if we're beings and I you know non in markets that are not like New York or San Francisco [noise] how do you balance the banning worse is profitability equation\nThat that's a that's a tough one for middle markets you know as you look at St Louis St Louis does it every year you know I I'm One of the owners of the uh the spikes in state college which is a St Louis a minor league team\nAnd the talent I watch them bring through in developing does it mean St Louis ... they'll have a team every year there's always going to be good [noise] ah we lost our way uh when we first bought the the pirates are back\nBack in Ninety six and a pill in that period up to like oh seven we didn't develop our minor league sweet what's so players to try and get players because we wanted to perform but people\nThat they didn't want that kind of an extra so I think\nGo Huntington came in and like seven uh and so that Frank currently I'm from that point on what we did is we said we're going to really build the minor league teams and when you build the minor league teams you have these players for a number of years and then\nPeople can identify with them they develop their skills I mean\nAre we picked up looking bell a plan to go to mark the guys all came up from the minor leagues that's how you build a good team today and then you go about it today I think our pictures or some of the best pitchers we've got ... it's just\nYou know the ... when they shouldn't be ants we've had times where we have twelve games we went in a row and then we have plans for the call we don't ... I think that comes back to the fact they argue them and they're coming up uh we should be in the playoffs the sure there's no doubt with this team we should be in the playoffs this year\nAnd a you know so that's the\nOnly turn her yeah on that but gosh like\nHurdle do make a difference in his players player when I watch them in the spring training he talks the players a race or age is probably the best guy I Know as far as dealing with pitchers are and that's why we have such good pitching staff and it\nIt's just you watch the managers they make a difference yeah\nSo I'm thinking about ... going to go to a commercial break and we'll be right back uh where are our guests Barbara ties\nTo heroin mixed promises promises that can't keep believe them once and you could get hooked and then

lion of the Senate after many years after he did all the nasty thing\nYeah ... ... you know in the in the ... this crazy saying was this cabinet I'm saying turned into people's to keep talking about it like a trial\nIt was just it was a hearing to see whether he was qualified to be on the Supreme Court in a lot of people based on what he said uh didn't think so but you know guilty or not there there was no way that that wasn't that wasn't what was being discussed at the time but a lot of that bend to it but\nWhat a shame you know when they couldn't get him about one thing they brought something up from Thirty years ago about something else like a woman who was the best friend said no she never talked about the party and there was a party\nWell they I mean there's been all this is

on the air so I'm going to try and for the nine thirty tomorrow morning I Want to see these guys are news of Bob bats that a great story in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette\nA couple of days ago about\nGoalie for the team who is blind I thought it was just a joke what\nBut they had blind hockey in Canada for fifty years\nAnd somebody told me there are blind hockey players would you call them referees ha but is there is a Canadian all blind hockey team and for the past fifty years they've played against themselves because no one else had organized a blind hockey team but in the United\nBut in the United states has and they've got they've got some players that are not totally blind but they would be considered blind because of how bad their vision is ... day really cannot see 'em\nBut the goalie to be a goalie and be blind and here's how they do it the goal which\nIs usually six by four is is narrower it's probably four by three so it's a little bit of a smaller a net the puck is twice the size of the regular National Hockey league park which is\nThree inches in diameter so it's six inches in diameter and it has ball bearings inside it but it's metal with ball bearings inside of it so the players\nKey on the sound of the puck I think it's amazing and as a goalie you you square up on the sound\nAnd um it it's pretty interesting 'cause I I mean it sounds very interesting I

on the media but here goes this person says you've got some real old bags on the damn side shut your racist mouth angry Joanne\nOh come on is that really necessary\nCourse isn't um so getting back ... shaggy story\nOr about the the apple watch in if he did that I'm like whoa dude that's that's good thinking on for a you know an unfortunate in for the for the man's terrible but\nIf that's the case he has the final word on the final story right uh so this investigation continues on from CNN they're saying if an apple watch is connected to an I ... this is from the apple\nThe audio back to his iPhone via Bluetooth would have been incredibly unwise for someone like a shaggy and self imposed exile from Saudi Arabia rabies log into Saudis counselor why why fire right\nSo but security in technology experts say audio dated data is unlikely to have been able to ah have traveled via Bluetooth from his apple watch inside\nThe Saudi counselor to his fiance outside because that system of transmission only has a short range\nWell I'm telling you this is like ... is like reading the spy novel CNN intelligence and security analyst Robert Baer to Anderson Cooper he believes any audio recordings from inside the consulate could only have come from a quip meant the Turkish government placed inside the building\nI think what's happened clearly is the Turks have the Saudi counselor wired they have transmitters the Turks don't trust any diplomats and they've been well okay maybe it was that and they have been into most embassies in most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's going on and if indeed there are tapes proving that he was murdered\nOr he goes on to say I think that's probably how they know but the Turks are very reluctant to admit that I get that\nIs I I guess it really of whether it was on an apple device\nPoor he used some listening device that the Turks had installed in Saudi consulate ... if if if it got the story out who cares he this guy goes on to say the apple watches a silly distraction um and on and on and on and there's there's more about this um and nobody's talking\nYou know nobody's really giving any indication of of of how this is going but that's crazy oh my gosh\nSo will this is a story that's going to continue on uh the president's been very coy about ... what he's going to do he's he is kind of brusque and his comments saying you know this is going to we're going to take care of it and Lindsey Graham why Lindsey Graham I don't know\nSaying you know they'll have held and pay and all that stuff but nothing nothing concrete\nUm so what\nHe does I don't know but he's receiving a lot of criticism a for taking this angle um\nHe and the ... to other stories is that there's a story out now are not yet confirmed that are non junior has not paid any taxes in years like his father and I don't know if you saw any of the money a Trump interview yesterday but she's completely changed her story\nI'm ... and now now she and she ... she uses the term left wing which didn't sound authentic to me I mean that's how she talked she she doesn't speak in political terms ever um and so it a lot of people are saying uh especially on the left that she has been coached\nOr to say things like that a ... and ... and she completely changed her story I'm so she's she says she was blindsided by zero zero tolerance immigration policy so the people are looking at this thing going on\nThat but so you got this thing going on\nUm with millennia which is really not a story this whole thing was ... which is a big story and getting bigger as it goes along a and then and then you've got in your hearing Bob Mueller's name surface again\nAnd apparently they've asked submitted questions to the um the Trump White house and they are answering them because because they can't put the president in front of Bob Mueller because they know not that they are afraid or they think he might\nOr they think he might or they could be let down a blind alley they know he's going to lie I mean they're essentially saying that are caving in to that that we're not gonna we're not going to have him do this because he'll perjured himself\nAnd a ... so that the Bob ... Mahler thing is surfacing again and chances are\nThat they'll answer these questions was very ... legal or answers are giving themselves in out for everything\nAnd my guess is that a mall or will look at that and say that's ... we know this ... you have no idea what we know but that's not the answer is we're looking for we're looking for the real answer and they're going to subpoena the president which I Do believe they can't um so it\nThe the knees in\nPittsburgh let's get beyond me don't have a lot of time you do do you there you are you're yelling at\nMe and you are now how would I Want and I my son are angry man to be accused I'm a woman but I Know that there are women who rely as Matt Hi to\nHim oh sure how how would you like to be killed if that's something you didn't you\nKnow one wouldn't want that absolutely I agree a hundred percent absolutely not\nI don't think they have power over their cash against Kavanaugh\nWell they're ... that was the interesting thing it proof was not really necessary because it was a hearing you know it wasn't it wasn't a trial and that's that's where it gets really crazy\nAnd probably why they didn't want to do it because there's no way to to verify or ... or or not and verify and I only have one\nChild who we are we going to be when you go to John to be ruined chewing away from you is because my hearing\nYes a hair and for here say well let me see and she said well the I I you know what happened to you\nI I I agree with you a hundred percent nobody would want that but in this case all it would have meant is that he didn't make it onto the Supreme Court he was a hearing to say to say that this guy\nIs without a doubt the guy that should be on the Supreme Court in a lot of people so many people had differences thank you for your call D I appreciate it so many people had differences with\nWhat was said during that hearing and again it wasn't a trial there wasn't going to be guilty or not guilty it was simply a character study it was a job interview it was I don't know is this guy right and and it obviously went along party lines\nOr it certainly became political\nBut it raised so many women have the questions in so many men as well saying ... he he was not the guy for the Supreme Court it doesn't make any difference now unfortunately he is on the Supreme Court so that that's done\nI got to take a break I'm done here Anthony will kick us off in the next half hour and we got some um [noise] a text to read as well as we continue our news radio ten twenty K DJ [noise]\nYeah we sort of stopped paying attention and racked up a lot of\nThat yeah it was ... he blinked an eighth on my credit card debt and I can for building not man cave\nIt's awesome anyway we stop blaming each other dinner homework and read that a smart way to consolidate debt is to get a fixed rate loan but getting a loan was brutal and time drain so I was in my man cave researching personal loans and I found best egg they have an a plus rating with a bb\nAnd best they handles everything on line start to finish\nAnd which probably hurt Democrats and I I warned them when you get attached to some of these movements that can go a completely off the rails you'll be painted with it and then this you know this McCarthy types of food does me too is very distressing and a lot of people should be distressed\nBecause when you have thirty six year old accusation where nothing can be verified there's no forensics there's nothing and then it does harm this man's reputation er and that's not good man I'm Sorry\nNo and but you know what also made a bad was the way that it was rushed through it was you know and granted they didn't want to have any more\nUm investigations but I think that also hurt because that also made people think well what are they trying to hide you know and and I agree with what you said about his reputation and nothing was able to be verified that's one thing the other side of it though just made the doubters doubt more because they are thinking\nWell why wouldn't they talk to more people\nWho don't listen to those doubters who are so concerned about cab and all we're where they win the Republican ham struck Merrick Garland nomination\nYeah didn't belong to have a hearing now than they could've they could have rectify that in that election that came up sixty they didn't do it and there was a plane to follow the Hillary and all these other things and allow the trumps here to win by Seventy thousand votes and now they're so concerned\nAnd now they're so concerned now they want to stop people in elevators to complain\nThey do that for Mary garlic\nIt is a different time your your I get ya because it's fake phony it's phony outrage [noise] well [noise] here we are an [laughter] not at all I call it the\nAppreciate it meant to talk with you take care of our\nSecurity than some in Oakland or he does call it as you see it I asked why I enjoy speaking with him\nUm ... this Texas high stony or do we have enough time there yeah there's a high stony did you have any opinion on the circus that Kanye West brought to the White House\nWhat did you take away from it did you understand his ultimate point are you just over ... did say one or two truthful things but I think he wants more attention than anything\nBecause just like Trump calling us is very narcissistic also did you have an opinion about the whole thing\nThanks um yeah I I had an opinion\nThat was it was just cheap ah reality television I think Trump likes to have somebody in his pocket telling him how great he is he he's thoroughly enjoyed that they could have had if they had had if if the story would have been Kanye West\nCame to the White House today sat down with the president in the oval office from what we are told they had discussions about a number of things ah they came out shook hands and and said Hi to everybody and that was it that would have been a different story but this was obviously\nA media event created by the president in ... near west uh I think he knows that he is going to be campaigning he's setting up his campaign or if it has to be\nFor the Post's I'm an election stuff in November\nThat let's say the Democrats take over the house in the Senate he is he's going to he is then gonna have to behave differently and he's got to get some cheerleaders in his corner not\nNot a not staff people he needs cheerleaders in his corner and in Kenya West is a good choice for that so I think that's why that's why he did that\nUm I wasn't impressed by it I'm not impressed by Kanye West in any way\nAt all ah and but I\nI don't even know you know his his his his music his his his art uh and I don't really care that much about him at all um I Do see that there is value in for all candidates for all politicians these days to have\nCelebrities in their corner because it does it does make sense people do listen\nPeople can complain about Taylor Swift people can complain about Kanye West but when he says stuff there are a lot of people who may be on the on the fence are are are just tired of Trump maybe but if if there are like in tight with Kanye they go\nMan my man county and says okay you know what I'm doing a ... it's a poster boy for mental health he does he does have some you know I I Do think he has some problems too I I\nGet that um\nBut I think he likes to hear him self talk and who better to have listened to you then a guy who likes to cure or anybody else's voice as long as they're talking about him to narcissistic walk into a bar [laughter]\nYou you make the punch line up but there it is so that's my feeling I I didn't I didn't really think\nThat was on the air the day after that happened I we even talk about it because I just didn't think it was a story we're talking about or worth getting people all upset that are so many other things going\nThe things going on in the country the the the remnants of the hurricane the damages from the hurricane this whole ... story um ... the election coming up a ... there are a lot of things to deal with it that are are not being talked about\nAt all and I wish the president would stop talking about deals and start talking about\nSomething that they put together that has to do with policy we've got a new policy we've got a new cruise we've got a new agreement as opposed to a deal I mean we're we're not building hotels somebody tell this man we're not building hotels areas waiting in Kentucky I Want to see how he did with the ponies 'cause he was\nBetting on horses
