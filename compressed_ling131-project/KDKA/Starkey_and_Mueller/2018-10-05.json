Institute of Pittsburgh newsletter and Laurie welcome the decay radio good to have you\nHi thanks for having me\nNot one of those things that you point out in a story that's available and fact check dot org is that President Trump has repeatedly said things incorrectly just flat out wrong regarding the testimony of Dr Ford how was that\nYes so this was a a rally in Mississippi um earlier this week and the president was a mocking um soccer Fort memory of the event and and the next day or the White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked about that and and she said that the president was\nSimply stating facts that forward had given in her testimony but he got some of those facts wrong I'm for one he quoted forward as saying I had one beer that's the only thing I remember\nUm but Ford of course provided many details I'm of the alleged attack and her testimony\nUm and then there were a number of little things and uh the president's remarks he said for didn't know what year the alleged attack occurred but she has that summer of eighty two he said she didn't know if it was upstairs downstairs but she said it was a bedroom upstairs\nUm there were of course the details that ... that she did not remember such as how she got to ... uh the party and home from the parties\nKnow on the issue of the summer of eighty two there have been conflicting reports even regarding that year I mean there have been some that have said in her their accounts of her telling the story that it was somewhere in the mid eighties and not specific to a year though\nMhm yeah Rachel Mitchell she was the prosecutor that Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Judiciary Committee hired to question Ford during the hearing and she wrote a memo on detailing some inconsistencies\nThat and and some other gaps in Fords memory and she brought up the\nUh the year I'm mentioning that one Ford had texted the Washington Post um at some point the summer she said mid eighties in her letter to I'm senator Feinstein's off as she said early eighties uh and then um\nWhen the Washington Post story her first up a public interview about this came out in September she you pinpointed it to this she said she believed it was the summer of Nineteen eighty to\nLaurie Robertson is joining us She's managing editor at ... dot org and you can see the stories regarding the president and Dr Ford available there there's something else that needs to be talked about and it's something that ultimately is going to have a tremendous amount of impact\nFor many Americans if not all and is the issue of health care and preexisting conditions and claims by the president's regarding those what did you find\nSure um well this week I was another rally I'm just wondering wheeling West Virginia on he said that a quote pre existing conditions are safe\nAnd and then he went on to say that he would quote always fight for patients with pre existing conditions so it's interesting because the Justice Department is citing with plaintiffs in a lawsuit\nThat the Justice Department said if the accessible would end the Affordable CARE Act protection for those with preexisting condition um so it's a little complicated but the the lawsuit which has been found in a district court in Texas a it saying that since the attacks\nSaying that in the pack a penalty associated with the individual mandate at the requirement that you have insurance\nI think that taxes now been eliminated by Congress that the mandate itself must be unconstitutional and the whole law and let's go uh and the Justice Department took the rare step of saying that it would not defend the federal government in that last year and in that it came out\nOn the ... largely on the side of the plane is ah the attorney general Jeff Sessions explained this in a letter to Congress earlier this summer and he said they that the administration didn't agree that the entire Affordable Care act would have to be scrapped if at all but that the administration did agree that two provision\nI wouldn't need to go away as well and those are the provisions caring gene that someone can't be denied coverage by an insurer or charge more based on certain factors
