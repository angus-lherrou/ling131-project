who's had groceries delivered have you what am I missing if you've\nDone this is a great one of the most wonderful things ever I I'm just curious about this 'cause I've never experienced ... never even really thought they'd be been trying it because to me grocery shopping as one of those things that you need to go and do for you except for like the staples\nWe a AAA do a lot of events Robert we do things ... things we do events to help the mature drivers that their vehicles or we have a long list of community events we do this is the most popular one\nThat we have going right now I just I just didn't want in Allentown and we had more than two hundred cars pull through our line with boxes of documents\nReady to be shredded so yeah very popular that were really excited to bring it to our pleasant hills branch because we just wrapped up some renovation at that ... it looks brand new and we're really happy really excited to get people over there to get their boxes shredded\nOkay what kind of things can people bring\nWell you know sometimes some sometimes people come through the line they have\nBoxes of they've had their basement for years things like credit card offers bank statements they get in the mail or old checkbook she may have lying around medical records credit reports anything with sensitive information on it you bring it through that line as long as as long as you're not bringing us anything metal\nOr as long as you're bringing us all paperwork ... even if it's in a plastic bag that's fine too or would we take up to five boxes of him and when you come to the er the pleasant hills branch which is right on fifty one it's rape asked the uh\nLebanon church road interchange with fifty one you pull into the wind you don't even have to get out of your car full through and we make it as easy as we possibly can for everybody\n... give us an idea these boxes you say five boxes I'm picturing maybe computer printer paper boxes yeah we're talking about is\nThat yeah that that's mostly what we get as a banker size boxes and and uh we we take 'em out of the car ... read them there on the site and you know Robert it's it's for it's for a great reason I you know working in the news industry just as well as anybody a how prevalent\nIdentity theft is becoming in our culture I just before we did this interview I went over to Google News I typed in the worst data\nAnd the fraud every two seconds so with that what are you doing to protect yourself is is just one of the things that we offer a and not just to our members but to the general public\n... normally when you think about identity theft now so oftentimes it's about what's happening on line but there is still the old fashioned way of people gaining access to your information that you think\nIs no big deal you're just throwing it away but there are those who are looking for opportunities to get your information that way to go through different offers that are in the mail right\nI yeah I ... so I just moved and uh and I had to order a new debit card and it occurred to me that it's been a couple of months and I forgot to change my address with my back\nHome so I was thinking to myself oh my you know oh my goodness I Wonder what's which letters were heading there\nThings like that that you may not be thinking of but you get your point identity theft isn't a new crime but you know with technology the way that it is today it's certainly more prevalent\nUh that's why we're offering this is one of the events we offer but there's also something that we're trying to get the word out more and more about because we really want our members to be taking advantage of a free service\nWe offer called protect my id Robert are you by chance of triple a member die am you are are you signed up for the you're free to protect my id\nWhere I Am I not that I think I may have overlooked at what is this\nOkay so it's identity theft protection that we offer freedom members\nWe have three tiers of at the basic tier which is protect my ideas central that's what's free and that you get your you get a credit report\nYou get lost ... protection you get a certain amount of identity theft insurance but then you can also you know purchase for either eleven bucks a month or sixteen dollars a month that election platinum which offer a lot more options like dark Web surveillance by Social Security number monitoring\nChild I then they monitoring social media monitoring a yeah there's a whole list of it\nUm but just you know even if you're still on the fence about\n... you know buying the eleven or the sixty dollar a month option if you're a triple a number we have free identity theft protection I Can't stress that enough and it's available to you\nThat sounds really good so often times we have membership to the different things and then don't fully understand what all is available to us\nAnd this sounds like another one of those examples where do you think about AAA for roadside assistance and you may not think about it for other things but there's just so much more that comes along with the car than just that\nYet another example of and you know I I say this and it it is to get out of the calculator you can add up the triple a membership does actually\nFor itself if you're using it and you're getting everything you can out of it more than pays for itself\nAnd a ... within the year so when people come to a a shredded events were were really on top of making sure that they're at least aware that this free identity theft protection auction knowledge is available to them and I and it's really really easy to sign up you just go to a a a dog a flash id theft\nA dot com slash ID that that's the easiest way to do it you could also stop in any one of the
