to go there quite yet [noise] speaking of a no sense to be made and whether or not there is sense to be made of it how about this\nWe are so concerned with the possibility of outsiders outside of this country trying to impact our elections that for Pennsylvania voters Pennsylvanians\nWho are outside the country right now and we'll be through election day\nWe're making it very difficult for them to vote you're joining us right now from a unit Germany is the CEO and president of the nonprofit us vote foundation Susan Sweeney and Susan welcome to cater gay radio good to have you\nGood evening for me that afternoon to you thank you for having me on your show\nThis is very very important ... there are thousands and thousands of people\nWho are or who are us citizens live in Pennsylvania however for whatever reason they're outside the country sometimes is for middle to reach a reasons who knows what the other reasons may be\nBut it seems as though when our effort to try to secure our elections we may have made things really difficult and complicated for those of you outside the country to be able to vote what's been the experience like for you to this point\nWell what's going on right now oh sorry for that I Will\nStop that noise um excuse me what's going on right now in Pennsylvania a we have seen in other states in the past we see it now and then and it's a the problem is it's rather serious right now in Pennsylvania and that's that\nVoters are being overseas on military voters who\nHave requested their ballot to be delivered on line which we are allowed to do on the ballot retrieval online is essentially block a\nVoters are going to the Pennsylvania website to download their ballads and they're basically getting an error message a and no instruction about where to go and what to do a live can result\nObviously and really frustrated voters on some level of voter suppression because voters will be\nYou know disturbed or worded or just plain old confused and you know they don't have all the time in the world to to you know you you follow the instructions that doesn't work and then most people aren't sophisticated enough\nTo try and other technical methods I mean some people\nAre but not not the average voter so what's happening is that they're really unable to retrieve that are about\nAnd um this come about because as you were saying the obvious thing is that we are under attack as a nation in our elections we are\nUh the target of foreign nation state I'm In many different ways and the states are having to respond to that and it's a bit overwhelming so\nThey seem to have in some cases like this one\nTake in a sort of elementary approach and I say that was some sympathy because I understand they want to protect themselves but this is a completely self defeating shooting yourself in the foot way of doing it um basically they're blocking all the good people they're blocking the voters\nVery effectively voters who are overseas trying to get their ballots replied for them military voters um civilians\nBut bad actors know how to get around that stuff I mean it doesn't prevent the hacker from getting into the server it just\nThe average voter from accessing there about\nSo um [laughter] yeah that's kind of the situation in Pennsylvania right now and I do want to say that I just saw a news wire I'm a release go out from the acting secretary of state Robert ...\nI'm not too long ago just about an hour hour and had to go um basically acknowledging this and telling voters\nThe message when they encounter the problem and ah it's really not out of that [noise] um there's really no magic and I'm\nSo hold on one second Susan you're telling me that if somebody tries to go on and to vote that they are directed on uh how\nThey can just go ahead and get get the fix if you will they have to know you're out what the fix is otherwise through listening to a newscast or or going out and looking up a new story about this online are going to the department of state a Web site\nThey're being held to go to a\nRather obscure email address for help desk or to call a certain number but let me tell you that\nMhm I'm sitting in Germany right now I'm In overseas though there is well if I go to the Web site that is designed for downloading overseas ballot I get\nA very sort of strange not available message I don't get any indication of where to go with it [noise] yeah\nWhat for somebody like\nMe and I'll just say we have the overseas vote website overseas ... we'd been servicing healthy overseas in military letters for Fifteen Years\nUm [noise] ... it's pretty obvious that if they stay in\nThe vein yeah is offering military in overseas voters online and ballot to download they had their email addresses and they could probably proactively notify them\nNot that the central thing Susan\nA county on voters to understand the get a VPN or a virtual private network and work around it and pretend they're in the U.S when they're not that's way too sophisticated for most people and really not realistic\nAnd it is it hot\nAir Susan I Wish I had more time to talk to you I Do appreciate you're making yourself
