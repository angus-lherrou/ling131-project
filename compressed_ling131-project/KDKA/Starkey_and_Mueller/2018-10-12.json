similar businesses to get connected to Amazon lungs fat and to look at investors\nSeattle has a has a wealth of investors there so the more that we can get people out and connected that's what we do

considering\nWhat he did and even if it does rise to that level you're talking about something that took place all the way back in the eighties and early nineties and if\nThose who actually committed the criminal acts on these young boys cannot be criminally charged only two of them were I don't know how you go after a cardinal Wuerl at that point and uh let's see here I Want\nA guy that won't raise my taxes okay over onto the Wagner one\nUm stomp on your Facebook spikes now that's negative yes it is another comment or\nAnd if we're isolated you say okay it happens but so many things have been happening on Facebook that if they get him to get kinda cumulatively concerning to me\nWell how long until you think people start taking a real conscious look at Facebook and make a decision as to whether or not they want to be a part of it\nYou know it's a really interesting question that that I asked myself because I'm active on Facebook and I love my Facebook friends and my interaction and I'd hate to give it up so I I think it's\nI don't know it almost feels like you know how long we keep eating food that you shouldn't be eating it because you know it's not good for you but you love to eat it I don't know if it's that\nKind of a thing I I don't quite want to compare it to people who have trouble getting a cigarette or maybe not quite so bad but you know it's beginning to feel a little bit like that notion that I wouldn't call it addictive but it's it's compelling okay it's hard to let go of\nWell maybe you can sort of twelve step program for this I\nThought about it I'm Larry and I'm a social beyond your holiday I don't want to make fun of people who have serious addiction problems but seriously I mean there is some evidence that that there's kind of a ... an emotional psychological federal psycho chemical thing that happens\nI Know that when I post something I'm very anxious to see how people are reacting to it mhm I don't think it's an ego thing I think it's more of kind of a social thing wanting to see how my friends are responding to me but it's hard not to keep looking and and that but I think ... literally millions billions of us are doing\nAll right let me ask you this here's what I have in front of me on what they were able to glean at this point from the Associated Press or they were able to get names and email addresses phone numbers from twenty nine million accounts right from fourteen million of those accounts they also receive more data like home town birth date the ...\nFirst date the last ten places that they checked into or the Fifteen most recent searches now what's interesting to me is that I don't know that any of this is really something that people should be worried about somebody stealing aspects of their identity and then misusing based upon this information\nI don't know cumulatively a kind of adds up if you know somebody's birthday if you know some of this kind of information it begins to give you a picture that you can use to impersonate that person and certainly\nI don't want people to know my searches I mean I Can't think of anything I'm particularly embarrassed by but I think I have a right to privacy when I search mhm and so those kinds of things are concerning and so yeah even if nothing horrible happens to you we all want to think that we can control our information and there is the danger of ... staff when you start getting that kind of stuff\nUh you know you've you've seen situations they want to know your mother's name they weren't made name they want to know your birth date okay where you were born things like that kind of car did you first Dr all those questions can be used\nTo maybe get access to some of your data or somebody or even your checking account aren't\nVery well so now a third party apps according to the story from the Associated Press or like watch the apps and Instagram were unaffected by the British so\nYeah though they're actually Facebook owned company someone that really things Facebook has multiple services but they're talking about what's called the blue therapist to Facebook service at Facebook dot com or the Facebook gap\nAs opposed to Instagram and WhatsApp fit me just basically in effect all guys like us um and you know and not the young kids that are on Instagram [laughter]\nAlso says here and you know that Facebook has every intention\nTo notify the individuals who did get ... you have good and then they can go ahead and do what they feel they need to in order to protect themselves more so let's get onto this story about Facebook purging more than eight hundred US pages in accounts for ... users with garbage links and click bait what's this all about\nYeah I'm Glad you said you ask you can't blame them for on the Russians this as an American base to people who are posting what they call an authentic behavior so it's usually things like fake accounts or multiple accounts under the same name where you just posted links after links after link\nTo content and this contacted the dubious quality it's often sensational it's often politically sensational so it might say something like proof that uh that what's that I Can't remember her name of a sudden the Dr Ford was lying for example lesson example for Dr Ford was lying well\nThat's a pretty sensational story and if it if it can from the or you're biased you might want to check it out\nAnd it turns out what you wind up in an ad farm you you find some kind of story if not based on any facts\nBut a ton of ads and that's how they make their money they get millions of people to go to the pages and it's a form of spam and it's often designed to enrich people or maybe some people might have a political motivation as well but it looks like it's mostly a financial motivation\nYeah I Wish that they would post I don't know screen shots or something so that people can see what these pages are yeah because so many people don't believe they can be duped\nWell it's funny I haven't seen it in this case but right at at some point after the Russian interference they did post samples of the kinds of\nOf posted the Russians did and many of these looked to me legitimate like something that ... a conservative or liberal might be interested in and and they would do both they would they go after both political types of the spectrum\nAnd they didn't all seem so outrageous and crazy some of them seem reasonable like come to the black lives matter protests well okay I I Believe in that cause then I'm going to go there or come to the anti immigration protest okay I don't like immigration I'm going to go there and so some of these things were within the mainstream political thought let me ask you this\nIt is one more question before I let you go did you get any Facebook messages that said Hi actually got another friend requests from you which I ignored yeah yeah yeah now I'm trying to understand what the point of this is is it just somebody who's in somebody else's basement this really happy about the idea that it's spreading far and wide\nOr is there any real risk to messages like this\nIt almost reminds me of the original viruses back in the in the nineties where we couldn't death from any financial motive just looked like a form of vandalism like you were just trying to kind of like setting a fire for the sake of be watching it burns thing the fire department show up I Can't think of any\n... there may be but I'm not aware of any financial crimes associated with this nonsense but it's just another urban myth it spreads around the Internet and those of us who spread it are creating unnecessary alarm and we should really think twice before we respond to her spread any of these kinds of stories\nBecause it's

numbers that he towns regarding the economy no denying the economy is doing well but he seems to inflate those numbers and take a little bit more credit than he should\n[noise] um well what we do every quarter every three months we switch to something called Trump's numbers so it lays out a how the economy and in that weather\nAnd and now whether uh other things are doing it\nIn the United states since he took office okay uh so what we're what we see is that obviously the economy's doing great it's in a an acceleration of a trend that's been occurring for several years unemployment rate lowest since Nineteen sixty nine record number of job openings\nOr that kind of thing but there were also some worrisome trends the there's the increased and federal debt the\nDebts up one point four trillion dollars under Trump nine percent or in deficits of of also gone up a the in fact they will hit a trend that we're on right now more than a trillion dollars each year that's the annual deficit so um\nSo yeah it's a it's an interesting look at where we're where we are at right now relative to um the the previous president and where we're headed\nAnd when you look at the where the economy was going on under Obama the depositions were being reduced every year as the economy grew by this is certainly at a pace that everybody was thrilled with butter I was growing but we weren't dealing with\nAn ever increasing amount regarding debts and deficits too I also want to go on to the issue of school safety if we could and some of the claims that the president's made regarding providing historic levels of funding for school safety what did you find\nA yeah he was touting the new law that passed called the stop school violence act a and he said this was providing historic levels of funding for schools safety in and to hire more school resource officers are but that's not\nTrue at all um there's much more money than it's been spent in the late Nineteen nineties and early to thousands I'm particularly on one program there was something called the cops in schools act and that\nLaw had provided a hundred and eighty million dollars a year\nTo hire school resource officers and it lasted that that was\nAs much as a hundred and eighty million it lasted five years provided more than a hundred million dollars a over that period of time and that was used to hire more than seven thousand school resource officers so the idea that the Seventy five million dollars is being provided was historic was not not at all true\nThat the president also writing an op ed regarding Medicare and he claimed that the cost would go thirty two trillion dollars over ten years\nAt the number is right but not completely explain how right at thirty two million is an accurate number but it's not the number that you'd be looking at when it comes to actual real costs\nYeah this op ed was critical of a [noise] a proposal called Medicare for all which Bernie Sanders is spin out in front on 'em and there's been\nStudies that said that Medicare for all will cost the federal government thirty two trillion dollars over ten years so Trump has that number right but that is a gross\nCost as you said it's not the ... cost so there are offsetting acts a savings for that for individuals families employers state and local governments because they don't have to pay for health insurance anymore\nThe government pays for that ah so this when you factor in this big shifting of resources so when you factor all that in\nA ... there's an expectation or at least by one group that looked at this that it would might increase national healthcare\nExpenditures by six trillion dollar so that would be more like a net cost than the thirty two trillion that the president throw out there are a

D. bound and determined I'm going to vote you out of office\nPeople Pennsylvania are going to vote you out of office one November sick\nEnough is enough we got to collect their money and I believe that businesses in Pennsylvania believe that and this is an insult anybody that if you pay check\nAnd once again John you've been covering this for ... TV what did you learn this accident\nWell you know the Wagner people immediately kind of backed down from the statement essentially\nSaying that this was you know a metaphor that obviously is Scott Wagner does not intend to confront the governor with called spikes and stop all over him he couldn't do it even if they wanted to they wouldn't let you know the\nThe state police are all around the governor you can't get that close to him\nOr to do anything like that\nBut the fact is that that the the whole question of this is just political hyperbole or does this manifests something or say something about Scott Wagner that the Democrats are certainly going to use an are using to suggest he's not fit to be governor of Pennsylvania\nAnd that's what this will this is already becoming the hours since this statement was posted on Facebook\nA by Scott Wagner and you hear a criticism even from Republicans\nFrom Republicans are the Steve skull east the majority whip for the U.S house of representatives he was the congressman who was shot at that softball field he put out a tweet\nUh [noise] this afternoon basically condemning ah Scott Wagner is a rhetoric is unfortunate and not appropriate so I think this is just another example frankly of\nHow our politics has gotten so heated and so hard and and I think most people just kind of say a pox on the mall is too much politics\nWagner says that he was Trump before Trump ... that seems to be a line that many politicians like to be able to use um dislike Trump if you will and I'm Wondering to what extent is this like Trump or has it gone well beyond anything Trump's ever done\nWell I think part of the rejection as we see so many people who are unhappy about politicians in general what they liked about Donald Trump was that he stood up to it all and he basically said things that were outrageous and that people knew were outrageous but that kind of like 'cause it was so non conventional it was so different\nFrom other quote politicians and if maybe Scott Wagner thinks that he can follow that uh that that pattern and and make this a his mom truck I just don't know that it works for him I think it was different with Donald Trump\nWho is already a television personality for saying you're fired and I think people knew that and that sort of resonated with this character\nBut I think when you're a former state senator and you're somebody seeking the governor's office in Pennsylvania I'm not sure that nobody knew Scott Wagner before this campaign frankly and I think it's pretty hard to create a new image just doing this kind of stuff\nWell he's definitely getting talked about as you talk about the the the text that was put out by skill lease a it's made national news so the name recognition he didn't have before today he's getting a but is there this argument that you know not all good publicity is good publicity\nWell that's exactly right and that's exactly what the Democrats are saying and in
