thousand people now it seems as though it's swollen to upwards of five thousand people as they cross the\nBorder of Mexico or the southern border with Guatemala and it's making its way to the U.S the president saying that he is willing\nTo send the military there we'll talk about that also the latest negotiations between the U.S and Russia are a little bit of hardball about whether or not we ought to stay in a nuclear treaty\nWhere President Trump is saying that they are violating that treaty the Russians for their part saying well we're violating it too\nAnd then the latest when it comes to the Washington Post journalist ... and the latest just odd ball story coming out of Saudi Arabia to try to have this thing make some kind of sense with us right now Pamela folk joining us from CBS News Pamela\nThank you very much for joining us I Want to play for you an audio clip of the president as he's talking\nAbout these ... these um the individuals you might right near the migrants that are trying to make it or to the United states [laughter]\nSo I'm not exactly they're either\nAnd he's mad because Honduras or Guatemala and it doesn't seem as though Mexico did a whole lot\nAnd keeping these thousands of people from coming northward threatening to withhold money to those nations and now the possibility of having us armed forces on the border with Mexico over to\nYeah absolutely yeah Robert de issue here is that it's not the first ...\nThe United states to their northern border and through Mexico and coming to the United states\nBut this has now swelled in the last hour to Seventy five hundred so it's a real caravan\nAnd it's come somewhat I'm In it it's grown by itself because as people see it they say now is the time because their their spouses are dead or their kids are dead and they have been attacked\nBecause the drug gangs have become brazen and brutal in the region and there's been somewhat of benign neglect and in both Guatemala and Honduras\nBy Europe by the United states by other countries as they deal with all the crises around the world and so\nIt's gotten totally out of hand and there's also been a Trump Administration statements and down for warning that they're going to have a new family separation policy\nAnd the border wall so both of those things have created somewhat of a rush to the border and people don't realize that may be\nMotivating desperate people to say let me\nGet an before before I die and let me get in before I Can't get in\nPamela phone joining us from CBS News in Washington or New York I Want to talk about Russia now the president saying that he is looking withdrawing states from an arms control agreement with Russia saying that the Russians are violating the arms control agreement\nOr the Russians saying that the United states has been violating it as well Senator Bob Corker is suggesting that he's hoping that this is really nothing more\nThan ... go shooting maneuver what are you hearing in New York well it\nCould be a bit of a negotiating maneuver to try to get Russia to be on board they have violated the agreement they certainly deny that they have but they have with some cruise missiles and particularly ones that they have actually deployed and um the ... the idea here is\nPerhaps to get them to be on board but it's also most likely that the United states is actually pulling out of it and it was somewhat predictable there was a twenty eleven\nOp ed by John Bolton who is now in Russia speaking with them about it saying that the Cold War missile treaty that's doing us harm in the hour argument was that it didn't address the Iranian threat\nAnd so on the idea here is that the United states will react to what they heard from flood Amir ... president of Russia in March saying that they have an unlimited a range of a nuclear warheads apparently that could rain down on Florida and the president wants to\nGet a new round of smart us missiles but are you reading heard from I'm from\nI'm from um mid bed yet today I think it was I'm a firm Gorbachev himself I'm Sorry from Gorbachev himself\nA former leader of the Soviet Union who signed a treaty saying\nUm it it back

Pittsburgh public schools are holding a a forum\nThis far for people to get him out and express themselves what they think about schools having officers that are armed\nAnd I want to hear from you especially since you can't make it to the hearing tonight\nOn the phone calls right now whether you're for or against it doesn't make a difference and I just want to hear what you stand on this farming police officers in schools now this isn't the first school to ever consider doing it obviously there are schools all over the country that are\nWhat do you think that every school ought to have officers that are arm [noise] where do you think that we would be better off if schools didn't have officers armed at all as the parents or\nGrandparents aunt uncle does it make you feel better about your child's safety if this officers at the school are armed\nDo you think it actually makes them practically safer I think it's interesting as we're talking about the lottery and the odds of winning and how remote they are but we still go ahead and do things because we buy tickets because well we're dreaming and somebody has to hit right\nWhen you look at the number of schools there are\nAcross the country and the number of incidents that take place the likelihood of something happening to a child that would require an armed officer to be able to address it the numbers are miniscule I mean we're talking about less than one percent\nHowever it does make us feel a whole lot better about the idea of sending our kids are school if their officers or arm for a lot of people and then now they're saying absolutely not where do you say eight six six to nine one ten twenty let's go to bill Duquesne welcome to decay radio\nHi uh this is bill ... what's on your mom\nSo my my feeling is you know I grew up I was born in the fifties we never had any problems like this in school the worst you had was you got into a fight mhm you have kids not bringing knives guns to school\nAnd I I think the problem started back in the sixties when they took prayer out of the schools breakdown of the family unit because you don't have that\nGuidance direction that used to have I mean we grew up fearing a we respect the law enforcement but we grew up fearing that the repercussions of our actions against that and kids nowadays they have no fear they have no respect for life you see a teen\nIn some cases like the George wrong case where no I understand that they're there for our reduce the sentence but children killing people\nAnd it's a breakdown of the family union so I end my fortunately for me I'm In my sixties my daughters are grown ... but I fear for my grandkids\nAnd so you would want officers armed absolutely\nMind bill thank you very much for calling in Bob south hills welcome to ... where do you\nThink they Bob yeah hello what's on your mind well I I ... the\nProblem a kind of there are two parts of the problem the kind of much together and it makes the answer a little illusory and it it lends to emotional as a minute if I may I'll break it apart into the too\nIf you can do it quickly I can do it quickly thinking of the first\nPart is that the uh the armed guard is the in the school was the best deterrent to the kind of mass shootings that we've seen too frequently having a connection to the police and the case of the Pittsburgh schools Pittsburgh Police as good as they are there still a delay and getting their too many things that happen\nA I think that's a given the other part though is and I think the specter of the ... center that is that of an armed security guard that it's not necessarily adequately trained I think if the security guard\nA is actually a placement for example envisioned the state police and rolling with the kind of quality of training that they have and fire discipline and so on a I think we could get a greater comfort so I think the answer is\nThat they should be armed they should be in the school and uh that they however require an investment\nIn to experience in vigorous spring\nI Bob thank you very much the one issue though is that a although there had been schools where no one was armed there had been shooting is the most recent one in Florida where the officer that was there on the property was armed and didn't stop anything from happening we think about deterrence\nBut what real deterrent is there for somebody who is hell bent on going to school and shooting it up I mean you think about it for a couple of minutes you go there and you do this you're going to get the death penalty you're going to be in prison for the rest of your life if you don't die from the death penalty\nYou may die as a result once officers show up and you get into a gun battle with him none of that as a deterrent for these people why there's this thought that it will be the ultimate deterrent if there's an officer there that's armed I'm not quite getting then Ann Marie in Brookline welcome to ...\nI think it yes I support our guards armed police officers and she had me at first of all why would he shouted police officer there they were are especially when you know and all these cases that the attackers have weapons and they shot people\nAnd the guarding the issue of carrying it you know nothing is a hundred percent foolproof I understand that but the thing is you want to put yourself in the strongest position to protect the students and teachers and I'm always do that I have a police officers that are are\nAlright Amory thank you very much I'm also concerned about what happens when you go and you put police officers whatever the officers are which firearms themes schools all over the country and then you start having accidents that come as a result of that\nAnd they're going to come and I know that because they've come already Jacob just outside Pittsburgh welcome to decay radio\nAnd they're going to come and I know that because they've come already Jacob just outside Pittsburgh welcome to ... radio\nHey how you doing what's on your mind a\nQuestion for you as you mentioned that uh what is happening with an armed guard and if\nI were endangered in the office that the armed guard is going to do like one did uh in the upper Midwest where he was he was the trainer of police officers at firearms and he had that position for twenty five years retired and then he left a firearm\nIn a restroom\nThat come to some of the accidents I'm Talking about I don't think that the gun just going to go off and the man's holster I also am concerned about police officers that will then you use a firearm does shoot a students because of the perceived threat of a weapon that they really don't have\nAnd ... if it's happening on the streets around this country why would it be a shock that it would happen inside of our schools\nMore of your reaction you can send me a text eight six six three nine one ten twenty eight six six but I Won ten twenty you can also join me on
