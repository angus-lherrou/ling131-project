that money is lost for sure\nHey Daniel you're up we're going to do for you\nKnow I'm I Am ready to reach out to me and my credit card or a hotel room it was over [noise] um before I my credit card number I contact me right right how how did that hey I'd like to ride the charge for anywhere\nOr how did you call the dollars that we can do a maximum of five hundred dollar and I said I read provide my credit card number or a new days later I when I log on my online credit card account\nAnd noticed that there was a man in charge or forty five hundred dollar ... by ... contacted the credit card now we have that hey look you know I only authorized them five hundred dollars and I'm independent hard reporting on\nThat day to day to day you look you know that that was on the Indian lie to bang however wanted actually written certainly won't be leveling with whom I Wonder in all the ... when the average actually posted it was ... thousand dollars\nTo lay off ... days later I log I get into my buy online account and there was another opinion power in the day motel were over seven thousand dollars [noise] reached out all the credit card company again that hey look there are they any charge at rovers having thousand dollars\nIs Roger ... being use right now I only operate five hundred dollar about which there was already wanted him out for over five dollars and um they said to me they said you know there's nothing that we can do with it and in charge and then with the dealer vendor is already targeting hard was taking part in many times they want\nAnd at the end of the day there was over well out in\nDollars huh and your friends spent twelve thousand dollars of one hotel Iraq well there was a friend there is a friend of yours brilliant\n... exactly [laughter] so my question to you is that when I reach out to the credit card company before getting providing right around the credit card number and they gave me the or the ... you know more than twenty five hundred dollars and charged up and then\nYeah quietly there ... or drop drive and you have a record\nYeah you do and here's the problem you're gonna have though and that is a they're simply going to deny it oh we didn't see that or a policy has led us to do that and I wish you had sent an email or to the credit card company but I don't know how many people would actually do that because you know your friend you didn't know your friend was the the\nUh you to come for their word and so I I'm not I'm not going to call you an idiot on this one because I think a lot of people would have done the same thing I I probably would have done the same thing so your entire age you retire issue is uh that uh the credit card company a tool\nI told you that you're only liable up to twenty five hundred dollars that's all they're gonna charge and then you start arguing the dispute everything right down the line now I ... I'm Sorry go ahead\nOh you're going to have taken steps the tower and through their quote unquote investigation they come back and said you know what we're going to stand by those are good you are held by\nOr what did they what did they say about the twenty five hundred dollar limit conversation\nUh when I when I got that with them with representative I spoke with several conversations with different ... and tried to climate change within our got one of them said oh you know it's unfortunate that this represented made a mistake when she authorized only up to twenty five hundred dollars but you know what it's her mistake\nPlease come it's Harlem mistake and it doesn't matter that she works for a a term mistake come on give me a break on that one now or is there any record in your file that says twenty five hundred dollars a limit to have you talked to anybody to look at the notes\nThat they can look at the note on well I said look obviously all your all your phone conversation go recorded right audio certain purposes and I got through to one of the manned her then she acknowledged that there were several conversations that she went back and listen to him\nAnd I could tell that I had heard here on the phone call as you can understand where I was coming from the lesser aging only comes from that part of our company\nI'm so sorry out the the recording to exist and so I received a letter on if I could have a copy of those recordings and obviously you know\nRight but I Would let her in the mail that there were conversations only or different days and so we've documented on their lead\nWriter so you've got so we're going to happen is going to turn over the collections you're going to disputed a collections are going to dean your credit and at that point unfortunately I'm going to win that you just tell them suicide sue me just go ahead and to me uh and we'll talk about this I Will when Iran would you have to worry about is your um is your credit\nThat this was approximately here in Africa where I'm at now is that going in the payment on the credit card\nWait a minute have you gone over the twenty five hundred dollars I have not not that line reason I'm writing I knew I here's here's the only advice you go up as far as you can in the food chain\nI and or if you've done that and just keep on going over and over again find out who the vice president is in terms of stupid employees or that put a lot more on a credit cards and they should there's there are certainly a vice president that does that somewhere in the system and at the same time I had the collection well once you or\nI Would cancel the cord\nAnd and just get right into it and say hey because what's happening\nIs you're paying interest on the entire amount and you're going you know place and that's just stupid to pay you interest on twelve thousand dollars and all you is twenty five hundred dollars so I you just I Would stop paying let them know you're stopping a payment based on this you're disputing I'm assuming you're turning over the collections I'll be fighting that\nAnd there will be legal action taken if you being my credit and if you try to collect that simple and then I Would call and you may even want to go to a lawyer a collection lawyer a dead a quick call was a huge collections layer and die and buying an hour of time or just ask\nI Am I doing everything right and we are I mean I don't know anywhere\nAnywhere else to go I mean finding credit card companies and credit reporting agencies and it is such a drag [noise]\nThis is handle on the law\n\nAnd the judge is going to say really are there for but you could have and you didn't didn't you turned it in and you took the deal\nAre saying they'll pay you a hundred and ten

of the stories that we might have missed out on the economic front and anywhere else\nWhy all of the ... from all over the judge Kavanaugh and Dr Ford were going on as you well know by now a judge Kavanaugh has been a elevated to the Supreme Court but let's talk about something for at least the first half hour or so of our program\nA Donald how are you feeling sorry a very good All right\nUh I I remember last time I was on that might have been last Thursday a U.S text me and said\nOr something to the nature of how many stories that uh we had missed while we were debating all of this I had long predicted the judge Kavanaugh would be a concern and so I wasn't that concerned about it\nBut uh basically what have we miss what should we have been talking about in your opinion sir\nWell the last time you spoke here uh all the air with Labor Day\nAnd we were talking about some of the economic issues get that gets missed by the mainstream media and one of the most important things is the ongoing negotiations between us steel in the United steelworkers union mhm\nI'm that still hasn't been resolved in is a very little news that I see a especially in light of what's been going on with the uh the Supreme Court a K off\nA but it's important to ah to everybody the to stay abreast of what's going on there um because it's\nIs absolutely correct there's this law that has for the last forty years\nA conspired with interests of of big money to make America look with it's become\nEconomically we've gone through that history many times to the potential is there if we can fix these trade agreements if we can get a level playing field with China and we can get the U.S chamber of commerce to quit\nBattling for the rights of Chinese workers and start worrying about American workers there\nIs a potential for him to have a great record on economics and an issue for the working class\nWhy do you say that about a U.S chamber of commerce or you what did you use to call it the U.S\nThen it got estates chamber of Chinese car MERS yeah [laughter] well I mean I'm\nSure your listeners know from listening to you for years and listening to us for years the evidence is out there I mean these people lobby more for Chinese expansion economically in Chinese workers than they do America every day of the week\nLast time we spoke to when I talk to you briefly about the connection between Senate majority leader McConnell and his Chinese connection with the ship building and and the millions he makes off of\nHis wife is Chinese and uh uh some many of her relatives in on the board of a huge Chinese ship bill\nYeah his father in law and his sister in law and uh it's just all also sits on the board of directors of of the largest Chinese bank\nSo I encourage people to to look into that but there's all kinds of chemicals um and and I don't want people to think that I'm going to be Pollyanna because we have some good economic news in the last Eighteen months\nIt took forty seven years of concentrated effort and wealth by all the folks to destroy America's economy for working ... it's not going to be healed in one term or to terror but it's nice to finally see somebody\nWho who promised to deal with some of the trade and tariffs issues and and somebody who said why can't we make things here actually start to do some things\nYou know you you talk about Mitch McConnell and his ...\nAnd his family but Dianne Feinstein seems to prove that they all seem to do this Republicans and Democrats alike down to\nOh sure of that was just one example that day we use ... um that that's the problem with Washington DC they're all\nWearing swamp right yes the unit party definitely exists unit party sure absolutely it's like the old\nI think it was a Sinclair Lewis said right wing left wing it doesn't matter if it's two wings\nOf the same bird for a no\nPreying upon the American working class well that's true you know uh it's just been decades and decades and decades of policies and legislation or to purposefully de industrialized America and crushed people and and make them desperate\n... went to what in what they do that and and have the tax breaks that are largely gone to the one percent or been part of that or are these folks reinvest in industries that will eventually put people back to work or are they just taken dividends and getting richer\nWell they're going to be some people who take the dividends because greed lows no limits for some folks but all the other hand you have a lot of investment this coming back into the country\nAnd some of the foreign investment some of the high tech investment is going to build plants they're talking about uh you know ah what does that Foxconn\n... some of the the stuff for Apple you know they make all the apple pie in China from other\nHigh tech firms that were overseas that are going to build here\nUm so it's a beginning its baby steps but it's it's life to see some things going into the positive I'm I'm sick and tired of having to come on the program for years\nAnd talk about why the Chinese are making the new Golden Gate bridge because we can't or why the Chinese are getting all the infrastructure job bids around the country that take care of stuff because we can't make the steel it's nice to come on\nOnce in awhile to talk about America and its workers getting getting some good news\nAn elaborate on that Golden Gate bridge because I think there's a lot of stuff people don't know about that\nWell that was doing the Obama administration they were a ... a free surfacing and and and and doing some update on the structure\nAnd the contract of the state of California had a contract to steal a through a Chinese a fabrication for her because we didn't have the capacity here to make what they want it so they shipped\nAll of this deal over the ocean from China to California and said that that was one it was cheaper\nWhat's that's amazing but the other thing is we didn't have the capacity so they supplied to steal some American workers actually put stuff together with Chinese workers but it wasn't as an American all American projects\nAnd I find that to be sinful the that's one of the wonders of American Needle Golden Gate bridge Chinese Gate Bridge him there\nAnd there's and if people look into it there are many many bridge and infrastructure projects and the last ten years that have gone to Chinese fabrication company some of them are projects within Washington DC\nWow ... ... or maybe ... says right a there they'll say you narrow the gap ... we'll hang on with you don't have to worry about ... ... that's going to the phones appeared butler Peter young Katty Kay\n[noise]\nI Know this thing is on what's going on here Peter are you there Peter ... Peter as wide open wow are we not hearing anyone All right Peter I'm going to put you on hold and drive somewhere Jerry announce it are you there\n\nOh All right I'll tell you what we're in a similar problem I mean I Know all the buttons to press to be owned or we're going to take a look at what that is going on but I interrupted you before we we go to the break in a couple of minutes we're we're about to say uh before I tried to take so I was gonna say\nSome of the other thing that you're talking about we miss while all the different fluff all about\nThe cabinet or hearing thing um the new NAFTA agreement has been tentatively agree too because it has to go through\nA the government agencies of all three countries Canada and Mexico um but it's nice to see that that the original NAFTA agreement was was torn up and read enough certainly to the devil will be in the details\nUm and we'll see if it can make it through the various government entity to get approved but it's nice to see something like that that was promised\nBy the fast administration in two thousand eight to be dealt with finally get dealt with\nWe'll see if it or if it's as beneficial in some areas\nAs as we've been led to believe through uh the news briefs to talk about it but it's nice to see that uh for me one of the positive side of that agreement is or the United steelworkers international president Leo Gerard came out the other day it made a statement\nThat he was a looking upon it approvingly and thought it was a good deal for other people that he represents that it was about time somebody uh you know looked into all of this dumping\nIt was allowed to happen for all these decades under the original NAFTA [noise]\nSo that was another issue that has gone on it hasn't hasn't got a as much focus as it should have\nAnd then they're American farmers do with access to Canadian markets or his new agreement is being called the Mexico usa Canadian\nOr agreement um I I just wonder how that's going to work out for industries like pharmaceuticals and others are I interviewed experts to say that a generic drug prices may rise as a result of it\nA lot like I say the devils good to be able to details when it when it's finally done um\nFit you know hopefully with an optimistic mind about it but I've I realized the reality is you'd never know until you\nSee yeah All right we'll also they optimistic about al ... thing we've got our problem fix will come back with your phone calls after these commercial him out\nOf you or a loved one been diagnosed with lung cancer me those helium a colon cancer or throat cancer is though you may be entitled to compensation even if you smoke many local area trade them in in the workers were exposed to his masters and didn't know if you are suffering from lung cancer measles dealing I'm a colon or throat cancer\nCalled the Pittsburgh make law firm Goldberg her ski in light\nAt one eight hundred and complex for a free consultation that's one eight hundred complex or online and keeping W. law\nTo me seems like it it seemed that way\nBeyond that fleet reliability of ... out back [noise]\nThat means whether you're downloading files [noise]\nAgree like I said earlier there are times that that he speaks and acts in ways\nThat make me cringe I'm\nI Am as a man in on the market range pardon does harm the young people of America um I think it came out of it\nBut I think it potentially is a bad example for them but I Would say are all of our culture\nHas aspects of it ... that are\nDeleterious to young people there are many things that go on that the president has nothing to do with that I look at not cringing I shake my head that young folks in this country can too\nSo I think if he needs to elevate his game in his presentation America as a whole lot of areas we need to raise standards a lot for if we're worried about what our children are consuming and save and participating\nYou're right there are five banking Peter or you know I I was talking to another one of my young are meant to ease yesterday and she teaches photography and the Manchester craftsman skill she's not much older than these Ninety\nThese Ninety ... Eighteen Seventeen you'll sit she's teaching a but she is even I I mean she\nSounds like an old person when it comes to trying to teach them and how much they are into their phones social media\nYou should've seen her yesterday\nA imitating them you know ... and when she's trying to teach and they're going\nHa and then looking down at their phones and go did that did what did that did that their follower yeah OK\nDid that did that did and and and not\nEven being able to pay\nAttention to basic math skills you know\nWell certainly uh I have said for many many years uh when you lower the standards and you compete\nIn the world and you're at the bottom when you're always at the bottom and math and science and another uh academic pursuits compared to other western style democracy is and and the first world there's consequences defeat pay\nNovels just ironic that you bring this up I was reading something yesterday uh American students or thirty fist in the world in math skills\nAnd there's something to cheer about a minute we're down to thirty minute we're right on the third is um\nIt it it I've always said uh we need to raise the bar or we need to raise the bar in our own personal lives if we see areas that we are slack we need to raise the bar in our communities we need to raise the bar in our country\nAlready lowering standards just you can get a whole lot more people feel comfortable participate isn't the answer you got to make people strive for excellence\nImmune to that let's go to Anthony in Oakland Anthony young Katty Kay\nYou know honestly I Would never give Donald Trump any credit for anything in a ... if he's helping the steel industry meant they could have been dead forty years ago if they would've naturalized the steel industry\nBut they but wait pardon me but they didn't\nWrite but so you want to give him credit you go ahead because when you look at an overall record a ... he he doesn't deserve any I'll give you I'll give you the example he uh he has um attorney general and the Justice Department or defend the Janet\nWhich are going to hurt union organization\nThey they um they would let the increase\nA pay increase for federal employees came up he disregarded it mother off that they don't they're not going to get it even though he gave millionaires and billionaires the largest tax cut in American history that half the eventually be paid for\nHis bar mental issues of allowing more radiation more radiation to be at least in the in our environment\n[noise] let me ask you a question if I might well when I thought what am I said well look what you can also\nJoin buster okay go ahead [laughter] when it or from Oakland is recognized [laughter] when [laughter] he's also if you know and the fine print allowing corporation to bring out again a carcinogen\nThat stuff is expensive\nNot going to enforce those environmental aspect plus the coal ash but he's allowing to be dumped in our rivers so you can weigh one good thing is that for industry that I can understand that you've been involved in your life\nLook at all the other nonsense and he pulled it off\nThen he Paula how 'bout the how about the ah the ah the increase in oil offshore oil is going to hurt that environment so I mean the man and [laughter] and they say what to do with the voting rights with his ... his attorney general's disregarding by state by state\nSo and plus the birther\nI remember when I called one time when you are on that saying he was a kid in the George while you challenge me on it now you can challenge me on what I see from this from a George Wallace won a beep when am I Am black and no with George Wallace was like and black and see what your with on a Donald Trump is like\nThat's not even a ... a comment already know ...\nNobody can have dialogue with you I'm not here to challenge you but nobody can have dialogue with you because you filibuster so go ahead continue I'm done now now you know what what what's your points you sing the praises of a a a ... well my my point to one question I'll ask you brought up Janice\nHow ... how has unions over the decades brought about Janice through the fact that they forced people to pay dues and didn't represent them affect his lead all these decades\nJanice was an inevitability it was going to happen\nThere was no way it was going to be avoided when you disregard the cries of the folks on the shop floor for decades after decades and you change your Wagoner hook your wagon to a party\nThat leaves labor wanting election after election after download on how does that comment\nYou wait a minute we didn't end up in the rub you know you know alone go ahead down what I'm\nSaying is what when you bring home none of the bacon for your members and you're taking their money\nInevitably people are going to say I don't want to pay for no service any more Anthony you were you were a union member right\nOf course yeah you were an officer to if I remember correctly right was there at the local economies rather was their advertising up and I applaud you for your service\nWherever times you through your hands up in the air with either AFL CIA leadership or your particular international leadership and said my God these people don't know what they're doing to us\nWell of course one has yet what when we went to one on the folks that terminated when folks need representation or for whatever reason we were there and ... and ... and we help them\nAnd and as you shouldn't have and I'm not saying a union shouldn't exist what I'm saying is\nThat the leadership\nOf the international into leadership all the AFL CIO don't have the heart and the concerns is [noise] and it was inevitable that people were going to get tired of not getting up for union leadership and political payback\nFor all the do's and the votes\nUh oh okay you can't disregard the failures of them having us support the war and Clinton and Obama\nAnd all the money spent all the promises made to change labor law and to put in the employee free Choice Act and to take care of these trade agreements they did nothing\nAnd of course people are gonna say I don't want to pay for no representation it's the same as taxes people complain about taxes I pay taxes I get no represents syntax and it's the same with union dues it was inevitable\nThe bull Janice would come okay since since you made that point let's be clear\nIf it were up to Donald Trump and they were called the concurrently they'd have a right to work in every state which means you you have no collective bargaining agreements or anything to help you and you get can you can only only only if the people are\nFoolish enough to go for the free rider claws and that's my whole point\nYeah out here and the other way Taft Hartley was terrible Anthony you're right it was terrible what the unions do one meter ran and his main platform wants to get rid of Taft Hartley they went out in Kansas to keep them off the ballot no I don't have a problem\nWhere we're at ... struck a half an hour and a and I'm looking for a break go ahead and then let me just\nSay this all to see I've never watched it when block Obama one of the last thing he did\nWas look out for salary workers by allowing them to get an increase from the twenty thousand dollars to forty seven fifty or pay them overtime and women Donald Trump do as soon as he got in he we're sending that", "show_name": "Starkey and Mueller", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "07"}
