are much of the day as the state Senate\nI Will not going to address it today are very likely we will take it up tomorrow there have been some a compromise has been floated back and forth and I think that's what we're trying to put her arms Ron How we can find you know that common ground where we can agree upon providing folks with the opportunity to\nRevive their time barred claims and allow them the opportunity to go into a court that it'd be a civil court and the quarter comic pleased or putting together some type of the tribunal we've been talking about that would have attached to it a fund that would be funded by the dioceses\nWe haven't we haven't fallen on the right place yet there's been opposition to sort of the some of those cut some of those things we talked about but at the end of the day we're not quite there yet\nUh I I Know the GOP leadership at least from what we have read it you know a state senator scar naughty passed around this proposal uh uh uh about a fund and a tribunal\nWhen you surveyed the membership though especially on the Democratic side how do they feel is there any sort of momentum for a ... you know to go either way well I think\nI Would tell you in the Senate between the Democrats or Republicans would probably more enough there's enough votes I think to do a one or two year window and a quarter to come to please whether we're given an opportunity not remains to be seen\nThe mark Rashid bill Senate bill to sixty one right now is in what's called our rules committee and that's the only place that we can offer amendments so that's what we're working towards that\nBut I Would tell you I think that if it if it if a two year window was presented on the floor I guess that there would be sufficient votes certainly among the Democrats more than a majority of the Democrats if not all the Democrats in the Senate would support that um but the issue is that we may not get that opportunity because of the way our rules work here\n[noise] if there are amendments than men considerable amendments those may be proposed that would have to go back to the house\nOf representatives [noise] it would have to go back if we can\nBe amended in the Senate has to go back to the house for their concurrence and we're actually already being told unless there is a\nUh the window and the other three elements of what the grand jury came out with in terms of recommendations if ... if it's not for recommendations and a window of at least one to two years and a quarter to ... or a civil action that they're not likely to take it up or that they will got well we didn't send us right back what are they sent to us a previously\nThey were in essence have to wait until next year\nIt would if we don't get it done by the last day or a legislative session a correct would have to start all over again next year\nAnd um that would be a it'd be unfortunate if that would be the case I think their support to do a limited window to allow people the opportunity to file claims to revive those claims given the conduct of the the the various dioceses but at the end of the day I Can't tell you whether or not we'll get their\nState Senate minority leader Jay Costa forest hills is joining us on Katie carry a\nSenator I'm ... how much it is is lawmakers talking among themselves trying to reach a compromise or is there still a lot of lobbying going on we you know we we read about the the insurance industry lobbying the the Catholic conference lobbying are they still a beating down yours on this thing\nYes they are I mean they're meeting with the members um to try to make the case about trying to put together this tribunal in the fund cetera unlimited one year window to the claims process would be like found insurance claim and then use present your case through these George claim and you've you seek\nA the remedy or damages that you would be a final two so there's a lot of push towards that between ... and insurance folks but we also have a significant number of victims who spent time here and talking to members would be in the hallway so why they're meeting with them and their office today yesterday I met with the\nUh forty sisters who made it very compelling case about what took place with regard to their family situation was horrendous\nBut you know as I said um there's a lot of lobbying going on but more importantly there are conversations going on between us our Senate Democrats myself and my colleagues\nAnd the Democratic caucus as well as the attorney general who's been very much part of this long centers going on in center Korman and those guys\nJay ... we're getting close to the end here I have to ask you what are the political ramifications of all there's if there are I mean I Know that's not the top concern so much uh but we can't forget that there is a general election coming up and a half of\nThe states it's half of them right there for a run for reelection and I and I think I saw the uh uh uh Jake Corman is one is running for reelection not that he's in in any uh\nI don't know that he faces any danger but are there political ramifications that these lawmakers are considering as well\nI I Would imagine that some folks might the consequences of let's say not supporting any window I think there's sufficient evidence to show that there would be a number of people who will be out there who would be very much disappointed\nIf in fact the victims that we know about um that you reference to thousand plus that don't get a fair opportunity to present their case and a quarter of all that's all they want they want it to a period of time to be able to do that and if they don't get that I think that there would be um some consequences to some of the members who may not support that\nThis uh we got thirty seconds left we've been talking about this what else do you have to get done other legislation before this uh before the end of the week is there anything else on the front burner\nI'm with a number of bills little working I'm working on a [noise] a we've got about for example in about twenty minutes we're going to appropriations within Nineteen different bills coming out of the Appropriations Committee [noise] um there's hope a whole bunch of different things that we're going to be looking out yesterday we concluded the anti hazing legislation which I thought it was a pretty significant step going forward or that was senator Corman is measure\nOf dealing with the Penn State situation and applying it to all the colleges and universities\nUh that was a port piece of legislation we're glad we got time we spent some time on that but there are a variety of different bills and different subject there's some not consider very major uh but the biggest issue\nBut the biggest issue we're dealing with in the will be dealing with tomorrow lengthy day tomorrow will be the one dealing with the grand jury report and recommendations to the grand jury\nI may be calling you back [laughter] okay ... thanks thanks for the times I presume anytime just talked to some of the state senator\nJay Costa and you know he gave us a pretty good the British good sense of where they are\nI'm not sure that he sounded all that optimistic that they'll get a chance to vote although you also heard him say that if it came to a vote he thinks this two year window

hard to look back that far but I actually was\nA young adult I remember it very young adult and what I recall was I remember reading about these personal computer that I think I saw a picture of one on the cover of Popular Mechanics of popular science and I looked at this thing and I said no that's nice what do you do with it and that was actually a very good question\nThat Paul Allen and Bill Gates answered because they wrote a version of the basic operating system and operating system that had been around on mainframe they really are tiny little version that fit in for K they flew out to Albuquerque New Mexico where the al ... computer this\nCrazy device it had which they didn't have a keyboard you never screen and they demonstrated that their version of basic would work on the outs are actually have a friend of mine who also passed away David but now the founder of the PC Magazine\nOr who worked it out there at the time and that and before David Steffi and I talked about ... contribution\nAnd so Alan and gates created the first ... and then fast forward to Nineteen eighty\nThis tiny little company called Microsoft at the micro hyphen yeah so F T a gets a call from IBM saying that we are going to create a personal computer can you give us a disc operating system and so they said yes even though they had no disc operating system\nAllen went out he acquired this company called Seattle computing and I was actually around at the time I was working for competing company developing another piece of software for IBM but anyway\nYeah I Am but anyway so Alan acquire Seattle computing which had an operating system it was called ... rating system they sold it to IBM they named PC dos but they kept the rights to it\nSo then they re released it as an M. S. Dot Earth and that's what created the clone market there would have been no PC or no PC clone had not been for Alan and this operating system and that of course wound up leading to Microsoft Windows so those of you who are using windows\nReally owe that to Paul Allen because windows wouldn't exist without dos and dust wouldn't exist without Allen\nIt wasn't even their their system they actually bought it\nThey bought it from Seattle computing I remember that at the time and they bought it for fifty thousand dollars on the other interesting story about Alan talk about good timing Bill Gates offered to buy 'em out at five dollars a share and Allen said now give me ten bucks and gates wouldn't come up with ten bucks a share so\nAlan kept his stock and that's why he became a multi billionaire a because he did keep that stock and when Microsoft went public of course it was worth a great deal and continues to be worth a great deal\nOf course the other huge part of his story is if that isn't enough was then what we what he went on to do with the the the billions of dollars of your cumulative\nAnd that's a really good point because he did some amazing things both in business and in philanthropy a it was an entrepreneur he funded a lot of nonprofit funded a lot of businesses\nHe's best known besides for computing for the Seattle Seahawks which she rescued they wanted to leave

and the windows got off to a rocky START I reviewed windows at one point oh and it was not a very good product but they've certainly gotten better over time\nI get that credit to Bill Gates and others at Microsoft is by that time Alan was gone for Microsoft but look he built an empire that continues to be a very important\nCompany not just in personal computing the cloud computing and many other aspects of technology\nI guess at various times had kind of a rocky relationship where they met in school I guess in Seattle\nThey met in high school and I I've seen pictures and they built the big bill gates look so young and Allen looks slightly older he was a few years old and then when you see a picture them at Microsoft will still looks like it\nIt's like a kid in Allen with his beard looks a little more mature yeah but they were young men and it's sad that we lost him at sixty five you know he was young a relative to what we would expect for life expectancy but he certainly led a full
