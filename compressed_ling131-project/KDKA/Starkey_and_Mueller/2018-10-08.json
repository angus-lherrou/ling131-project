ultimately legal action and it's going to be obviously plenty asked a bit of a rhetorical question but I Know there are a lot of people out there that would know the answer and that is\nOther than the obvious people didn't do their job\nI mean you have to almost go beyond not doing your job to say that if all of a if a if a vehicle in your business is not a lot on the road to put it on the road\nAnd and that then gets to a level of potential criminality so wild well there's going to work in the space of the civil court for a long period of time these people are in a lot of trouble\nNow the driver wasn't certified to\nDrive this type of vehicle either can in West Virginia what what can you share on this\nSide I have a commercial license and now I drove for twenty two years big truck\nAlso got a school bus why should I drove limousine for a a buddy airport for ten years prior to that wow he had to have a commercial license because it was Fifteen passengers or more that's why the driver couldn't drive because\nRight he\nDidn't have a commercial CDL right or a path you're endorsement as it's called\nRight exactly exactly the doors to part with out on now is it Fifteen universally or is that Fifteen by state\nAt universal CDL and that commercial stuff is all supposedly the same across all fifty states\nOkay except perhaps not permitted to different prices different sizes and stuff like that\nOkay what about this company\nAlright the company the car with probably put out a service because it wasn't in fact it had to have a commercial past the oh the inspection at you like a big truck in a trailer they both have to have it it's it's one year\nWall\nThat's not including like your P. A. inspection if your cars titled in PA you're in New York they have you know infection\nOkay I use ... short present trucking companies in as you know there is no small case with a trucking company\nAh but I grew up okay so I Know there's a lot of regulations when it comes to that so this is we don't know why but this limousine company knew was aware of uh the vehicle uh presumably knew\nFor God's sake I got to you know put a camera and everything that they had a bad ride and I\n... and and just from your experience I mean give me some ideas on how the bad right ends up in a highway\nWell it it it it might affect their reading on the cars that need it they say you know like they inspect you for the federal\nSo they would have definitely used to sell so one possibility is this is a really good call one possibility is that he remedied the problems with the federal regulations\nThat threat but we don't know that do we do know that yet even if he did it in formally but didn't get it certified he's still going to be in trouble\nWell it didn't have to go back to the states slowly still being looked at it quite a big truck as long as they get that the key thing by a mechanic who certified to do that in that state\nOkay okay\nHe can put the sticker on the court oh this is a big white sticker you see them on the side of the big trucks summer on side they compartment door but it's all white after it has the date on it the company's name on it and who did it\nOkay so we're making progress so that this could have happened we'll find out or what you're saying that even if\nThat is accomplished there is a possibility he didn't pass the state is ...\n... well yeah every car has been you know except Ohio let's make it right Ohio the only state that I Know that doesn't have a eerily inspection\nYeah so the little did sweat according to reports it did fail the states' safety inspection just last month if we don't know the basis for that\nIt might have did it might have been there might have been a light on and that that for for the Amish it ... you know any light on your dashboard your car won't pass the mission York hasn't mission like ... I could have been bad break but I don't know if he could have done all that sick\nYeah well that that ... that I really appreciate you're putting your experience out there on that because I you know the other thing that happens you see you lose you fail the state is fiction you know you immediately think oh my God that immediately contributed to it but the lawyers tap on the on the shoulder right now saying well\nThere could be there needs to be causation it's not a good luck I wouldn't want to go to the courts and yeah my well I didn't have his vehicle or a a appropriately inspected and look what happened that's a loser I get that\nBut you know before people jumped to it's probably important to recognize\nA front right that as well and I know of another quietly\nFor them run out of time go ahead and just wrap it up\nAny court can be fell inspection and a week later get passed through because they stick with Paul them commercial truck the same way they get the the they find something

but on the state you have to get the state\nA state a state authority to say okay this is a lot to be out of the road you\nKnow what I say he goes to a mechanic like we do here in ... you got a job as

Institute of Pittsburgh news nine she go to work on the ... good to have you\nYes thank you so much you know explain the if you would your opposition to this idea\nWell we are opposed to any sort of automated traffic enforcement for at least ten good reasons\nBut the biggest reason is that ticket cameras do not improve safety is a total illusion it's a ticket camera companies are selling a product and um and everybody's under the illusion that it's going to make it safer and what really makes things safer ss better traffic engineering other works down\nUm Montana for example as recently worked on how people do suffer merging makes a huge difference in how how do you do that how you do signage\nUm how much light at night you have on the signage that people can see it there's all kinds of things you can do besides speed cameras cameras you know they say it's an experimental program and mental they need but it's not it's a gateway well\nLet me ask you a lot more to the issue of emerging too and lighting and how do you get people to slow down without the very strict enforcement of speed laws in work zones\nWell you know what the easiest way to get people to slow down is to have an actual cops sitting there waiting you know watching them\nAnd for potentially a sixteen to twenty four hours a day\nWell if our works on working at night if they are then you know maybe that the rules should be off at night I mean that's the other thing that that should be thought about as well the the the the cameras are going to be twenty four seven yes then when people are working in the works out and\nWhat about what I'm Talking about people who were there there are work zones that are functional overnight yeah there might be yeah that's true\nYes so you could theoretically then have work zones and neither have state\nTroopers they're enforcing this on the highways state roads upwards of twenty four hours a day or and if all they're doing is slowing people down I understand the safety aspect of it but then again there's a tremendous cost aspect to it as well as in there\nYes of course whenever you have personnel involved yes if you're using speed cameras tremendous cost each motorists as getting a ticket and remember radar so I always reliable\nWell why should we say we're we're in Pennsylvania it's going to have all I I understand but that's why they built in a cushion you have to be going eleven miles over the speed limit inside the work zone so if it's forty five you have to be doing fifty six\nIn order to get a ticket in the first place I Would think that that eleven mile ... little just\nTo say let's say it's a two lane road that still operational uh-huh you have two cars I'm One cars going the speed limit or or you know less than eleven miles over and the other cars speeding but you're the one that gets the ticket because you're closest to speed camera you get that you get that thing in the mail three weeks later you you can't fight that ticket you can't prove that you are you going to see them again you can't even remember at what point\nThat was in the day\nSo you is that really fair to motorists no it's not\nYour scenario would not be if you have both people who didn't get the ticket because one person speeding\nNo just one person gets the ticket but that happens over and over again people are because\nFor the wrong person you say gets the ticket\nYeah wrong person gets the ticket you don't find out about the ticket until two or three weeks later you know uh there's no sort of fiber witnessed the alleged violation mhm this is a huge problem in our country we have we have the right to to a faith or accuser ... you can't face a camera and court come on\nBut here's the thing though nobody uses that argument when they're holding up a convenience store I Can't face my accuser because you're using this video camera as evidence that I just committed a crime\nBut there's still a police officer involved when well when they go in to to find out who did it\nWhat the police officer just looks at the video camera and says well Joe just did this because the cameras as there was Joe that's all the officers doing is saying this so I don't understand how we use it consistently all over the country for all kinds of crimes as video evidence but for some reason we can't use it for traffic\nWell people do use it for traffic what we're saying is that is just not it's just not right to use automated traffic enforcement for everything no\nI understand not everything but I'm this is and everything is just about\nSometimes drivers aren't even positively identified they're not even the ones driving they stuck at the ticket\n... yes but ... but then at the same time insurance companies are\nNot proven that safer you know that the people that are saying that safer our camera ticket company ... which is you know related to all the insurance companies who actually want you to get a ticket so that you can\nWell eventually people I'm guessing people would eventually slow down if they got enough tickets some people are stubborn slowed\nDown and work sounds that's what it all comes down to the people just need to make a commitment to slow down and work than smoking like with the speed limit says that's really what should happen\nAnd I wish they would have speed cameras\nI I ... if people would otherwise not be law breakers we wouldn't\nLaw breakers we wouldn't need to have some aspect of enforcement in the first place\nBut also you know ... minutes alleys and whoever is killing of work to make sure that that the sinus is correct and that the ... work otherwise that's why you have problems huh\nSheila done joining us once again still is communications director with the national motorists association joining us on the disc Institute of Pittsburgh new Zion thank you very much for your time here well I Do appreciate it I Want to get your thoughts about this what do you think about speed cameras and work zones\nPersonally I don't have a problem with it I don't have a problem at all you don't want the ticket don't speed on\nThe rarest of circumstances where you have two lanes\nAnd you happen to be the person that gets caught if you were I'd like to hear from you if you if that is your situation I'd like to hear that story but for everybody else if if the speed limits forty five and a construction zone and you're going fifty six don't you deserve a ticket\nWhether there was a real person who's issue and get to you or not\nAnd since we automate so much of our life why is it somehow
