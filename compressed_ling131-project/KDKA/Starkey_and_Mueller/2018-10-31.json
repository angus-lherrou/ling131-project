[noise] Hi how are we is tonight most of the sort of a pretty big place\nToday and there are some\nParents that just don't like the idea that Halloween is on a weekday is on the thirty first trick or treating on the thirty first they want to move the official holiday to a Saturday and then there was a petition signed by tens of thousands of people to do that just moved to a Saturday\nAnd then I had this idea this morning like granted Larry and John both thought it was kind of out there but I think it's I I think it has the potential [noise]\nWhy not turn it into a national holiday like Thanksgiving and Christmas and New Year's and Easter and the fourth of July Memorial Day and Labor Day and President's Day maybe get rid of Columbus Day and kind of screwed it over\nTo Halloween that way everybody's off and you can have a real good time have fun make plans a whole day go to the pumpkin patches and all that kind of stuff go home at night and then you can go and have the whole trick or treating everybody is good\nAnd then you can still have the adults go do their party thing on the Saturday before or even after 'cause I don't think that is that big of a deal\nBut for the kids and the parents and maybe what do you think a semi you're taxed and join the conversation on my Facebook page land you know on Katie gay\nAnd there is one group is trying to make the whole trick or treating thing a whole lot easier it's trunk or treat those special event going on today between five thirty and seven thirty and it's put on by light of life for rescue mission and joining us right now to discuss it to to Pittsburgh news line is Kate Wadsworth\nKate welcome to decay radio good have you back on\nThank you get to be that okay so I before I get onto the drunk or treat her how would

[noise] I don't know I think I Do the Saturday the last Saturday of the month\nOkay now there's no wrong answer and this is just more ... for me thank you very much averages fading in Plano [laughter] so what's happening with trunk or treat this evening\nThat's not good for you we're partnering with a few different organizations um do you make it safe kicker trait environment for kids on the north

are being provided by the beach where they're making hot dogs and how to get a a the the at church here in the north side of the writing hot hot chocolate and fighter so and it isn't that the candy there's going to be um some substantial Mac and\nThen we also have an allergy\nFriendly treat for the kids all nice and I get up early and the candy\nOn the pencil stickers glow sticks and bubbles for um you know the allergy frankly treat says wow\nThat's so nice to think about that because there are a lot of kids that have different allergy issues and it's kind of ... and now granted they go and

... where is the best place to go when it comes to trick or treating because there are some people\nThat decide to go to different neighborhoods and then some people need to go to different neighborhoods like I was talking to the guys this morning and the first of all I I don't do the whole Halloween thing in the first place I don't haven't for decades however in the development that I'm In ... it's really not conducive\nTo do any kind of trick or treating it was Seventeen different buildings all of them are locked so it isn't as kids were walking around doing the whole trick or treating they'd go someplace else to trick or treat so is there like the go to place\nNow I realize that you may not want to reveal this because you're thinking well if I let everybody know they should go there then and maybe the Candy's not going to\nBe as good if I once I get there but if it's really that good of a place and my guess is they have all kinds of candy and they'll be able to take care of or whatever the happens to be a request happens to be all ... says the go to place equals rich neighborhoods\nMhm well I I get that into it to an extent but there are some people who are rich and\nTheir stingy I mean there are\nNow ah I Know some that don't like passing out a little mini bars there was a big bar type you know the regular sized candy bars that's what they're all about and\nI and I respect that too now when it comes to Halloween and whether or not you leave it like it is you move to a Saturday or you or decide to turn it into a national holiday like I suggest I actually think it's\nUm I I think it's something that a lot of people would be on board with that and this tax that came through a saying that\nKeep it the way it is get rid of Columbus Day really why because this generation of snowflakes can't go to work come home and get their kids dressed and go trick or treating and then get up the next day\nRidiculous the next ...\nJust waiting to hear how

on and the governor made a very interesting statement regarding the punishment that he thinks that Robert ... hours\nShould be facing here's the governor from yesterday morning with Larry and John and the KKK morning news\nWhen it comes to the the murder or hear a medic by violence was heinous crime than than ours because there were just a piece you cited under federal by the federal statute\nAnd the Russians have all the under the law\nAnd the harshest penalty under the law is the death penalty right\nNow the da in Allegheny county da's a panel has decided he's going to hold off and allow the federal case go forward and then present the state case after the federal case has concluded\nBut the harshest penalty allowable by law is the death penalty\nWe don't have the death penalty currently in force in this country because of a month moratorium that Governor wolf has decided to impose\nNow can someone explained to me how that you believe that this man is should receive the harshest penalty available by law and then you're going to then withhold that harshest penalty\nJudiciously across the board for everyone in total fairness in the sense of justice then\nDon't say that he's deserving a British punishment available by law I Want to get your reaction to the governor eight six six three down one at ten twenty eight six six three nine one at ten twenty can the governor have it both ways\nWhere you are the guinea because it seems as though he said what he said to Larry in John because that was the expedient thing to say\nBecause in this region especially uh you know there was an election coming up it's less than a week away\nI don't know that people here are all that interested in the idea of this man if found guilty\nSweating because he's accused and it's it it's still the accused a and I'm the alleged shooter him you're still dealing with that from a legal standpoint um\nThis idea that he should spend the rest of his life in prison I don't see many people not only here but across the entire state maybe the country okay with that idea\nAnd if you're OK with him being executed how do you then not have the moratorium lifted\nYour reaction eight six six three nine one at ten twenty eight six six eight or nine one ten twenty call me right now you can also send me a note on the uh discussed it to to Pittsburgh news line\nI'm Sorry you ... you can also send

welcome the kitty K radio film\n[noise] hey how are you today good what's on your mind\nOkay I just want to say that the governor said that he deserves the form of punishment available what if the death penalty but he said the variable and other words\nYou can receive the death penalty but he gets that can be executed at this time but it is the ... and I met federal aid has never stop anybody from committing a crime\nAnd asked her one thing if we can see that a crime of escalated shooting so it doesn't really\nKnowing what was the issue I'm not interested in debating whether or not it has any effect it's whether or not be should be given it or not and is it consistent is it intellectually honest or the or the governor to say yes he should get it when the governor is saying he won't give it to him George and Clinton walk on the ... radio\nLand fear that you're kind of fly fishing either today casting for\nThem at all to the right to the law well focusing on the death penalty that

a matter of fact heading out there I think would rather have a fire\nYeah but the drug concoction is not the issue that is primarily being looked at by the governor it's about making sure that you don't execute people who are uh unjustly convicted in the first place I mean that's where his concerns primarily and they\nFound a lot of folks over the years when he and probably more story and most
