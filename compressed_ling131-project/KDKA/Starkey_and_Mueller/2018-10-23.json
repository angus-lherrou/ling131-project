to the U.S Mexican border\nAnd now they made it into Mexico underway still\nAlmost ah two thousand miles or so they have to go not expected to arrive in Tijuana San Diego area until about a month to month and a half from now joining us right now is CBS News correspondent in Mexico city Adrian barred covering the caravan and Adrian what can you tell us at this point\nWe have some information from the Mexican government on that the status of some of those people who are actually in Mexico um it's kinda hard to keep the numbers straight but according to the Mexican officials there are about five thousand\nA Honduran you've crossed in with this group into the Mexican border 'em up though they said at a close to a thousand seven hundred have filled out former petitions for asylum in Mexico and about five hundred have chosen to return\nBack home to Honduras my math isn't that great but I get twenty two hundred\nSo you know we've got a group of two thousand eight hundred people potentially a that are going to be continuing their journey up to the U.S border\nAnd by the way there are a couple of versions as to where they actually are trying to go we have heard\nUnder way but there I'm just telling you who is actually in Mexico right now so you know in five five thousand seven thousand people but the important point they're trying to make here is that I'm not all of them are going to continue to treacherous journey to the United states I'm under these circumstances\nOkay no very entrance into Mexico but the Mexico allow them or are they in Mexico um illegally if you will at this point any of them outside of those that you say the due to apply for asylum in Mexico\nWell technically yes but Mexico um has reiterated its position about migrants which is quite different from the position that the U.S government the current US government has and they take more of a position in in keeping with international views\nAbout what actually ... or the rights of asylum seekers and that's what they're repeating here and ... which is that migrants are not criminals\nUm asylum seekers are not criminals and there isn't any reason to use force against them or to detain them and Mexico's absolutely adamant that they are not going to do that just because the president the United states is telling them this is what you should be doing\nEven with the threats of financial aid that could be impacted\n[noise] even what the threats but keep in mind and this is a very confusing situation here because we have a government leaving office\nOn November the last day of November we have a new government which is a sea change over a much more to the left government coming in Mexico on December first and they're going to be even less likely to do anything or any kind of violence or any kind of\nYou know trying to hold back people are who have legitimate claims and the view of Mexico and the view of international law to seek asylum\nWhat are you hearing in reports regarding the views of the Mexican people toward this caravan of individuals from Honduras\nYeah well that's a really a great question a fair question because it you know I Can't say that everybody in Mexico is thrilled about it and I saw some polls this morning here on the Mexican a television network and some good analysts that I that I trust\nIn ... they think about eighty percent of the people in Mexico support their the migrants in the sense that they don't want to do anything against them\nUm and but there's about twenty percent of the people maybe twenty five that are upset about this because there are a lot of poor people in Mexico and a lot of people that need help and Mexico and so some of them are saying why should we have\nYou know poor people from Honduras taking jobs in our country that we need for our people overall the majority of people in Mexico seemed to be supporting them\nI'm In a kind of a humanitarian\nWay and in fact it's been you know a kind of almost hard to hold back the tears when you see grandmothers coming out the Mexican\nA working class of ... women older women just coming out just to give a hog if they don't have water or food to give to some of these young people and the group just coming up and give them a hug so there has been a tremendous outpouring of sympathy what you could actually physically see\nTalking with CBS News correspondent in Mexico city Adrian barred\nWhen a group this SARS comes into a town they're going through a lot of small towns at this point how were these sustaining themselves because it looks as though they have nothing more than the clothes on their back and maybe ... maybe workers put into a backpack for themselves I mean I'm seeing little ones would that would need diapers obviously mhm\nNothing more than the clothes on their back and they may be what could fit into a backpack for themselves I mean I'm seeing little ones would they would need diapers obviously food and water how are the existing at this point\nWell so that's kinda what I was addressing the ordinary people just coming out with giving them water food I saw some people coming out and getting strollers people are carrying babies yeah I mean you're talking about people who watch walk six\nOr seven hundred miles you know with babies and\nAnd so there's an outpouring and then there's also the official a what's the next governor is offering curious ... many of the people in this caravan do not want to go into basket or go to the shelters that the Mexican government has has set up that's one thing that's a very interesting they're afraid that it's like um\nYeah trap of mankind so basically they're sleeping out in ... in St in these smaller towns and yes they are now sending medical brigade down from Mexico City and I

to talk about it is Bruce and Coby act a law professor from St Vincent college joining us on the disc Institute of Pittsburgh new Zion and Bruce walk on the KKK radio good to have you back on\nAlways a pleasure but let's talk about this case how difficult do you see this being for either side at this point to convince the justices that they shouldn't rule either for or against\n[noise] if you read the lower court opinions the commonwealth court opinions um it it reads like a very technical argument about whether\nThe provisions of the home rule charter would give Pittsburgh the opportunity to do this the home rule charter has a provision that a city is not allowed to\nRegulate a number of aspects of businesses unless there is a state wide law that permits them to do so and there is no statewide law that specifically addresses the issue of sick leave time\nIf you take a step back from this ... ... the underlying issue here is does the state wanted permit\nMunicipalities to create a checkerboard scenario\nThat businesses that are deciding to relocate in the area have to determine well if if I moved here in the city of Pittsburgh I'm going to have to provide sick leave time\nOr I may be in a a a business ... business venture that that is not commonly given to my employees or I'm going to be at a competitive disadvantage if I Do perhaps I shouldn't move into this area\nThe ... the whole underlying ... the underlying argument about this is that you cannot allow cities to have a patchwork\nSystem like this to discourage business development\nLet me ask you this then you're making a pretty good argument but isn't that something for the legislature to deal with and not the Supreme Court considering that there is no law that would prohibit them from doing what they're doing\nThen allow them to do that and then go back and tell the lawmakers in Harrisburg listen if you don't want to have this nightmare scenario do something about it\n[noise] well actually the the law as written says to a city you cannot do certain regulations unless the legislature specifically authorizes you to do so with respect to the regulation of businesses\nAnd so at the existing law puts more or less the burden on Pittsburgh to say well\nThis is not really a regulation of business this is like one of our building codes were doing this for health and safety and that is that is the essential argument that they are making in this and there's actually a related case to this which is also going to be argued orange has been argued\nAnd that is about a city ordinance that required that in retail commercial buildings over a hundred thousand square feet that the employees in that building get a training by a a certified city fire bureau\nAh official and that the owner of the building certify that they have received that training that\nA certified city fire bureau ah official and that the owner of the building certify that they have received that training that ordinance was also struck down on the same basis\nAnd the city is certainly arguing that case my goodness this is this is safety this is health and safety and this is something cities are allowed to regulate\nA both of those are now before the Supreme Court and in both cases the city has lost and the courts below\nNow are you saying that the home rule charter that lawmakers in Harrisburg gays ... throughout the commonwealth a that gives them the this ... this latitude ... it has limits on it that aren't necessarily specified\nYes I'm the humble charters give us and they take the way I'm In in certain areas of the city has given a considerable degree of of latitude a considerable degree of discretion\nBut in the in the area of regarding the regulation of business is putting new requirements on businesses the the legislature seemed to to want to hold back on this because of concern\nOf creating a multiple system of regulations that I'm sure their argument will be that this would frustrate the development of new businesses because you know a a business is is going to want to move into an area\nAnd have a reasonable confidence that no matter where they move in Pennsylvania they are going to face the same regulatory environment\nSo does this also would would it fall under the category of what you're talking about if the city decided they wanted to have a higher minimum wage for every one that does business inside the city\nAre rigged I mean obviously they can do that when it comes to contracts and stuff like that yeah like if they wanted to make it a blanket rules for everyone they cannot do that based upon the home rule charter\n... we we would all be back in court over that one again and and the ... the result of this case will be enormously informative\nAs to that case if such a regulation was ever passed that all businesses in the city of Pittsburgh would have to pay a minimum wage of ex um he would be back into court and these cases will become critical precedent for those you\nKnow it may be one of the best things that have happened though is to go back to the lawmakers and get more specific about what it is that you want and don't want municipalities that have the liberty to do that way it doesn't go to the courts in the first place that just that's the way that it is\nOr pass statewide legislation that would mandate sick leave time for every employee in Pennsylvania in businesses over over a certain number of employees or however you would want to calculate it\nBut that's the other alternative is not to have local legislation but to have a state wide legislation that would cover employees are at all stages it at all levels throughout the commonwealth\nThat's the other all her friends and co VX is joining us on the disc Institute if it's for

you\nBecause I think what it does shine a light on the schools that we serve in Washington County and it helps connect create that bridge between the corporate entities in Washington County and give them an avenue on how they can directly support the students who so desperately need that support\nWe keep on hearing that we're living in one of the best economies maybe ever how is it that there's still a need and how great rather is the need in Washington County for kids who don't have the proper supplies to go to school\nYeah well I mean it is good news that the economy's doing well and I think generally speaking the Washington County economy is also improve a there are good census data that shows that but that doesn't mean it's improving for everyone in just the\nSeven schools that the education partnership is partnered with in Washington County we see poverty of among twenty five hundred or so students\nAnd I mean I think it's a problem that can be easily a draft and you think about getting school supplies into the hands of kids who need them in probably the folks that stand to benefit most outside of the students themselves in the students' families in that direct business community\nIf we're talking about how the business community is on the rise in Washington County five years down the road ten years down the road where are they hoping that that future workforce is going to come from\nI Would hope that they start by looking right under their nose so we can support the kids in their own geographic region I mean our goal is to make sure that all of those students have every access point could be successful in their education to take advantage of the rising economy\nGeorge Foy side with those with the education partnership where can people who are listening

they do the eye pad purchase\nAnd then they swing the screen around if you have worked at a place like this you don't need to get a signature you know you don't why do you do it\nI think as I can go
