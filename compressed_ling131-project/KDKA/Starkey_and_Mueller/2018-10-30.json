the welcome is he not welcome as in never welcome a or for that matter or how about a little bit later You're welcome but not just now uh I I've mixed it's been the way I have looked at this because I

prioritized a one eight six six what am I talking about eight six six three nine one ten twenty but to the topic is been simple be all the way to three o'clock basically it's it's morphed into ...\nAnd my take is been more like you know\nThere are three ways to look at this and that is\nYes absolutely no absolutely later absolutely in some way around on that let's go to bed she's been a gracious enough to be around for a while she's in swiftly how are you\nI'm fine how are you today\nGood how are things in your former Alan ...\n[laughter] you know I remember ...\nParents are ... you know there's that was on your mind active\n[noise] um I agree with the president coming here today and I base my opinion on the opinions of two very important people that I listen to what is the rabbi who didn't have a problem with him coming he didn't say\nOh you should come next week or he should come last week he should have been here two days ago he didn't put a timeline that he said if the president wants to come let him come\nAnd the other one was your caller that very emotional she was wonderful and\nUh she broke my heart um she said she wanted in here and she talked about their religious schedule and I didn't know about that she said this was the time and she felt that these victims were important enough\nTo have him come here and I I agree with that a hundred hundred percent they are important enough to have a presidential visit\nAnd she claims that the ... is that this time she wants him to get a visual of the synagogue and and I agree with\nThat yeah that was powerful ... who's very emotional and and they came across we talked about the human nature of this and obviously that that has come through many times today let me let me say this about\nIt is I've said from the beginning I think is norm as power I'm with President visits I think that I ... I almost always welcome them\nTo me it turns on menu factors you've talked about as well what is the right and what is wrong and I have to different people that are on the face and know that a lot more than I Do and I don't think there's anything wrong with saying that because you know it it's it's just the truth I'm a ... you know I'm ... you know that it's\nYou know some people go to the political aspect of it in a variety of other\nUm um reasons for that to me I'm I'm about ... what is appropriate and then I pray that his visit then used a unifying one\n... is an unmistakable language in and build verbal non verbal and does not devolve into things that we've heard or in other circumstances but I don't think would be appropriate for all\nThe other thing I wanted to say and I want to say this as an American I'm not saying this is a Democrat or Republican because I don't want to get into politics today I really don't you heard me say no\nDon't want to hear it but I'm saying this is an American because I think we've all had enough of this and not for the hate and that's what they hate talk and all this from everyone Democrats Republicans everybody everybody's tired of it\nBut you know we really miss the mark here in Pittsburgh\nWe could have shown a beautiful light you know the countries looking at us right now we could have shown a beautiful light on Pittsburgh today only our political ...\nAt us right now we could have shown a beautiful light on Pittsburgh today only our political leaders do though and council or anybody they're left in the city could have their five minutes to go to the president he's coming in at three forty five\nAnd shake his hand and say well come president thank you for coming and leave how long does that take from your schedules from traffic from the time you're logistics\nHow long political leaders in Pittsburgh would it take for you to just extend the olive branch to the president is coming here to honor our victim how long it doesn't take long it only takes a couple of minutes\nJust go wherever he is and if you don't want to stay and have dinner with him fine just go we would have been the heroes of the country we could have started a powerful movement here in Pittsburgh [noise]\nOur political leaders dropped the ball\nThank you Bye bye appreciate it very strong very powerful and a lot to be said for that we're going to continue the conversation right after Scott [noise]\nTriple a traffic on the finest hour vows are nice on route fifty one south on top of them we have an accent are over on the Pennsylvania Turnpike this is ... terrain Allegheny\nValley and bother rally blocking on my plane and ... point five on on on the album side of the ... before the Greenfield bridge overpass as your head towards these ... tunnel\n... backed up the grand streets blowing through points they bark thirty gets ...

I Hope that the political they want to add a lowered for\nBlind date he adds up late with if it's a way to be lower for three days and so I think it's a it's a third of the politics will cause the\nTotal how have promoted bad ... bad to let them and other things and I think that that there were all the time I think that came after election day and again the Democratic party may be crowded and capital gains that theory that and I got caught [laughter]\nThey're probably going to say on the end up with I think that ... that they that they thought I think the politics [noise] and um and I would hope off so that there were two African Americans killed even though they are hopefully with a letter or something because they'll probably will but um I think that he came out there that they\nAll right ... thanks sorry well I mean you know that's an ear uh it would be a\nSilly to not acknowledge that there are a lot of folks are tied those things together I'm I suspect uh I'm not naive but uh I I think the circumstances are circumstances that would call for a presidential visit\n'em there's somebody said earlier it's world issue and making it clear where\nThis country stands with respect to an anti Semitism\nViolent acts like this in other things we probably may not well I Would say we don't necessarily appreciate it as much as those who live around the world or need to hear around the world were so consumed with it is right and are not literally just event but the whole dialogue is in our\nBack yard every day and\nUh there's enormous power to those words and that's the symbolism or goes out\nUh and that's what's favors having the president here and as I said earlier if he doesn't show up or or have an inkling of it or we're rejects that creates another problem for him so you just fits into the category if your damage do damned if you do on the flip side yeah I could have gone for a few uh cancellations of\nA ... or\nWhatever they're called a rallies um a few different times now but there's nothing quite knew about that a let's go out to a Tricia Tricia welcome decay decay radio malice cannon but guess what oh good good I thought it was two forty fourth to forty one you're good what's on your mind\nOh Alice thank you thank you for taking my call I just want to express my opinion um in regard to your question as to whether or not a President Trump should be visiting Pittsburgh\nToday and I think it is absolutely the only place that President Trump would be um given that he is the leader of our country and our nation and that this is a city that is in the morning I'm Jewish non Jewish all of us as Pittsburgh urged have come together and\nThis is a city that is in the morning I'm Jewish non Jewish all of us as Pittsburgh or have come together and are in in deep sorrow over this\nHateful crime that has happened and all of us are United in and our agreement that there is no place for hatred\nSo when our president comes in to to be the leader that he was elected to be that's where I expect him to be that's where I think many of us know that it brings great comfort to those who\nWho have had this hate hate crime extracted upon them and um and I completely agree with that that we miss the mark and not just treating this as\nAs the president's visit he's in he's out he does he does and pays his profound respect\nAnd I also wanted to say another thing to Alice that for the first time I I turn you on today and I actually stayed with you because of the way you've handled this subject and the way you've invited everyone to call in and calmly express their opinions about\nAbout about what this means it's given that is controversial I Can't help but be disappointed in my local leadership that they don't acknowledge our president and this leader\nComing in to share his respects with them and with the rest of the community and as far as I'm concerned these in any out and politics has no no place in this well as I don't think you'll hear a word from him\nOn that in that regard ... wait to see\nRight right ... that's been one of the difficult things about today is we ask we're asking a question about whether we should or shouldn't and you know go to a totally different than a few hours expectations are going to be low for a lot of people seem to be exceedingly them or just a little bit of seemed like a

Vincent college joining us on the disc Institute of Pittsburgh news on a now granted he can draft anything he wants to and sign it as an executive order is it possible for it to stand\nNo not in there if I I Would be stunned if if the stood\nYou're talking about an attempt to interpret\nThe first clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution a clause that has been interpreted by the Supreme Court a cause that has history where at the time of the passage of the fourteenth amendment ... the very meaning of this was debated\nAnd it would appear that that the people who passed the fourteenth amendment we're reasonably clear\nThat it was meant to do what it says which is all persons born or naturalized in the United states\nAnd subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and the states where in they reside and the the phrase that gives people pause is the phrase subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nBut at the time of the debates what that meant was that there are two very narrow classes of people who were not subject to the jurisdiction the United states one where those people who were foreign diplomats who had diplomatic immunity\nOr another even tiny or group were actually a theoretical group which would be the the the children of enemy occupiers if and if a foreign government or occupy the United states that would not count there was also some question about the relationship of Native American tribes\nTo federal jurisdiction at the time but\nIn so far as ... as individuals\nWho were who were born of parents who were not United States citizens it was reasonably clear that the clause meant to give those children citizenship upon their birth here\nNow in these individuals they had primarily on their mind\nWas it a thought to ward ... those who were born of slaves was thought to ward those that were visiting this kind of whatever the reason why is that we're even new migrants to this country who is being thought of primarily in doing this in the first place\nThere appears to have been an overt attempt on the part of this language of the fourteenth amendment which was proposed by Amish the the senator from the state of Michigan Jacob powered\nAnd also supported by a congressman from Ohio named John Bingham who actually was born in Mercer, Pennsylvania and moved to Ohio\nBut their their\nFocus was on eradicating the Dred Scott decision\nThat had come in or around Eighteen fifty six had essentially ruled that that any person who was born in Africa could not ever be a citizen of the United states this this horrific decision\nThat um upheld and ratified the position of slavery ruled illegal to Missouri Compromise that had been a hope for a means of avoiding a civil war um but\nThe the ruling of Dred Scott which would have made a very different um calculus for citizenship this amendment\nThe individuals who proposed that pretty clearly said this amendment wants to eradicate the thinking of Dred Scott from the books\nThere an argument then that it would be some type of an overreach to extend this to immigrants whether the\nThe thinking of Dred Scott from the books\nIs there an argument then that it would be some type of an overreach to extend this to immigrants whether they be here legally or illegally\n... the ... the language reads what it says and there was there was a case is decided in the late Eighteen hundreds a involving a case called United States versus warm Kim arc\nA gentleman who was born in San Francisco of Chinese parents who were never us citizens and never could have been us citizens under the existing law at the time\nUm this gentleman's parents moved back to China he went and visited them a couple of times and when he returned from a visit he was denied entry on the basis that well you're not a you're not a citizen of the United states\nOr the United States Supreme court upheld his citizenship saying he was born here it doesn't matter that his parents were under the law that time in eligible to become citizens\nThe fact that he was born here gave him the the the citizenship of the United states per the language of the fourteenth amendment and so\nThat's it that's going to be a a very difficult argument but you know beyond that is just the fact of\nThe president power to issue executive orders extends to the administration of the law his power under article two of the constitution is to be the executive tour of the laws\nOr if he be takes under that auspices the authority to interpret the constitution he will run headlong into the Supreme Court and this is a debate that has gone back to almost the founding of the republic\nAnd regularly the Supreme Court reminds the executive\nThat it is their job to interpret the constitution and to have the final say so on it um presidents from Nixon overweight back in time had been told that lesson explicitly by the Supreme Court time and time again\nAnd Bruce and Kobe you really sound

look back to two thousand twelve and Superstorm Sandy is that was a lot of grief that was given by Republicans to Chris Christie because he would dead or\nHave a meeting with President Obama in the aftermath of that storm when they would go around and they were meeting with victims of that storm\n\nAnd my question for you is it real simple if it was\nWrong for governor wolf to do it to not why was it wrong for Christie to do I mean we have to have some sense of consistency right don't get upset when the other side of the Iowa was playing politics when your side of the aisles playing politics\nI mean we can easily be hypocrites can't win I think so Helen forest hills welcome to Katie gay radio good to have you\nOr I didn't think there was anything wrong with Christie meeting Obama and I don't think there's anything wrong with Trump meeting that got there and if people are so full of hate 'em to heck with them you know we need a middle ground\nWe do need that Helen thank you very much for calling I'm Glad you did Mike in him feel welcome to Katie K radio\nHigh I agree with that on a hundred percent uh I mean I think there are some things that are bigger than being on one side of the aisle or the other\nAnd I think that uh violence in our country is one of those things you know I mean I I won't go ahead and guess what ah the governor or the mayor might have done that they thought was more important than being there with Donald Trump today\nA because frankly we don't know their jobs and we don't know what\nOther responsibilities they have but I just do think that it would have been meaningful for them to be there and show sometime unit for the people of Pittsburgh and for the United states\nOr Mike thank you very much for calling in I don't think you could argue that if there was a Democrat in the White House they would have cleared their schedule if a Democrat was coming or Dan in Greensburg welcome the KKK radio\nBy I'm actually considering a trend I agree with Mike and Helen I'm I think that you made an inaccurate and in my opinion ah insulting assumption that those of us who are opposed to the governor and the mayor playing politics\nAre here you are at least I think I heard you assume that the way by default ah especially as conservatives were in favor of opposing Obama's visit to Christie on those of us who oppose playing politics and wake of a tragedy\nOr consistent in that opposition uh regardless of what side of the Iowa leave we ...\nAnd I appreciate I listen I appreciate that you are in ... but you represent a ... you don't represent collective and there were concerns that were being made and there are many that blame Christie\nFor Obama's re election in two thousand twelve I understand that you have a different
