think all ... three thousand from what for what\nFor empower three thousand dollars for a mound fees yeah that's pretty hefty isn't it a ...\nYeah it is an saying I've never heard three thousand dollars impound fees that's kind of crazy okay it's from a collection agency do you have proof that you sold the bike\nUm I heard it on her\nGod I understand but you didn't you don't have proof you just did it so as far as as far as they're concerned you never transfer title\n[noise] okay so here you are never transferring title\nAnd uh\nNow who is with the collection agency whose charging you for the impound fees\nAre All right it was it was it the city or a private company\nA nightmare I guess what the ticket and then that led to a helicopter to come out\nAll right so they're telling company and they won three thousand dollars\nA\nGallon and even if I let him keep the bike and just say yeah fine you know go ahead and keep it if they go after you uh you say I saw the bike years ago\nAnd the problem is they're going to ask what's proof that's why I asked you for paperwork a sales I either a a sales ah receipts I mean my daughter had a a very old car\nOr that she gave to a friend of hers and and and she made sure that it was ... she has the copy that his registered or you were going to say what\nAuction off the bike and someone else ... recovered after ...\nYeah because they impounded so you just say no because you sold the bike and argue and I don't understand the three thousand dollars but a a mark your defenses are are attacking\nThe three thousand dollar impound vi and somehow proving that you sold a biker gave it to your body and uh that's all you can do and maybe your buddy will testify saying yeah\nAh he sold the bike to me and I saw on registering at ...

right when you're so what's your question like question is\nShould pay and put that about half of what I\nYeah I mean how much is a ticket I don't get like a couple of dollars\nAre going to be a lot more than ... here you go to court I Would just pay it but here you may have an argument and you go in front of a judge you know your honor here's what happened a B C and D and uh\nThey said we should have filed a police report who helped ... police report over a stolen sticker on a license plate because once I put the sticker on a license plate like every other human being who pays attention anymore\nBecause I think my first check it every day\nYeah exactly I think I think paying into different these in defense a shirt tell it to a judge 'cause the words that happened you can have to pay for the ticket anyway or or\nIs how do we get all ... yeah yeah you know I get a lawyer this is this is one where it's\nA above your pay grade yeah you're going to need even in either trust in a state lawyer figure this one out instantly and you want to get one like tomorrow kind of thing\nAnd make a motion to freeze everything pending and this is where you go into court ah with an emergency order and uh that\nThe court to freeze which which the court will do and then you start trying to figure out how much money this person has stolen a from your loved one yeah it's no fun when that happens whole\nDamn good high gave right [noise] yeah okay yeah\nSo uh [noise] I'm a software developer and uh I developed some software or a media studios that actually was a young wrestle show\nAnd a quick but I just want to know part of the case against ... basically [laughter] my cousin which I Do not have a contract with\nA new one that you know a God of the deal and a contract is between young on the referee and my cousin company and I developed a software and so\nWe should receive licensing fees every year okay uh for this\nFor the software and uh probably four or five years I was receiving my payment and then a one year last year was somewhere around October it's won't get a man I didn't get my payment and eye contact like us and I said hey you know what's going on in this\nBig long story short basically what I found out where he went to his friend and they were trying to rewrite the software copy and like a basically and give a CBS a new version of the software and then they finally got me out of the deal\nYeah how much money were you getting a year\nOr a thirty grand was leasing and my cousin give me twelve and he'd keep\nUh actually I got eleven like eleven thousand eight hundred different so hot at work that he got more money than you can eat it and the\nVolcano but there is no good reason for him to get more money than you you were just in you can look at\nThe end of that now now in those four years I just want you know I was the one that they always contacted report to the soccer I Would go and do the right\nOkay so here's the so the bottom line you get to see who your cousin and your cousins defense is going to be hot gee we don't have any signed contract your argument is going to be yeah but then why do we don't have a signed contract why did you pay me a over four years but what if\nWhat if I don't want to see my cousin and what if I thought I did I I spoke with the DEA is in the restaurant next plane than situation unfortunately they're caught in the middle but I told him I owned the copyright that software\nOkay so you're right and right now you're you're infringing on those copyright\nI'll actually not because there was a contract or that they have and it's not CBS it's growing you is your cousin that's screwing you and someone has a written contract and you're saying there was a written contracts between your cousin and CBS correct\nYes and yet but in that contract there's nowhere there is no car there's nothing that states I'm releasing my copy right\nYou have a lot but the point is that you're allowing him to use it it's not a question releasing the copyright is the question if we we have a deal you can go ahead and use it a verbal deal you go ahead and use it so what do you want to do if you can't sue the cubs and what what would you like\nI Want what I Want to stop using with awkward\nI I don't know if you can start you can stop it now you can make a motion to have CBS and then there was a lawsuit about interference with a contract that they may have but I tell you you go in to see a CBS you gotta you gotta world of hurt and what are you gonna do you're going to send them the cease and desist saying you can't use the software anymore\nBecause uh I'm being ripped off and they're going to say we're not ripping you off you talk to your time than what I don't want us to my cousin well that's your idea OK\nYeah basically basically it's\nLike why don't you want to sue your cousin who's coming you name it you know because\nIt's good because it's going to cause more family problems I Believe you know [laughter] [noise]\nI don't know okay you're you are an idiot across several different levels I was going to cause a family problems if someone's stealing a stealing from me and I want to go
