represented mark must deal on the line we were talking about a bill that is a before the house I'm sitting out there are waiting to be finished a it deals with tele medicine and tell them medicine coverage or mark or\nWant to do or just for anybody that has\nBeen hurt or wants to know the specifics of tele medicine and what it it does and and can accomplish I'm Mark was going to provide us a little bit of a um explanation\nYeah thanks um you know in Pennsylvania and maybe other parts of the country as well there's shortages\nOf certain types of positions and that was in an addition in rural areas um there's even a more exaggerated a shortage so what tele medicine will do\nWill be able to bring for example some initial drug treatment um as I said earlier some behavioral health in psychiatry um intensive is those are the types of physicians that work in intensive care facilities intensive care\nIn psychiatry um intensive is those are the types of physicians that work in intensive care facilities are intensive care units in hospitals\nSo the the challenge that is out there right now is the providers because they're doing the right thing in in making available or via tele medicine's these types of specialties\nUm unfortunately they don't have unlimited resources to do that so the insurance companies most and probably Ninety five percent of the cases will pay for in person\nTreatment from a specialist but to get that same type of quality work done via telemedicine they're not reimbursing for it so as you and I saw that some of the demonstrations that we went to\nUm the gentleman who was coming in from Johnstown area to go to the hospital in Pittsburgh um was backed up on traffic in traffic on the parkway eighth and he had gastrointestinal issues he had to relieve himself\nThough he pulled over to the burn jumped over the guard rail and and did that whereas\nOnly because that only because mark his insurance company wouldn't cover the same procedure via tele medicine that could've been done\nThe only reason that situation happened\nThat's correct it was it was it was a doctor visit a prior to uh you know going in for surgery but because we had to make that up for our journey and get stuck in traffic on the ... are on the parkway eighth\nThat's what happened in life you know so but think about it give me the ... and I'm Sorry representative excuse me so uh [laughter]\nThe um the amount of time\nUh that that took out of an individual's life\nBut they put that in your situation right you have a young child um ... you could have the ability to\nUh you know get treatment for your son\nOr without having to take if you lived in the city multiple buses to get to get to that position um you know all these types of scenarios the persons that that's a sick at work and doesn't have to take the day off work all these reduce costs in addition um the the rates that were going to be\nI'm reimbursed for not parity thirty eight other states are doing this by the way I'm Pennsylvania's not so we left it up to the insurance companies and the providers then go she ate so obviously in most cases there would be a negotiated a lower rate which\nWould benefit the insurers yeah I'm so right now the insurers are saying oh we're reimbursing and they provide or the\nYeah I don't know if a if I lost mark there but I've worked I've worked\nHim on this issue over the last couple of months and and and what we're stuck with two free market conservative sweat you know that we we we like to\nAllow the private sector or to uh to work work its course to solve problems because we're a little ... were very hesitant to put the government or\nA into that space um and but you have to free market conservatives saying there must be the free market in health care and insurance when it comes to tell a medicine has been broken\nWe need a legislative solution a legislative solution\nThat has been passed in Mississippi it's been passed in ah Texas also in New York and California\nAte a system that will put the boundaries in place not to micromanage tele medicine and coverage but to ... to ... to ... to make sure that our

deserves a lot of credit\nUm these types of issues aren't partisan there about the having the leadership and the guts to get them across the finish line and I want to thank mark for his leadership or

government um and reimbursement and people are stuck in the middle I mean health care in this country as I mentioned earlier one sixth of our economy it is a huge business\nBut in my opinion we need legislation to to put doctors and patients in the center of our health care and that's why tele medicine is so important it's also why we've got to have um we've got to have a a more consistency in the way I'm\nOr health care system is administered um and we don't have it right now and it's pretty frustrating I can I\nAll I can say is elections have consequences and this is a a major election

there's there's um some a lot of strategy that goes into it um you know and I I Do think\nWe've got to be careful of how much we micromanage from the government standpoint micromanage um you know businesses and it's a business I I I I'm very critical of some of their business decisions um some of which we can solve um\nBut consumers to consult some of them to um and uh\nBy voting with their feet as we as we like to say but you know it's a short run given\nGiven the opportunity I'll give you a for instance I live in Armstrong got it right now okay when before Obamacare started I had at least four choices are health insurance than when Bob kicked in I only had two other the other people ... wouldn't let you know they left now the question is\nIf if health insurers have to provide for basically everything including you know free a free existing condition so why did they get to discriminate on where they sell their insurance\nBut not well they they can they could they have to do everything for the patient you know give a lot of service but yet they can say okay for this group of people we can't do that for you so you know and you know what happens to the price of it it goes way up I'm a conservative Republican myself but I Believe in free market\nAnd I believe that if you let that things are open to the market instead of third party payers instead of going\nLook at myself but I Believe in free market and I believe that if you let things open to the market and the third party payers instead of going to a hospital and you you could ask them how much is is it for that but that to me they can't tell you\nYou won't tell you you're right Ron this was like I mentioned earlier you you can't hear what you don't reveal and transparency is one of the solutions and its including including the costs of health care um and this is something the legislature consoles again\nUm these nonprofits these or a tax exempt organizations need to provide transparency ... for what the cost of health care really is\nAnd and you're absolutely right it is a ... what the cost of healthcare is now is what's the maximum amount we can get reimbursed for it it makes no sense we can use technology\nIf the ... and put reasonable guidelines in place that protect the consumer and we need to protect a consumer with providing more transparency and it absolutely or could be applied in health care I think uh we need\nWe need to do more of it and I do think transparency is one of the solutions Barbara in squirrel hill\nYou're on a good how are you\nThinking [laughter] yeah I'm sure about that myself I I'm like a everyday get something from a health care you know\nAnd they're talking about I I Belong to a security breach at low right now and so I called in and before they told me I got a letter saying don't worry about it that way\nAnd all of a sudden they say it will affect me a hundred and twenty nine paid up at the switch to something else\nOr else she said I get paid to some to Nineteen dollars a month for health care right now it's one sixty six\n... that you know a a Barbara oh I can say is that uh if the legislature were were to do what\nI think it should do and it should protect consumers and it should provide consistency in our health care system not all of our problems are going to be solved in Harrisburg some of them have to be solved in Washington\nAnd I think if we were to to to put some reasonable guidelines in place that provide consistency and transparency that's why the tele medicine bill that's what it provides consistency trends parents see a needs to be achieved\nA and other other bills but but the reason I hyperventilating on these issues right now is because right now you have you ... the public has access to all the people that are

afternoon a radio afternoon news has brought you\nBuy right automotive the best deal in Pittsburgh after the news with rose at the bottom of the hour we will chat with a triple A. and Laurie cook is going to come by the safety advisory there have been some or rather\nA troubling statistics that have arisen out of a study that they put together ... as it relates to teen drivers so if you do have a team driver or if you have between as they say you know your twelve Thirteen year old kid who\nUh is they're getting ready to drive perhaps sooner rather than later though there's still a few years off of course they're Thirteen ah but you get my drift and uh it's something that you want to hear perhaps in preventative measures that we will get into with Laurie again the safety advisor\nFor AAA that's coming up after the news with rose up top of the hour I Want to talk to senator J cost and he's been kind enough to join us uh at the top of the hour because you'll recall perhaps uh what was in the news after\nTennis is against gay radio afternoon News I'm Dan's angrily keeping the chair warm for Robert Mann Gino he has the afternoon option\nPut on surprisingly a couple of teenagers together in a car without adult supervision\nWell I'm Glad you asked that question uh actually what we know about new teen drivers those that are that are sixteen Seventeen years of age than are are actually three times more likely as adults to be involved in a deadly crash in in twenty sixteen we had teen drivers involved in\nA more than a million police report it crashes that resulted in thirty two hundred people being killed um and that's pretty significant\nLaurie what's the common denominator here not to cut you off but I mean because that's a short period of time and a total hockey stick it was like\nOh oh certainly well I think it's you know a lot of it has to do with the inexperience at them they they simply don't have the experience of a season driver that increases the chances that there's gotta be some sort of deadly outcome not just for the team driver but for the passengers and other folks on the road\nSo we really AAA really wants to emphasize the need for teen drivers to gain adequate training especially in different driving scenarios and certainly having their parents involved as the coach and the seat beside them\nSo I obviously texting and driving who's been a culprit here for years and and I think it would be irresponsible of me to do is one of the state anyway\nYou know you you look at the Instagram Snapchat is where you're literally taking real time videos of yourselves ... it it appears not to get on an ... an old man get off your your your launch an old guy soap box here but\nI mean do we know what the culprit is is it distracted driving you mentioned the inexperienced but I obviously ... Lori when you and I started driving these numbers weren't numbers\nWell we ... we have you know their their attention is is everything competes for their attention\nAnd and driving has almost become secondary to the initial task is your first job is to drive the vehicle and everything else should be secondary to that but with our younger drivers you know there are so inexperienced at operating a motor vehicle that they think they can multitask and do all these things the same time and they really can't\nYou know and you combine that with an experience you can find that with speed you put other people in the vehicle with them you know we we see a fatality rate jumped for fifty six percent for occupants of other vehicles were teen drivers involved\nForty five percent just for the team driver and if you throw in pedestrians cyclists there fatalities go up Seventeen percent so it's huge when you when you put teens and a team passenger combo together\nYou know Laurie I brought John here to discuss the data which is disturbing and um if you want to learn more about it you can visit our website ... radio dot com\nAgain twenty sixteen teen drivers were involved in one more than more than one million police report it crushes thirty two hundred deaths researchers have pinpointed a win teams were carrying passengers other teen passengers as they ... jumping and fifty six percent of occupants of other vehicles forty five percent\nOf the teen drivers Seventeen percent for pedestrians and cyclists that that are staggering so I I guess the the counterpoint is what to do about it I mean this was a bad spot here lord but do you do do we can put him\nIn a bathroom we consider do we consider raising the driving age or are we going to get to that point I\nI think we need to start with supervise driving with with parents you know a monitoring and mentoring they're driving to teach them how to become safe and responsible drivers that you know typical AAA recommend that you know we we would like to the parents that at least a hundred hours of supervised driving\nA with them before they drive so though by by giving them some practice in low driving low risk situations and and moved to a situation that become more complex driving at night driving in the rain different kinds of weather challenging roads hills curves and things like that\nAnd not allowing more than one non family member uh\nSitting at night driving in the rain different kinds of weather challenging road kills curves and things like that and not allowing more than one non family member\nA passenger under the age of twenty to ride with a teen drivers during the first six months of driving a Sony as soon as you put a teen passenger in their uh their their crashed six go right off the charts\nIt's ah it's staggering ... it's disturbing and I guess uh the the what to do about it now you you mentioned I guess for potential remedy I Do understand that the numbers do increase with the presence of an adult right\n[noise] yes they do I'm actually but we find out that those numbers go down when you have more experience drive or at least age thirty five an older ride when a driver fatality rates go down ... percent\nWell yeah I mean so obviously there is a common denominator there but\nI mean I I I'm just thinking ahead here Laurie these numbers continued to trend in the direction that they are trending\nA ... and we boil it down to you know them some common denominator is you know teams together with the teams in the car with no adult supervision but I think we can take it a few steps further I Do wonder ... where we are going to be and what we're going to be faced with obviously some hard decisions\nAnd um I mean I I don't know I mean I guess we're going up off the beaten path here but but nonetheless\nI mean something's got something's got to give as my\n... well it certainly does things need to be be looked at and um you know whether that's a change in state law that certainly is something that that that's a possibility but\nYou know not not immediate remedy but you know we certainly like to mention that you know teen driving that triple A. dot com we have some great parent teen resources that are available path and go on our website and get that information right now and find out how to make a difference in their teens\nLie and what kinds of differences can they make and what can they expect if they do log on\nWell they can find out a lot of information about how to um you know practice with their teens how to use different route 'em how to use the three factors that we actually using and adjusting speed young drivers tend to go too fast\nOr they tend to not slow down in conditions where you need to slow down rain snow sleet poor visibility fog and things like that so there's some good tips on all of that that we can give them\nLaurie cook safety advisor for AAA we appreciate your coming on and I'm hopefully next time which I
