right now and\nBuilt this story is making a lot of different twists and turns and it looks as though the president is caught up in the middle of and\nHe is caught in the middle of it and others around him and in Congress say uh you almost have to forgive him for being caught in the middle I just listen to an audio interview that Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana did a short while ago and he explained he says look the president is caught between a rock and a hard place here he says because\nThe gut instinct to want to go out in the sanctions Saudi Arabia for this and to go after them he says but the hard\nAnd a true fact is Saudi Arabia though it's a government and its leadership is not an authoritarian one and not one that uh you know the United states necessarily a ... a endorses but\nThese are the people we have to do business with an order to keep the stability in the middle east he said countries like Saudi Arabia turkey and even Iran to that extent and he said the ... the sand because we can't\nReally get along with Iran and Saudi Arabia is needed so much more so there's got to be away from the president to say what you did was wrong we're going to hold your feet to the fire on this it's not in your best interests to do this and here's how we're going to move forward and that that seems to be a you know what everybody's trying to figure out here in Washington is how exactly to go about that\nNow considering that they have we have the relationship as you just described with Saudi Arabia is there much more in that anyone saying that actually can be done other than waving your finger at them and telling them that they were wrong for doing what\nAnd read them and telling them that they were wrong for doing what they did and then go on to something else\nUnless your if your Senator Lindsey Graham you throw the bucket Saudi Arabia he says I Want to throw sanctions at them I Want to get tough on them I Want to tell them and no uncertain terms\nYou know you took out a U.S resident he may not have been a full blooded citizen but he lived here he's got children here ah and ah you don't have a fiance ah and ah he did work for the Washington Post did other things in this country so you know it was an American interest and we're in it whether we like to be in it or not now again compared to that\nAgain you've got guys like Kennedy of Louisiana was saying you know that sounds great on paper\nUm but he said you know that's a pie in the sky approach to it he says we have to look at the pragmatic realities of the middle east and and that's how we should guide ourselves\nNow what about the reports that are coming out from a pro government Turkish newspaper that sites in official describing some gruesome details regarding the body of Jim all good show the ... what are you hearing in Washington at this point about this\nWell we have not confirmed those reports and talking with our correspondent on the ground in Istanbul are highly Williams\nShe's somewhat skeptical of this Turkish outlet because they've been known to publish a shall we say are embellished versions of stories in the past not saying that it didn't happen this way we just haven't confirmed it yet but uh yeah so those details which I won't go into here are are are excruciatingly gruesome and or\nIf they do proved to be true well ah you know again it puts the administration here in Washington in into even a tougher place in terms of how to respond to this ...\nAgree with you until we get a confirmation that these are descriptions are accurate I don't want to be a part of a spreading any information regarding that as well what about the president and this idea of a comparison back\nTo judge Kavanaugh and that somehow Saudi Arabia is guilty until they prove themselves and they said how is that playing with lawmakers in Washington\nAt the very least there was an artful expression to say we need to take our time and we need to search this out and get to the bottom of the investigation at worst a critics are saying this is just the president's ah you know trying to\nYou know a take off for Saudi Arabia and try to give them some cover and all of this uh and where it lands is probably somewhere in between those two points men Gino but it is getting a ... that comment was not well received it all by many are from the center over on the left side of town\nThat presidents also suggested that we may know by the end of the week uh what ultimately did happen to this journalist ... is there a reason to believe that that is possible are there others that are confirming what the president is suggesting that an investigation can wrap up that quickly\nWell look I think the best information we have is what's being reported a you know journalistically speaking here uh that uh\nUh that a Turkish report not withstanding ... again it may turn out to be a completely true report down the line but that's where we are getting\nMost of our best interests or information now my ... says he went over and had a productive discussion with both the Saudis and with the Turks before coming back home so it may be that uh you know he is a reporter something to present by week's end in any case uh there are more details that are emerging almost by the hour on this man Gino it wouldn't surprise me\nIf we know a whole lot more on which way the story goes in the next few days I one\nLess thing Steve I'm for it and I are reported about the idea that maybe the FBI or maybe playing some or all asked at the FBI was being sent to president than asking back or how do you know that the FBI has not do we know anything concrete regarding any potential FBI involvement into these investigations\nWell how do you know that the FBI has not do we know anything concrete regarding any potential FBI involvement into these investigations or we're relying solely at this point on the Turks and the Saudis\nWell it's the Turks are investigation at this point uh we don't have any confirmation that the FBI is involved either an advisory capacity or a direct investigative capacity or our polar read his work at her sources on that but we have\nHeard absolutely nothing about that but as as it appears on the surface anyway at least at this point it's the Turks show a and the Saudis too because they control the consulate

the gay decay radio after the news ... by right on a mode of the best deal in Pittsburgh [noise]\nGot a question for you how would you rate the job market in Pittsburgh well according to a survey done by glass door they say the Pittsburgh is actually number one in the entire country\nAll cities considered Pittsburgh is number one and here's the way they broke this down um Pittsburgh offers more than Ninety One thousand job openings medium base salary is forty six thousand five hundred dollars\nAnd the median\nPrice for a home one hundred and forty one thousand three hundred dollars and those three issues\nThe ease and finding a position the city's affordability and then job satisfaction on top of that\nWere what went into the rankings and Pittsburgh at number one let's talk about this right now joining us on the disc Institute of Pittsburgh news mine is Andrew Sassaman he's the branch manager for Robert half\nAnd Robert half is an employment services organization here with offices all over the country but right here in Pittsburgh as well and Andrew walk on the radio right to have you\nThanks for having me Robert I appreciate it so\nIs very hot right now it is a great time to be looking for a job here in Pittsburgh it's a it's a combination of quite a few things but I think one of the great parts about what our city is bringing right now is the the reinvention that we're going through right now we've transformed into this biotech cub\nYou have dozens of universities around here some of the best in the country and you combine that still with uh some of the ah the old manufacturing the level that still out there a great time to be job searching here in Pittsburgh\nNow are we talking about just the highest of the tech jobs or is this something that has brought appeal and uh the job market is wide and deep\nI Would say that this is white and deep right now I'm so you've been here in Pittsburgh for a while now you know the Monterey used to be that the\nKids couldn't wait to get out of Pittsburgh once they got their degree right they were going to go somewhere else and find that great job that's changed now they are staying here in Pittsburgh so it's everything it's the entry level roles in the mid ... here at the opportunity to be promoted the move up within an organization that has its roots here in Pittsburgh\nAnd everything up through the through the ranks [noise]\nAre you seeing people that are showing an interest in wanting to move here I mean one of the struggles that Pittsburgh has had even though it's been consistently listed as one of the most livable cities in the affordability of housing and then you had the high tech\n... like you talked about what's Carnegie Mellon ... and with pet\nAnd then you couple that with the universities are not only with the those other universities here that you have U. P. M. C. A. G. H. but we still seem to be having a difficult time and really attracting people to want to come here in large numbers why do you think that is\nWell I think we're starting to see a little bit of that or the first people that we are attracting hair or what I call the boomerang or they're the ones that have left Pittsburgh and are coming back so they're they're kind of on the inside track right so they know what we're about here and there they're looking to come back so we are seeing more of that but the idea of attracting talent you're right it's still somewhat of a challenge\nUm I I think we haven't seen quite as many come back because not as many organizations here in Pittsburgh has made it attractive enough with relocation package is back here I think that that is something that needs to to change and evolve a bit before we can attract\nThe same level of talented maybe a New York or Boston or Chicago could\nI once again we're talking with Andrew Sassaman branch manager with Robert half international or they are a human resources consulting firm with offices here in Pittsburgh and throughout the country\nOr what needs to take place in order for us to be even better I mean granted we're number one but you don't want to be content with what number one what does it take what are we need to go and do next what needs to be accomplished\nBut I think you mentioned it right you don't want to hold the status quo I think we need to continue to improve I think that\nYou see this odd juxtaposition of high tech here in Pittsburgh combined with the old steel mentality I think we need to continue to evolve\nOffering more things that increase job satisfaction overall we uh we only ranked to three points you out of five and job satisfaction here in Pittsburgh and I think that's something that we can work on with our current employees offering more flexibility the ability to work from home and flex time the things that will make the current rules more attractive\nI'm going to be what we can improve upon at this point in time our salaries are starting to keep up I think there's still some room for improvement there but\nAre generally low cost of living helps to balance that out\nOnce again for joining us on to discuss it to to Pittsburgh news line Andrew Sassaman branch manager with Robert half international and what they once again ... human resources consulting firm here in Pittsburgh and around the entire country and around the world for that matter\nSo for that matter a Andrew thank you very much for your time Robert thanks for having me do
