to create a bomb but not necessarily have one that could actually be functional\nWell because you need you need some type of catalyst that's going to energize the actual device now what do you mean by that is\nThere there are certain types of triggers their remote microchip detonator there are clocks if there are a number of different ways in which you can engage that device absent that it's almost like a gift and just say I can give you it's almost like carrying a gun without a firing that so if you don't have that one piece that's going to accelerate that\nThat that package into being an explosive device and functional want then it you know it really becomes nothing more than a paper away but we don't know that that's the case as\nOkay I I heard you this morning when you were on with

know\nInside your deepest feelings of who this was does this fit what you were thinking most likely the person would have been\nYeah I mean it with this had to me with this said to me it was right side\nUltra right side radical is outlet somebody that was drinking from his own Kool Aid from one that was listening to rhetoric political rhetoric and and from that deal to his own level of just

it really does sit rather well into the the age the race the the ... the gender the uh [laughter] um I hate to say this because I Know it it sounds inappropriate but um [noise]\nThe lack of where with all of obviously this man isn't going to be gradual probably didn't graduated from Harvard put it that way [noise]\nHelped me connect the dots here on this issue I'm a little surprised that somebody with a criminal record as long as his is would then have a very adamant interest in politics how to use it as\nWell you know that's a fascinating way of putting it but I don't know that he had the interest in politics so much\nAs he likes to pile on and I don't know that he was so interested in in what you and I would consider political views but more finding a reason to hate\nAnd more finding a reason to divide and that's really from a behavioral side that's the category that he said said\nHow confident are you that he worked alone\nI'm not confident at this point why I'm well because\nWhen I look at the way ... you've got twelve devices\nNone of that actually detonated so we don't know if they were able to do it or not\nBut they all arrived successfully and you know that takes a pretty significant amount of organization in order to do that without really messing up and he he did that well but yet the manner in which he constructed these devices was was floppy to say the least so\nI I truly believe and they truly believe once we finish with this with a search warrant the information comes from is computers et cetera that we're going to find that I truly believe that there there was somebody that was guiding him in this process\nDoes his ... what what you know of profiling and everything do you believe that the he will cooperate with authorities and want to tell his story\nProbably the best question I've been asked in the last thirty six hours and I'll tell you why because\nThat is going to be entirely contingent on the detective slash investigator that conducts the interview this guy is dying to tell us this was all him but he's going to have to be coached properly he's going to have to see it like it's ... his idea but\nCan tell you without any hesitation whatsoever almost forty years of doing this this is the type of individual that wants to pounce his chest and tell you how he did it\nSome acquaintances are saying that they are surprised that they never thought he would go to this talk politics talked issues you know maybe a little passionate back and forth but never to this accent what does that say to you\nI'm stunned because all you have to you and me as a whole world has seen the man's if there if you can look at the the the disdain that man has painted all over his ear and toward certain political figures and say that you were shocked that it came to this\nYou know I I think they need to keep both of those eyes open because uh I don't think anyone I think it's strange you're driving down the street quite right would look at someone driving that than and not be surprised that they would resort to something like this\nBut there's a difference between not being surprised and then thinking somebody that would drive a van like that would then go and do something like this directly\nI think you know when you see somebody that makes that overt statement I mean this one thing when if you and I were regular guys you know and if you know we get mad because this year was ... well you know what okay so we say a couple of things and then we get past it but when you\nAnd when it's you know we get mad because this year

then that's far beyond with that ... percent ... reasonable person would do in trying to project or communicate their views so\nI truly believe anyone that that had contact with him I'm sure as we are

Republicans will protect patients with\nPreexisting conditions um but you know the the the fact is Republicans voted for health care bill that would have reduced protections for pre existing conditions and Trump's own administration supports a lawsuit that would overturn the Affordable CARE Act and the Affordable CARE Act of course includes a provision that\nRequires insurance to provide healthcare coverage regardless of pre existing conditions\nYou know I one more topic I Want to get through before our time runs up\nThe issue of the economy there is no disputing that the economy is doing well unemployment numbers are very low a job opportunities are out there uh the economy continues to grow a and they're very very respectable rate though well north of three percent\n... where ... what do you find when the president talks about the economy\n[noise] uh well uh [laughter] he's playing from a position of strength or as you say or you know the economy's doing well uh but you know he can't help himself\nUh well he's playing from a position of strength as you say or\nYou know the economy's doing well uh but\nYou know he can't help himself he makes false and exaggerated claims about the economy to instead of sticking to the facts and that's what we looked at here for example\nA manufacturing up he claims that the economy's added six hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs the actual numbers under his leadership three hundred and Seventy eight thousand still a very respectable number of coal jobs he says they've been putting coal miners back to work like never before\nA there has been an increase in coal mining jobs a Nineteen hundred uh but that is not like never before there have been\nA periods are under ... three times under Bush where during a twenty month period that there had been much more than Nineteen hundred jobs are created total jobs he says that\nUh in less than two years of created over a four point two million new jobs total number of new jobs are actually three point eight so it's less than a four point to a million he says and also\nI'm under Obama and for the previous twenty months\nThat the economy added four point two million a job so\nUh what\nWhat's been going on under Trump when it comes to creating jobs is actually a little bit slower than the Obama economy from the previous twenty months\nEugene colleague joining us director of ... dot org how long have you been doing this that fact check\nI've been here ... years ...\nHow do you ... process in your mind why somebody would need to figure out a way of inflating numbers when they're good numbers just start with in the first place just actually say the numbers the way they really are instead of coming up with inflated numbers\nYou know I don't know I've never seen anything like this before or frankly are these numbers are good enough and you could just stick to the fact we do see from time to time we'll politicians do something like this and we all look at each other like you know why don't why don't you just stick to the fact [noise] um\nBut this president uh always does this or repeatedly does this and uh it it it's\nKind of I'm kind of something

an eighth street in New York the postal facility that one was addressed to the former director of national security James Clapper there was another device that was found in Florida Today that was

do know that they had the proper materials to make a bomb but were they functional where they put together properly or maybe intentionally not put together properly that's one of the big questions right now\nNow are we only talking about one fingerprints on one particular package and it was that fingerprint in a place that wouldn't have accidentally go on I just my touching the outside of the package\nThat we just don't know the the authorities are given has limited information but they told us during the news conference that what's\nTheir DNA matches this may have been hair or it may have been other DNA matches\nThat they were able to connect to other DNA testing that had been done on him and he has a relatively a lengthy criminal record things by fast broad apparently even threatening above a took place a bomb at one point\nOr other media outlets are reporting that he is ... ... was living in the van can you confirm then\nWe believe he was living in the in the van at this time but what makes it most interesting is the pictures the bumper stickers on this ban\nMay point to a political agenda that he had may point to his opposition to people that he was targeting with these packages there was a one little sign on his van said CNN sucks we know that a true of the packages were sent to\nPeople who work for CNN there was also a member of pictures are seem to be complementary pictures of\nPresident Trump and they're also was a picture of Hillary Clinton that may have had a target connected to it\nAnd that was he apprehended at the auto parts story it was he there as a customer or is it employee\nThat we don't know that we don't know no indication I have right now in some of my other colleagues may have more information than I have but no indication that I have that he was working at that oil parts store\nWas he living in the parking lot because I only ask is because I saw a picture of the front dash of the van that they hold away and considering how cluttered it was it just so hard to imagine the guy was driving around with a vehicle like then\nI you know I don't know I Will say this I'm going to do a little bit of self disclosure here when I've
