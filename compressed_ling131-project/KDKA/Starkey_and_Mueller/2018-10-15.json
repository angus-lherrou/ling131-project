eighty four percent of registered voters in competitive districts thinks the tone and civility of\nIs getting worse we saw a little bit of it what was it late last week the Wagner wolf campaign and a candidate for governor candidate or a Wagner you know the a Facebook post about starting over to almost phase where\nWe're Gulf spice everybody knew it was it was not meant it\n... it was and it was it was not a real he was making a a metaphor but it's that kind of talk that as people like Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska believing it's it's part of a larger problem named this book and that and because we act like politic\nI saw was the king of Saudi Arabia\nDenied any knowledge of what life was regarded as you said your abs citizen [noise]\nSo what are the chances we'll get to the bottom of what happened to the Saudi journalist joining me on the disc Institute a Pittsburgh news on CBS News foreign affairs analyst Pamela fog up Pamela what what do we know about what's happened today and do you think we'll get to the bottom of this\nWell it certainly sounds Joe like we're getting a lot closer or the President Trump said he spoke with the king you as you mentioned he said die might be rogue\nOr people in a way that were involved in it he said the king knew nothing about it and he dispatched secretary of state Mike Pompeo who is as we speak\nIn air in the air on edge his way to react to me with the king king sell them on that is now as this is breaking\nGuy and he's going and all of the twists and turns in this very dark mystery have taken place a there are sources telling several room news agencies including CBS is this\nYet we're talking about this happening inside the Saudi embassy so you've got to wonder how rogue these operatives would be\nYes exactly I mean it it does it solves one of the problems which was the fact that the Saudi Government was denying that they knew anything about it\nUm now is so much evidence including mainly by from turkey\nI Would whose government said they had ... audio and video and then there's something coming from the I watch\nThat show games self was wearing and I'm pictures of these Fifteen intelligence and medical agents who came into the consulate flew out on private jets least from them by the Saudi Government mine right back last night\nUm with the one with a stopover and that could show he was then gone and so I'm all of it does seem to point to the fact that\nThere is some relationship obviously to the Saudi Government would be very hard to believe\nThat the king and the crown prince who rule everything in Saudi Arabia ... didn't know that the whole operation was taking place\nMaybe that it had gone wrong or by telling it seems to be what President Trump was saying this morning and that that's what the game was telling him that it was a rogue operation there'll be\nSome penalties for anyone who is involved so I think it solves the one issue Joe but then I think there are still will be an interest by Congress by the un by everyone else has been calling for an investigation\nTo have forensics and everything else show who is involved and then track where the the orders came from\nUm and that way really know what what happened in who ordered\nA show that that may open a new can of worms which is what kind of penalties I mean if someone pleads guilty doesn't mean they're off the front um so what's next you know maybe under the Magnitsky Act which of course\nIs a change I mean before\nThe Magnitsky Act and first centuries or diplomats world leaders you know kings potent tastes they all are would get away with murder and literally\nAh because of sovereign immunity and there's this famous case in the Nineteen nineties Joe that I I find really fascinating today um where there's engineered turn whistle blower working American who got a job working in the king ... hospital in in Riyadh\nA was tortured and he came back and they brought the case all the way up to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court said no the Saudis did torture you so um there's nothing they can do because of sovereign immunity\nSo those days are gone yeah and we do know that the Saudis have that you know tortured Americans so now the question is what do you do so that there's this doesn't keep happening\nIt puts the CBS News or foreign affairs analyst Pamela ... is running is certainly puts the children in a strange in a tough spots the ... the relations between the king and and and President Trump have been\nA ... you know relatively close the Saudis have been our ... among our best friends are in the in the middle east we have this well pending arms sale jets to do the Saudis odd\nThough I mean that's a hundred and ten million is basically promissory notes over the next ten years they're the biggest purchase server American arms\nI heard the president say well if they don't buy it for months they're going to buy in from somebody else so it\nIt is it does beg the question other than tough talk which perhaps ... mean that much perhaps there's not that much of the United states can do\nWell there are a lot of different things United States could do without stopping all the arms and and sending a message\nTo the Saudis and that's and travel bans for some of the leaders ... acid freezes on some sanctions but not\nTotally closing down of the\nHum of all in from of all sales or purchases of oil I mean there's there are things in between without saying\nWe're just a week we either have to do business with someone we know just killed a Virginia resident in Washington Post reporter yeah because he's a reporter and doing that and and closing down so there's there's something in between those two things\nAnd um I think you're hearing from GOP senators and from the business community from\nA virgin Atlantic from over from all of them I mean I did J.

childrens\nFund in Allegheny county a fund that would bolster after school programs and a nutritious meals for kids and other uh programs are aimed at younger children joining me on the disc Institute of Pittsburgh news line is Patrick doubt\nPatrick is executive director of allies for children one of the organizations that is pushing for the fun Patrick thanks for joining us on Katie gay\nHey Joe thanks for having me I really appreciate it\nAs I've I've read some of the concern a about the funding\nIf I had to generalize I suppose it would be one no one wants no one is saying the kids don't need more money programs for young children but there seems to be concerned that you're asking us to pay for a fund\nOr without really knowing all the details of of how the money's going to be spent ... ... ... what do you say about that\nSo first of all we're talking about creating what we're asking voters to do is to create if they choose the Allegheny county children's on so we found that would be dedicated to providing financial support for free program areas and only three program areas across Allegheny county\nSo early childhood learning of smart investment for our kids and a really smart investment for communities in the future um after school programs again another smart investment for kids in her community and meals particularly inside of those settings but\nThey will be an officer will be set up to county government\nYeah so the fund will be created through the Allegheny county government that we currently have there are about thirty funds around the county\nOr sorry country that have created these kinds of things um and typically they run through county government uh they create a small office to create visibility into reduced overhead we're talking about the industry to overhead about three to five percent\nSo it smart to have it in a segregated off as the county budget as one point five billion dollars gets would generate approximately Eighteen million dollars which keeps visibility on those dollars are and makes it very clear to to the public because we'll have an annual report out\nHow to the money how has the money distributed and what were the results for kids and ultimately for our community so we think it's really smart to have a small segregated a fund in office\nThe or the great public schools a coalition put out a statement late last week that said existing up programs for that they're trying to accomplish the same kinds of things haven't been fully funded a lie start a new program where we don't have the money to the to run the ones that we as\nWell so the money that we spend all the money that we spend with some exposure exceptions on after school programs here in Allegheny county come from state and federal sources\nAnd by creating a fund or we are eight and ... B program all areas and only these areas\nWere able to think about strategic investments across the county so ... ... that's from Pittsburgh public schools and sure they have they have resources and need but there are a lot more and and we we believe they're still need obviously in the city\nBut there are there are kids that live all around this county that have meeting we want to make sure that we're thinking about how to be strategic and county wide in our work on these critical programs which again\nAre really designed to to support and enhanced the work that is done\nYou know in the case of twelve cycle and ask the before the the school that's out\nThere doubt is executive director of allies for children one of the organization that supports the idea of this childrens fund in Allegheny county are funded by a quarter mil a increase in the property tax Patrick voted\nBy the way to do that so that is equivalent to twenty five dollars on a hundred thousand of assessed value just or so people can sort of measure that as you're thinking about it\nIs I'm a soldier has more to say yes what would happen next\nThere would be a year or so it may be fourteen months of public process as we lay out the details and we designed so that there will be strong public input over the course of that year or so\nFor implementation the dollars would then be first distributed based on a a plan that's laid out of course and very public process over that year beginning in twenty twenty January first twenty twenty\nAnd and who would do that uh who would who would kind of organized that\nSort of the county government so they would again they would quickly establish a small office typically think about three maybe four people at the most um we proposing advisory committee that would sort of support that works\nA committee of citizen some experts some parents community folks that could really help design with that with again public input from around the county or and then that would all get started and and it's beginning execution so to speak and full implementation of January first twenty\nTwenty and that sort of you looked around the country to see how some of these other funds operate and what and how how they were able to benefit their communities may be that we were in such a way that we don't have here\nSo first of all most importantly we've spent a long time looking at it and understanding those different funds and we tried to bring back to Pittsburgh Allegheny county the the the best ideas that we can find them\nUm we feed that when we implement this with full public profits as a fully public entity I'm you gather public engagement and really it tends to enhance the the quality of the work we see that in some of these communities that are able to boost their um the the the the the way that they are\nThe the the the way that their kids are prepared so that by the time they get the third grade they're seen more kids are able to read on grade level which are the great predictor for things like high school graduation successfully in school but then life we've seen that in the after school programs that support after school programs a lot of great worked for kids\nFueling their passion or things like creativity and future career but it's also\nI'm really great at keeping kids safe all those the after school hours and then of course for the meals this this we're finding all around the country that there's there's real neat if he does it relates to food we all have hunger gaps are meals gaps what we're trying to close in on this would\nBe one additional way for us here in Allegheny county to do some of that work in connection with all the great people that are already doing that worked its way to the extent that you can make these\nPrograms supportive and ... and ... already there that's really when you get the best and that's why we think public office for over a year after the public or if they were to do yet I'm there will be the best way to go about this\nProject out allies for children the question on the November sixth ballot in Allegheny county Patrick thanks for your information Bridget\nThanks very
