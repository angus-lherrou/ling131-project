Love the low some disease one and then ... and attacking women's virginity I mean how speak chat\nKiller is that huh OK Dennis hello Dennis\n[laughter] [noise] [noise]\nNow that you're up welcome to handle on law hello\nI'm Sorry Dave I Apologize oh that you and that's my fault hello down to a\nGood morning ...\nI have a a a file a personal bankruptcy which will be discharged are completely next September in the meantime I'm In the middle of a cash out refinance on my personal resident [noise]\nUh it's almost at the end and so we're on a timeline a title search revealed that there is a second mortgage owed by a large bank or the title company will not fund the refile left that second this paid off outside of the re fi\nAh contacted the bank they said there was twenty five thousand note but they would settle for ten I don't know anything about this loan I've never paid on it I asked him to send me the records of the contract they said the records don't go back that far\nHow do they know you all the money\nThat was my question to them but it showed up on the credit report\nAnd would that would be an era that could be an error\nI I understand that but they won't they won't provide any per okay alone in the meantime the the brief I as being\nYeah up yeah All right so I I think at this point I Would I Would do is get a lawyer\nLetter over to them and if it turns out that they don't have any proof that you all the money is just hey you all was the money I Am because there was a letter or someplace there's some indication we have no backup what you're doing is a illegally interfering with my ability to get re fi\nAh and ah there's some there's some liability there\nBut understand that in the meantime the the locked in rates are going to\nCome here there's no question now rates are are are exploding oh there is no issue about it at all so I you want to work with your lender although the lender is going to do everything now that interest rates are so high would love to get you out of a locked in rage or maybe a they still want your business who the hell knows at this point\nAnd that because I don't know the anticipated the rates going up as quickly as they have been going on in the last few weeks and\nSo you work with them but this is where I I think you have to threaten or the banks saying you're holding up\nI'm going to last a few weeks and\nSo you work with them but this is where I I think you have to threaten on the banks saying you're holding up uh my rate which is locked in interest rates are now higher there is some damages there\nAnd do you just you can't do that without proof but we don't have the records well then how do I do yoga money will cause you do I do not so that's\nWhy a letter from a lawyer and making a couple of demands would help\nIt would there be any advantage to waiting until the next September when the bankruptcy discharges to get a just a standard uh uh a conventional\nEarly on that well it's put your interest rates ... what are the two points higher yeah\nOr you have to you don't want to wave your rights on this one Gulf War I get the letter a and Neal the bank if you can while right I've ever heard of that happening and and do just\nThat we're always money [noise]\nThe bank [noise] maybe there's a letter there [noise]\n... uh\nUh but they said the CDC in ours um rent from having a window because it's a zero outlying [noise] so but I went to the board meeting and it got very very nasty personal uh with the way I can go back [laughter] um so that's where I Am [laughter]\nAll right and what are they are they finding you now or is it just is screaming at you\nKnow to find me a hundred dollars a month or ... or be caused by Seventy five and they expect you to take the window out I'm assuming they're demanding I take the window out or else they would keep finding\nAlright has anybody else in the building or put windows in in those locations\n[noise] not that you know\nAll right so this is new well I it's\nThey have the right to say no or are they have the right to say if you put one in a that in violation of the CBC in ours or they can say ...\nAnd you take it out until you are and and then here's your fine and uh we're going to keep on charging however they made it untenable for you to on the other side is that you wanted to put it in and they they made it impossible for you to even\nUh even make an application and there it is and they're ... by the way there's the court case\nOkay uh you have to buy a ... when I Would do is have a conversation with the attorney that represents the board and every every board of directors a H every age away has an attorney who represents a that represents them and have a conversation and say hey you know the board made it impossible the management company wouldn't call me back\nWhat am I supposed to do well what you're supposed to do is just keep on trying and trying and trying and at some point I'll tell you legally what should happen even though it's the biggest pain in the ass you go to the point where they make an untenable and then you get a court order allowing you to do that because they made it untenable but that's\nWay down the line so you kind of early on now it's a question of\nA what a pain in the asked the board is they're going to say hey we set up a time or are we set up a date you could've called us and found out it was eight o'clock or eight o'clock I Am or P. M. and you're gonna say I tried yeah you never responded here's my phone call the management company and what you guys do where ... year playing chicken with each other\nSo it's a it's a problem\nAny attorney for the board or sitting right next to me at a board meeting or one of the boredom is turning around ... ... ... to the window of Ford put a solar bottles and this man ... said kicked the window out while a trip to model\nOkay that incidentally uh if anybody else will\nUh will state that who was in the room now he doesn't have a right to do that by the way that's not a legal decision okay that's that's a board decision by that adds to your argument that says decent argument really is a tough one God has problems today that I don't so that works out hello Dennis Hi Dennis\nI I'd want to know what they're up for me to try to break a lead a we were renting properties are flooded four times\nThere's carpet in the bedroom that we've uh we've had over ... and go on to dry them out or we're going into the water and the wall also ah the water coming up from the flab\nHi how are you okay you just want out right have you on that they know that have they tried to fix it\nWhat they're doing is they're working on the ... very well aware that hit the outside All right we're all\nIt you wouldn't you want out and you want out correct yes All right well base\nWhat they're doing the work it on there are very well aware that you're outside\nAll right we're all for it you wouldn't you want\nAnd you want out correct yeah All right well based on the fact that it's untenable to live there is basically uninhabitable you say hey I'm Out of here and I don't even know if you need notice you just say it I just can't live here anymore because of what's going on thank you I'm done and then what I Would do is give this much noticed as possible\nOr a and they're going to withhold a security deposit probably depending on the management company or they're going to demand some kind of a rent till the end of the least uh I'm assuming a your do you have a lease\nThrough may\nOkay uh so All right so you've got a good long time so you let them know what you're going to do and uh they unless they're willing to repair inside right now\nAnd unless there are and if they're saying but we have to do it from the outside in a then you can withhold rent whether you can leave or not ...

T. session and um he seemed to be okay and\nThat I'm a big company the insurance company from the other party said hey look we'll pay for your medical costs and we'll throw in a a five hundred dollar bond for pain and suffering mound pointed out my son is having recurring nightmares and he's going to college out of state so the insurance company wants to settle I'm trying to figure out all you know do I take 'em to small claims\nNo no no you don't take into small claims court ah your ah first of all your son's\nCase obviously you're still open because you haven't signed or accepted money on behalf of your son 'cause you have to guard emit light I'm and I'm assuming you did none of that\nCorrect that's correct or he is he is more of an Eighteen okay and so they can't is not settled against him that's correct All right yes a recurring nightmares is no small thing if a if it's going to be chronic and if you've been connected\nTo that accident so your problem is or your challenge not your problem is connecting his nightmares\nTo the accident and that you and they were going to have to deal with the shrink uh\nAll right there's no way that you can say well in my opinion well where did you go to a psychology school where's your memory how the hell damage therapy have you done\nSo it's a question of going to shrink and there could be some sustain a substantial money uh involved\nThere I mean we had very similar case or with my children are when are we sent them and it wasn't in a car accident but we sent them to a psychologist for certain problems they had and it turned out their entire psychological problems was due to the fact they're my kids\nAre and ah you know [laughter] there's not much we can do about that but connecting the two is the challenge then\nThen you start talking it's going to be a lot more than small claims to my friend oh really okay yeah yeah it's a personal injury case I Begin to tell you you you got to back up the the connection\nDo you think should hook up with a personal injury\nOr anything I Would yeah okay I certainly starting to yeah I certainly started all ah for sure\nBetty Hi Maddie [noise]\n[noise] yes I have a large pine tree is hanging over in my yard and the house next door with a ... I don't know who owns it but there's several people living in it because of the four or five cars I see out front\nOkay well there are probably around when we squatters and her\nWay I can yeah I'm tacked or get a hold of somebody yeah Betty how old are you\n\n... pardon how old are you ready anyone or you've really yes God you don't sound to me over Ninety Oh thank you all\nNow very yes and so you want to do this certainly quickly before you die I understand that [laughter] All right so bad that right yeah well\nGood for you read sense of humor aren't so\nThat is fairly quickly before you die I understand that All right so bad that right yeah well good for you reaches humor aren't so bad he uh the trick is finding out who owns the property and that you can just full title and it could be the bank or someone owns that property it with ...\nUnderstand so therefore the cat's it which is exactly what you want the bank to own it because then you contact or the bank\nAnd say hey clean this up get rid of a though that hanging though those hanging branches now when I Would do is you've got to do it anyway at some point and a is there a danger your property I mean is there a wall that so being affected as a\nFence fence between the two ... or ... I understand I've been here for years and I understand it's a common than\nAll right well I ... doesn't matter even if it's common fans that they're responsible for any uh trees branches hanging over your property so here's what I Would do I get a bed\nAnd find out how much is going to cost if it were me I'd do it myself I pay for it and then turn around and do those people but doesn't that necessarily have to be that way I could simply finding out who owns it and you and use it pulled title on that that's easy ah that's just a ... Internet search cause he's raw public documents\nAnd then you contact the owner now\nYou hope it's the bank because if it's still in the name of the previous owner\n... they're going to tell you the go pounds than they don't care I mean they're losing everything anyway I mean the worse that happens if you get a judgment against them for let's say three hundred dollars okay just get in line because we've lost our house when you think our credit is like already\n[noise] their their distaste and their son took off\nThen you have to find out who owns a property 'cause that's where you going to go or you just pay for it and just suck it up I mean the people that are squatting next door or they don't have any responsibility or how bad is your problem with this\n[noise] well it it to the point I haven't done I hadn't said anything to anybody 'cause I don't see anybody coming in and out but it it is a hanging over at least half\nIraqi are it's a lot how much do you think it's going to cost to clean up\nWell I think it's quite large and the pie and those are about ten inches wrong\nAll yeah All right so you got an issue I so I get a bad and I don't know how well how you doing for money are you living tape for oh good All right because then the next question was going to be I like are you living in a dumpster and is it nice and clean and\nSo that's not the case I Would just pay for it and just have it done and then find out who owns a property and just send the bill\nOh okay that's and then uh it's right in the same small claims court as I said if the bank owns that don't clean it up because that's just what they do I mean they're\nTrying to sell the house and they don't want any liability and ah [noise] they're they're pretty good about that especially if you're talking small phase two hundred dollars [noise] this is handle on the law\nI'm I'm I've written one book and I'm writing another one and and the first book we held off on publication because we were worried about we describe a couple of experiences in hotels and it was all positive\nNothing negative or we were wondering if those hotels would do try and do anything to us legally because we talk about them and we give their name to the hotel\nOh no matter of fact even if there were a negative and you give me your name too though you give the hotel name out of the what you can't do is make stuff up in a negative way that's defamation or a or you can tell him\nWhat go ahead no no go ahead yourself\nAlright so uh let's say a year accusing uh the hotel and having bedbugs in your story in the name of the hotel uh you know I don't want to name any names but the Hilton Marian Wright Wyndham which is going through the names incidentally what was the name of the hotel\nA combat want to say that on the air bill\nWhy they don't know who you are\nAh well actually truthfully I'm I'm not sure if I can remember after hearing of a it's been it's been a few years\nYeah okay fair enough by the way they're ... they couldn't go after you because uh there is a uh uh just to let you know you've heard of the attorney client privilege\nThere is a there is a hotel talk show privilege that's recognized under the law so they could not happening what laws that one thing that you know by the way you can't remember which hotel I don't have it here in front of me uh when I'm sure it's there no the point is is that let's say there was a horrible experience and you're a disparaging the hotel\nIf it's true or you know what there is\nDefense there is no such thing as defamation to the truth is an absolute defense by the way they're not going to go after you if you say OK their bed bugs in the ...\nAh you know what there is no defense there is no such thing as defamation to the truth is an absolute defense by the way they're not going to go after you if you say OK their bed bugs and the people were horrible and if you're talking about a non disparaging remark if you're talking about something that's positive that happens\nOr not only is there are no disparage may not only is there in the lawsuit for defamation 'cause it's not defamation or they're getting a commercial\nYeah that was kind of my take out your way out what what kind of book to write\nWell the first book with the travel experience a that was done and sort of a novelist ...\nLike in in real time you know strangely enough I probably didn't read it how do they do\nWell we didn't do because we we put it on hold\nOkay has we were worried about language I understand there are no wonder you don't hire a okay you're very lawyer understand don't you don't have\nTo worry about that because uh the fact that it hasn't been published yet there's not going to be a whole lot of difference when you publish it I uh-huh terms of sales okay what's your next book that you're working on okay\nThe the second one uh this is a book about a um a period of time in my life I guess you could call it a memoir or that takes place in Mexico uh-huh\nAnd part of it involves they very well known cancer clinic and Mexico okay\nAnd there was an extremely negative scenario involved with this with the very famous cancer clinic and what I did and the second book is I changed the name of the hospital and all the doctors and and uh ... made it as unrecognized\nOr they could then you're fine to do there's okay there's a little detail they're getting long and hard to Mexico\nWhere it is it's the only cancer clinic and it's very well know\nAlright so big deal in the meantime here is ... I'm going to give you a reality check okay let's say there's the information right ah and ah there's it didn't happen there's legitimate you're giving a you're issuing fascinating facts that\nAre are not true so now you they have a case to things have to happen number one uh people have to give a rat's about what happened to you and they don't\nWrite so uh I I wouldn't worry 'cause all three people going to read the book\nUh it really doesn't matter a number two they're going to be three people going to read the book\nOr they're never going to hear about it and if they do they're not suing you so don't worry about it enjoy yourself defame them I just have a time of your life couple of rules make sure it's um that you don't make up the facts and number two is as often as possible\nUh making your opinion\nOkay for example a it is my opinion that when they operate on me uh they took out my diaphragm but that shot my opinion\nI really don't know if they don't believe you can have a diaphragm well there you are okay thanks for the call is handle on the law\n[noise]\n\n\nThe sevens annual full flooring yard sales going on now with incredible deals lumber liquidators we've got hundreds of floors on sale up to fifty percent off in stock and ready to go see big on waterproof floors all on sale from just thirty nine cents skin will look limited flooring all on sale up to forty percent off\nFree finished hardwood and bamboo starting at Ninety nine cents plus special financing stop all your local lumber liquidators store or visit lumber liquidators dot com today\nIs nothing small and now your book [noise] your passion your hours your reputation on\nVisit lumber liquidators dot com today\nThere's nothing small about your business your passion your hours your reputation all huge their partnership even bigger\nWith Dell small business technology advisors you'll get the tax advice and one on one partnership to help your business ground because with a reliable doubt PCs with endemic or processors you can focus on what matters most to getting business down\nA seventh heaven by down to speak with an advisor today that eight seven seven by down\nAre you putting your retirement savings in a four O. one K.

or ... series the executive director for pin\nHaitian rights network and former chair of the local task force or the right to education for Pittsburgh public schools are welcome you all to the program I why yeah All right you're here to talk about this ballot initiative that's been put on the ballot or and according to the literature\nThat the people who supported us say it that it it says something pretty simple shell the Allegheny county home rule charter be amended to establish the Allegheny county\nChildren's fun funded by Allegheny county living and collecting an additional\nA point at twenty five mills the equivalent of twenty five\nDollars is at twenty five dollars on each one hundred thousand dollars of assessed value on all taxable real estate beginning January first one day Nineteen and they're after\nTo be used to improve the well being of children through the provision of services throughout the county including early childhood learning after school programs and nutritious meals well on the face of it ... it sounds like it's going to benefit the kids would you say is more to it and that\nAbout who's going to\nPart of the reason pin took the position that it took is because in public policy you don't go out and say let's raised the funds and then we'll decide how we use them as we as we go alone that's just bad public policy all around it sounds like putting the cart before the court in the cart before the horse exactly ... and as I've said before we're we're not against\nProviding a early childhood services to children are providing there were nutritious meals or\nAfter school programming but you know that the root of the problem is still there whether you have Eighteen million dollars or not and that's what we're saying you can't raise Eighteen million dollars and then try to figure out how you're going to spend it that that's just bad public policy\nWho's supposed to administer this or is it into an office of the county executive and what is the county executive saying what is the mayor say\nShow up according to the literature or you know there's going to be a new department created with this initiative\nJust what we need a new dog very good at right over here that falls under the caddy black males go into the overhead of that does not many people will the department there\nThough that's not decided that will be decided later and I've heard people say it's going to be anywhere between three to five percent of the overall budget will go to the administrative costs but again it hasn't been decided there's no cap on that number do now\nSo that sounds like a poor planning according knew All right\nWell that's absolutely poor planning you know it's it's a ... ... this whole idea of not knowing if it's going to go to public or private entities means they could add private entities into the mix was means you not increasing upon your dividing the pie and a smaller pieces and so it was definitely is not going to help children that really needed most\nUm so what is the county executive what is the mayor say about this ... of the voice support for did any way shape or form\nLast we heard that the mayor is supportive of this um and the county executive I think we heard like a Democrat to raise taxes right [laughter]\nI'm Sorry well you know I I honestly don't know what the mayor self interest is in this um if if you were asked me to May of last year I probably would have had a whole lot to say but at this moment I Know [laughter]\nOr or or inside yoga or or\nWhat is the county executive say this is going to be on the is for you right\nHe's saying that he doesn't want to raise taxes taxes but he likes the idea so you know how those to reconcile have no idea\nI'm well how did they get this on the ballot they must have had to circulate petitions and that sort of thing and people had to sign it right there\nYeah I was approached um well first of all yeah they did get a lot of petition signatures um I was approached by for different people um my first one the gentleman said would you like to sign a petition I said well I'm not really sure I'm interested in this initiative and he said wait you don't like kids\nAnd that's the kind of feeling that I get I Do know quite a few people I'm I'm at a committee person and the fourteenth ward and in our fourteen Ford meeting somebody to get up and speak and say that she did sign a petition but after she did some research she's not for it now\nOr so it's on the ballot and we are going to vote for it or how am I mentioned in the open how much we're going to talk about but I I was just going to affect people in the county uh in terms of their taxes\nWell you know you hear there throughout this number that it's only about thirty dollars on the first hundred thousand dollars of a set of value but here's the other thing to\nThe county assessments have been frozen because of the imbalance in some of the neighborhoods like Lawrenceville the how home values have shot up significantly and so the people in that neighborhood have called for a\nIn balance in somebody neighborhoods like Lawrenceville the how home values have shot up\nSignificantly and so the people in that neighborhood have called for\nA freeze on assessments and so once the assessments kick in again are that's going to drastically affect people who own homes are going to see a spike in their housing values but the other thing too is\nA lot of folks whose children would benefit from this morning likely are renters you look at people who worked for you can see in other places that are making less than Fifteen dollars an hour working two or three jobs\nUm and they're probably renters don't think the landlords are going to pass a tax on to them it's going to cause and rent to go up and the other pieces not mentioned here too is ratepayers in this county are going to still have to figure out what's going to happen with the al ... component of what's going to happen with the ws say when you know when they try to figure out how to pay for the loans that they've taken out so this ...\nCitizens in their county and in the city are going to be hit with other fees eventually before this even to this before having to consider this tax the impact on this tax\n... are are you afraid that that money would be transferred to pay for other a county expenses\nNo this can't this does create a special find um you know it's a five percent increase in the county tax that goes into a special fund\nAnd the county council can't change that so it has to stay there so I ... something that I thought was really interesting was in a county council who does not like to raise taxes if they say we don't want to raise the tax we don't want the military as they could vote to reduce the tax if they do that\nThese point twenty five males have to stay in that finding the childrens fund which would mean the general fund would go down by that same amount\nOr have you have your poll look county a council to see how they feel about it\nSo my county council man is our talkline and he actually came to that fourteenth board meeting and basically said county council does not know much about this this was a referendum that goes around Kenny count though\nIs that part of the problem there has not been much public information disseminated about this and that's one of the things you own object to\nOur our mode of operation is community engagement is what we do we're our faith based organization that believes in hitting the ground and reaching people are working with people\nUm and so we're talking about putting the cart before the horrors that commute engagement pieces what they're looking to do after the fact rather they should have done it over the last two years while they were in a think tank trying to figure out how to raise how to put this legislation in place\nAll right I'm number here is eight six six three nine one ten twenty talk or

a question or a month or so ago my concern and Chris I'm not afraid to pull out my deck of cards here and play the race card year\nAre you know this thing was is the spearheaded by Patrick ... out with a former board member\nAnd the other organizations I Know very little about them but it's not what you say it's what you do and I've heard for years on the school board with Patrick go and he just\nIt's not what you say it's what you do and I've heard for years when the school board with parents you know\nAnd he has been a thorn in the side of former superintendent John Thompson when he was when he attempted to do some of these things that they said that this children fun I'm supposed to do\nAnd so I really find it ironic now that he wants to be an advocate of poor children and when you look on their website is the pictures of black children of course those poor black children and that's always always pulls on cards during the individual to make them guilty to you know to do what they\nThink they should do and so that always concerns me when\nI see him ... turning around and now I'm saying he's he's he's for helping people these for helping the cage and he has not secondly to the listeners when you go on the ballot\nWhen you're going to vote the printers very small the title is misleading because it doesn't have children under the title of course there's an amendment to the to the home of charter or the other thing that it is worth noting this filing from\nElected officials now they will mumbled there and she called a couple of months ago and the mayor and the paper

on\nYou are serious about keeping this region can competitive each county count any each county body can simply passing as you mentioned we're loud and supporting any charging that you know you can cast in resolution make the public and released a public statement against it\nThe the folks from circulating mission uh they had the right to do it anybody can circuit to shouldn't get the necessary amount those\nSignatures and then of course it goes to the\nMarket has more to give you make your final point\nOkay and and I just wanted to say the most important thing is that folks got to come out you got to vote no for and you have to continue to talk about\nChina on that note will continue to talk about it but in the remaining segments of our program\nHere venting thank you for great experience and for your support the military and veterans' thank you so much that tech family's gone through a lot the last few years and this gave us a nice break\nEvery empty seat at a concert game or a special event because a missed opportunity to say thank you to a veteran\nIt does um I also wanted to just mentioned the fact that and I think I'm somebody mentioned this earlier that a lot of the coffee um discussion is that they've had have been in communities that are probably not going to be served by this and I think that also speaks to what I'm Pam is getting at the fact that\nHave to we have to make sure that we're building in protections for the communities that are being served by the ... from the start or else we're going to have to run to catch up later I'm to retrofit it to make sure that we're actually serving the people who are supposed to be served by this and to to begin with\nOr going to ... go to Judy in court Julie in Carnegie Julie you're on to the gate\nYes Hi um I'm In the early childhood field and have been too for over forty years as a manager as a teacher I'm I have been out to support the campaign\nI too had the same kind of questions in doubt so the fact that that that there isn't a details\nSet out yeah it does make me nervous as well well what did you support to frame is Julie\nWell because I Know that there needs to be consistent funding streams for early childhood childcare early learning\nAll the bug and after school for two for that matter I'm not versed in the field or the nutrition\nSo\nBy listening and looking at what is available to our um I'm comfortable with that there's going to be enough discussion about how it's going to be disseminated I'm comfortable in that there's going to be a little administrative costs\nAnd I am\nAbout how it's going to be disseminated uncomfortable and that there's going to be alone in the state of cost\nAnd I am so fat Akeley committed to finding it ... or early childhood so I Wonder you know I I understand what what your guest there are a fan\nAnd I wonder what alternatives they have\nTo make a a a a source of infighting level\nAll right let's see if they're going to answer and anybody want to handle that\nSo you know a couple of things that that I've heard here um again bad public policy when you say we're going to create a source of revenue in funding and then figure out what will will do with it and the other thing about marginalized communities in this process or\nFor those you don't know I'm black and for most of my adult life and even into my childhood I Know a thing or two about entities\nComing into the community just a few weeks before election time to have conversations about things that are intended to benefit us that we never see the light of day\nAnd while I ... I Can't say that it is a hundred percent the case here but the remnants of that are in full motion because when an entity says that it is or has been working on an initiative for over a year\nAnd just two and a half weeks before the election they're only starting to get into those communities that have the conversations about what this proposed\nA tax increase is going to do with those communities that should\nSet set in on your heart's in your mind and let you know that\nThere's just something here that's not right to lack of information and plus the history of these promises causes you to be distressed exactly are Julie a quick response and we have to let you go\nWell I I I hear that I get that um I if it passes I Hope people will be at the table\nA ... I I\nI get it needs to go to the children that made it\nI Will say this cave black and white and fill out the county um there's pocket in almost every township that we have\nWhere there's kids that they should be able to serve I Know the struggles of childcare at ... and the struggle of that field and I guess I just wondered fast poured it and I just wanted to get a call in and and I can imagine\nAll right thank you appreciate it All right if you want it to the table when they put it together is there any guarantee that you're going to be at the table fan when they were all Reverend well ...\nYeah there's there's there's no guarantee that that's going to happen and given the amount of time they said they'd been thinking about this\nThere's plenty of time they could have had town hall meetings over the last year ... two years ago would have made partition signing a whole lot easier a little less nefarious uh and and there have been a lot more trust in this process but the but to try to do this engagement now two weeks before the election is ludicrous\nRight our guests are are Jamal Craig who is executive director for pin the Pennsylvania interface impact network\nA we also have Pam heart in here who is co founder of the education rights network and river John Wells who is chair of the board of the Galileo a network\nThey are against this proposal that would raise your taxes in order to pay for programs that would help children in public schools throughout the county or number here's eight six six three nine and won ten twenty talk or text you can write us at the dollar banking and access center\nSchools throughout the county or number here's eight six six three non won a didn't want to talk or text you can write us at the dollar bank and some access center at Katy K radio dot com we'll take your phone calls throughout the rest of the hour once we return from bees commercial message\nNow you can see it on the radio every jar top SARS SARS is people making news radio during the bird that was released on the earth day experience our state of the facility is really hard [laughter] it's great\nSweetie once I'm sure you have to use so writes for the job of how Israel is the wrong soul to slice for just like an antibiotic is the wrong tool to treat viruses including closing flu antibiotics only needed for certain bacterial infection\nWhen they aren't needed antibiotics won't help you and the side effects could still hurt you ask your health care professional and an antibiotic is the right tools and when it's not visit C.
