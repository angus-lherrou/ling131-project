you doing good man for sugar do okay I just bought ... crossed my head\nIs um she's from South Carolina yep Lindsey Graham's from South Carolina and he's on the move\nWell yeah I'm thinking after the midterms he fires Jeff Sessions as the OJ moves Lindsey Graham in it she runs in a special election to take his Senate seat\nIt wouldn't it wouldn't shock I mean I I could see that scenario I mean\nThe reality is that uh we raise that as a possibility earlier I'm Glad you are chimed in 'em and I I Will just say this the the one thing that's important is a lot of people analyzed\nIt's what Lindsey Graham did the last month as audition for exactly what you just described\nWhile I'm ... I can see it and you know he's he's very this place with a Jeff Sessions so no yeah ... you know what what what crossed my mind when I heard about her resigned today\nLet me ask you when I when I what crosses your mind when I ask you this question do you think that Hillary is completely Don\nNo [laughter] not I grew up I was shaking would be but I don't think so up\nTelling you I'm telling you I I liked uh I'll just sort of dropped that in every once in a while or let's go up here and I think we're talking about the chick fillet is that correct\nYes that's correct\nNow welcome to the show what's on your mind sir hey\nListen a couple of things that I just wanted to uh just kinda respectfully put it out there that often time when you're discussing concerning you know the gay movement they often line it up or compared to being African Americans and and you kind of suggests that bad\nAnd I just wanted to just add to the conversation or there's no comparison at all to African Americans versus\nA little bit of a movement and it's often used because it suggests it OK black people have been discriminated against and so a week and they're just too far they're staying or or get too far apart\nBut what I wanted to say is\nWhat rights do business owners have for as long as you have this kind of strong alarming of from an organization to force them to move out you hit it on my head when you said the sponsors hope drop out of the sky\nYou know on chairs or nurture their uh their wind and dying they're talked to their work on their targeted before a signed over and so it just doesn't happen or that that that easily\nAnd isn't it starting to get a little bit embarrassing\nWhen does the Gary movement\nAlways wants to Glenn hurt someone or did you expect someone because you don't embrace\nTheir lifestyle it's a movement\nThat exotic control now and it's such a terrible thing because I think there's this marathon thing as the national you get all kinds of people I mean you get a chance to profile\nWith city and for our mayor to come out and to start to suggest that it's a little disappointing it should be disappointing to those who are in bed with because anytime you have to bring in your business a lineup for your profile that this movement doesn't agree with\nThey are in position to hurt your candidate than if you can and I mean if you haven't noticed do they have the financial wherewithal they have the power they have the support of the media and they can hurt you like\nBaker their national king and that I just think it's wrong\nListen a couple of things I'd like you know hopefully called back particularly well in anything I'm a I have a historically ... looked at the uh\nThe black civil rights space as being its own space uh and and and yet there are a parallels a from a legal standpoint that that are least worthy of a conversation if it comes up again or for that matter on anything would you please give me a call\nA A R surely will make you hear one second to mention one other interesting thing you know there is a little disgusted in the black community some of us look at some of this stuff and the little stuff that go on that\nStuff that go on that goes on among us way up and say we were if this was a group of people and their oil and had the power to do that they would refer to as gangster okay\nOkay I got a live with their I understand what you're talking about\nI'm going to run I'm late I gotta get Scott [noise]\nOnly traffic on the fires power vows are nice on route fifty on south on top of the hill dealing with the

much a Nikki Haley's got to decide whether or not she's going to exile the people of a of the world not only of South Carolina too you know to a sweatshop status\nBut uh that she would also be working for a guy like Trump who claims that he doesn't believe the global warming exists\nWell you tie together you tied together some things out of work at 'em and let me let me just ask you this is a major issue is going to be if you ever go down the road with Nikki Haley is going to be how much was she a mouthpiece during the ministry doing their job and how much he actually uh uh uh embraces personally\nOh I Would say pretty much a mouthpiece then she\nSaid some extremely nasty trying to think what you said about a month ago that was so bizarre that it\nCouldn't be believe [noise] but um you know they're they see a ... do you keep up with a there's for probably forty years there's been an organization called project censored\nIt lifts the top ten censored stories of the year now start\nUh look for the twenty Seventeen a project censored and you'll find the number five story has to do with that refugee status\nOkay thanks I Pretend to tip a real quick you think you're ever going to you think Hillary is completely Don\n[noise] well I'm a Green Party member so you know she's never really impressed me\nNone of that I'm just asking you whether she do you think he is totally extinguished every conceivable Jean and her body cell in our body to the idea is so never run for president\nUm I I I don't want to get sidetracked you know from the issues of the day Trump is\nTo the day Trump is is basically a coordinated evil and you're asking me whether or not somebody like a Hillary is going to she said a hundred opportunities to improve our lives and she hasn't done it yet\nAnd I got it are are good enough it was really simple [laughter] I appreciate your call David it was ... I I'm I'm sitting on the set last night was Jim burn about grammar and came up out of my mouth I said you know what she's not done\nAnd\nI didn't hear a whole lot of well I'll just leave it at that\nIt's just an idea of just asking if I'm the only person to have that thought about whether you agree with her and all\nThat come over here old on All right\nLet's go over to a joint appoint breeze on chick fillet what's on your mind Joanne\nI and as far as that lady with her and I guess after a they laughed at him at the un they assemble a it was time for her to to get on out because she's seen a she wasn't going to be able to probably accomplish very much\nNow as far as uh the chick fillet and that should they pull out I really don't think so\nUm and this guy that called and said uh something about you know it was a bunch of black men and they did it\nThey would be left we have we don't have the power we have the power if we look back at your history if we stick together that's why the gay and the homosexual community has a huge voice they have money but they also have learned to stick together as a unit\nAnd not be that's where your priorities and your vote\nBut uh we have lost that somewhere down the line and you know the thing that bothered me whether who's jumping on the back\nOf the civil rights is we are not trying to do anything and we were were supposedly trying that but\nI wasn't penalize 'cause I didn't let the anybody bother me\nThat it was because of the color of our skin not because we chose whether people said I was born this way or the homosexuals are are came I don't care which way as far as what's our God don't make mistakes but you have your own choices\nBut the thing that bothers me you'd ever many people latched on that civil rights the backs of people they got tired said there\nWas a guy and I understand that distinction I mentioned before I understand the distinction I've a traditionally a had its own space or for a a a afro Americans in history a on the same as high there are\nConstitutional and legal parallels that we can't go to right now and that's that's a point I was trying to make second of all uh I understand what you say in terms of the power that is there and arguably isn't there in the two communities you talked about\nI disagree with you as a relates to choosing and things of that sort\nOf but I Want to go back to the first the second if in fact the black community has lost\nOr otherwise never had\nType of political\nSupport and or power that you see in the gay community how can that change and I've got to give you a forty five seconds\nOkay the thing we need to do is go back and look at our history I didn't say we never had because we did have it\nAnd the guy you offered regained that power\nIn our in our vote and it just sticking together and and being as one and then we can do that we have the power to get our people out the vote we have the power in our boat move these people out\nStick together that's all I can say we have the power to look at your history thank you thank you\nThink you can usually makes a great point about color of the skin me nuts\nFor the most profound but yet simple elements to the whole conversation All right I'm looking for a statement from uh the folks over at the marathon I'll see if it's in my mailbox in the meantime stick around we'll get

the you know it is can actually go all throughout this ball on the\nUp today with news radio ten twenty [noise]\nHa [noise] back in two thousand six team when it was Hillary Clinton\nDonald Trump running for\nThe White House [noise] many conservatives that I've spoke to she said that they were going to vote for Trump were concerned about the direct June of their culture\nAnd although they saw Donald Trump has not won who live in the culture that they supported what they saw him as being a bit of a stopgap and not full speed ahead just like it wouldn't be in their minds if they voted for Hillary Clinton I received this tax on the issue of chick fillet\nThe chick fillet controversy is just what we need to energize Republican voters every little bit of a left wing activity\nHelps Trump and I think there's a lot of truth to that a lot of truth to think about what's happening with the whole cabinet thing now with Kavanaugh\nAnd the great opposition clearly the Democrats did that in order to respond to the cause of the base and to energize their base\nAt the same time they energize Republicans that were otherwise not all that excited about going out to the polls in November and now there's this growing thought that the blue wave is not going to be this big\nKnow that I made Nikki Haley was thinking about leaving for a while she certainly has sparred with on the president on some issues\nBut she's also been one of his greatest supporters\nWhen the un when the U.S pulled out on the climate of court or the Iran nuclear deal the un human rights council all\nOf those things she supported those decisions and even when the general assembly delegates lasted the president's she said no they were laughing with him she\nWrote an op ed I just claiming the fact that she might have even had anything to do with the anonymous op ed\nAnd said when she is disagreements she says I'm directly to the president but that also pointed out that she has disagreements with the president\nSo everyone who's ever met her especially in the UN or Robert things that she has a political ambition in the future and on and the question is what could she has ruled out this morning twenty twenty five and she'll be a candidate but that doesn't rule out\nThat doesn't rule out that she would be a vice president with either a vice president Pence says he moves up or with President Trump is their switches I doesn't realize that she take another position in the administration after a little respite or a that she would go on to something else what let me ask you this caller hospitable\nAnd then on the bottom God is to say I don't think\nUm that was too serious although nepotism is not unknown in the White House but what they're really saying is he also said that Dina Powell who was a former national security advisor in his administration and went on to the private sector is being considered\nOr before we get on to Dean I want to go back to a couple of comments that were made earlier today and analysis that were made one was CBS News correspondent poll to read\nThis one is great for a for Nikki Haley because she avoided oh I don't know being fired by tweet us ... that her direction as are under cutting public under cutting this gave her an opportunity to heal the heap praise on the president\nWas there any aspect that you are able to get a buzz on that Nikki Haley was falling out of favor what the president as ambassador at the un\nOh absolutely ... there was a marked difference from her first year with the second six months I she is she was the first woman named to President Trump's cabinet\nShe would as a cabinet member and national security council member she would go to Washington all the time as soon as she didn't get along very well with a secretary of state Rex Tillerson and I think hoped\nTo get along with pomp pale when she even put his picture up I'm at the U.S mission which Rex Tillerson did not have if you want to read those tea leaves\nBut is she was excluded one ... and came in and uh there were a few things she appointed a national ... she had a national security council that the vice president appointed who\nAre they all were lasted four to eight hours because they realized he was never Trump or a John alert or so there were some very serious battles over going on and she was being excluded and that\nAlso I came from the time when she announced the Russia sanctions on on CBS and Larry Kudlow may mentioned that she would be confused and she pushed back there's been a lot of back and forth that she she wasn't really happy\nAnd that but there's no question Robert that the timing\nI'm In the letter was October third this is clearly pre mid term she could have waited another six months\nA part of the question is does she want to get out before there is any more damage um or before um she can't run for something else\nBut what do you mean you get out before she can't run I mean obviously there's no time to run for anything in two thousand Eighteen\nIf you decided to get out maybe next summer she was still have time to be able to run for maybe a U.S Senate seat if there is one available in uh South Carolina for two thousand twenty right ... why did she need to get out now\nWell she did say she would not be a candidate for any office in twenty twenty so we'll see if that changes that always is set in Washington is you know I worked in Washington until the moment\nThat changes um but the point is if there's a shellacking of any kind during the midterm elections I she's she's not having she doesn't have to justify she doesn't have to\nDeal with it she's okay out\nWell let me say this as one who order\nI I as one who worked in Washington\nIs a curious to you that even though the letter was signed a almost a week ago right that it would be put out today the day after the ceremonial swearing in of cabinet\nAnd not allow the Republicans are kind of like ride the wave of cabin or for a week and now there's this aspect of a little bit of a downer news if you will\nWell she may have waited\nI mean obviously she could she rode on October third and may have waited in deference to the Kavanaugh questions okay we got it was John\nUm she clearly went out praising president and the president praising her and that's her style she she doesn't want to see him in any way disloyal and she has not been in any way but she has\nA guy has to be said carved out a place where people perceive that she does have different policy interests sometimes more hardline as she is on Russia than the president\nBush then makes you wonder how it is that she finds a place somewhere else in the administration\nIs for at least maybe it's on the domestic side because on the foreign side of things
