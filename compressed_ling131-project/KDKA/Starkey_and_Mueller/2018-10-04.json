its knees by foreign money they they don't even know lose donating to these campaigns it's totally ridiculous\nBut what I Want to talk about in particular is if you have you had a chance to watch the movie Fahrenheit eleven nine\nAnd that's not just an anti Trump movie by Mr Moore 'cause she goes after the Clintons he goes after Hillary goes out to the Democratic party for things they've done he's gone after Obama\nBut in the end of that movie was about a ten minute segment where they have political a history professor and they go through the films of how Hitler who was an Austrian immigrant him into Germany\nAnd took over in Germany is that not only took them about eight to ten years that have complete control they show his Hitler rallies and honest to God if you see them and you see one of these Trump rallies where they have all the Nazi banners then and they show that side by side and they have all the\nDrugs were wearing women's gym Jim ... you're comparing so wait a minute I'm let me ask you to hold on hold and Matt I let you talk man see one class you\nAre you comparing Trump to Hitler\nYes Ron I'm Talking about the tactics and what's going on right now for example okay you know how it'll or Hitler actually took over in Germany in\nGermany started out one hit with payment or there was a Nazi Party but it was strongly democratic there was some communists in there was a mixed bag in parliament okay when Hitler started to take control what he did was he burned down a parliament their rights that that's in history\nThe cost of ... a major national catastrophe you know that little thing where the other day well with that ... that's that's in line with what just what happened they burned down a parliament and and Hitler declared martial law and they took it over they talked about how the all the the free newspapers in Germany\nWere eliminated there was one newspaper they talked about how the Germans had TV\nFor years before the United states had any kind of commercial basis that became Hitler TV for propaganda you had drugs of verbal and yell at his family's saying was if you're going to tell a lie tell a big lie and tell it often\nAnd they just went right through all the parallels and as I say you look at these Trump rallies you look at how Hitler got in ... it was a populist it came to the point where Hitler could do anything and if people would support him you don't watch a movie and you can see how it doesn't take long for a fascist like that that take the country over\nNine day thank you I appreciate it uh I Know Michael Moore's movie just came out uh and uh\nUh it's probably worth watching 'em\nAnd then you had to be ... a capital would comparisons between Trump and Hitler um but I understand your point a Mitt these rallies in those rallies in it looks like a ... that's how a another um dictator did it\nUm so I guess you have to watch that and be careful with\nAll right here's another one I ... it's good to hear you it seems

be a little bit more intense\nThan we anticipated although it's more of a an issue obviously in terms of very heavy rainfall of a short period of time or we were really didn't see too much in terms of when with this ah certainly not a severe storm as far as when goes but obviously severe in terms of very heavy rain in the short period of time\nAnd you couple that with the rain that we received most recently and then higher humidity levels and it just wasn't much of an opportunity for the ground the dry up in between time right\nExactly exactly the ground is just a very moist across the region didn't take a whole lot of rain to produce a flooding so a downpour that we got obviously a really cause big problems\nAnd I don't fear joining us from accuweather John thank you very much You're welcome I this issue with the roads are just a one minute report doesn't seem to be quite enough\nScott Stiller with us from the Pentagon Information Center ... you were saying earlier Scott that we

water and there's different stretches from fifty one from the liberty tunnels all the way out to eighty eight or the south bound lanes and flooding Vermillion with entering the creek runs right along the runway there so that's where a lot of a catch pace and\nDumps down into that creek so that's flooded their it's also flooded eighty eight between\nUh fifty one and McNeely road and the area that you were talking about we've got people try and drive through standing on her street or on the road and Brent one runway of someone trapped in a vehicle down their street Toronto always floods\nAnd we get heavy rain like that and a lot of folks I see going up crane over towards banks Melrose but our banks don't was flooded between Potomac ... monitor all so I don't know where there are those folks are going to go I Would make my way over towards my celebrity avenue or if you normally take fifty one I Would think Brown's railroad because both of those roads are higher elevation\n[noise] when you're looking at the cameras are you able to see intense amounts of rain fall or at this point the rain isn't that bad it's just an issue of flooding at this point\nIn the rain isn't that bad it's an issue of the runoff now the flooding everything out but it you know it's coming down off the hillsides end of the creek basins and the catch basins and we're going to report in fifty one out near marry me where it blew the manhole covers off the roadway just so much for some water\nYou know what in fact I just got a photograph from somebody and it looks exactly like what you just describe where the water is forcing itself up through the manhole covers and creating a spray affecting them it's just a remarkable how much power is in their considering how much those manhole covers way\nOh without a doubt and it just to check them up off the ah up off their base like they're sitting on there and\nIt goes to show you how quickly the situation can change that's why we always tell folks turn around don't drown you don't ever want to try and drive through standing water that's why I have this right now I see these folks driving through standing water in fifty one in crane and they're trying to grow up crane Avon\nAnd I see people turning around and going back towards mount Washington which would be the smartest thing to do you want to stay on\nThing to do what you want to stay out of the south bound side of things into some of his water starts to\nRecede now I can see eighty eight starting to receded fifty one but somebody tried to drive through it and then they were very smartly got off the runway and no one of the business is on the side of the road because they weren't going to make and all the way down from Naomi down to fifty one so folks just spit it out for a couple of minutes and it just starts to mercy and they don't get a little bit better\nNow Scott Stiller traffic on the science coming up in one minute from now in the meantime\nI'm going to give you
