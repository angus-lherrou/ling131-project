did\nThey don't have any memories whatsoever of the murder that was committed the Supreme Court previously ruled that condemned inmates must have a rational understanding that they are about to be executed and why\nBut at the same court also ruled back in November of last year\nThat Madison's execution could proceed\nJustices said then and then I'm assigned opinion that testimony shows the

know on kitty K.\nLet's now turn to CBS News military consultant Mike Lyons joining us on the disc Institute of Pittsburgh news like\nMike is this something that the United states need to send a message back to Iran over or do you just move on from here\nNo I think we've got a sense I'm kind of message back I mean we we don't ascribe to the big sky little bullet theory which is what basically the Syrians and if you arrange to hear\n'em that are from the airplanes perspective could've had something there and I think it's too close to troops us troops on the ground there I think they're sending a message that off so I don't know if we respond can ethically but we're gonna have to do something um I don't think will will put up with that for much longer if something like this happens again\nNow the message that you see them sending clearly to the U.S government is\nA watch out keep your troops are away from these militant groups that you're supposed to be firing and we we basically want them out of there they don't they don't want it to U.S forces inside of Syria on any level\nAnd they don't care who the fighting or they're going to take care of it are wrong makes a statement that the Iranian missiles are the framework for combating terrorism from their perspective this is how they're going to fight\nTo who they perceived to be their enemies so I think it's a message to us ... ...\nWhat about the Russians that were there because they're on the ground there what about Syrian military or the ... is there with the day somehow get notified I just didn't come to us\nNo I I think I'm ... yeah there's there's not that we don't have that conduit set up by it would've taken an extraordinary effort from somebody on their side to make sure that it happens that battle space was coordinated it just you know given what's happening there or you could you know that they're going to argue that the United states shouldn't even be inside of Syria\nNow so that that's what they'll say is that you know they're not going to coordinate with us but\nSo you're saying that that the Russians didn't have any advance notice either and neither did the Syrians that these missiles were coming in from Iran\nNo I ...\nAnd whatsoever whether the Russians did uh we won't know they won't admit um but the Russians don't have what they'll say to be are at their own ground troops there anyway they're just kind of mercenaries so they're gonna you know that and if they have to write them off they write them off it's been it's been happened before\nOkay now joining us once again on that just gives it to the Pittsburgh new zine is Michaeline CBS military analysts U.S officials also concerned about the south China Sea saying a Chinese destroyer got too close for comfort in that South China Sea here's more with Vicki Barker from CBS\nEngineer an area called the ... the Chinese destroy a pass\nWithin forty five yards of the USS Decatur forcing it to swerve to prevent a collision get us blames the Chinese yet but the Chinese accused the Americans have acting in what they call a provocative manner the Chinese military has been building on reefs and strategic waterway had claiming an ass Chinese territory\nHence the tension on both sides I think he Parker CBS knees Mike what's happening here\n[noise] well now you've got China having built up these military assets along these they told and areas they're claiming wider space when it comes to the south China Sea or in terms of us encroachment now the United states recognizes mainland China but doesn't recognize the they told that they've built up as part of their\nChina's says eleven miles off there is now inside of Chinese waters and so now the Chinese are going to play this game of chicken with us and they left it there it's just not going to go well I'm so we will see this is the next logical step that we thought that they were going to do based on that kind of military assets they put on those built up areas\nOkay well if China wants to claim this mount of distance off the coast\nUh and specially what the president's a new idea of not necessarily being the policeman of the world and focusing more on what's happening in our fifties states what's the downside of giving China what they are claiming to be there is at this point\n[noise] well this is about us protection of allies and if we don't keep those shipping lanes open our allies are in the far east or the country's Australia for one\nOr the or the Philippines others they're Vietnam Vietnam in that category of you know it's kind of crazy to save that Vietnam isn't our ally when it comes to getting making sure their goods and services are shipped throughout the world if the Chinese decide to um you know play hardball in South China Sea\nThey can look to own the rare earth minerals that are underneath the water but also as well as a making it making it more difficult for some of those good to be moved and I think that's one thing the United states does this ensures the safe passage of that equipment\nWhen Mike Lyons joining us once again CBS News military analysts on the disc Institute of Pittsburgh newsletter Mike thank you very much for your time things around me\nAre and what are the things that's free pretty clear especially with the south China Sea dispute is it not only is the United states the policemen\nTo the world with conflicts all over ah we are also the primary responsibility to ensure that goods are able to be shipped across the seas as well which tend begs another question are we being paid for this too\nSo that\nWhoever that country is maybe it's the Vietnamese or whoever and South Korea I mean you name the country that's over there in order to ensure that they're going to get to hear\nWhy are we paying for that\nI mean we're alternately subsidizing it aren't we\nWe pay our taxes so that our military can then ensure the travel of the the a shipment of ... goods across

welcome back to ... to gay radio good to have you\nHey Robert thanks very much for having me how are you that\nI'm doing very well this issue of seatbelts in school buses now obviously we can clearly recognize the value of having a seat belt in the car and having children especially the little ones being seatbelt\nBut for whatever reason we don't expect children to be seatbelt than as they're on school buses or you would think that ought to change\nYeah especially Robert in the past in the past week we've got to school bus crashes out one up in the ... city\nUh personally I think one is too many um now this number metro at your real quick here it sounds like it's very very low but again I think one unique about a levee kids every year the United states do to wash crashed left\nDo one of those electric kids may have the cure for cancer that we will never know so I take this off for selfish reasons I might eat one of those children one day\nAnd looking at the banking up and got through after the other day about the costs of these stadiums mhm uh went up here in North hills I did a little bit of research on you probably know what school district days it's a beautiful stadium caught nine million dollars to build nine million each school bus on the high\nEach school bus on the high end of the school bus rigged with seatbelts costs on high end seven thousand could about twelve hundred eighty five school buses Donald seatbelts\nWell here here are some of the counter positions that I've ever heard of why it isn't really feasible to have seatbelts on school buses one how do you ensure everyone is using a seatbelt\nThat's correct so in that situation a school bus drivers got to be trained as well to\nUm something else that goes along with that\nRobert is assigned seating or one thirty assigned seat the discipline problems come down to bullying comes down to about Ninety three percent of all school bus or a school bus drivers have steam bullying\nOnce seatbelts on these buses there has to be with right now the bully gets cut way down to the school bus drivers to take a walk through if you have to sit and hold people accountable to put these seatbelts on at
