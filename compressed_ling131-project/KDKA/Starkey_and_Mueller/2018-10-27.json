think it's going to happen to wash a but it does you know we have good faith that\nWhen it comes to security and I realize that is something that you focus on helping people be as secure as they can be what do you see us needing to do the heightened security to make incidents like this less likely to occur\nYou know Rob it it it's such a it's it's such a of the spectrum of issues is so broad you know let's start with the with the with the general issue I mean we've we've we've\nHey this is such a of the spectrum of issues is so broad you know let's start with the with the with the general issue I mean we've we've\nWe've done very well with focusing on now what is a hate crime should this will be categorized as a hate crime it because of that the the punishment will be exponentially larger but we're still struggling because of our First Amendment rights as to what hate speech is and so that's really one of the issues you know what are we going to do about\nTeach beach which which which promotes so much of this so much of this this this this temperament that our country you know just to give you an example Facebook used to have\nTwo people to be able to eliminate you know post

spectrum\nTalking about security on a more practical level the first thing you have to do is keep ... percent out of the facility\nYou can talk about monitoring social media about all of these things you want from the from from a practical perspective\nYou have to keep the person out of the facility so you know every every perpetrator\nWell how are you a ...\nLet me ask you this how do you keep this individual out as you have an open synagogue and open church and open place of worship we're trying to be welcoming do you have some type of a security guard at the front door unless you're a member or an invited guest you don't get access\nYou limit you limit it fell off the gross and accept you limit access just what you do you know you you you would you go to so many of these these facilities whether it be my church or your church or synagogue typically there's a number of ways that you can get in and out\nYou know every perpetrator every criminal everyone who's going to do something wrong evaluate the risk and and if the person is going to walk into a situation where they know that they're going to be scrutinized very carefully doesn't have to be a metal detector\nBut yes yes we're we're getting to the point where you're gonna have to have someone on standby to be able to evaluate who's coming in and out absolutely\nAbsolutely now that the world we live in today\nLow too many people going to church later on this evening many other people going to church tomorrow with a heightened sense of alerts or maybe even some aspects\nOf fear um your thoughts about people who decide to take matters into their own hand and decide okay I'm licensed to carry concealed I'm bringing my gun church today\nWell let me tell you something uh\nFirst of all you know what our concept is initial responder you know everyone has to be everyone has to be cognizant of the fact\nThat you know the city of Pittsburgh place where some of the best of the world\nYou know but no matter how quickly they respond by the time that they respond\nThere there there's casualties and terrible casualties as we've witnessed today so first of all you know every organization has to understand the fact that they have to have a plan they have to have a remedy to be able to be able to respond a and and that's first and foremost in regards to firearms I Will tell you\nAnd what do you know what am\nI really only know from a news report um I just found out that one of our regular [noise]\nI mean ... was shot and killed [noise]\nI'm just a matter of shock [noise]\nSo I understand that people are meeting over at the J Sisi the Jewish community center that's where families are going now and they will be\nA apprised of uh [noise] the condition of the of their of their loved ones that they uh had been shot\nThat's where I'm headed I'm headed there and you're also police chaplain so just so Nirvana zone for which is right here\nWhere I serve and also we serve in general to help police to watch [noise] today they went beyond the call of duty in three of them are\nAnd I understand that if you know the police had not acted this this uh this terrible tragedy would have been worse than what it is\nMy last I heard was that he before they caught him he was the question in my office which is up in the third floor can you describe that to me\nCould almost see if we are I'm such a beautiful study in the third floor sort of quiet and peaceful I\nOverlook will come after you so I see where the action is [noise] but this is an unbelievable than\nHe was a behind your desk Congress I may have to barricaded himself\nI haven't been the wouldn't let me in out of seasons\nBehind your desk I guess I\nMay have to barricaded himself\nHave meant they wouldn't let me now to see that I don't really know\nAnd it's just shocking I mean as as a rabbi and you know you know the anti Semitism exists but uh and you're probably on guard about that um\n[noise] I actually do hire off duty police with a high Allen is was a few weeks ago [laughter] normal week and we don't [noise]\nI mean you know the president's out a statement today about well had there been an armed guard I didn't hear that [noise]\nWell hang on every level of security helps uh so I think an armed guard sadly I've I've ... I've been in Israel many over the last fifty years and Israel takes these precautions very serious [noise]\nShocking is that did this happen in this neighborhood is real just as the remarkable neighborhood we are within the city limits the Pittsburgh very peaceful very beautiful trio trees old buildings [noise] it's really an amazing neighborhood or to raise a family is which is what I Do [noise] so it's distressing and many many levels [noise] I'm\nA resident a squirrel hill I'm a Catholic or Jews Catholics Asians ah we're diverse neighborhood now and [noise] we we all get together\n[laughter] I just got off the phone call cardinal Wuerl\nWho reached out to me as very kind considering the troubles these having [noise]\nWhat will you be counseling people and especially the police officers are police officers are shook up\nOf course and you just need to know that the communities with them [noise]\nSo we are grateful to them for the\nFact that they put their lives on the line every single day [noise]\nI'm a former navy chaplain 'cause I have a little experience in terms of military [noise]\nA fence assessed on [noise] ... what do you tell your your congregation what do you tell police officer\nI just have to do the best they can for everybody including themselves [noise] I have no magic bullet pardon the expression\nTo make the pain go away [noise]\nAnd we will ah this is forever changed this neighborhood\nI think history will always be referred to as a neighborhood who are shooting took place [noise]\nAnyway thank you and you've\nAlready seen his interview from Katie Katie be just a little while ago a with us and the kid decay radio news Ron Paul Rasmussen poll continuing to monitor and trying to lean more information about this man Robert Bauer who he is and what his life was like\nOn social media previous to today or Paul what do you have at this point\nWhat Robert what we're able to tell from looking at some postings that a Robert Ballard is made on a forum called gab dot com gee I began dot com which describes itself as a free speech show a social network\nOf one post after another in time and he joined the forum in January of this year it's actually January of this use of less than a year\nOne post after another on these is green characters that are still available a archived photographs of his account the account itself has been taken down so if you were to go to that website and look for it now you would not be able to find it\nBut what what you see is a consistent pattern of book fought here but which kind of standards around the Semitic fought that are the two Jews in the United states are are against whites and are conspiring as a group to work against whites in whatever way they can\nAnd why is this a number of posts that you see repeat that there's a number of slurp through their uh and and his profile on this particular website\nSo that you see repeat that there's a number of slurs that are there are ... and his profile on this particular website you see a picture and ah you see that he made the six hundred twenty seven posts since the first day of the year\nAnd there were several hundred people who he was following in several hundred people about four hundred that we're following him and below his picture you see\nThe words Jews are the children of Satan these this this would be kind of I guess he's monitor his ah you know his calling card and a in a post made shortly before the shooting took place at the synagogue\nHe said H. I. A. S. likes to bring invaders and they kill our people I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered and he says the closest the statement by saying I'm going in so\nWe're for people who haven't been able to listen to the entire time can you remind us H. I. A. S. what that organization is\nYes it is the Hebrew immigrant aid society and what they do is help resettled people that are believed to be at risk due to wars are persecution or violence and according to weigh competed they've helped resettle more than four and a half million people one thing I wanted to throw in Robert ... that's popping up now on social media\nIf you're listening to this and wondering what you can do donate blood\nAnd blood donation centers are extending their hours today for the reason that they would like to be able to help as many people as they can assuming that that we have patients who are in need of her ticket or kind of but who knows what all the demands are\nAbsolutely long had a number of injuries that we're dealing with at this point you have a lot of people who are in need of a blood and it's a wonderful way of when you feel helpless when something like this happens and you feel helpless and you want to do something to make a difference and um you want to go and do and that's a wonderful thing to do\nOne other thing uh it's a pretty good bet we don't have this confirmed from authorities but it's a pretty good bet that Bowers is\nBeing treated Allegheny general and the reason why we would say that is is\nThere is very tight security ah we've heard the word lockdown used and people who've been in the hospital who've spoken to reporters had been saying yeah security is quite sided Allegheny General Hospital so from what I can tell from what we can see here he's he was taken Allegheny general\nEr which would be a apart from\nThe other victims where they were being treated much closer by the U. P. M. C. facilities where John ... way Katie gay radios John ... has been doing his reports for us in both Katie gay TV so you would assume that ah that that's what's taking place there and there are also reports that authorities are investigating\nAt the castle Shannon home of a Robert Bowers okay and as you may have already been as you've probably been talking about with you these numerous gas you've been talking to the FBI is of all this is a hate crime now investigation\nAnd people immediately and this day and time there were and are looking for politics and is there any kind of a connection whatsoever and it from what I'm able to glean at this point I'm this is just a hate issue with no political leanings whatsoever\nWhat can you hear that act what I can tell you from the postings that I've seen on this a gab dot com account by a Robert Bowers and we assume this is the guy mhm it appears he was a ... he was thinking that President Trump in terms of any political leanings you think President Trump was being used by the Jewish community\nOr for their own aims so it it does not appear\nThat there is a a\nA direct connection or ... this would be I guess very different from the the male bombings the the bombs that were sent in the mail not bombings but bombs in the mail you know they were directed at a particular group of people just like the shooting at the ...\nThe the male bombings though the the bombs that were sent in the mail not bombings but bombs in in the mail mhm you know they were directed at a particular group of people just like the shooting at the ball field in Washington was targeting a particular group of people\nYou know the only thing I I'm reading from a the Fiji at this point and they have a little quote and I'm sure that you may have it as well where are you did not favor Donald Trump endorsing post suggesting\nUh that the president was quote controlled by the Jews as you just mentioned yes and writing that he is a global is not a nationalist\nAnd there is no hash tag ... M. A. G. A. make America great again as long as there are a a expletive for Jews and infestation he also wrote that he was glad the overwhelming a ... problem has been solved so we can now\nFight with each other I mean that is absolutely at all sat around and getting\nAll centers around this this conspiracy about a conspiracy against white people is being perpetrated by the Jewish community ... worldwide but in specific in the United states and if and he was a\nYou know he was just it seemed to tie in almost entirely with that it does not have seemed to have much more of a political bent like in less there is a politician that is involved in the issue somehow in a peripheral basis\n... Paul Rasmussen joining us from the kid a K radio newsroom we're going to go to the news with rose Ryan Douglas right now news radio ten twenty kitty\nThat all searches and the guy said have armed guard I hate to think of it that way I Will say that I hate to think of it that way so we'll see you and\nWorld with a lot of problems and it has been a world with a lot of problems for\nYears many many years then you could say frankly many centuries I mean you look at what goes on [noise]\nBut certainly you want protection\nAnd they didn't have any protection they add a maniac walk in\nAnd they didn't have any protection and that is just\nSo sad to see the results could have been much better it is a very very\nVery difficult thing for me to say this president is to watch\nAny of this go yeah before I\nRead her office said I'd watch instances like this\nWith churches and other\nI say what a shame what a shame but\nIt's even tougher when you're\nPresident of the United states and you have to watch\nKind of a thing happen is so sad to see\nPresident Trump once again speaking before he went to a rally or Ron Paul Rasmussen indicated K radio news room with more details Paul let's talk for a moment about what's going on with the central blood bank if we could this is critically important uh it's a way of people being able to play a part\nAnd have a positive influence here to do something when they feel so helpless in times like these\nThis is uh what are the late ... Rogers was talking about when tragedy strikes you teach the children to watch the helpers that respond well this is one of the ways that you can do that central blood bank has expanded their hours at the places where the\nWhere they have a blood donation there are three of them to pop up here there's one in the eight hundred block of green tree road\nAnother one downtown in the eight hundred block a Fifth Avenue and then er into five hundred block of Martin deals street up on the north side so that that's really not very far at all from Allegheny General Hospital by the way and all of these are pretty can be located but the one over here in uh\nOver here in our area over on the green tree road to all these are going to be open I guess your hours for donations have been extended today now I I recall um they have a specific need Robert what are they looking for specifically they\nAccording to its they're looking for platelets which is critically important because that's something they can give to everyone\nEveryone can donate platelets\nAnd then old positives and negatives are desperately needed as well it's not to say that if you are unable to give just platelets or are ... positive or oh negative that your blood is it needed\nTo use the opportunity if you if you're not you can still use the opportunity to give you the truth is that you're working in our in our jobs as we work here you are I'm sure you remember this\nWas the last time I mean it it's a constant stream of messages from the different organizations including this ethical but banks saying hey we need donations so they tend to go down around the holidays so but you never know when they're going to be needed in greater supply but they're always needed\nAlways always needed ... here's the phone number for you if you are in need of some degree of\nAre always needed\nAlways always needed a here's a phone number for you if you are in need of some degree of a council you want to talk to somebody about what's going on [noise] you know Paul when we talk about incidents like this and we get to see them from afar\nWe have this feeling I feel so bad for them and what they're going through\nAnd now it's us and what we're going through and I believe that many are going through emotions right now they didn't realize that they could feel regarding this I mean you go from a grave sadness and heartache and despair and then I'm sure there's an aspect of anger\nThat kicks in as well and it just goes through this cycle loop and the ability to talk to somebody so critically important here is the phone number for one to four three two\nForty four hundred grief counselors are available at for one to\nFour three two forty four hundred and a ... once I also want to go for something else to I Want to go over once again a Rob power\nAnd that this individual and how he took their social media not the traditional forms of social media but was very much a a sphere of hate and um made it very clear who he did not like and what he was intending to do\nWhile he was among a group of people uh several hundred about four hundred people were following him he was following about four hundred people on a website called ... dot com\nA it's a free speech social media platform for people to express their views I guess it's somewhat like Twitter or it appears to be very much like Twitter in its format but uh uh what what you're talking about a Robert is a is it's difficult to describe on the air\nThe messages that are being re posted by by rock a Robert Bauer is\nA ... there were six hundred twenty seven posts made by this individual since January twenty Eighteen\nAnd his uh his profile statement says Jews are the children of Satan and then it links it to a biblical verse from one of the four gospels John chapter eight verse forty four I'm not sure how that could possibly be\nLinked to that but anyway that's on his profile and shortly before the shooting he posted a\nAgainst a group that brings a refugees are into the United states resettle refugees apparently all over the world over four and a half a million of them according to what we were able to learn about\nThis group it's the Hebrew immigrant aid society H.

there's a news conference coming up the ... will get more details about that but we don't know the ages we don't know the names we don't know sex I don't know anything\nAnd they haven't they the authorities do I do believe but they've not they're not releasing their by hopefully\nThis news conference that for a from the FBI and the ATF will crystallize what happened this mass shooting a this morning at about nine forty five and thankfully the police first off local police and then FBI and ATF all their\nUh showed up and and got this guy I mean they ... the shooting apparently was so bad that they have to seek cover behind their vehicles because he he was shooting back at them and then they they got him didn't kill them so there's a story to be learned\nIs interesting that they were able to apprehend him without him being killed yes and hopefully a lot more information is able to be gleaned from him as a result of this I mean we we already know what the conclusion is for the most part but I'm Paul Rasmussen is joining us from the ... radio news Ron Paul what do we know\nWe have ah some breaking developments for you guys uh we've just confirmed through the Associated Press now at least ten people have been killed oh my God at least ten people have been killed\nA so we have that development so we also have from the governor or has ordered all commonwealth flags at the Capitol all commonwealth facilities and throughout the state\nTo be lowered to half staff effective immediately and until further notice the attorney general has commented now on the shooting and part of his statement that was released a few minutes ago says when any one community is targeted with violence\nIntimidation or discrimination it threatens all of us and must be condemned\nAnd then from\nThe district attorney uh\nIt threatens all of us and must be condemned and then uh from\nThe district attorney uh we've received this word just a moment ago says that a senior prosecutors and detectives\nHad been monitoring the atrocities since the first reports a deputy district attorney is on site coordinating the prosecution of this individual under state laws\nInvolving murder and federal laws involving domestic terrorism so ... says here that the district attorney Mr Isabella has been in touch with the U.S attorney Scott Brady and they're working together to determine the appropriate forum in which to address the crime so those are the latest developments in of course the most disappointing and\nReally shocking and saddening is uh we're now talking about ten people tend lives you know had been extinguished today in an act of terror Haight\nAshbury ...\nPure your horrific it heats up for when I I Want to give this number just leave our pride trying to process this as best that they can and there's a help line it's available I think it's important to continue to get out it's for one to four three two forty four hundred for one to four three two forty four hundred also people who want to do something\nAnd feel as though it isn't enough to not just sit back and wish and hope and even pray they want to go and do and the central blood bank is asking for blood and platelet donations\nAnd I got a message on Facebook from Mary who says can you give me the address to the location and green tree and I said yes and then she message me and said that the places pretty busy right now but she's sticking around and she's joining us right now on the disc Institute of Pittsburgh new Zion Mary are you there\nAs we all Pennsylvania and degrade people of Pennsylvania is Los in our hearts and prayers [noise] I Am glad to be here today in the wonderful state of Indiana we love and [noise]\nAnd to address [noise] some\nPeople that I got to be so successful future farmers of America [noise]\n\nPresident Trump at a rally for the future farmers of America and making a number of a very poignant points regarding the mass shooting taking the lives of temp people according to the Associated Press here\nAnd scroll hill a Sony Richards is with us we'll be taking over here coming up at three thirty completely but what are the things that stood out to me and what he just said\nIs the simple\nReferences to Mayor Bill de Vito ... and governor Tom Wolfe and said that ... they're terrific people you know it it's something that you would have not heard from the president's regarding to individuals especially considering the history that he's had with\nNo bill poodle and the whole Pittsburgh not perish and ... who does made it very clear how he sees\nThe president politically a governor Tom Wolfe there is a very heated gubernatorial race that's taking place right now the president's come out for ... for Wagner in opposition to governor wolf but realizing that have disparate ticket or for time\nWhat you say is what he said\nAnd commanding the governor and committing them air\nWell in so many people have been critical of the president's saying show some heart you know open up and and get off the prepared speeches on the teleprompter and I think he did exactly that I mean that was not scripted I think he just came from his hard on that\nAnd thank goodness for that and you know these things have happened enough times in his short times president that I think he's getting the idea\nYou can't just you can't just have a speech written quickly and and you give your condolences and and and offer your prayers up and move on and rises ... this is something he's speaking he's speaking to people who truly understand that the future farmers of America in Indiana there\nSo you know and he also said earlier and they were talking to him when he was leaving a Washington\nThat uh he said had the synagogue had an armed guard results might have been different um and that that's possible and that you know that's to be talked about later are still trying to subtle what happened this morning\nHere's what's interesting though there are a lot of people who are looking are going to church than I only Catholics riot church this evening right and there are obviously many more that will be going to church tomorrow and this is going to be met in the back of their mind oh in the forefront of their mind of a house save am I here what should I be doing\nIt's going to be not in the back of their mind oh in the forefront of their mind of how safe am I here what should I be doing and I wouldn't be surprised if there are people who are licensed to carry that decide I Want to be as safe as I can be and then make that decision to do that tomorrow\nBoy I don't you know and I don't welcome that scenario I mean I Know I think you're right um but that's that spooky spooky that Americans will choose to go to church yes moral and say I got the Bible you got the gun mhm and\nWe're going to church yeah is that it's a pretty frightening thing it's organizations all over the need to be thinking about this from independent churches to the nominations in\nSignal denominations bishop David ... is joining us right now bishop of the Roman Catholic diocese here in Pittsburgh and bishop welcome the KKK radio good to have user\nAnd you know I'm I'm Glad to be with you and your listeners are they're pretty tough time today\nIt is a very very difficult time study Richards is with us as well ... there are many people who are trying to deal with this emotionally today speak to those who are struggling as they're processing this over the past five hours or so\nAfter the has to be that the the the place where we have to be played the cells in the position of people\nWho are suffering so much you know ... me that the families of the victims I think but we also have to have to consider the Jewish community and how deeply hurt they are by the active horrific hatred\nAnd so the way that we have to be concerned about each other from the heart\nA bishop zoo is joining us on the disc Institute of Pittsburgh news lie we now have a confirmation that the death toll is now at eleven ... TV reporting that number as well and hoping hoping beyond a whole set the number doesn't grow any higher than it is a\n... ... ... ... ... have you talked to some of the priest in the diocese throughout the city here or in and um you talk to them about what they may be saying and their sermons tomorrow in church and ... yeah but\nThat's all of our of proof to do is make sure that our all of our ... and all of our parents if this weekend that tends to be given the praying for a Jewish humidity for the victims\nAre both that had a chance to be able to talk to some of the people in the hills offer support in the Catholic community or for all of them as well to\nWe've been also talking about the issue of security these are just peaceful ah worshipers that we're going into a baby naming ceremony people of all ages generations are going together\nAnd not thinking that they needed to worry about security measures to what extent do you bishop worry about security at churches around the diocese and give a level of comfort and reassurance to Catholics that are listening right now\nI think if you can't escape the issue everybody worried about security but\nOnly in our churches but everywhere and I know that you know uh we we have a ... some of our parents knew that\nBut we have to take a look at what that fit a need for everybody in my head\nBut I also think that we have to be able to take a look at the root causes of this liar because we live in a time in our country and in the world and we have to be able to root out the hatred that really gets you so to give birth to this kind of violent so in that\nHi I'm a in our country and in the world and we have to be able to root out the hatred that really gets paid so they give birth to this kind of violent so it got to be a two pronged approach\nDo do you see bishop a time when there will be security posted outside the doors of churches in perhaps church doors being locked one of the service is going on heaven forbid but do you see that\nAnd a lot of anything and play we also have and and and most of our church that that the security cameras as well too but we're also going to have to take a look at where we go from here after what happened today\nYeah let's talk about the issue of their rhetoric and how heated it is at this point\nWe don't have to engage back when people started it do you believe in this idea that\nYou can make a decision for yourself whether or not you're going to reciprocate because oftentimes I notice when you reciprocate all you do is get to higher and higher levels of anger and rage can we is this something that we have to all claimed responsibility for ourselves in your estimation [noise]\nWhy I I think that's where it has to be getting man you know uh you know all of us have to take a look at things where if they're bigotry and are hard for president\nAnd the fact of it is the challenge ourselves to route that out or have other people to challenge it within it because it not said you know it could be used to grow and grow and grow and they said the kind of hatred that so destructive\nBishop David ... joining us on the disc Institute of his ... Pittsburgh new Zion bishop thank you very much for a time I do appreciate your willingness to come on and give it a couple of moments to us thank you\nThank you very much and again but\nThis is a very difficult time not only for the bishop well obviously but churches all over ... not only here in the region me we we we get into this little\nSpace where we think it's just us but imagine what people are going through who are listening to this watching the events unfold here in Pittsburgh and then having these thoughts in Philadelphia and Cleveland Chicago and New York and LA wondering exactly the same thing\nEspecially ... coming off this past week with bombs being mailed to various people across the country and here we are I think a lot of people yes it's happened here in this community now\nUm and it ... it it happened in squirrel hill it didn't happen perhaps where you live or where you live but it sure does shake UT or core or when you put the TV on when you turn the radio on and here we are covering the murder of eleven innocent people in a synagogue run\nAs a talk show host ... ... your show live from the center where you do your best to try to hear what it is that people from both sides are saying\nHey have you uh how how could you not notice this but what how do we ratcheted back just a little bit to where we can have really serious dialogue about differences of issues but then not launching off to the point to where you are now hate filled in that dialogue\nYou know I have found in talking with people and getting to know the audience you know even better\nUm letting them express their feelings and many times by you know not arguing with people but letting them express their feelings when you find I find that the audience hears some of these\nSide not Twitter ... none of those but um he he had a real presence on social media on this particular site the Hebrew immigrant aid society is what he was talking about on his side uh and uh just saying\nAbsolutely horrible things and he essentially a sad or one of the last things he said was screw your optics I'm going in a which sounds to me like that was a moment of decision for him from what we can tell\nA victims or assistance has been set up at the campus of Chatham University as I told you [noise] um this is being treated a on a federal a basis now because this is this is a this is I hate this terrorism as a hate crime this is a mass murder is um is about as bad as you can get\nUm the blood donations setters as men Gina was reporting um have a extended their hours through the day to day oh so you can help and there'll be open again tomorrow I suggest that you call a ... before you go to your local or blood setter\nAnd um find out you know just exactly what the hours are because this is kind of being and lived as we go through the day today by all the agencies\nAnd um find out you know just exactly what the hours are because this is kind of being and lived as we go through the day today by all the agencies who are trying to help\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers or the or a University of Pittsburgh Medical center pitch a University of Pittsburgh and the uh the Steelers of penguins and and the University of Pittsburgh Abul released statements on various social media\nOr just horrified at what happened um to reiterate a bit of what has transpired in just the last half hour and things are happening quickly that is why we are staying with this story throughout the day today because there are other stories that will we're sure\nAnd be connected to this the president I think gave a very heartfelt\nA speech just a few moments ago addressing the future farmers of America and Indiana a ... and I think ah it I I think he really showed\nUm ... what this is done to him as it's done to so many of us are our governor Tom Wolfe ah has said that he has ordered all commonwealth flags\nOn the Capitol complex of camp accounting well facilities and throughout the state\nLowered to half staff effective immediately this was about Fifteen minutes ago\nAn honorable victims of the attack at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh I'm all commonwealth flags should be flown at half staff until further notice all Pennsylvanians are invited to participate in this tribute if you have a flag that you can lower and a half mile asked a good thing to do\nA attorney general Josh Shapiro today said the violence against the tree of life congregation today is horrific\nIt is an assault under liberties our country and commonwealth were founded to protect\nHe said when any one community is targeted with violence intimidation or discrimination it threatens all of us and must be condemned\nAs many Gino and I were saying earlier you know it happened in squirrel hill you may say well no not not in our neighborhood not over here not over there uh but it affects all of us and it also affects people who might be on the borderline to thinking about doing violence a dismay repel some and it may encourage others and that's frightening thought\nJosh Shapiro goes on to say that this attack took place in the house of worship we're congregants seek safety and peace and it's particularly perverse and is an attempt to intimidate people of faith\nHe goes on to say that attempt will never succeed\nAttorney general Shapiro says I'm proud to stand with the brave men and women in law enforcement who put their lives at risk to save others today you went on to say I am profoundly grateful to them for their bravery my prayers are with the victims of this heinous act and the loved ones left behind to grieve for them as the congregants of tree of life\nThe people of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania N.J across our commonwealth grapple with this latest atrocity over the coming days and weeks we must act to quell the senseless violence there will be hard conversations they had looking at both our words and our laws but they are critical for us to heal and move forward together\nI Want to check in with a with Paul Rasmussen uh he he was talking earlier about this\nHorrible website that the shooter was using and and putting some of his thoughts in comments on and I'm ... I understand Paul from um what's law enforcement is doing is they're looking and they have now found a house that the shooter lived in is that is that correct\nIt's a the ATF the bomb squad and a police from the capital of municipalities have ah been on the scene at an apartment in an apartment building a small one they say in the Baldwin areas stony and um\nOf ah been on the scene at an apartment and apartment buildings small when they say in the Baldwin areas stony\nAnd um I Would assume that uh the presence of the bomb squad would indicate that uh perhaps\nSome devices were also involved in what was going on today a we have not had that confirmed but I Would not be surprised if at four o'clock when we hear from the FBI that we we we find out some details about perhaps some devices as well\nWe don't know what weapon he wish he used to do this you and we\nKnow now a according to a report in the post is that they're quoting Pittsburgh Police are saying an assault rifle was was a weapon in this attack so there's that aspect it's out there now\nAnd it it the um the death toll has gone up\nTo ... you had to learn now and then to the police officers of the four police officers who were injured or we assume they were wounded but where you you can't be sure right but the two of them are in critical condition\n[noise] so yeah that that continues or as as they go through that because you don't know and I would imagine that this ... the tent than the eleventh uh victims perhaps or those that were are being taken care of by by hospital care\nIt makes pretty good sense at this point that although you know where we're at that point where we won't know names nor will we know you know how many we really don't have a really good handle either I I think on how many people\nWere injured so you know ... to subtract to\nFrom the number of injured may not ... that math may not work out there may be at the number of people who are either killed or wounded maybe larger when it's all over with when we find out that when we finally find out what the numbers are those these things or have a funny way of being fluid and changing from one hour to the next Paul\nDo we know how many people were were in the tree of life when the shooting occurred do we have any estimate is a number of people in there\nThere is a one report a it's a fairly extensive report again this is the post is that ah that I read some time ago there were three ... a ... a congregations that we're using this building the tree of life building their history congregations in all three could have been\nIn the synagogue at the time of the shooting so it's possible that you could have people are having their ship bought service which I was supposed to have started at nine forty five\nAnd the shooting happened right around that time and we could also have been having the breasts that you and Robert were speaking of a few minutes ago that could have been taking place in another area and there could have been a third gathering\nSo there may have been a\nYou know dozens of people inside that you know one of the estimates we saw a ... that we saw this article was around forty five people could have been in there at the time or perhaps more on a typical Saturday that would be the number so who knows it might be a larger number because of the Brits who knows\nAnd the and the mayor um has it's safe to go out I mean I Know there's a ... game tonight I Am people it's a\nTypical Saturday ah I Know earlier this morning that area was shut down there were saying stand your home but now this this is this guy's been taken into custody um yeah is Pittsburgh safe\nIt is this man is in custody he's in the hospital there they're treating him or he has apparently been speaking with the FBI\nOr sell to the crime scene itself of course they're asking people to stay well away from that right you mentioned by the way to pick game and I wanted to just say that ah that they are playing the game are they posted a tweet not too long ago about an hour ago [noise] uh they say that they're going to be playing today's game with the heaviest of hearts ah\nYeah yeah not talking about\nAnd they go about an hour ago [noise] uh they say that they're going to be playing today's game with the heaviest of hearts ah yeah yeah\nOr talking about the synagogue there the community or that they stand strongly United in support of the east of victims and their families while simultaneously standing against senseless acts of violence that attempt to divide us\nPulled us Paul does not do news twenty four hours a day what were you doing this Saturday morning when this story broke\nWell you know it's kind of funny a stony I normally take a nap around you know it around noon every day when I get home short now so I was napping and I woke up and by the way the game is taking place right now is that this is a ... in case somebody thinks that you don't know what time it it it's that the game is being played right now\nBut I I was taking a nap and I just happened to wake up to pick up the phone and there was a text message from the Jacob magic saying ah\nYou know are you are you still in town I've been off for the week so um yeah the vacation came to an abrupt in but you know that was the fastest shower I've ever [laughter] here and I think twenty twenty five [laughter] but

understand what's going on and know what's happening\nYou know I was just thinking is that moment a moment ago or I just laughed I realized was the first time I laughed since I walked into this building it's been that kind of a more\nOh since it broke this morning and we will continue that throughout the day and into the evening tonight and into tomorrow morning as well as long as it takes

[noise]\nWe would take all precautions as we would with any search warrants um we don't know if other to a weapons or in their um ... we would proceed with caution\n... from that we would put the bomb squad in any scenario like this where we would anticipate the devices but we have no information at this point that there are an extra for IDs a presence in the in in a God or\nApproximately twenty minutes [noise]\n\nHow what turned it over the window [noise]\nI Will not get into whether or not he's speaking with the authorities however my understanding was he was transported to the Allegheny general isn't fair condition with multiple gunshot wounds\nOn any body armor [noise] if I Do not have that answer at this point anyone to investigators have an answer reflect I don't know it was one [noise]\nI I don't I Know a service was taking place I'm not quite sure of law exactly which kind of yes we heard that as well I Can't confirm that this time the gunman shot by police or\nBelieve it was police but a definitive um determination will have to be done with the investigation being conducted by the FBI greater\nWe do not uh we're hoping to have a follow up press conference tomorrow and at that time a representative from the medical examiner's office will be there are ... though there are no children among that this season\nAnd at that time a representative from the medical examiner's office will be there though there are no children among the decision I'm Sorry [noise]\nI don't believe so [noise] um we're still talking to the many witnesses at this point so much\nWe don't have that information at this point or or Google synagogues in Pittsburgh on lockdown at this time I don't know about lock down but we will certainly make sure that the information is passively can take the necessary precautions to people\nThe Jewish faith and just for the worried or be on alert or do we think that the threat than\nWe think the threat has been eliminated again if we don't we don't think that anybody has been associated with this gunman but will continue to look at all angles in the conduct of the investigation\nPlus the fact that just follow up on that Pittsburgh bureau police have been notified of numerous services that are being conducted including a vigil tonight and we will have adequate police protection at those suicide security is\nAnd then another officer who had an extremity or damage you and he says he's doing fine I'm they discussed the weapons uh this guy was well armed and they are Fifteen and three handguns no children were killed in these

and is with us now oh let's get Melinda on and see what she has to say Melinda thanks for calling in what you got this afternoon\nSo we just finished a news conference where we got an update from several authorities including the FBI as well as us attorney a window of his record the public safety director when they were able to confirm some details that we already believed uh and they were also able to offer a little bit more information\nOn first of all we have learned quite a bit more in the last couple of hours about this affected shooter a suspected shooter in Robert Bauer run six years old\nOr from Baldwin stand that he did have he was armed with an assault rifle and three hand the gardens right now it's unclear if you use all of those weapons that we still don't know what we do know that he was armed with the assault rifle and I felt rifle and three have gotten\nShe was shot and multiple times when he was engaged with police\nAnd was taken to a G H the Allegheny General Hospital a we understand that charges are pending against in there and then it could even see those charges filed today\nYeah yeah they and they are I heard in the ... they said that the they would be a very swift and severe which I thought was important to hear concern Iraq the charges against him yeah go ahead\nYeah swift and severe that's right that's how they described it and well they said that they don't know the sole motive here\nUh it's unclear whether he was targeting any one in particular or why that synagogue right why that temple yeah um but we do know that he had the anti Semitic postings on on his social media particularly understand on Twitter\nThat social media accounts have been taking down of course that's all part of the ongoing investigation authorities are also out at his house where no doubt I'm sure that they are as you know seizing computers and and any other literature that they might find that there\nI heard there was a question uh and it was answered saying that there were no I ... that they knew of president in his residence at this time\nThat's correct and they did a fleet of both his rights\nSaying that there were no I ... that they knew of president in his residence at this time\nThat's correct it and they did a fleet of both his residence as well as I said to God and they did not find anything like that and\nWe also got a bit of good news I guess if you're well out of this as we were able to confirm that none of the victims are children yeah and there was certainly some concern earlier today about that because he knew that day they had it for is that the traditional names are named ceremony there\nAnd ah thankfully none of the victims are our children\nYeah and and it was also I'm a good no to to hear that there will be a good police presence for the for the vigil that's going on tonight at Ford's Maria's six o'clock I thought that was good to hear a during that press conference as well as we look for some good news

examiner yeah we will probably know more than a doubt the cat ladies\nAre the ages of that was the victim the extent of their injury so tomorrow not only will still be fresh and everybody's mind that heart\nAs they go to church and they and they reflect upon this will also be getting more information and I'm sure that there will be burials very quickly yeah in this case and involving very conservative Jewish jokes so\nThose areas will happen quickly on and this is obviously very emotionally charged time for a lot of people\nDo you think that they will be releasing the names of the victims tonight or do you think that that will become tomorrow morning do you have any indication that\nThere won't be any more updates tonight from authorities okay I Believe that information will

support state and local police and conduct a full and thorough federal investigation this wicket act of mass murder is pure evil [noise]\nHard to believe\nAnd frankly something that is on imaginable our nation and the world are shocked and stunned by the grief\nThis was an anti Semitic act\nYou wouldn't think this would be possible in this day and age but we just don't seem to learn from the past our minds cannot comprehend the cruel hate and the twisted malice that good cause a person's ... such terrible violence during\nA baby naming ceremony this was a baby naming ceremony at a sacred house of worship [noise] on the holy day\nOf summer anti Semitism and the widespread persecution of Jews represents one of the ugliest and ... features of human history\nThe violin hate filled poison of

thinking of this our town\nUm uh it's not ... ... it is a squirrel hill but it's Pittsburg it is is western PA um it is is it is it's the Jewish nation\nA this mad man a lemon people killed this morning in a synagogue while the parade and you you you can't\nYou can't frame it any other way um there was no accident there was it was premeditated um and and there you have it and a are Fifteen and three weapons\nJust a terrible terrible thing forty eight year old man I'm\nAngry for a long time the police law enforcement had no a record of this guidance and no knowledge ah to law enforcement of this guy's\nExistence a and yet when you see some of the stuff that he has posted on some of these sites it's chilling to see that but that's what that's what he decided he was going to do\nOn this Saturday morning and so as a result of that eleven people have lost their lives if you are planning to go to this um candlelight ceremony I think it's going to be very touching I think it's going to be very\nVery beautiful and will be a very positive thing to come out of a very horrifying morning\nGo ahead and do that it's going to be at Ford's in Murray six o'clock tonight people are probably already gathering a and a police officials during a press conference that was held this uh this afternoon a little after four o'clock said that there will be increased police presence there so you will be safe\nUm so go if you can\nUh and if there are other ways that you want to\nUm remember those who have lost their lives today go ahead and do that the the the blood centers are are going to be a extending their hours tomorrow as well call and check if that's what you want to do they are saying they need blood I'm so go ahead and do that\nOr if that's if that's what you want to do and I say that not to not to just say you got to do this but at the times like this there are people are saying well what can I Do\nAnd ah there's that so keep that in mind uh Gary says\nMy sincere condolences for the victims and their family and friends tried to stay strong\nFaith for today hope for tomorrow and love for all day's going forward yes indeed yes indeed I'm ... and you know it's always when you have tragedies like this that the kind words come out and it's good to be able to share of them are coming up in the next half hour\nUh I I Would and I wouldn't be at all surprised about that\nUm what followed during the commotion\nOf the early morning I mean because the ten o'clock eleven o'clock people were still going to watch you know I mean it it took a while for the actual story to develop and as it happened so quickly that as the story developed\nIt was already winding down at the scene in squirrel hill for a while they didn't know if this was the only shooter a very scary for the people who've squirrel hill or anybody here in this town ... when you hear stuff like that and of course it becomes very scary when people start thinking about\nWhat can happen a for a copycat\nWho hear this kind of stuff and go oh okay maybe that's a sign for me and you hope not I'm governor wolf earlier this it was I think it was still this morning a said I'm leaving I'm coming out there I'll be there\nUh the mayor was they're built the judo or at the scene in squirrel hill [noise] and shortly thereafter Tom Wolfe's the ordered all commonwealth flags if you're driving out and you're seeing flags at half staff\nThat's by order the governor today are at all capital a commonwealth facilities throughout the state lowered to half staff were flags effective immediately that was earlier uh this morning\nA he said all commonwealth flags should be flown at half staff until further notice all Pennsylvanians are invited to um participate in this tribute to the victims who lost\nUntil further notice all Pennsylvanians are invited to um\nParticipate in this tribute to the victims\nWho lost their lives suddenly suddenly and seemingly for no other reason than\nTheir faith he had an A R Fifteen three handguns if there is any good news and this\nAnd there were no children in a no no no children who were victims um they checked out his apartment his home he's originally I guess originally from castle Shannon a and they check out his home no ah I eat these were present\nA and and and that's pretty much is the story the story now is contained a ... as far as the shooting of this morning goes the attack what's going to happen later tonight is that we're probably going to hear a from\nUm ... law enforcement perhaps tomorrow most likely tomorrow\nIt will be a litany of names of the victims of the people who died and that will be very sad to hear that on a Sunday um\nAnd it'll also be a U.S think something that a lot of people will be talking about\nA in church tomorrow whatever your faith is a and of course it will be occupying the news programs tomorrow Sunday or face the nation CBS all those all those shows uh will be there in no doubt they will be talking about this\nA poll Rasmussen is been in the newsroom all morning all all morning and all afternoon long a if a party in ... in the middle of the story right now you have\nNo I'm ready to go I have a new sound clips where you from the news conference that took place now more than Ninety minutes ago fleas and this is Bob Jones the FBI special agent he was a answering questions that they were fielding questions at this point in the news conference about the uh weapons that were involved\nI don't know the caliber is at this point if we think it was an assault rifle and we noticed suspects at at least three handcuffs on him at the time\nSo an assault rifle is in the mix three handguns and now it's a an explanation of how that ah Bowers the alleged gunman was captured\nAthlete was accepting far in the process of extra thing to synagogue when a Pittsburgh a uniformed officer engage them\nThat Pittsburgh officer was subsequently wounded [noise] ah it was true and it has he withdrew the defendants or the suspect went back into the synagogue in order to hide from swat officers who were moving towards the same\nAnd then the director of public safety for the city of Pittsburgh window historic was talking about uh the status of of the shooter\nI Will not get into whether or not he speaking with the authorities however my understanding of what she was transport as Allegheny general isn't fair condition with multiple gunshot wounds\nAnd again it's a Robert ... hours or the building of of the authorities had been looking at his apartment in the Baldwin area and this just in not too long ago a the Anti Defamation league stony has\nPut out a statement on this and they said that what happened in squirrel hill this morning is likely the deadliest attack on a Jewish community in us history oh my gosh uh there was one ah not too long ago a I think in twenty fourteen but this was their limited as far beyond that\nYou you mentioned um that he knew he was taken down\nTwenty four team but this was their limited as far beyond that yeah\nYou you mentioned um that he he was taken down by a uniform officer so this was not a swat policemen this was this was just this was a cop right\nIt's kind of sounds that way yeah what what ah how what the director of safety was saying so it could very well be that and and I don't know that he was injured or not he knew he was he among the injured or not I don't know that for a fact I Know that the first officer was injured that encountered Bowers is he was ... the synagogue\nYeah there were a couple officers one twenty seven one fifty three officers I think twenty seven oh one fifty five and another one that was that was younger than um than Dr done nearly as she said in the press conference but a pretty brave getting ...\nGetting back to a one on one of the thing on the on the ... even from the attorney general Jeff Sessions yeah uh he says that they do intend to file hate crimes and other charges or an understatement he said the killings were reprehensible and early repugnant to the values of this nation\nWhich of course echoes the earlier comments from the president who said shooters should receive the death penalty yeah and uh the U.S attorney in Pittsburgh said federal charges could be filed as you said as soon as Saturday a there is talk or\nIn this statement from sessions about a possible death penalty which I Would assume if they were to go\nWith a with a federal hate crime trial down and then that that would make a a a if a death penalty were a arrived at after a trial that would make a death penalty possible because he would be prosecuted under federal level rather than in Pennsylvania where we know we have a moratorium\nWell you talked about the ... desert have Defamation League or you know Benjamin Netanyahu early on um sent words heartbroken and appalled by the shooting which I thought was you know that that's worldwide he's that's from Benjamin Netanyahu\nCapital of other things that have popped up just as a side bars don't eat them tell you the how how this is reverberating around the country\nA police departments in several Phoenix, Arizona suburbs are stepping up visibility and controls around houses of worship happier are shooting here today well uh [noise]\nAnd let's see what were they doing in New York I was seeing something here earlier about what was going on in New York if I can find that real quickly here\nYes increased security at Jewish centers in New York City and elsewhere in the state in response to the shooting in Pittsburgh New York police are dispatching heavy weapons teams and squad cars to check on houses of worship across the city [noise]\nAndrew Cuomo the governor there are releasing a statement saying

there was one police officer who was brought here treated and released in the emergency room or a walked out of here so that's absolutely terrific news\nAnd then over at mercy hospital there is a twenty seven year old police officer who was shot in the hand and he has been in surgery this afternoon as they try to make sure that the full function of that hand is restored\nA I did ask the doctors if any of these people were at risk because they were shot in their extremities at risk of losing an arm or losing a leg and they said no not at this point that's obviously something they are very worried about when you're dealing with this kind of a situation and then of course the shooter is at Allegheny General Hospital\nOr we know that he was shot multiple times uh they believe all by the police said isn't fair condition\nAs we speak but that's pretty much the update on the ah the victims and the shooter a and it's going to be a long road for a couple of these people because of the extent and the nature of their injuries are but certainly we hope that that number eleven doesn't grow", "show_name": "Starkey and Mueller", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "27"}
