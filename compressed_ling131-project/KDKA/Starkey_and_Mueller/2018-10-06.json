know they just jump up about a number of high profile guests on this show Steve Forbes and like but what's ray\nDavis I'm certainly ... or ... you know a uniqueness what this humility and I started the show last week by asking him about that and he talked a little bit about his childhood being an orphanage just a young boy\nOr the work ethic installed in him by his mother to support from his wife and family I tell you um you got to spend some time a little bit uh with him even after the show\nAnd this man is truly the salt of there are a ... it really is and we also talked about our leadership style which is a southern leadership style that I certainly want to be\nAnd a wonderful question or listeners out of question on this so let me respond on the air but before I Do my apologies for not taking calls or responding to email ... on the air that forty five minutes or went so fast ladies and gentleman so many topics to cover what grade a business leadership philanthropy\nSo I'm In a here's a question from Chris hold\nAnd he's from the Pittsburgh area artists blacksmith association\nAnd as a email as our idea of technology is good call good ... good ... has a very different from the ladies and gentleman I I'm On the the high tech or a software business but then he goes on and says what good leadership results are age old\nRed five oh one C. with over three hundred members western PA would you please provide me the title\nAuthor of the book you have your managers read I miss known and get on your show thank you Chris hold\nA well Chris I'm the name of the book is called the ... by James Hunter the full name is ... the servant a simple story about the true essence of leadership\nSo a hope you enjoy the book this is a book that I buy every manager and my company the first week when they come in I give them the book they um you know I asked them to read it and then send me sort of two or three takeaways from this uh by end of the week\nAnd the one other thing um you know that ran I talked about is the integrity and this book as you'll see that's a cornerstone of uh of leadership and I told re when we were talking about attributes that to me it's not compromise simple for anyone and leadership and leadership is doing the right thing\nWhen no one's watching and when it costs you something you know any of us can ah you know I Can't say we have integrity when it's on our favor but how about when it's not\nAgain you know it it this is in your actions and it's not so much and what do you say it's in your actions and when you have to make an action that is the right thing and it costs you\nOr that demeans integrity and our gas our ... our guest today is uh you know for him to integrity comes first and this is the tagline at his company into others says on John says integrity comes first and always had had it\nAnd he says the John says the most valuable thing he learned from his dad whom he describes his humble and family oriented\nIs to always do what's right even when it hurts and I'm a and they won the Pittsburgh business ethics award and the small business category so he'll be up and a little bit with us and them and this is what he says well number dealing with customers are situations that involve money do what's right\nAnd they join us was also named one of the best places to work but the Pittsburgh business times John is the past president of the shady side chamber of commerce and has served on numerous boards in addition to his role as board chairman of joint chiefs of America\nJohn also serves on the Fox poll young life John was inducted into the national jewelers retail hall of fame in twenty Seventeen John welcome to the show John\nOh great to be here Roger thanks for having me\nIt's I'm so John you grew up in a in a family business for generations so distorted of what was that experience like\nWell it means ... I started working at age twelve [laughter] I came to the\nStore and I learned a vacuum and clean toilets and make bows and wrapped packages or and then continued to come here and do that in high school and then did some experience in college and the sales floor\nWow so so you sort of seeing the business I'm I'm I'm guessing soup to nuts every aspect of it growing growing up\nAbsolutely yeah and saw some of my dad toiling away at it every day\nYeah yeah so the business started in Eighteen eighty seven is that right\nYeah by my great grandfather\nGreat grandfather and looking at your website ICU another interesting fact there and it says the first official a Groundhog Day was celebrated that same year in ...\n[laughter] we trying to connect people to what was going out at the time I also believe it's the same year that the Pittsburgh Pirates or were founded\nAwesome awesome but uh but but the school for accounting and then became a certified public accounting so at that point where you I'm sure you're going to be in the business owners or something you want it to do\n[noise] you know I wasn't completely sure I thought it was likely but I wanted to try some other things and frankly in high school friend said you know accounting is a good field you could potentially end up in the big eight accounting firms at that time and that's where I ended up I went to KPMG\nAnd then they've been whittled down to the big four but it was great experience to have that exposure to accounting and finance that it's been really beneficial to the business\nNo absolutely are drawn and ... so you got to see like being you'll probably get cut on how companies use the financials to control\nAnd been three and you know sales and all up and so I'm sure that was a huge competitive advantage for you so you go back in the business and then you noticed that that oh you're the engagement rings run a very small percent like something like two percent\nSo what what your thoughts looking at that\n[noise] well it it corresponded with the fact that our sales manager at the time was also reading the obituary pages and checking out which customers of ours had died off [laughter] ...\nDoing much to replace them and as I spent some time with some of our regular customers I learned that they they came to us they developed a relationship with us was through the buying of it and ...\nSo it was my desire to rekindle those relationships and bring new people into a relationship with any jeweler so we started to really expand our engagement ring offering\nAnd where are you today no so you started at two percent is now ... percent grown significantly\n[noise] it has it's about thirty eight percent of ...\nIt's about thirty eight percent of our business now wow\nWow and John I was looking at your a Facebook page and then there was a there was a photo of some ladies has got a coffee cup there\nI guess after she'd drunk drank the coffee at the bottom and says will you marry me yeah [laughter] so so what I was going to ask you as well that sounds pretty crazy to me but I'm sure you heard\nCrazier than bad what what is the range of of stories you heard of engagements\nOh gosh there was one really good one that I heard recently it was an actually one of our customers but he had a his girlfriend up on the chair left and they were skiing and he pulled out or what she believed to be an engagement ring and it is it turned out it was a fake\nUh but he pulled it out and you know pretending to propose and then dropped it [laughter] that's a shame freaked out oh my gosh you know the ... and then he turned\nOut to pull out the ... and proposed there but we have certainly a help some of our customers plan some neat once we've had people propose right here in the jewelry store or as a surprise to her\nWow wow how exciting but you have something unique John and then you have this uh this approach to have and to hold\n... ... ... I I've never heard that before so so ... what led you to create this and then what does this mean for those who are listening you know or what does this mean to have a whole\n[noise] well I attended a a leadership cohort through the Pittsburgh leadership foundation\nAbout eleven years ago and we were developing our leadership skills in fact a past person on your show a re butler was part of my um my uh class okay and we really learn from each other to enhance our leadership skills and then at the end they said yeah okay now how can you apply this\nTo make a real difference\nIn your organization or your community that they call it a world changing goal and I thought oh my gosh what could a little retail jewelry store do that would be world changing and just at that same time I had a good friend of mine from college who I really looked up to and respected\nWho went through some real challenges in his marriage and ultimately the marriage failed and I thought is there any way that we can make a difference in couple's lives who are preparing for marriage because we end up in this unique opportunity to develop a relationship with them you really get to know them as they're going through the engagement ring process and so\nWe've taken it upon ourselves to uh find a book and we found a great book that we give to every couple of who walks in regardless of whether or not they Bahrain from us\nAnd the book is entitled the things I Wish I knew before I got married Britain McGarry Chapman he also wrote the five love languages\nAnd this book is just really easy practical advice I read it as I say I wish I had read at twelve years prior because I had already been married twelve years and we we also give financial incentives for people to do pre marriage counseling and if they do that we give them a special a coupon for a discount on their wedding dance\nSo hopefully that it just is preparing them a little bit more for actual the marriage relationship as opposed to just the wedding day\nYeah yeah I Know I and I haven't read the book or John and I I think my wife said and when I told her that uh\nYou know John ... I think I Want to tune in to the show today [laughter] so he's on the boat to agree um boom Gary Chapman\nSo so I'm a ... uh before I ask you some questions that people wanted me to ask you you know given that do you own a jewelry store is you know what is hanni do what do you specialize in in in and sharing with us you know ... ... what's different about you\n[noise] a great question\nGreat question you know I Would say certainly what's different about us is that people and I believe the experience that anybody would have here that we have a great team of people some of whom have been with us for fifty years uh and we really\nWe hire people who genuinely care about other people and a lot of other people so our desire is that they have a great experience and leave and say we want them to have the best service even if that means\nSending them somewhere else because they get better served there because we might not have exactly what they want\nBut we also we we really run the gamut and we have find watches Rolex is our number one brand were so pleased to have that we do engagement rings no wedding band we defined jewelry and all the way down to uh inexpensive gift items you can buy things for Seventy five dollars\nAnd we have three Goldsmith on staff that can custom design and create some of the things that I really enjoyed doing is when someone brings in a piece of jewelry that might have been in the family could have been their grandmothers\nAnd they you know I Love this sentimental but it's not exactly my style today and we can take that and rework at recreate it into something beautiful that they would enjoy wearing today and then lastly we do have a certified master watch maker here on the premises that can take care of the service of just about any watch neat\nWow I'm ... Hi I'm thinking this Goldsmith having Goldsmith that's become a rarity right now right John\n[noise] it is it's um I had to say it's a it's a dying art but ah the the traditional way of how people were trained in that field or doesn't happen is often through an apprenticeship uh but\nYou know we we really have found three great craftsman in fact one is semi retired he's extremely talented so we've worked out a way that he can still enjoy\nSome things that retirement has to offer but yet keep themself I'm engaged and busy and creating some beautiful things for us\nWow I'm so when when you know when Donald send out an email blasts we do announcing that your your coming on the show I got some questions you are so one of the questions was you know when people are ... you know looking for in a jewelry store\nSo generic question is how do they know what's the best value they're always there you know for me when I go into the store to store like this you know I'm I I I I don't know in fact I have no idea so generally where where do you how do people find things that would be you'd consider great value\n[laughter] that's a really good question one of my father's\nFriends used to always say if you don't know your jewels no you're jeweler\n[laughter]\nIs why we have you on the show John how you can tell us all we do [laughter] the children's ... now that is great\nBecause it really is difficult for someone who doesn't spend a lot of time or learning about jewelry to learn enough to be effective and really finding the best values so certainly you know do some research do some homework on the Internet that can be very helpful\nMhm [noise] yeah he's always taught us that we live by that he learned that from his father before him and along with that he said a family is most important business a second and if the challenges of navigating a family business\nA cause problems with the family then he would tell the business and he was sincere about that and so ah my sisters and I now got along beautifully I bet there were times it was difficult and we always knew that if we didn't work it out or he would sell the business\nInteresting interesting so let me ask you you know there's a lot of our listeners have family owned businesses a couple like sort of business kind of questions\nThe first question that comes to mind is control you know if you have three people in the business all having equal control is a very difficult thing to manage how did you navigate in in in how ... how what's the best practice here\nThat can be challenging what's most important is you've got to get everybody aligned in their values and where they want to take the business and fortunately we were able to do that and then we we always came to consensus which isn't necessarily easy\nBut you talk through things enough and you're\nYou care about the other person enough to work through to come to compromise and fortunately we were able to do that again it wasn't always easy and there were times that it was really challenging there were times you'd go home and you were upset about what had happened that day but he'd come back willing to work at it and and apply yourself to making it work and unfortunately we were able to do that\nAnd then in your case it looks like you're sort of like an accounting firm or a legal for him you were able to sort it looks like by out or your dad and mom and your siblings um and and uh in in in some sense that that gave you the control\nYes uh so my my parents did eventually pass on all of the shares to my two sisters and I we owned an equally and then through the family business agreement and some things that we encountered a I bought out on my sister Meg and I bought out our first sister Anne about uh\nEleven years ago and then um I bought an egg out about seven years ago\nVery amicably in I was a\nAgain there was challenging times but at the end uh we came away really integrate loving relationship we still ongoing family vacation together and it's really special to still have that relationship so important and still intact\nYeah and that also shows that the character of your family joined that's great you are able to do this the other comment question is if if you have a family on own business you know when people come to work\n... is there at least in my mind I think there's a perception hey you know my my chances of advancing is going to be limited because the family controls this so how do you attract and keep the best talent\nBut you know right now certainly the understanding that no one is likely going to end up owning the business and less family doesn't want to own it some day but we do have opportunity here we have a thirty people on staff I have a\nSales manager I have an operations manager we have people that have great responsibility so our desire is to attract a great people and let them grow through the organization\nAnd many of them you know one thing that I really talk about is that find something that you love and and do it well you should do something you enjoy sixty to eighty percent of the time and our team really does love what they do a so some of them are here and they've been in the sales floor\nThe sales position for forty five years and they just love it\nThat that's awesome that's awesome so what are some of the other I'm sort of challenges that you've seen in in you know sort of through your family's always are stories of a a you know in in a business has gone through four generations what kind of\nYou know challenges of your hat and and how long have you been ... you know how to address in the ... not just with you but just generationally\nWell certainly that the challenge was in the generational transfer between two generations and then within the generation between my sisters and I hadn't really relying on outside counsel was so beneficial and we used a family business councilor that active kind of as a quarterback\nOr and then we also used to our accountant in our attorney and the three of them\nOur advisors to us and we're able to speak into all of us our lives about ... what was best going forward based on their experience and it was really helpful particularly from my parents to hear from an outside or this is what we have seen and this is what we see to work best\nKnown that's great that's great ah ladies and gentlemen I'm you know I've known John for a while I've\nShopped with him um as in there and then you can hear from him integrity is important to him and his family um and be in India welcome you at the store so I I welcome all of you\nTo go uh you know visit historian shady side and also I heard him say I'd say ... dot com um I think we have about a thirty seconds so drawn so just so you know is there anything new that's coming out new and exciting you know for our listeners\nWell we're we're really prepared for Christmas which is our busiest time about twenty three percent of our sales occur in December so we have the most inventory we will have in the month of October [laughter] thought oh we have a lot of beautiful things to see and we look forward to seeing people in the store over the next three month\nOkay now that's a that's a great uh John hey wish you the very best you know you are oh you mean the fourth generation very successful very few families and very few individuals that can have the success and say they've lasted for generations John and we wish you the best and that many more generations to continue the business\nWell thank you Roger was a real pleasure talking to the same here daycare they give away [laughter]\nWell I'm Glad you enjoyed it but I think it's that had back in\nKilling I'm sure they'd be careful getting as a\nI'm

like they just didn't never given up hope my wife is always there during nine and we have in life\nTo live da de provides a lifetime of support helping veterans of every generation get the benefits they burn I Am a veteran but after I got out I spent two years alone in homes\nEvery year being the help of more than a million veterans so they can reach victories great and small\nFuture was finding the support to get back on my feet now I'm getting things right with my family and finally admitted\nMight be TST I wasn't doing well\nBut there's more to be done in more victories to the one\nNow I Wish I'd found ab sooner [noise]\nI'm a veteran [noise] my victory and just enjoying each day\nHelp support more victories for veterans go ta da di di org\nHa ha writing [noise] gosh a show [noise]\nWalking back ladies and gentlemen hope you enjoyed um uh you you know the the discussion but John ... um I tell you what I found was very interesting you know his uh his this one comment\nAnd a member there or is the fourth generation or to the company started a hundred and Thirty years ago and this is a business and he basically said his dad told them family comes first\nI tell you if you have that kind of a\nPhilosophy I can see why the businesses that survived so long um survive for generations that was one you talked about uh the humility aspect of it and then understanding that uh hey as things go on you know you only all of us have limited area of the areas of expertise\nSo like his dad went and got a family counselor I think that was fantastic that they're\nThat inside was available so that it was good to hear from John and very few I think the u._s. uh most generations or a family or a family business was or ... or Fort Fort generation in other countries UK and\nOther countries they may be more but uh but in the U.S for is pretty much the high water\nMark here um and I asked you this question prior to the break um you know why family owned businesses are so much more successful\nRight and and I shared with you a little bit about the report from Credit Suisse and uh they surveyed or nine hundred family owned farms and found that these firms made more money generated more cash and generally out perform better and the financial markets than than non family own account\nTo you and again ... their definition\nOf a family owned businesses as twenty percent but not just ownership but control\nOr like we talked with John you know he controls the business um because he was able to buy out his uh his two sisters so he's in control so in a large companies are twenty percent is a is a is a controlling boating share 'em and that's a a baseline of what they use for their analysis [noise]\n'em so those are some uh some important things that you could do 'em to make sure that the one final thing how close where his\nPhilanthropy um and that holds a lot of family businesses together and it keeps you don't believe me he'll do some stats eighty one percent of the world's largest family businesses practice um philosophy and they give charitable eat\n'em and and this allows the family to stay with the core values and ... and and help those who are not involved directly in the business to make meaningful contributions so they just hope you enjoy today show about family business and John Henry Ford generation so I'll leave you with the same question that he said he was still\nThink of a way you could you you'll work to create positive societal change so I'll leave you with\nAnd so I leave you with that what can you do how can you have your work or create positive societal change how great we talk to you again next week\nThe only way you can have a radio when he was a radio and listen to us anytime anywhere\nSaying hey I got to see

thing to do to let the wheels of democracy and justice move forward are you willing to put this behind you and to move on I think as a nation all of you need to learn a valuable lesson from this including me\nThat we need to find a better way to start to judge people as human beings as far as their faults and what they've been accused of\nAs far as being very quick to judge and sometimes we live in a country that we do that way too often and again\nA lot of senators said that they believed\nChristine Blasey Ford but on the other hand they didn't believe that it was Brett Kavanaugh who she was pointing the guilty finger at so my question is why can't we take a hard look at what happened here that really put us out on the edge\nAnd disrespected democracy the country that we call home or the Democratic process the Supreme Court a person's resume obviously once again that me too movement reared its ugly head and why can't we as a nation\nWe need your help to learn more Gutenberg and

On the mountain looking down\nAnd I see a sea of people in in that see I see my family look I'm about ready to saddle it up you know what I mean I mean I'm going to be sixty two in January my dad had been retired five years already\nBut I'll tell you this today is another indication and I would tell my children this if they were here today\nKeep hope alive and if this taught you anything hey be respectful to others as you were growing up in this world for the fear that it'll come back to haunt you someday she'll go the extra mile to be respectful but more importantly real\nBut more importantly to realize that through a throughout all democracies still rang out through and our president is still standing and he has said bring a victory Jay and I'm sure the president didn't want it to be this way but\nIt was that way so just may be we as a country learn something from this but sadly I'm so sad to say do I don't think we did and that's what really hurts me more than anything

done a God it is a guy that they get it now that they had\nAll right Rachel thank you for the call hey listen let me get through some of these right on I'm going to text messages if you're a Democrat Rob I'm an astronaut\nFunny I actually wanted to be an astronaut I used to watch I Dream of Jeannie all the time and I really want to barter eating to be my Jeanie but that didn't work out either so I decided to get in the radio and we now that's working out right ah also um as far as I'm concerned I don't care if he is in as a person of color they aren't for any of us Democrats or Republicans\nI have to respond to that female caller who claimed the Democrats said nothing about Supreme Court two thousand sixteen like the rest of the reality challenged Republican she forgot about merit Garland\n... you know and and listen\nYou think sending a text message making fun of my great college who have the courage to call in and speak their mind I'm going to even give you the time of day other than to say you need to get a reality check why don't you have the courage to call in as opposed to taking time to text message or send a message about a caller who may not\nIt was until six o'clock in the evening\nIt Rob I cannot believe you actually somebody call in and praise Ted Kennedy the lion of the Senate that's the same ... that let Mary Jo ... die in the back of his car at the bottom of that lake\nYou tell me what I can talk and then I'll talk\n[laughter] come that he actually say that if if Kennedy was on that board on the judicial committee ...\nNo no no no no no we were talking about\nWhat he was as far as his job as being a senator he was dedicated to the process of government we don't need to revisit his personal life because many people and I don't know your background you don't know my background we've all had moments\nAnd and I I look the guy has been dead for a while the family has suffered enough and as I said about a conscience don't think for one minute that Ted Kennedy that didn't really weigh heavy on his thought process his entire life up until his death\nI wouldn't be a bit surprised if he was not dying thinking about that suffering from cancer and wishing that he would have done something different but you don't want as a human being and someone who admired someone who was a patriot\nI think that we should just embrace what he did with his family has done and we we got to let it go but no he wasn't saying that that person meaning Ted Kennedy was actually a part of this process we were talking about it would've been interesting to hear what he would have had to say\nAll right let's go to I'm John in the north hills eight six six three down one ten twenty dollar bank and access get a get radio dot com John how you doing good afternoon\nHow are you I'm good oh\nI Want to comment on the gentleman I Believe it was from Vegas who made the comment by Tom Wolfe and the gas prices\nNo Tom core but he was talking about Tom Corbett er Tom Corbett ... ... ... it's a it's\nGreat that we've been paying these outrageous gas prices for wavy for Tom Corbett\nPast ten dollar thing for that\nSo again the people who keep bringing up the past I mean we can look at the past and learn from the past but at some point we need to move to the future how and and look at what is going on today\nI mean if you listen to the other hand there are still living in the seventies about how great the seventies where I'm forty eight years ago seriously\n...\nBy the way they're getting ready for the confirmation and and uh the swearing in but but uh I got to tell you this the president is going to hold a rally after the confirmation so already\nThe ball is rolling and you know for everyone who was reading all the Republicans often you know how it was going to be a bad mid term election for him I got I got to believe if you're a political pundit you're like oh I better start researching because game on again and I think tonight you know what I'm going to start swinging the other way\nIf people would take the time to listen to people they can make some better decisions credit Kavanaugh was\nNot the greatest choice possibly but you know he wants to choice let's live with it now and let's move on\nI mean that's what I Would rather say that I was more concerned about him not what he did in high school but what how is\nIs he he was in that all of a sudden these are not yet and some other things I was concerned about but that's who we got now let's live with them and let's support him and let's hope he does a great job\nHey John how about this and you know you said something that I should very early this morning when I first came on the air\nYou realize all of this mud slinging that took place it took us really away from the process of what it's supposed to be when you are seeing whether or not someone who's qualified\nTo sit on the highest court in the land and maybe if it would have went through its regular routine he might not have gotten chosen but because of this and this anger and one trick pony attitude of many Democrats will never know because guess what he is now a member of the Supreme Court and it will be officially assume\nYou know if they would have stuck to the facts\nAnd just let the process play itself out I think they might who knows what the results my event but no let's throw as much garbage up on on the walls and see what sex and hope that something sticks\nBut you see that's what listen and I and I don't mean to bring this up on this historic day but I have to end this is why I Hope somebody is listening to me and may move up put a little bug in the air Robert Mueller\nThis is what they're doing in that investigation just as they did here they just keep piling on piling on and they're hoping something takes flight as opposed to really putting a thought behind it and what you're doing you're wasting taxpayers' money and in the end\nYou get nothing but the president wins and I think it went with the Russian investigation to you don't want for all the Democrats who didn't want this guy to look good or to have that control in the house and Senate after the midterm elections\nWell because of that nasty attitude of digging and digging and digging\nWell you just may have put the shovel and his hand door he dug the Republican Party out of a whole as we get ready to cast our boat and if you haven't\nHad already answered a boat and get out and register to vote\nI'm not happy with everything Trump thoughts but I'm going to tell you what that's who's in charge let's let him work through the process and we have a ... a a process in place that well if it if they do their job instead of playing\nI got to go to a break I appreciate the call a ladies and gentlemen

it'll be a better world if the lights are on in neighborhoods and we have money to hire a police forces in fire departments and to pave our streets and they have good public schools and to pay teachers a livable wage and to be able to have places where they can go in worship and practice their faith\nBecause in this world that we live in\nIt is truly the small things that means so much and if you think about the building blocks in the foundation that we had growing up it was those little things that was the Sunday dinner it was the church service it was the warm bed to sleep and\nIt was your classmates going to the school that you were proud to call your school and it was the neighborhood that you walked around and just simply said\nYou know what life is pretty good right now and I do believe we have faith\nWe can make that same thing take place for these children and our grandchildren and for generations to come I'm Sorry I'm not going to look at this as a negative thing today

poor Jewish people had to go through from all walks of life it was happening all over the world and in the end some twelve twelve million were exterminated and I was in the\nBoardroom here watching the the big Comcast TV and I I started to get choked up and I said you know what it's tough as it is right now to be an American and it's tough it is to deal with these headlines in as tough as it is to talk about it on the radio as I have since five o'clock in the morning\nThere was somebody in this world who had it a whole lot worse than we did and a lot of them with a wonderful Jewish people during World War two and the Holocaust to where now generations later they still have to be connected to that horrible story so you know what I think we can get through this not taking anything away from it\nBut I think when you look at the big picture we can get through this\nAll day they chef JFK what happened in the next day we went on the way\nYeah I mean let's do\nWill go on all move on who
