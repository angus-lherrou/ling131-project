how to be a little you don't give you all that but meanwhile strong guys down excuse me he has the Democrats mailing bombs to themselves so I mean that's how powerful ...\nIs that where you are ... you're gonna you're gonna go with that just that they're mailing bombs to themselves as you put it\n[noise] yeah well because it's it's kinda dumb that these folks as all all of a sudden his own Democrats and no I'm is dumb that they would say that uh somehow\nThem doing this game favorite for them you know Hillary or just the other day that um they were desperate and they have to do something and two days later these bombs or melt you\n... how long we mess all\nThat's all right we have people calling earlier saying that uh that you have you know or the president saying he's a nationalist right now and uh that the next day these things started develop I Would assume that they've been developed a little bit earlier than overnight but you had an interesting point there\nAre and you knock I Want to get ... you know I\nI'm going to get to another call here momentarily because I'm really want to get people would I have these windows\nBut you made an interesting point you said that he's not a politician and he's accused of all that and yet he's got\nEither people eating out of his hands no matter what he says or for that matter he's got a major American political party on the heels\nAnd that that that's a big take away a that's a from the conversation at least for me uh but again as I said yesterday brother the only thing I got to say is that the the concept that the the the\nQuote unquote Democratic Party which again we're talking about the way to monolithic like would somehow get behind something like this at the risk of being exposed and destroying forever their party\nSeems to me not to be\nWorth the risk ... worth the reward\nIf you will a brother and you're not going to need to move on thank you so much I'd like to get the bill in beaver bill I'm

and this has been a wonderful environment to to meet people talk it's a it's a great place to do a show really for anything but this is a\nA been a good couple of days down here but you know the rules you start faster finished wrong so we'll be doing that\nAll the way to the top of the hour very interesting I'm now this is a New York post for what it's\nWorth but just to rolling through this during the break a destination into suspicious packages sent to democratic figures or this week is focusing on leads in Florida a federal law enforcement source said Thursday uh and uh that's just the bottom line uh there's some other clutter there\nBut that's that's what that a publication again for what it's worth as a tabloid is saying but they are suggesting it comes from a federal law enforcement\nSource it's always Florida unbelievable\nI mean you know typically we don't use it for grim things like this we use it for things that are well maybe grim but also comedic somewhere in the entire spectrum they do some freaky things in Florida whether I'll just go to Florida or not they do freaky things in Florida they've got some freaky people\nSending bombs to them or some innocent could possibly be killed\nUh yeah that you know the than than there is no room for that\nAnd even if even if you've made yourself a mark there's no room for that you know God Forbid I was thinking about this earlier dance about the idea that um [noise]\nFor\nYou know how much worse this could be of one of these bombs goes off vice starts to go into any type of scenario where I described maybe the background of the handler\nAh let's assume for a second that if people out there believe the Democrats are doing this and instead of ... and ... as we characterize it very broadly if that would be the case and one of these bombs went off and it was a Trump supporter who was injured or killed you know what would happen\nLook what happened at the baseball game I I really thought all heck was going to break loose after that baseball game and that\nGuy showed I shoot a lot of the Republicans and surprisingly didn't\nWell I think that you know cooler heads prevail because you know he was a one off but I mean you know this is the I mean where you could go another scenario I mean you know what happens if you know weren't dissipating that this is a dams doing this and in fact uh it's somebody that they break in the room and the guys got forty two thousand ... hats\nI mean you know the ... so I mean there's so many different scenarios I Will say this I'm a little surprised and I can't say disappointed doesn't media disappoints me every day that's why they just want him every day so I I Would just say this\nI'm stunned by\nThe number of people that I see on television that national programs that say we need to be cautious we don't know what's happening we don't know who's behind it we don't know the cause the mission the purpose by blah blah blah and then launch directly into the narrative\nThat this was all Trump or launch into the narrative ... this was all about the uh media I ... it it it's so disingenuous it's so ... intellectually shallow or that\nI don't have any room for that it's either or if it's it it it it might make boring radio it might make boring television but I'm Sorry you've got to do the right thing if you're going to hold your ground and say we need for this to play out before we have a much better way to approach it much more information than either you stick with that\nWhere you blow by it all together and you just enter into it you don't even pay any homage to the idea\nWell let me take that one step further that on you then let's say they do burst into a room and it is a person with forty thousand magazine apps and then what do you think they're going to do they're gonna they're gonna wait they're going to spend every our second and minute lambasting Trump and his supporters and that's how we ended up in this spot\nThere there'll be collateral damage and again we referenced day and I asked the guy earlier Dan and I got to run but I appreciate it because I've got a Bob I Believe and thanks and good call I I I Would say that um when we start talking about the day\nAnd I appreciate it because I've got a Bob I Believe and thanks and good call I I I Would say that um when we started talking about they\nCNN's is what you're saying okay MSNBC is probably what you're saying and and the other outlets that we need to be careful when we started talking about they as media as being monolithic Lee defined by a network or two we really really do\nI expected more from the president last night I thought a statement yesterday got pushback from people saying oh you know ah that that's disingenuous all but I didn't say that I gave hope for it I had a lot of hope for last night\nI really did I thought that you know that was the moment to say I want to acknowledge is a regret relative to the presidents I don't have any room for this ah yeah he said some things ... and you can pull out and probably put in front of me that\nThat that could counter what I'm saying but the reality is there was a full throated at I don't like CNN everybody knows that but that can't happen in the first person who says lock her up is getting thrown out I mean you know look\nIf you're old enough to remember Richard

and so that as a kind of thing that investigators are fairly early on especially with a case like this where they're working against the clock to make sure that nobody gets hurt I think and discover all of these different devices\nAnd we're also getting word in this afternoon and it was reported in Rose's newscasts earlier that the postal service and folks the facilities all over the country\nHave heightened alert status in order to intercept these packages let's talk about the security aspect of is with us right now on the disc Institute of Pittsburgh news not as Paul VI oh he's a CBS News security analysts he has been in New York county district attorney's office criminal court unit also security specialist supervisor under\nThe United states command and a space command and CEO of a Florida State police academy or Mr by all this work on the KKK radio ...\nThanks so much pleasure to be here at this stage in the investigation and now with\nA more packages ... how ...\nThat is is look at the different lanes that investigators are going to be in on one side you can have the cyber approach so you'll have\nA multi Jewish fictional agencies ranging from from ATF NYPD to local police departments or the FBI et cetera and they're going to be looking at any cyber communication social media website seven access et cetera to see if there's been any kind of traffic\nRelative to this particular event the reason why from a behavioral standpoint the individual that typically perpetrate acts like this has spoken about it even bragged about it so and went to use the social media that will be checked the second part is examination of of the composite of the ordinance itself\nHow is it made or they consistent does it look like we have one in multiple people and then from there the packaging is the packaging the same or is it similar is the print the saying these tape the same and he oils that saying anything that was a common ground to the device and packaging itself\nAnd then the last part is looking at this point of origin of the genesis of the package\nCan we in any way shape or form go\nBack to the beginning traced the beginning and see if there is hard evidence needs to be a closed circuit TV cameras if somebody actually mail this from a post office or was it placed at a street level inside a mail box that we can get a picture on\nWhere they driving the vehicle will be could run a play it on so all of these things right now forensic Lee are being done simultaneously\nThe question of how it was made what does it say to you that none of these devices exploded and we're not certain at this point as to whether or not although they may have that all the components to\nWhere they actually designed and built to explode\nAnd you know that is probably the most poignant questionable and the reason for that is because when we look at\nThe naked eye will look at these devices and they'll say they're blatantly crude there's really nothing sophisticated about that but yet they were distributed with the silver meticulously and their timing that it makes it really makes you step back for a second and I said this number of times last couple of days on airs that\nThirty eight years I've been doing this and say look at this I Want to caution myself not to start accepting what looks so obvious to me the fact that they were so crude the fact that none of them have detonated and we do know just based on some comments from law enforcement that\nSome did not appear that they could have been in some did to the question is where they made by someone that was so inexperienced they tried to put this together over the Internet but then was so physical who was so you know organization early organized\nThat they knew how to meticulously distribute them a doubt that this seems like this is going to come down to someone much more experience that's playing cat and you are in right now if law enforcement\nOkay because you would think that if you learn how to do this on line that you would have gone and tested it at least one or two times to make sure that it works the way that you wanted to write\nNo question about that and that's why and again another great question another great point the fact that these have not that NATO and we also have to understand from a behavioral side okay the individual that says things like this is looking for attention\nNow think of the amount of attention they're getting right now on radio and TV United States and abroad\nI mean I've spoken with either the networks from well over ten countries today and when we look at this look at the attention this guy sitting back and he's shaking his that that's why it's foreseeable as much as they don't want to say that it's foreseeable we are going to see more packages in the days when we sat\nAnd when it comes to more packages are you concerned at all because I Am that in our desire to reveal as much information as possible to the public\nAnd the days when we sat and when it comes to more packages are you concerned at all because I Am that in our desire to reveal as much information as possible to the public so that we can know are we revealing so much that we make it possible for ... a copy cats to do likewise\n... we have to be very very judicious in the manner in which we disseminate information which is why rescue short law enforcement is far more than what they're telling us and that is the way it should be\nUh the public does not have a need to know at this point ... or ... has covered this for ... what do we want to ensure that very reason we also don't want to let the individual or individuals that are responsible for these had particular packages understand if we're close\nSo for that reason I think it's a very safe assumption again almost forty years doing this that law enforcement state and federal and local no far more than they give it a split\nHow confident are you that this individual or individuals will be some\nExtremely confident but I Want to be very cautious and the fact that I Do not as opposed as many people have said today I Do not think this is going to happen tomorrow as much as we would all like to think that I don't think so this individual is not accurate\nAnd they meticulously sent out and think about this and different ordinances and they did not leave a blatant clue show I don't think at this point where this is going to be solved anytime soon I Do think we'll get there\nI Do think we'll get there and I'm very confident about that my hope is that and my prayers that none of these start to detonate\nPaul VI all at once again CBS new security analyst joining us some businesses for ... thank you very much for your time sir my pleasure let's

saying\nNo it is not by you know what I you know the one thing he has going for him that other at its it's that thirty four percent that is the solid nucleus of his supporters and he manages to choose

interest rate increases\nYou know I I I think that there is an issue I I was just listening to an interview with Alan Greenspan the former fed chair and he says well I never met a president who didn't want interest rates to be lower a book but I guess the key point is let's remember what the Fed's job is the ... job is not about the stock market the Fed's job\nIs to try to foster an economic environment where there's enough growth so there's lots of jobs I think they've done pretty well right if you think about it the unemployment rate is at a forty nine year low so hard to argue with that\nThey're also supposed to make sure things don't go too quickly so as to cause prices to go up or inflation\nAnd so far so good on that front\nI'm now balancing those too can be very difficult because when the fed looks at all the different data they say hey look that tax cut it did pump a lot of money in the economy the economy is growing regroup grew by four point two percent last quarter were probably grow by three and a quarter percent when that numbers released tomorrow morning\nYou know for all of twenty Eighteen that looks like growth will be a maybe about three percent total that would be the strongest year since two thousand five so the fed is kind of worried that they've got to stay out in front\nOf this inflation problem because trying to catch up can be very dangerous\nIf the economy is doing so great and ... are doing better and better and better what's wrong with having ... like China grows like six seven eight percent well\nYou know we don't get China growth anymore where we are a mature economy oh I'm so what that means is if you really look back even in the nineties I think the best we got to was five and that was during a massive technological revolution so I I really think that\nYou know we have been in a growth mode where GDP a let's let's call it let's say before the before the recession hit we were sort of like a three to\nThree and a quarter three and a half percent GDP country than the recession hit it was awful and then in those post recession years we were two ... two and a quarter now would come in at three again we're getting back towards normal so you see that we're not that far off from where we\nWere okay budget deficit so they're playing a role in this little now not now nobody cares about them or you know no matter later but not no\nYeah and you know like you'll you know leaving you only care to the extent that the bond market cares remember them on market so much bigger than the stock market and when the bond market cares it's going to care\nBecause there is going to be this anxiety that some have carrying these deficits is going to start springs some actions um and interest rates rise and that would then maybe be inflationary and all these things kind of work together but\nToday no one's worried about a budget deficit\nWho do you give more credit to the economy I realize this was a difficult thing that has yet to the fed and regardless of who's president ... to the president and Congress who do you think it plays a major more ...\nYes yeah to the ... and regardless of who's president ... to the president and Congress who do you think it plays a major more major role\nUm [noise] I got to tell you something is funny or like ... when when you really think about that it probably neither I mean the fed will be more important but economic cycles moving huge\nLink the year long years along\nCycle so it's hard to say one or the other but I Would really say the economy sort of as more of a sad thing and and I innovation thanks so obviously in the nineties only a technological innovation that was a real innovation I Can't say that and I mean\nOkay and what one last thing before I let you go through a second can we continue to have an economy that's growing with the market shrinking\nYes how about that\nOh God yeah we'll talk more about it next week alright hosts lessons are joining us from New
