they're\nOkay what what what ... what\nExplains to you or how do you understand that they would then have a second visit with other cities like Miami in Chicago\nThat's a great question the Miami site in particular I happen to be very familiar with that site it's innovation district\nIn Miami and that is really the epicenter of so much growth right now I mean I literally can't walk down the street or anywhere near the innovation Centre without\nA hearing got the sound of you know construction activity there's a lot of moving parts related to that site Mariette is building a major new hotel or near that disability a\nFollow a visit to such a active a place\nLike like the innovation center a innovation district in Miami I think it's just could be part of due diligence executives want to see how far along other construction activity is coming they want to get a second look at some traffic activity and as far as Chicago the winking yards looks like the front runner site\nAnd just anecdotally I mean I can tell you that during Amazon's first visit to the Lincoln yard site there whereas all sorts of reports about uh graffiti being removed and a shootings or and and those environs or maybe a second visit\nTo a such a potential legal contentious site like Lincoln yards could also make make some sense\nAccording to mayor ... in the ... that he says here there hasn't been any contact with Amazon nor has there been any requests by Amazon to meet with any city officials\nAre ... it seems as though not even any type of follow up questions that need to be asked or they wouldn't want to ask\nThat just seems somewhat odd to me\nRight you you know obviously you like to get some more positive indicators he liked that you're about ... between Amazon officials and and the mayor's office you know but again this is the company that has a wealth of information at his disposal\nMhm uh it it it is possible\nTo have all the information that they need they're waiting for some other factors\nThat play out and Pittsburgh is not alone if you talk to officials in Raleigh are or many of the other markets and the and the ... twenty of finalists you you'll hear a similar narrative\nA lotta people are scratching their heads that leads to this idea of you know this should Amazon to a better job of of this community servicing\nAnd you know just engaging with these twenty markets\nIf for no other reason do allow some of these you know prize real estate assets to be marketed full throttle to other potential uh companies\nAnd what's really disturbing is that if you really make a\nFool investment into this and you're one of the twenty cities that are the finalists\nOr you may be holding up on other projects that are showing an interest in some of properties\nAnd delaying development you otherwise would be getting an odds are only one city I mean it's the ... the reality is only one said he's going to get the development with Amazon the other nine teams that have put their entire lives on hold for upwards of a year now\nWhen you get to development with Amazon the other nine teams that have put their entire lives on hold for upwards of a year now\nThat's a great point I mean some of our nation's most prized commercial real estate assets or let the late ... yards ... district in Miami whether that be Suffolk Downs in Boston ah ours are sitting idle right now and waiting to see what Amazon does\nA lot of companies are taking a wait and see approach companies considering expansions and re locations in these twenty cities are taking a wait and see approach to see where Amazon goes because they don't necessarily want to get peed with fifty thousand highly paid Amazon\nOr employees and that's going to create some HR demands\nI expect after each to that to be announced you're going to see a plethora of new activities new expansions new announcements on relocation in these twenty cities uh and I think a lot of folks are waiting to see what Amazon duster\nDrummed what do you think of the process going through this idea of starting off with all of these cities and then ... it down to twenty and they're making this big deal about an announcement it's going to come is this a new way of businesses looking for opportunities to set up new operations in different places\nFew few companies have the wherewithal the swagger pull off a site search like this the first time we saw anything like this was back in the late eighties within the Saturn plant we had you had\nGovernors of southern states going on the Phil Donahue show to make a case for their states ultimately that facility went to Tennessee and have seen you know the the jihad quarter relocation from Connecticut to Boston a couple of years ago garnered a now a lot of national attention\nBut look a lot of savvy companies fortune five hundred companies that are named brand companies are now wise to utilize the twenty four hour news cycle the business media news cycle and you know use the headquarter relocation to kind of reposition their brand and said you know promote themselves\nThink one of the exciting issues here and one of these new site selection narratives mhm this idea of social impact okay and companies want it to you know incorporate you know just business practices and to their site selection decisions\nAlready for one more thing before I let you go I Want you to be honest with us now we may spend the night eating a gallon of chocolate ice cream you give us the answer we don't want to hear but ... ... give us the the top three cities in your estimation for this choice\nI I still think that northern Virginia the or the D.C environs\nAre ... are probably the the leading front runner you're given Amazon's large presence that market uh I think South Florida is emerging as a major contender\nI also think Newark New Jersey I've been hearing a lot of buzz about Newark in recent weeks associated with this idea of social impact and Amazon's desire to increase goodwill among lawmakers\nGiven potential anti trust issues and of course operating in industries like multimedia and healthcare which are highly regulated\nNow it looks as

[noise]\nThose concerns Jimmy narrative joining us right down from ... to to Pittsburgh new Zion Jamie what's going on\n[noise] well it's it's kind of a retesting of convictions and this this happens every once in a while we're seeing it now we had we had something like this in January and the markets have been rallying we talk a few months ago weeks ago about some of the longest expansion trends that we've seen in the history of the markets and\nAnd now people are saying well old geezer are estimates right are are are guesses as tomorrow right and we've seen some Mrs from some key companies uh yesterday we saw some big name a big named caterpillar three am or some more surprises today\nAnd uh and that causes the markets to pause it causes people to say well arm or my growth projections a little too optimistic a or my expectations are a little too optimistic\nDoesn't mean things aren't going well doesn't mean things are reversing and the economy is about the collapse but I think it's uh it it it's really a again pushing back on some of those convictions and obviously from the markets falling there's not a whole lot of people convinced that the prices were where they should have been\nOkay what about interest rates do you anticipate there is still going to go up one more time and the comments that have been made by the president regarding the chairman\nOf the Federal Reserve is that playing a role in all in all of this\nI think to a minor extent the markets certainly watch what the fed does a lot more than the fed watches what the markets do the feds more interested in and making sure of it in a inflation doesn't get out of control the fed is more interested in and maintaining full employment\nAnd the markets are are are just one small piece of data but the but what would move the fed more would be\nOne small piece of data but the but what would move the fed more would be we we had a housing missed today a housing numbers came in worse than expected\nThat could be a sign that the fed may be tightening up too much and then tightening maybe over but if the opposite happened if we saw house prices jump then the fed would continue or you know that would be more evidence for the fed the inflation might be on its way\nAnd the feds tightening ah so you know a ... again the interest rates are very very important when it comes to a corporate profits if you think about it the fewer people were buying houses fewer people are buying cars because it's more expensive to finance those things\nAnd in that does indicate that potential slowdown going forward so the market does watch that very very closely\nJimmy Meredith with us from the ... and can we continue to expect the economy doing well if the markets not\nYes there are plenty of times when the markets have a deviated from the economy good and bad so\nUh the markets are are a bit of a I I kind of tell folks that it it's more of a barometer\nThan a temperature gauge and the ... measure pressure which is indirectly related to weather but it's not very accurate so the markets are are okay a measure of the economy but by no means are they an accurate measure of the economy because you've got a lot of emotions and\nNow we've got robots that are devoid of emotions but they follow programs but you still have a lot of folks looking at these um these changes and and going on the Internet and making changes in their four one K. is and not realizing that's causing things to sell and re by and\nSo there's a lot of water churning here [noise] um but the ... the underlying fundamentals still remain fairly robust\nDo you see anything stabilizing once we get past the midterms\nI think so historically speaking if you go back over the last ... years almost a mid term elections are a destabilizing uncertainty for the markets and certainly this was a big one or the or the ... ah Republicans going to keep the house or if you're going to lose the house for the implications of that\nAnd that creates a lot of uncertainty in the markets I don't think that's what's causing this volatility now but in general the markets do heads that\nAnd the markets will take a bad outcome over an uncertain outcome so are the markets or you know everybody has their own guesses and wants as to who controls Congress but the markets don't necessarily care about they they just want that to be over and once they know who's going to control Congress\nThen they'll be able to make decisions based on that new information\nReports this afternoon with where the Dow is now it's now the editor neutral points towards started the year would you be surprised at the Dow finished down for the entire year over the course of the next two\nAnd a half months honestly I Would be you know we're not allowed to give a projections or production so this isn't one but the economic data a really supports that the economy right now is much stronger than it was last year and last year we had a banner year in the market and\nThen some of that or some of those gains war kind of paying it forward the some of the some of the gains of twenty Seventeen reflected the the good news of twenty Eighteen\nI still think there's a there's a whole lot of good things going on the twenty eighth team that would support the positive market\nAnd when it comes to geopolitics wood working a deal out with China on trade ... much of this\nYes that's a big part of it and when you see the global name such as caterpillar mentioning that they may be at peak profits and mentioning the tariffs are a big part\nThat's a big part of it and when you see the global names such as caterpillar mentioning that they may be a big profits and mentioning the tariffs are a big part of it is\nCertainly resolution of the terrorists would would bring a lot of relief to the markets\nAnd you know again with those fundamentals of look beyond some of the big names that had Mrs in general a earnings are up again in double digits except for those you know apart from the some of those key names there's really really strong earnings going on that aren't making the headlines but these key names are barometer for the markets\nBut if if we are able to ride resolution with with China and come to some agreement that that would certainly allow or a stabilizing force a foundation for the markets to to look beyond that and again\nThat's uncertainty once they know the outcome of able to focus on I I think some of this really really good stuff that's still in the economy\nAnd what course when the markets are down there is always a buying off right
