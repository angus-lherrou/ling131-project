that's something I I'd like to ... to flush out a bit here here's why\nYou run a little bit of this in your mind what what I Do ... ... obviously I'm not a police officer maybe you thought about that maybe aren't police officer\nBut if you're a police officer you're in a different place you vote you know what you signed up for you you you know what ... what could happen and what you could face everyday God Bless you God Bless you\n\nAnd so it's really really hard to say I don't have that button I don't have that place I don't have that acceptance of facing that every day so it's just nothing more than what what I Do as a civilian\nAnd you you examine that\nBut whether it'd be the officers whether it be all the different EMS cruise\nOr it'd be the surgeons that are called in because when that happens when when this happens\nI mean that's really one on one everybody's on everybody comes in and it's almost well I mean it's just that it's expected\nAnd then they face the worst of the worse than they do what they can do\nAnd I have no connection to that none\nBut I I Do have this one small matter my my father God rest his soul is a funeral director is you know\nAnd he was a brilliant man and he had any number of opportunities to use a brilliant mind in areas totally different than being a funeral director and I was asked him\nHow did this whole thing happen\nAnd you characterize it as a calling\n\nNow I suspect that there are a lot of people who I suspect there are there are some people who do it for ego for money I'm particularly you know I'm going to say medical just is a great\n\nYou know prestige what have you but I have to imagine that you have decided to be a trauma surgeon seeing the worst of the worst for reasons that are beyond that more important than that\nPolice officers\nI have to believe whether they're they come out of the military in this an extension that there can be other reasons why\nPolice officers I have to believe when they're they come out of the military and that's an extension of there can be other reasons why they have the makeup and the interest and the passion\nTo run toward the evil even if they in fact are not equipped if you will\nFor that exact moment to be prepared\n\nUnlike you swat guys not to minimize at all but obviously they're they're they're they're brought in as a little bit different time and they are more prepared\n\nBut the guy who's driving around squirrel hill on Saturday morning and the woman driving around squirrel hill on Saturday morning who hears this and goes right to it and then goes right into or toward\n\nThe tree of life encounter somebody gets in a gunfight with them as he's trying to leave ultimately\nThat's different man that's a whole different place that has to be a calling\nI just want\nTo underscore what some of you said earlier should officers be or EMS people are ... that entire category we now call first responders to know the appreciation we have\nThat could have degraded into something even more horrific God Forbid\n\nBoth at the site in an emergency room\nYou're more in Pennsylvania Welcome to the show\nHey Alice I'm like yeah you got your hands

the past it was kind of helpful for me and I'm going to go back to it or is that I went and I learned the names in the proper pronunciation of extermination camp uh there were\nThere were a lot of concentration camps which are some that were specifically a set up for the extermination of the Jewish people and uh I think it would be good for\nPeople to look into that and uh you can get the proper pronunciation on online and look up a little bit about uh you know I mean the numbers are mind boggling\nYeah very ... and that I mean not just from a historical perspective be familiar with it

strong mayor with very strong values are very strong county executive the rich get sterile we have people who stand by as to believe in value not just Jewish values but but we even values and those are not the values that that the president and I do not welcome him to Pittsburgh\nAnd my question for you is is now the right time obviously there are people who want the president to come to welcome him coming and then there are still others that I did so in one way or or the other um and then people like ... say absolutely not\nTalking about what to do to bring a higher level of security do we need to do anything\nTo accomplish that and I'm Wondering as an expert in the field spending decades in the in the issue of security and law enforcement\nWhat recommendations where you would you give where do you stand on this idea of like the president suggested what we need our armed guards at the doors of synagogues and churches all over\n... you know what Robert ... a great question um I think the biggest thing is and this and that that you know the president's comment and I think it's shared this view before I'm really don't think as much as they don't come and politically I don't think that was appropriate\nJust based on the sheer fact that you can't put anything on the good people synagogue David a victim to shoot it you know this guy was on him not that I'm reference evaluating what's going on right now we see this robber we've seen this before\nRelatives to shooting to South Carolina shootings in Texas at at houses of worship and this horrific event right now\nI'm the answer that that I counsel clients on and I share with the listeners and viewers around the country is that it really depends on two things one\nThe validated risk that focused on your particular religion and chew more specifically your house of worship show typically the delete the leaders of that\nYou were on with me between one and three but I Want to talk about this again for people who may not have been able to hear that conversation this idea of see something say something what are we looking for and who do we tell it to\n[noise] great well you know as government we have not done a good job for our citizens into communities around the United states and just finding what is something so to kind of drove down on on a little bit when we talk about social media it's the same thing as maybe ... hearing the conversation at work\nOr or at a social environment we grapple with All right so I heard this but you know shouldn't really report that and what's really not good the gut feeling is what I tell people all the time we know that there's a statement Robert if you and I are talking at a particular let's say we're at a ballgame and for talking you make the state like oh I could just stay with that guy\nYou know you don't mean that you're going to strangle that guy that said in that vein but now when you have somebody that has that kind of narcissistic driven statement that's repeated the talking about an obsession focused on one particular group or person does that something\nThat needs to report it in addition to that\nEveryone that listening if you know somebody and their behaviors are changing drastically your appearance is changing their ideologies are changing the manner in which they communicate is changing these are all the things that you need to piece together to say if I'm seeing these things this is something I Need to report\nYeah but Paul they're generally a good person I mean I ... and getting them in trouble with the law and arrested and a criminal record maybe or just the whole idea of the rest of the first place and going through all of that they probably aren't going to do anything this severe in the first place I mean this is what the kind of thinking we go for isn't it\n... ... you're right you're right it is and I'll give you a perfect example um when we covered the shooting at the pulse nightclub in Orlando and we drill down on the shooter here's a guy that was a license security officer for a promise security company\nHe'd been background check he was a very close in his community with a number of different people\nBut his appearance started changing when he came back from overseas and then his ideologies chain and the manner in which he would speak to peel it changed any isolated himself\nThose are the types of things when you start to see them cumulatively those are the things that should send up the red flag and even though here's the caution flat even know where we left it is certainly the shepherd Asian of really should I get involved the question is are you okay with not getting about\n... whether it sees as security analyst with CBS News helped me out with this bar 'cause I've talked about this with a number of different people the investigation is ongoing into this case I understand the crime scene may not open up for upwards of a week\nWe have the man he had the guns he was in the place we know what is why is there still this ongoing investigation that could take up the words of a week at least\nWell because right now with the police are doing and credit to you know Allegheny county and Pittsburgh TV as well as Pennsylvania state police\nThey absolutely must be overly meticulous because they're playing the clock right now they have to meet and and coincide with what the district attorney's office the prosecutor's office who's going to require\nIn order to bring this ... this this case to court now we look at it from the general public only save just what you just said it's the guy we know what's the guy there was nobody else but in a court of law it's entirely different now the whole face in this case is going to change and police absolutely\nWhat's the guy there was nobody else but in a court of law entirely different now the whole face it this case is going to change and police absolutely must\nBe meticulous with respect to what is collected how it was elected to ensure that crime scene is not contaminated\nSo that the defense counsel and that defense team and believe me when I tell you there will be a well publicized defense team for this individual mhm they're going to look for every possibility every technicality to kick out evidence and refused this particular case\nOne at a white police credit for that Robert Mueller taking their time\nOne last question before I let you go if posted a lot of violence things on a social media site not your typical one like Facebook and Twitter\nWas in my understanding is that law enforcement does not have the ability to monitor these sites looking for comments like this at this point why is that and how does it change do you have the answer to that\nI Do still get the one that we're talking about was designed to be sort of like a ... Twitter without filter\nSo it attracts um gang members but predominantly it attracts that ultra right side of the aisle that neo Nazi group the individual just like this that people like him\nThe the frightening part is that it's growing dramatically so it it's got to a decent level of security to it in order to how it is for making this protective how they transmit it now they become actual members\nAnd but at the same token that the numbers the sheer numbers of the people that are participating in it is growing rapidly so police don't really have the ability to dive into that like they wouldn't incite any other ... and now without filter\nReally they don't have the ability to put eyes on it to see whether or not there there are people out there needs to be concerned with preemptively\nJoining us once again CBS new security analyst on the disc Institute of Pittsburgh news on\nAlways pleasure uptake let's get traffic on the size of our vows her niece on something when south on top of the hill here Scott\nNow earn ... found side of twenty from um\nAn event sprinted towards the thirty first Street Bridge and then you know some ... again from the shallower on and work something behind one part branch out by Mark Twain only begin at the ... the allies boulevard in the allies offering backing onto the parkway saw it on on the forefront of orange between Oakland and Second Avenue you're crossing over and that can afford to Cambridge\nAlbum park where and when it's heavy before green tree out towards Carnegie inbound flown on starting to get heavy term Robinson and then again from the ... center overpass as your head from ... tunnels our next report at three fifty five from the ... theory and senior care network traffic center I'm ...\nAnd the forecast for you from accuweather for the rest of the afternoon breeze eat chili she breaks is on tonight partly cloudy skies low thirty six tomorrow clouds and son more mild high fifty seven\nFrom the Weiner bonuses for theft 'cause that was so who's going to be the browns coach the rest of the season for huge accident was fired today we do do it won't be taught Haley\nBecause a short time after Jackson was bounced Haley was shown the door is offensive coordinator Gregg Williams the team's defensive coordinator reportedly is the favorite to replace Jackson\nThe browns will hold a news conference in a little less than an hour these moves come less than twenty four hours after the Steelers did it I'm Around Cleveland had Heinz Field dropping the browns record it to five and won the Steelers will play a forum for Baltimore on Sunday cornerback Mike Helton\nAre we starting to find out reading you know uh the last couple of weeks was laying well defensively you know especially in like even though they're supposed to play as was how is this a lot of how last season so we tone it down and you know\nBelieves in his land well defensively you know fishing nagging baseball players which causes a lot of ... the so we tone it down or you know where that we know\nAbout it I'd football it's the patriots and bills beginning ... spent Panthers friday they will play a coastal division waiting Virginia what first place on the line or do she said today the defense of I'd ...

community the Muslim cuter feuding but um it's just not the case here in Pittsburgh it's not the case from the country as you can see nationally and internationally must come together to support you know like we're against injustice work and some tolerance for or against this hatred I'm no matter what and\nUm these are brothers and sisters are family members we do anything for them and it's really upsetting to see what happened and it's it's heartbreaking to us\nYou know just like their family so we acted accordingly and I hope that any Jewish brothers and sisters who felt\nThat the

right now I'm that stepped up\nYou know despite what people may think and and all of that um we just proved um through this fundraiser that there's no division between our communities that we really are brothers and sisters and um it shocked a lot of us but in in the best way you know like I'm this is such a horrible surprised\nOr what happened over this past weekend to have a a nice one it was a

we just contributed we just really like to thank you all for representing us properly you know and and in and sharing and and to keep it up to like like I mentioned yesterday like\nIt's not over you know raising a bunch of money getting to a high number is great but that doesn't mean that our work is done we have to stay engaged with the community we're going to show up to synagogues or all across Pittsburgh on friday we're gonna have meeting with clergy on Saturday to figure out\nHow can we sustain this solidarity how can needs to stay in this unity to turn it to something that's better and I have full time filled with like um devices political rhetoric and all these other things like how do we come together more eyes Pittsburgh we are going to have that conversation and they encouraged us to keep that up you know 'cause that's what the Muslim community does\nOne of the things that's beautiful and saying this is that it seems as though it's also quintessential\nPittsburgh

across we know\nPeople are going to look back on this day and be upset even when the press dies down in the media dies down ... members of the community members of the family are going to be really upset thinking about it we want them to look back on this\nThey're going to remember the tragedy but we want them to be reminded of this hopefulness\nTo thousands of people coming together to support them hundreds of thousands of dollars to close to a million dollars at the end is going to be raised to support them from fundraisers across the country we want them to think of that more so you know and um be lifted you know when they're at that dark moment thinking about some horrible tragedy that they can be lifted up\nAnything we can do to make that happen and we know money's not going to fix it or there's nothing we can do to fix what had happened we can't make it better but we can help a little bit and if that makes them hopeful if they're surprised at the Muslim community it was the first\nOnes to step us you know um is it leads to a little bit more hope that's what we want that's what we need we wanted to give that lost the Mohammed once again executive director for the Islamic
