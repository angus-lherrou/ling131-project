going out now and sharing that method and inviting people to have the same sort of recovery story as he found\nAnd so this documentary shadows what he's done but it also um tells the story of a woman who lost her sister to an overdose and how it impacted her family and so really what our goal was in creating a documentary was to raise the level of discussion about overdose an addiction and homelessness because\nRight now with the opioid epidemic happening across the nation it's impacting every single person one way or another and so let's talk about it let's have a conversation and let's try to figure out a way to come together to help make a positive impact on this problem\nI Want to go back to the issue of their homelessness are we seeing the people who are homeless are turning to opiates or people who have turned opiates finding themselves homeless\n[noise] yeah I think there's a lot of reasons for homelessness um you know lead a life that around working with the homeless since Nineteen fifty two and so we do the a variety of reasons for homelessness\nUm but one of the things that this documentary I think helped me the a little bit more is that sometimes people who may have never found themselves in a situation to become homeless\nOnce they become addicted are now I'm finding themselves in situations of living and homeless camps or not having a place to sleep\nIn a place to sleep because of the addiction\nIt's absolutely tragic what it's doing to people long before it takes their lives or what is going to individuals what it's doing to their relationships with their family as\nThe continual emotional trauma that love ones go through as they're worried about the one who is addicted to opioids and we've talked about this countless times and this is not a problem that you can go back and say ... their issue here it's all of our issue\nIt is we're all human and so this is a human issue and we are responsible for caring about the individuals who are addicted and and caring for their families like you said it's it's really tearing up families to see their loved ones and I mean this is addiction across the board of opioid addiction really has\nIt's just terrible you know the things that they're laced with and just the the effect of an opioid addiction in particular but all addiction really mom has such an impact on families and so we want to be able to\nHave the conversations to make it safe to talk about so that there's not a shame associated with it so that we can be open and really have a way to support our fellow human beings\nDo words words who from Lloyd of life will moderate this panel discussion uh once the screening of ... of the needle is made it all happened at seven thirty this evening [noise] no I don't want you to to divulge any information that would be confidential but I'm Wondering\nAre you encountering people\nBut it's surprising to hear of their background because we can do you need to hear that people who are dealing with his opiate crisis than this addiction\nThe way that it has impacted people of all walks of life all education's all income levels\nUm all ZIP codes regardless of prosperity have you witnessed people at light of life that without this issue of the drug addiction problem would have never been through your doors\nYet you know though that's been concepts in my time here at light of life I've been here seven years and um\nEvery person story is individual and unique an addiction that does not discriminate and so I'm throughout my entire time not just with opioid addiction but just dealing with addiction and homelessness in general\nUm I have come across people from every background um suburbs city you know college educated doctor degrees or GED or no education you know it's been the whole gamut the whole time so addiction is just catch it that way\nIt can you guys are on the front lines of this when it comes to dealing with people and I I Know the Pittsburgh is a very passionate caring community and the heartstrings get ... and we want to do what we can to help\nHow can people who are listening me right now ... along with coming out to the showing tonight and being a part of the panel discussion but if they want to help you help the people who are dealing with hobo system for whatever the reason is how can they do then\nThere's many ways to get involved in helping lead of life um financially as you can make a donation that money goes toward helping people who are homeless oftentimes because I'm an addiction\nI'm volunteering getting involved in serving meals to form relationships that the people that come through our doors so you can get to know them and see them for yourself then recognize that people are people\nUm even just like like you said coming to the panel discussion tonight or just going down to the I'm you this week to see the art installation which was an out that of the documentary where it recreate some of the homeless camps that we went through it\nIt ... it tells the story and get the experience and I'm Out I had three way of what it was like ... to the people who are struggling with addiction at home is\nJust that that you can have more of an experience first hand so that um you can maybe feel more comfortable talking about it yourself with people and supporting those in your life who either

Mexico and Canada as well right right\nOh they have a little more flexibility hum I'm both in both Canada and Mexico to get it done now the reason to get it done by November thirtieth which is when they expect to sign it\nUm is because on December one the new Mexican president comes and and and he has said he's in agreement with it but why not get it done before then so that's why this eleventh hour negotiation last night and the idea that Canada either had to sign or let the United states just go with Mexico alone\nAnd and the president making a reference that he thinks that there's going to be some trouble and Congress regarding this is for nothing else just political points\nRight I mean he said when you move submitted to Congress I'm sure that I like it but of course if you submit anything to Congress such trouble and I'm usually trade agreements do create trouble I mean when I was there in ...\nNineteen Ninety four twenty four years ago as a young a congressional staffer as this after after western hemisphere\nWhen NAFTA was passed and it was the first time in the history of the U.S Congress as post office that it had to close so many documents were coming in every group had their their thing that they wanted in it and including dolphins in the protected in protection of dolphins tuna everybody and\nThat will happen this time however you are you already heard from Senator Schumer sang it was a it's a good deal and he likes it because it protects I'm American farmers are protects American automakers Ford Motor company already said it was a great idea\nI think in the U.S got a lot out of it and it's it had to be updated so I mean it did it have to have a new name know and his name that doesn't really flow over your mouth but it's the um am us MCA yes\nWomen they can make a song out of it [laughter] you know it should be called Marga mad guy ... like ... free trade agreement [laughter]\nAll right let's talk about cars for a moment it seems as though one of the big issues here in order to get this zero tariffs Seventy five percent of the components for cars have to be manufactured in Canada Mexico or the U.S and its sizeable percentage has\nTo be made by people who are making at least sixteen dollars an hour\nYes you've put the two exact provisions together\nForty to forty five percent of car and truck parts have to be made by workers earning Italy's sixteen dollars an hour now what that does is level the playing field between may mainly Americans and Mexican auto workers to incentive five incentivize manufacturers to produce in the United states because Mexico is not paying that much\nAh made but to mandate Seventy five percent that all vehicles parts have to be made in one of the three countries in the deal where it's currently it's it was already there but sixty two percent\nIt means that these parts can come in from China and they can't I mean they can come in but there's going to be um a limit to how much they can come in so it's very good for labor it's very good for the actual manufacturing plants an increase in manufacturing in the United states than when you're making area in history and that's another story\nWhen you're making big ticket items like SUVs and trucks right then there's more room however there's also expressed concern that with these provisions it will make it more difficult to manufacture cars that are falling in popularity right now in the country and see more of that sent overseas the China\n[noise] know yes and no I mean the point is the other piece of it is that between the U.S and Mexico and Canada now there's no\nThey they're back to making sure that it's free trade that's why the Dow went up because um it it probably keeps much more of it here especially since there are going to be increased terrorists um places like China\nI before I let you go I Want to talk about the the president Kim Jong loan and the possibility of a second summit and this from the president over the

[noise]\nHere's a concern that I have [laughter] the the president of the out man the president can be in love with whoever he wants to be in love with ... but my concern is is that Kim Jong own may have effectively figured out how to manipulate President Trump and sent him wonderful lovers\nCindy in wonderful lovers letters and speak glowing of him and then do whatever you want to go do anyway\nWell here's the deal that may be true but um\nAnd you heard from the north Korean foreign minister here at the United nations on Saturday and he said there's no way he will ever became one will ever disarm them after this speech of President Trump is\nFirst if the U.S if they if North Korea can't trust Washington so um and then went on to say that he think it's a pipe dream\nOf people who are ignorant about us sanctions can bring as to where their knee our knees meaning that's what the United states is doing by by pushing continuing the sanctions until they do something\nNow what both Kim and Trump are doing are playing a tough you know I both to eyeball game which is who moves first but they both want a deal\nAnd so um it does seem like there will be something ... will love

Pittsburgh eight six six three nine one at ten twenty\nThis debate tonight this is the only one right\nThat's exactly right that Governor wolf insisted that there'd be only one debate\nA Republican Scott Wagner challenge tend to numerous debates in fact wanted one debate\nAnd all sixty seven counties a that was not going to happen but uh the governor turned us down I Katie Katie vie for a debate here in Pittsburgh he turned down others from Philadelphia for a debate ended up accepting only one\nInvitation before the Pennsylvania chamber of business and industry that's like the Pennsylvania chamber of commerce and they have an annual dinner they raise money it costs money to go to this debate\nOr they use it to hire their moderator and in this case uh they've hired Alex trip back to be the moderator of this one and only forty five minute debate between Scott Wagner and Tom Wolfe\nNow the the fact that there's only one debate what does that say to you\n[noise] well it's clearly a strategy on the part of a governor that he doesn't want to and doesn't think he needs to give a further attention to his Republican challenger Scott Wagner and uh you know whether you view it as a sign of weakness on the part of the governor\nOr not uh the fact is that he you know both candidates have to agree to a debate and they in this case\nThey agreed to only with this one debate ... agreed to the one debate before the\nThey are for the Pennsylvania chamber it's a little at odds with our practice you have to go back\nMany years I think nearly Thirty years to find a gubernatorial race in which there was only one debate\nOr the late governor Bob casey gave a former Allegheny county commissioner Barbara hey for here she was also state treasurer Barbara ... just one debate in that election but in all subsequent elections the incumbent governors have given more than one debate including Tom Corbett\nWhen governor Tom Corbett was running for re election and he had a challenger named Tom Wolfe a Democrat he gave Tom Wolfe three debates Pittsburgh\nHarrisburg area and Philadelphia as I say governor wolf has only granted one debate in the Harrisburg area to Scott Weiner\nAnd how much of this do you think is going to be about what's happening in Washington you think Washington politics is going to play a role here at all in this\nProbably not as much a role in this debate as it will in the U.S Senate debates ... but in the governor's race I think it's much more likely to be focused on Pennsylvania issues and will be very interesting I think folks are going to be watching to see how allies trip back does he's out exactly who you think of\nWhen you have a a a a moderator for political debate\nBut ah who knows maybe he'll do a great job maybe not\n... the right now later today well we'll\nWe'll tune in ends here tonight around eight Fifteen what do you think that Scott Wagner nice to accomplish in this debate tonight\n[noise] well I think he clearly needs to take shots at Tom Wolfe and I expect him to do so he's much more argumentative invite to predict Tom Wolfe is a very\nQuiet soft spoken kind of guy and it may be that the debate format is just not to his liking and ah I think we'll see whether or not their particular blows that get landed\nBy Wagner against wolf a it's hard for me to imagine Tom Wolfe coming out you know swinging because that's just not as style\nSo what does he do they does he need to win this ... that is in order to win reelection\nYeah I mean the problem is I think people are more interested in Alex trip back then they aren't Scott Wagner or a or Tom Wolfe I just think this is not this is more fun and games it's like a game show on television rather than anything else I I Know a lot of the political
