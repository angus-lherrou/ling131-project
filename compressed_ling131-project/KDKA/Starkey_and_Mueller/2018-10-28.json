All right\nOkay um my husband uh open the check a Chinatown a play like a credit card and he\nPut me on and knowingly and I spoke to that that\nWell I really answer is it sure looks like it except I you haven't signed it and you're going to argue with a credit card company as soon as you find out that there's a credit card with your name on it and do you go ahead and you let the credit card company no that's not your credit\nHowever and okay so you're probably get on that one the problem is\nThat the money that he knows they're going to go after any community property money if he'd evil oh and you both have community property you probably you probably everything you have is probably community property yes so here's the problem he's responsible\nThrough the community property so in the end you get nailed no matter what\nBut any what difference does it make if Bob he spends the money or doesn't spend the money you guys are married why would you get a credit card without your name on it and what he would have to deal with it\nOr a cabaret odd then you're fine as soon as he is law eaten away that's different\nIt's not legally that they will get separated it down and walk around\nYeah only make Iraq would that's even better a no doubt if you get the bill from the credit card company you say I didn't sign it I had no idea this existed we've been separated since uh X. period of time this application was announced words are not responsible\nAnd they will take you off you'll be okay okay okay Nicaragua on why would anybody move to Nicaragua Hi Kelly\nYeah my daughter had to do that and it had a she got a recall notice\nThe airbag the airbags we all know about that explode and shrapnel and she don't get in to the dealer to get it taken care of they said there is nothing they can do they have no way to repair it the way it or anything and for the time\nIn the dealer to get it taken care of them they said there is nothing they can give you they have no way to repair it replace it or do anything and for that time dean which is a definite you know just how nobody in the her car\nYeah that's what they do Kelly because nothing you can do well here's the problem there five million of those of you Kelly\nUh-huh and uh so we're in line are you let's say you're the third millions person that walk in\nOkay they probably don't have thousands of airbags sitting in the back they can replace it correct and that's the problem so uh you have to\nRight now how does that work do you have to find out where in line I'd go back to the dealer and say here's a recall and I'm assuming it's a ... year back correct\nI'm guessing yeah yeah the ticket and maybe you want\nI contacted to knock people I Would contact lawyers involved with those people\nAnd I would go back to the dealer and said is there a time is there an estimated time when\nUh I my car will be be able to be fixed and they can say talk has never been told us when it is we know we ever recall we know they said they're replacing the bags but again Kelly there's five million people that have your problem\nOkay they actually told her there was no solution lady then\nNo no no no that's not true they can replace the airbag oh that's not that's\nNot true at all of them were having yeah and then go to another and go to Kelly go to another dealer oh okay\nYeah you can go to any yeah you can go to any deal or a dad that so that that that doesn't that you're flying on that\nAlan Hi Allen\n[noise] hey no other show thank you or I read the actual contractor question yes if a homeowner refuses to pay the balance on a home improvement contract does the word guarantee or warranty still remain in effect\nThat's a good question and I would say no because there was a breach of contract going on and therefore there is no contract at all so interesting including the warranty once there was a breach ban everything is off the table\nOh interesting okay is that a specific California\nI don't you know I Am frankly I don't know because I just made it up [laughter] so it's [laughter] me making it up is specific to California but me making up is probably across the country but I think I'm right on that one yeah okay I'll check it out yeah please you know what I'm saying that\nCame up and uh uh you know with the show all the time I'm like man that's the perfect question for\nYou know it is and it'd be great if I knew about it [laughter] it would be wonderful and I should because I used to be a contractor\nSo or see it all works out Matt Hi Matt you're up welcome to handle on law [noise] man you there I'm here Yes sir\n[noise] okay I have had a house that I sold on payments that burned down in that respect California fires the blue cut fire [laughter] about three months ago I was effectively the bank\nOwned them out you know so you you you carry back paper on it\nI carried back paper on\nCocaine and so the house\n[noise] one of the house burned down in the fires they did have insurance I was listed as as the additionally insured right now it's up to my surprise which I found interesting\nBeing concerns company says they're going to issue one shack for the total loss in both my name and the homebuyer absurd name\nSays they're going to issue one shack for the total loss in both my name and the homebuyer insured name\nAnd it's up to us to fight it out now I agree that I'm not going to say the check over to them and they've agreed they're not going to sign the check over to me so it leaves me in a rather precarious position\nWell ... I I don't know if it does or not it probably leaves them in a precarious position 'cause they have to live some place and you're still okay and so are you you can do a couple of things on this one or you can\nAsk for mediator\nWhere are you guys pay for median or to work this out in a mediator who has experience in construction law\nOr mediators are generally attorneys who specialize in this field and then just sit down and work it out over a few hours\nThat's one if it turns out that they're not willing to really sit down then what you do is you file a lawsuit for the money and then you do in ... you actually enter plead the money with the court\nSo here's a lawsuit to the court hears the check Nell let's go to work and the judge will make that decision\nWow not bad I mean they had\nWorse I've had better I mean I Wish an alien or two were thrown into that story I kind of like you know with the woman foil hat so they can't read your thoughts and I'd like to see the FBI not investigating circling your house or because you're selling secrets of the Chinese that's a good one too\nAll right uh Hi rose rose you're up welcome\n[noise] I don't yes ma'am\nOkay it hadn't been with um my boyfriend for ten years you haven't done in taxes in ten years ... he's finally getting its act together [noise] and if I may I in a life responsible for that\nBut first of all let's start with I don't know why would you marry someone who is such an honor flake that he has an filed taxes for ten years\nWhile he pay their taxes they haven't found that fact\nHow he'll wait a second just write the check to the IRS no no\nNo I mean that has come out of the ... nothing like that he does all that\nI just had to file that but yeah he's probably entitled to some big refunds actually if you think up until maybe\nBut I'm just wondering if I marry him and my response though\nA hell you're only responsible for being stupid and um [noise] yeah well that's a given but I Know I mentioned part that I Love you and I'm not so you see the will lessened well we can have that conversation can't we are because I did we talk about your boyfriend now or soon to be husband you're not responsible\nA perfect but you have to be a little careful when you marry someone who has financial issues\nYou just keep everything separate everything separate and act and in in what I mean separate is everybody has totally separate bank accounts and you have a shared bank account that then you write household checked out of the mortgage or a gardeners are utility bills or whatever\nAnd so that is the cleanest wait now as far as he is concerned having pay the taxes and not filing a tax return now that is a violation but it really isn't a big deal\nThe IRS doesn't really care he just file their taxes and now you may even be entitled to you may even be entitled to refinance so why even though the violation and it's one of those and not paying taxes they get very upset yeah now he paid it\nThen you're fine and then just say hey I didn't follow the taxes that memory lapse for ten years and I don't remember and I woke up and I have a long beard and Rick family ankle and whatever but uh I haven't voted on accountant filed and taxes damn it and I get a refund okay\nI'm often yeah okay yeah you're an idiot from Mary\nGuy like Michel hello Michael a welcome to handle on the law\n[noise] about a month ago

do so\nI I just wanted to make sure that it was banned it in your shirt but we've got a low ball\nUsually not to that extent or pens on the insurance company it really does ... ... the insurance companies run all the way from miserable and horrible to really terrific where they go out of their way to the adjuster to not only help as much as possible but then called back\nAnd say is everything okay I'm Mr handle I'd had a couple of those ah you clearly don't have one of those\nDisappeared or ... weeks I'll leave\nYeah you've got you've got an insurance company you have to deal with all you can do is find it a a ... at the end you may end up having to to even take your own insurance company to ah to court and all you can do is go to a supervisor level and scream and rant and you can screen bad faith uh but that's that's a tough one and so\nYou're you're sitting there with ouch uh without a kitchen correct for five months for five\nMonths I Lived in a while they're negotiating while they're doing all that that's part of the lawsuit I think that's very good that's a bad faith all over the place so either you have a couple of choices first thing I Would do is contact me a bad faith attorney in in a civil attorney who deals with insurance companies and see if I Do read the policies if you have anything they're\nThey're all kinds of exceptions to mold or in many cases insurance companies will not do mold abatement you're sort of on your own on that one uh it's it's a question of your policy it's a question of ah the adjuster it's a question of the company that you're dealing with\nAnd uh of finding a lawyer that can look at it and then we started threatening I mean that the the only good news here or is that you and not me\n[noise] and there's all

Amazon her she purchased it and print out the receipt\nOh yeah and then you got it then and then if you have a picture and you have the Amazon recede then you've got it so now I it's an issue of um you hold the walk Smith liable would I'd go foreign accent\nDirectly led to the left and he didn't have proper identification\nOnly that but one of the way to say but what good if he did have proper identification see that's the problem of how the how does a locksmith no who owns the property does he asked for a ... a deed for example there's\nA lot of code or whatever\nI don't I don't I don't know because for example if you go to my house and I keep my deed or in a safe deposit box and I asked a locksmith you know what I Need new keys well no I Need the dean of the house to help\nThat you can call in I'm Sorry who does he call you know if you if you're taking a ticking I'm getting a vote who do\nHow do you help prove that and uh you you have to call in I'm Sorry who does he go you know if you if you've taken a ticket or done no I didn't know who to who does he call David\nCalling like a telephone refusing to the third call\nYeah oh I don't understand he was called to show up at a place and why should he who is he supposed to call not show up\nNot call it given the telephone histories refused taking the service call why in the locks with code and\nWhy do I don't know of a locksmith code but what I Do I have to look at what age what do you expect him to do he if someone calls he had not unless you're not show up\nFor this you should check identification\n... and what I ended up David what is the ID do\nI Need to show that somebody live at the\nMoney or saying it has to be it has to be that address got it so it says showing ID to show the live there and he didn't have any idea\nOh All right I Know that and I certainly concerns no I didn't know I I didn't know I think you have an up\nThere certainly to ah to take a locksmith and your friend to court I regret\nThe ruling the detective due to a court thing my ex husband criminally we're thinking of luck with the court civilly\nUh yes and the locks and the detectives are going after him criminally Oh yes\nOh then you know what you do it at that point once you have a ... ... here's what's going to happen once he is a job I Would dismissed the claim okay at this point I Would dismiss it with or without prejudice\nSo you can sue again because I'll tell you why if it turns out that he pleads or a couple of things can happen restitution is going to be ordered a and that is far stronger than any judgment you could get\nDavid a judgment for people like this mean nothing you have to go collected\nAnd these cock roaches what do you think or let's say you get five thousand dollars okay you have a judgment against them ... where's he going to cough up five thousand dollars David\nFrom ... from what the ... ... [noise]\nOh I'm Sorry I was thinking about your friend a friend or another and then\nThe only way to say the police so the police are going after the locksmith right\nWe're going to have to look at the printer going after my buddy wait so they're not going after the locksmith I don't know I don't I don't think\nSo no I they wouldn't All right so what you have is okay you sue the locksmith\nFor a civil union put all that you know K. yeah all that makes sense All right I think uh I I think you have enough there are certainly go to small claims court beautiful yeah I Would I ... I certainly would take out okay take care of them All right so either or he didn't do a great job of explaining all of that or I'm an idiot\nAnd actually I'm leaning towards I'm an idiot on that call\nHuh yeah 'cause if I had called and asked the ... that question and I got the answer that I got I Would definitely call me an idiot recall whoever cold or the name of bill an idiot\nEven that makes no sense to me oh I think we're going to take another call what do you think\n[noise] hey James\nUh yeah yeah I got a private school loan or it's been over nine years now and I wanted the statue of the shows that have to pay all that long\nWhen you say nine years you ever made a payment nine years\nYeah Atlanta play with and I have not made a payment for nine years yeah OK how much is how much was the original loan James it was a story a thousand twenty eight thousand nine years ago yeah now thirty eight thousand\nI'm Sorry I thought it would have been one point eight million ah it's only thirty eight\nEight thousand nine years ago yeah now thirty eight\nOh I'm Sorry I thought it would have been one point eight million ah it's only thirty eight thousand well this one I still think you owe it but how are they contacting you\nOh I think it's like they keep calling it a third\nOr a ... well some point James you're going to get sued oh yeah and\nYes you will have to pay and the statute I don't know how long the statute is uh somehow it seems ten years in my mind\nA bite you get to look it up and you may go ... past the statue and if it's a federally insured student loan I think they have extra time the feds but like James uh always here's my philosophy in life which obviously you are following always borrow money and screw the person that you're borrowing the money from because of\nHow to get along in life [noise]\nHow many phone calls the white yet I Want to screw this person I don't want to pay my\nBill [noise] we return okay this is handle on [noise]\nMe a

go\nThere yes if you're ... you're obligated to go to a deposition and uh you have to bring a lawyer Jerry you can't do that on your own\nBut I I don't I don't like the United states is over with\nNow so far request said you know what you have not been mandated to a desk or a deposition yet ah because just a letter saying we'd like to depose you okay ah no I mean they have to actually\nUh send you a legal document saying we are going to be deposed back and forth that's the way I understand it I don't do a divorce law but I don't think it's just my letter\nBecause you know he's saying no now the court could order it but again it has to be a court order it has to be under a the guise of a court order in other words have to be a legal document which a letter is not Jerry\n... and it's it's it's from her or her\nDie you know yeah but it's just a letter but I'm thinking well I'm Sorry I'm not particularly well no no not a Muslim no no not if it's just a letter you're obligated\nYou when you but you need in the ... year but they're going to hold you I'd be they're going to depose you and I'm\nNot the only one and I told her to the fifty well I don't have nothing else so I don't understand it I don't want to spend money and then the journey because I figure it's easy property\nThat could be you know what and that could be that could be the answer and I don't know why she's hiring and attorney or if it's fifty fifty all you have is one house looked up what's the difference in income between you and her Jerry\n... not much okay there and everything she turned it because the house
