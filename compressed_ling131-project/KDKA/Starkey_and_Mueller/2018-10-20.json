Gates said personal computing would not have existed without him so clearly a tech pioneer and I'm\nI'm ... and and really you know\nThis is a man who was a billionaire by the age thirty seven and ten times that by forty three did was work you know ten billion dollars worth of time he was forty three [noise]\nUm and and um you know you sort of a quiet man a and\nA lot of times you don't get the

us and but I got to give you contacts on this I'm going to use my first segment due to deep you know to give you contacts\n... listen I I came here in Nineteen eighty sakes came here to go to school um got my master's computer science and then I worked at a University of Pittsburgh worked at Lockheed and subsequently got my MBA from Carnegie Mellon\nSo I sort of grew up during when Microsoft is really taking off this is you're talking in in the early eighties and this is not my and I think in eighty six Microsoft has like two hundred million\nI'm and a dad to less than two thousand employees but they are growing faster than anything if I'm a technology perspective I saw all the things they were doing and being in the computer field ... I saw how easy it got\nYou know for personal computers to I still remember the printing from a personal computer was like a two hour past when I first was lucky you just couldn't printed you had to connect stuff and it was two hours and that then it's like a ... button on your phone it's ten seconds here\nA while well clearly ball Bill Gates 'em and Paul Allen where technological geniuses um I Want to share a little bit about what their dynamics were sort of behind the scenes that is what happens in a business a lot of times you know when you start this with partners\nAnd the and it's not a whole rosy I'm ... and and but most often people don't want to talk about the the the stuff that goes on it's just you know behind closed doors\nAre I'm In and these disagreements get hidden but but the twenty loving book idea man gave us an insight as to what was going on between Paul Allen and\nUh and Bill Gates and I remember Paul Allen was the one who came up with a BASIC Programming language that so the programming language allowed them to put this on a micro processor and do all the confrontation the first thing I don't know if you if you recall or when they were selling\nA what really got um their first paid a\nA product was they said what is two plus two in quotes and the answer came out for\nThose that that was that was it that was the groundbreaking thing to do the you know three you know sort of did this two plus two and then they hit the wrong button and then after some boring of the number four came out so that's the you know so that's how they get started then that's\nA you're talking what a Nineteen I'm a I'm a Seventy five something in that ... yeah around that range is what they did\nNow know a ... you know Bill Gates has always been the face of the company if you if you recall pilots to quite a person sort of behind the scenes but he came up with the basic stuff he came up with the name Microsoft or Microsoft or they actually had idea Alan and gates\nNinety nine pardons Rob is a partner at MIT best focused comeback capital Robin hoods dozens of early stage companies are accelerators like alpha lab a center idea foundry tech stars and University of Pittsburgh blast furnace he's a sought after speaker on lean product\nDevelopment principles in twenty ... founded no wait a two sided on demand network which connects people the casual

Thirteen no way to raise twenty two one five million a venture capital funding and had sixty five employees in February twenty Seventeen no wait was acquired by restaurant reviews side yeah\nRob ... an MBA from Carnegie Mellon ... school of business and be as an electrical engineering from University of South Florida Rob welcome to the show thank you very much\nRobin I'm going to start with early days growing up she had anything in your family who are entrepreneurs or did anything any part of your grill you know growing up that had a you had an inclination\nA yeah a little bit my ah my grandfather down in Miami he had a um airline supply business a very successful back uh I think in the seventies and eighties um so I had that gene or from early days and when you go visit we would go to the office and see the company and everything\nAwesome actually I was someone was from my grandfather alternative very successful business but it didn't really survive you know it was just like one of those ... ...\nBut it didn't really survive you know it was just like one of those generations were there was conflict with him and then the next generation my my grandfather so I talked about the last time when John Handy was on because of the fourth generation so and what brought you to Pittsburgh\n[noise] um my story similar I moved here to go to Carnegie Mellon in two thousand four\nOkay to get to be a ... so you know I Know the story of a no wait so you were um sitting you know in ... in California and they were like boy these wait too long to share with us you know how the idea came deal\nYeah serve I expand the story just a little bit ah you said I was a a guy waiting in line so a ... a problem was presented to me I didn't I didn't want to wait I'm but actually the solution was also presented because we went to one of the restaurants and they said it's going to be an hour you know you're gonna have to wait\nAnd we said oh you know that's that's really too bad and they said hey what's your phone number or we'll give you a call on your table is right and I said that's that's brilliant why doesn't every restaurant offer\nTo do that for us so we did that\nWe walked around forty five minutes later they called us and during that hour that forty five minutes I said wow what if we could we could automate this process um and uh provide this as a service to restaurants and that's kind of how no wake us started\nAnd at that point did you know when you say automate that ... was texting popularity Dan enough to a point where that was a solution you are embarking on\nA actually it wasn't so this was back in two thousand nine I'm In taxing really wasn't that popular um so it was the idea that we had to use tax thing\nLike one of the biggest criticisms that we had in a two thousand ten was people said no no one's going to give out their phone number to a restaurant so they can text you no one ever that's just you know to personal and\nAnd we said okay let let's try it out and we made an offer product in a matter of months and uh put it out to some of the great restaurants in Pittsburgh that took a chance on us to let us try this out and to our surprise and excitement not only did\nThe customers are those restaurants give their phone numbers their eyes lit up and said oh wow that's awesome you can just tax me I don't have to wait here thank you so much\nAnd it so so\nIn in in in in the bio you know you you mentioned like this is a casual dining no reservations restaurants using the stuff but we know when you go to a larger restaurant they give you whatever that ... and then you get but\nThis is going to be so much less expensive than bang buying the hardware and all that integration so he's that you know all these people are adopting to your ... you know the ... system now\nYeah no I absolutely and and that's a great point one of our early customers was the ... and they had previously use the ... those um wireless ... pages like you said have been around for\nA number of years um but they had and they are expensive they're forty or fifty dollars each really and they would have such a loss of busters people would take them and then just decided they didn't want to\nEat there which [laughter] like leave them on the ground and they even told us stories they would skip 'em in the river I'm I'm so they they literally ... is pretty funny um [noise]\nSo they changed over to us because we're a better system and uh they weren't losing hundreds of dollars a month or in these pagers\nThat's [noise] that's interesting\nSo you know I I as we were talking earlier Rob I did my MBA prayed tap are from Carnegie Mellon and one of the things that we always talk about it the school is there's lots of\nI I as we were talking earlier Rob I did my MBA prayed tapper from Carnegie Mellon and one of the things that we always talk about the school is there's lots of people ideas and but it's really execute it was like I Would say Ninety nine percent\nBut do you do the idea of what ... what was your initial steps how did you get started or to make progress on this yeah so\nUm I did a lot of what I now teach the entrepreneur is a at Carnegie Mellon in the switch center now to um really engage customers through the disc customer discovery a process so before we ever\nProgrammed anything are built an app we talk to 'em you know tens of restaurant owners and people in the restaurant industry to understand really exactly what I'm there use case was what was going to cause them to adopt a product if we were to make it so we really understood\nFrom the customer standpoint um if there was an opportunity there if we built this would they would they use it would they buy it um and then we followed a very intuitive\nProcess which is very popular ah today and software so that out yeah I'm ... exactly so we would we would do something and they test it and we would change it and we're constantly in our in our restaurants to understand this it's a one quick example I'm of the culture we built a new way\nIs we would require every employee or when they first started was no way to go work\nAs a host or hostess in a restaurant or partner restaurants and uh that's awesome that they would use our product alongside the actual user and they would understand how stressful it was to to be at\nA burger Tori on a busy friday night and everyone's hungry so when they would do do their job at no way I'm they they would understand from a customer stem\nYeah they're hearing the customer feedback directly what a what a great a great idea [noise]\nSo so you you had the idea but then you've got some other cofounder with you absolutely so why did you decided uh decided to bring in the co founders let me ask it say\nYou're you're straight at the beginning about I'm Bill gates and pull on was it was so great I mean entrepreneurship is not a a a single person\nOr activities so the first thing I did is I went back to my friends and I said hey I've got this idea what do you what do you know about text messaging what do you think about this idea and they're both uh engineers so we started working on the idea together um and then it's a great story we we we picked up so to speak are forced cofounder\nUm at one of the restaurants we were initially pitching the idea to\n'em and he said wow that sounds really neat I I've been in the restaurant industry on and off for a number of years\nUm I just moved back to Pittsburgh hey you know let's talk about this and he was absolutely pivotal less theloop panzer he was absolutely pivotal or to the company's growth because he had that inside knowledge of of uh how the restaurants where we the rest of us were just a bunch of engineers [laughter]\nThat's the way they talk about engineered some\nOf the ladies and gentlemen you know we we've been speaking with Rob ... he's the winner of ah Carnegie science a entrepreneur award or for for this year so I judged the panel into a and the chatter prior to me it was a rich lunatic who\nHad say innovation or extend the Roberts always had this saying\nHe said like when you when you know and you get ... you know a a founder steam there\nIs this for every person who has an MBA he says you're going to deduct a million dollars and for every person who has an engineering degree you Adam\nIs this for every person wants an NBA he says you go to the doctor a million dollars and for every person who has an engineering degree you out a million dollars for the value of the company\nSo you and me both have electrical engineering degree Senate NBA so we're net zero I guess we're zero zero flu and he's he's also got an engineering and an MBA degree so so we laugh about it so he's old says zero\nI'm so ladies in Germany if you are interested you know the Carnegie science of why this is for companies in our region or you can go to the Carnegie science website it's Carnegie science center dot org slash science awards that's one word science awards deadline is November ... thirty yet for next year you know you can nominate the the company that you want\nSo so you started this with your team and then you're going out for that\nYes mhm right right off the bat ah yeah so we really had the idea and and going doubtful lab was um some of our first milestone um you know if we get into our lab\nYou know they're pretty smart to see a lot of start ups that was a additional external validation um if we hadn't gotten enough that we we may have never pursued this obviously\nOr the arts and collaborate and in and build great things\nAnd uh so this is sort of like a lose lose those sort of like what ... does that you give them space in you and you sort of mentor them or or\nNo yeah there's there's probably a dozen different programs that are all underneath the Schwartz Center for entrepreneurship so we have a lot of scholarship programs for undergrad grad students PHD is we have a series of talks similar to alpha lap talks a every single week where people come in from all over the country\nUm we have ten physical offices called start up garages where are the students an alumni companies can operate out of\nA for for free and then we have you know I'm dozens more open tables that um the students and alumni can come and work out so it's a it's a very multi use space\nBut with these ah speakers had to bring on is that any can anybody a downer you have to be a\nAn alumni no actually it's open to the community so these are these are community ah oriented ... where can you what what's the website called or what but what have you called or if you go to sports center a French partnership I'm actually sports center dot com is a is it your other forwards there\nUm and look up I'm getting involved just see the connection series and you could sign up for the email list\nAnd then we can come yeah anyone any anyone could come\nAnd they I mean if you are listening if you have an interest in you know starting a business and entrepreneurship\nThat's a great way to get that did get started go there you'll hear some great ideas and something well it's parking like Rob said he was sitting\nWaiting for a for a restaurant you could go listen there you can hear something and you know that can relate to your field so that's a great thing to go to the to the ... and you're also doing the Ninety nine targets\nYeah this is a a project I started a little over a year ago okay um I had been\nAdvising start ups for a number of years throughout the lab and uh on campus and I decided to pull together and angel group that specifically invited Carnegie Mellon alumni from all over the world the country or to form this network\nTo invest in what we call Carnegie Mellon founders so I'm Carnegie Mellon founders that are looking for a seat in angel money they present the group and other alumni are invested in them\nTo sort of like a blue three but uh for Carnegie Mellon\nYeah it's a it's a very specific um [noise] angel ... were actually a little bit different than blue tree tree or tens invest larger amounts a little bit later on okay invest earlier in the company's um and we're actually not a group so we don't charge remembers anything we're just really a network\nOf alumni investing in founders OK okay and our website is nine times dot com\nOh that's awesome that's awesome so now no way to sort of integrated with yeah correct\nYeah absolutely so now you can get all the functionality inside the Yelp out um and you can even sort by no wait restaurants there called weightless restaurants and see all the real time waits so\nWhat do you think this is actually in right now the sole texting thing\nJohnson they're called weightless restaurants and see how the real time waits\nSo what do you think this is actually in right now the sole texting thing like this morning I got a tax you know I was going to like physical therapy when my shoulder\nAnd I got a ... gun from yes or no and I got a hair cut an appointment confirmed yes or no and it's all automated I guess I because it looks like a you head yes or no and they just schedules are takes it off the schedule\nSo so are you looking at some allied areas there's no way of looking at allied areas to get into our geographically different regions\nI'm so actually I don't I don't really know what ... plans for other no wait I'm technology is it was always my vision a you know way back\nIn the day that we had become the brand for not waiting\nAnd that's where we called the company no wait and send it off to his office yeah doctors' offices in his car are yeah I'm a hair a hairdressers barbershops any any place you wanted to really create a platform of technology and a brand around are providing real time information about\nA wait list type places in the ability to skip that weight by getting in line remotely\nUm so I don't know what ... plans are\nWhat are they going to be based in Pittsburgh still is that the plan for a no way it is a company to be a as a division to be here\nSo I mean obviously Yelp is a headquarters in San Francisco but they still have the same office space on Forbes Avenue I'm a ... for the no wait engineers or in other people there so they as far as I Know ... is going to keep a you know those people their\nKeep keep him here so just in you know when we think about like one of the things as as an entrepreneur you always thinking what's the next thing coming out what what is what is the trend in in this fast is like the ... or in the restaurant you know we have open table what what where do you see this going\nI I mean there's a lot of aspects that restaurants are trying to um become more popular um by offering more personalized experiences uh to to their gas I'm new flavors flavor profiles um was actually just in San Francisco last week and there's a there's a robot\nOr that makes hamburgers or it's more it's more of like an assembly line a bike completely automated\nIt just sticks out of hamburger with lettuce tomatoes bonds everything just comes comes right out um so I'm not sure of complete automation is the future of restaurants um but restaurants are looking to offer better experiences\nAnd and now we have everybody delivering everything down so so I you know I lazy generation [laughter]\nBut but that really you know it's it's a ... I I I wasn't using it that much but now I'm tempted to just ... it looks like every restaurant I can get the food right now yeah and and that looks like that's another and what they're taught him his car's a duck that's going to be a that's going to be a huge a ... area\nYeah I'm I'm working with um one company has CMU that's doing a ton of us drones I'm a you know based on all the economists technology that comes out of Carnegie Mellon and they're doing the drone so big future there\nAnd in our region is like a you know got so much investment in a a you know you got the ... here Google here all these companies are doing a ton of his driving\nIn in in a ton of Mrs one kind of subset of robotics and artificial intelligence which which is really exciting as the Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon becoming a kind of the center Center for that so\nWhat what is the coolest thing my you know I think we are coming to a closed here as being in a in a executive and residents what are the coolest companies your your your mentoring now a with a strong company called ...\nWhat is the coolest thing may you know I think we've come into a closed here as being in a in a executive and residents of the coolest companies your your your mentoring now\nA with a strong company called novelist sent a they're doing ... um you know drones that are flying themselves as very a very cool we have one of entrepreneurs that's doing at a I based communication coach\nAnd so so more people can get a coaching a for their um communication skills without a professional coach they can do it with a with a a\nNice nice hey exciting stuff or Rob it congratulations on uh on on audio successes and a visual many more going forward thank you thank you\nWhen you want a spot that burglar when he's case in your home or after he's in ...

shows that the racial problem man and and America is getting a work in my opinion and a bat the younger people and then they will not allow the they'll get along better and I remain optimistic and I hope that\nThey came with many people have with their little neighborhood and their little areas have not come out and get away with all the way that they portray African Americans are ...\nThey have they show and power and I like the ... the head that I Love the ... or an active and they failed but\nAgain they portray African Americans are failing of\nDoing all kinds of that they have to leave

listeners in the LA law was always my favorite but you know every show he was talking about um a empire in various shows that show African American people anybody many times in a band light is this is where the drama comes in\nA and it's a it's a cheap way to get listeners of viewers are you ... you show that you showed that the the aspects that are really the problem areas of any race or any neighborhood or any city\nOr any industry LA law was a was a great show about the legal system but what did they dwell on it dwell on the problems that occurred\nWith lawyers within the legal system and so you saw the\nDirty underside then of course is worth of drama comes from right we have had a great shows uh you know what what comes to mind talking about the African American community looking limited Cosby that that show I mean we could Cosby now let's not but I mean look at that show and and that was that was of its time\nUm and it was a long time ago um there are so many things that I'm Glad you brought that up because I was going to get into this later but maybe we should\nTalking about it now um there is I don't know what you watch on TV I don't know what your favorite TV shows are but one thing I Do know is that there are so many sources now\nWith content with shows that you can watch and some of them are streaming you can download them also who knew a Amazon Prime is got their own channel paramount network\nOr ... is on there's there's whole to Oprah's gun her her a network the\nOprah Winfrey network um in all these other number of places that are you can get television

gosh you got to go through this whole rigmarole to find out what it is that you want and then when you find out what it is you have to find out where it is and and you know it's it's a little foot work but it's fun it's you can do with the computer or your TV\nBut there is some searches are a lot of people\nHave started to say that they're just going to stick with a regular cable thing that they have cable is becoming a thing in the past is what we're told to believe\nA because there's this new wave of all these downloadable programs that you can binge watching you can watch them whenever you want and that and and truly true that's true and that's great\nBut there are so many of them now that you pay ten dollars a month for this you pay ten dollars a month for that it's nine

like MGM\nIn Disney and paramount and some of the big movie companies twentieth Century Fox it's not him at all you know it's Amazon Amazon he's got a we've talked about this before\nEight billion

here\n[laughter] rarely you know I I think you're right people are going to say we're being disrespectful but I think you're absolutely right you'd ask what you got to know his game yup yup\nAnd if you don't throw him off as game then he's going to eat you up\n... ... a gym and that's how I got it I think you said it will lead to a gym I think he's absolutely right I'm In I I still cringe and and I understand here's the thing here is the politics and ... and believe me I just here's what I Want to see\nIn the White House press corps one afternoon the next president is the next ah President Trump press conference I Want to see you know you're going to jump all ... hours he Dan Rather I\nI Want to see some of these guys from the from way back in the in the Nixon Tom Brokaw I Want to see these guys that ... that that chased after a story\nThat when the president said I don't want to talk about that and they said but let me let me just rephrase the question they just kept on and they kept asking the question Dan Rather Nixon hated him he hated him\nAnd what they're I think we're just comes down back to network television I think the networks are afraid that they will lose access to the White House press room if they go after the president or\nAn ... you know ... Gardasil which side you're on I think if if anybody's going to beat Donald Trump and go after Donald Trump you you you have you have to push hard you you I mean he's he's going to come after\nYou and he he's holding all the cards so if they want to get the full story\nThey have to go after it in that manner or\nHe's very good saying excuse me see them in the you know sit down and don't sit down don't don't excuse excuse me no excuse me Mr President I Want to ask you you've got you they've got to do that\nAnd he knows pretty much that the odds are against him doing that but uh it would make for some\nPretty good TV too [laughter] Joanne is important ... me a welcome to engage in what's on your mind\n[noise] Hi how you know what I hear that that that that that's comments about\nOh a than Democrats you we have positive ah opinions and and things you hear anything if I look at it that matter how bad it gets come come on with it that scene is a a\nLet me yeah I you know and that's you know the Democrats who tend to put it all out there and and\nI mean yeah I you know and that's you know the Democrats we [laughter] we we tend to put it all out there and and and there's there is bad and so that you know you get the the these affection and I understand it is frustrating and it was it's frustrating if\nYou're a Democrat and you hear somebody like Anthony why no is a as frustrated as he was there um but yeah\nI Know we're going I'm Sorry I Know we're frustrated but I'm Sorry this is the thing is that we need that push push ahead because who knows what happens then when you have\nA country or them these people it's like a cult that they're following this man and if that's not a scary time or the other thing as far as a A R abs\nThey know Trump allies on and on and on and so now they're coming with their lives and this is what we're going to get from all the countries out there they're going to be a line through their case for everything that's happened\nAnd it's funny that this is telling you the last thing I Do want to say but I cannot believe these women\nWho say oh ah they may do it to my side or am I a lot\nAbout what about the women who they have done it to one of the opinions in how they feel so what they're doing they're putting women down again that your beliefs or your feelings are not worth a nickel a\n... it's just it's just very scary and sad time and I hope these women were allies\nThat why she continues to say oh somebody might come out if it's your son or your daughter and you've had a bad experience like that you want someone to come out I don't care how many years later it is I'm wherever\nYou need to understand and realize that in in what's going on in this country\nThe other countries are following so yeah I guess like a rabies come a lie after lie after lie and people seem almost what happened you know what I mean\nSo I don't know I think these women need the white guy and say you know our men have issues just like women and put them up and say oh no something might happen\nWhat people have kind of been saying that for years about our our our children\nAnd especially the men and boys do out there and get killed you know we we worry about that tooth but are you going to stop not uh doing what's right\nYou know because I Know you're going to work hard they try to stop what's happening but women please don't get into that that that mode where oh this might happen to my my brother or my son or my husband will want to fight if they have much to you or your girls stop this nonsense and get out there and float\nAround Democrats what that the fetus attitude thank you so\nThank you Joe and there there is there is the locker room speech for joining a thank you\nUh I I and and you know what I I have to say\nYou like it or not um she's right there you know again we have the opportunity this this this midterm election is not over a and November six is going to be a very important day for Republicans and Democrats\nAnd I think we're going again like I was saying I Want to talk about polls you know I I Do want to hear from people because I Know oh my gosh I've talked to so many and I have to say so many women who are so\nPassionately angry at what's going on in in the country now you may dismiss that or you may say\nBut who are so passionately angry at what's going on in in the country now you may dismiss that or you may say oh just shut up and sit down but I'm telling you and if if and if you had some conversations women amongst yourselves men with other women you hear it\nYou hear it and it's deep it's it's not like oh yeah we're going to get it no they're angry or and they really want to take action and it's going to be a numbers game I could take a break here hundreds is waiting in Monroeville we'll

saying man well well thank you well done nice to hear from your man I'm uh our numbers are just six three and one ten twenty\nI'm good call a only get to a jury in a moment here a ... you know ... and it's pretty interesting I'm listening to these calls today\nAnd we're talking about the mid term elections\nBut nobody's talking about the mid term election issues really we're talking about you you are talking about Donald Trump who has managed to suck all year out of the room and make this mid term election\nAbout him now and that's not an easy thing to do uh but you do have to see that you do have to um if you will appreciate that uh because in that may be the interesting twist while we're concentrating on this I Wonder what the number of\nUm the Democrat female voters than I've been speaking with none of it's not even on the air and Joanne certainly of course but a ... a lot of people have been talking was in private they're not talking about\nSome of these issues ... ... it's a it's it's something\nDifferent um and I ... I Wonder if that's just bubbling under at this point and it comes to the fore on November six I I really\nDon't know I'm named from cranberry she's written a few of them are to us today though but I have to read this man thanks she says Republican women\nAre going to vote because we don't want some woman who drink beer in her bathing suit with the boys to come and accuse our husbands of doing something to them in high school where she can't remember\nAnthony gets that point I think that's totally wrong um but that's your opinion and I'll leave it there for people to comment on Jerry is in the economy or let's get on a journey thanks awaiting welcome to Katie care what's up\nStony how are you doing\nGood I'm good what's going on with you\nGood I'm a lifelong Democrat I just finished working thirty one years for our trade association in Washington DC with\nCongress so that a little bit of a different perspective\nBut I can tell you that I'm pretty certain that the Democrats are going to Congress I don't think they're going to take the lead ... well they have just they've they got it got much better ... this time they've developed\nOf course I don't think they're going to take the majority by a lot\nWell they have just they've got they've got a much better ground game this time they've developed they recruited some good candidates I'm I mean if you take Pennsylvania New York alone those two states are probably going to give\nNine more Democrats to Congress in this cycle but just those two are lower than give almost half of what the Democrats need to take back the majority so I I strongly believe that they are going to take it back\nHaving said that I really agree with a lot of the things that Anthony said uh-huh but one thing that I Do disagree strongly with the Democrats on\nWhen we've got to get an immigration policy yes this is getting to the point where it's beyond ridiculous the United states a sovereign country when we have a right\nTo limit who comes into our country ... and whatever that criteria is I don't care what the criteria didn't they need to set it Congress needs to grow a set of you know what\nYou are you know what you are ... yes said it you know it and move on in\nAnd and and these countries get this number of people if you want to give ... million I don't care giving point like Europe get so many that's the way we've always done it and don't hide behind the the misnomer of asylum\nCan claim asylum yeah yeah so I thought it sounded really stepped down from the rules that say hey that's it because other countries don't have to do anything Mexico has the luxury of just letting those people pass through their country 'cause there's no recourse\nBut then there's there's nothing in it do they have nothing to gain by jumping into the fray it's like well you were coming up north I Would what what do you want us to do\nI but I think you're right there's there's no policy currently\nAnd in yet we saw we I think a lot of Americans thought that there was going to be an immigration policy of wall is not a policy\nOr which doesn't exist and um second of all as you say people have got to the the leaders need to put them put a plan together both Democrats and or the Republicans and say here's what we're going to do I mean I think that's\n... ... and that's one thing I really miss I can tell you I've got thirty five years of working in Washington DC and I can tell you know\nCollaboration anymore you know ... the yeah back in the day in the seventies and eighties when I worked for members of Congress that you could work with somebody on the other side of the aisle you might not like them particularly might not agree with them\nBut you always walk away trying to do the best thing for the country and for your constituents and have come up with some common ground so they get a little bit you get a little bit you know it was a little bit they lose a little bit but the American taxpayer for taking care of we\nLost that yeah it's all winner take all now\nAt any cost me at any cost you anything you're ... you're right and I'm sure somebody will accuse you of saying well you know that was while they used to do will do it that way anymore that's ... I agree with you wholeheartedly jerk that's the way things get done in American politics\nYou know a little bit from both sides and we end up with the middle and you go okay then that's what we're going to do and it may not be perfect\nBut it gets better as time goes on\nWell not only that but when you when you meet in the middle somewhere you both have ownership of\nExactly what would you get

getting better to do the best time to do it\nWell and you know and and now it is the time and he's 'cause he he knows that all you want to do is the the news machine so he's saying we're not sure we're going to wait for the report as opposed to saying\nLet you know palm pale was there let's get over there let's sit down here's what we're going to do we don't like this you know we don't like this let's work this you know let's work this thing out\nAs opposed to dropping hands and being Korean saying maybe maybe this may be that I mean what are you what are you going to do and he's hoping this thing just goes away\nBut I won't go away because you're dealing with a new generation of ... of of of all of a press of regime these guys or or or eager to show that hey they're that they're going to leave\nA bully in the middle east and to me it's hard for president say hey we know toward you know we we are getting for Cher and murder meanwhile we've got ... bay which should be shut\nYeah okay yeah we do torture yeah okay yeah so it it gets\nOur lives and the way is a great opportunity for Trump\nTo really make a couple of details the may ... it's time to read ... look at the Iran deal ... they were ran it started to pivot away from Saudi Arabia you can you want against the other ... and ... and turkey wants to think that they're now they're telling us that was their video they they\nPretty much let people know hey what the Saudi was doing so\nIf Trump will be a little bit like next thing\nYou can do you know he asked the person ... to help out with Syria the ... time with the phone with the Turks don't worry about the Kurds there's a way to get what you want or very little effort well I don't know the president of it is really on the ball of it I think he has a great opportunity a law that they\nLook at the situation and you brought this up before and I think it's a it's always a great example of look at what Nixon did was try with China\nA that was doing a ... not more about this on a high demand out war it was perfect thing right anybody and you know next to study that you know a thing on the sphere yeah the biggest thing you always want what's\nKeep China and the Soviet Union separated right always won them never won them combined you always want to separate and excellent out there during the Vietnam War got what he wanted it got to deal with ... you know what mile in Mali won that was the U.S out of all the age ... get out\nWell and you know ... I was thinking about this earlier yesterday that this whole thing in the middle east now is starting to ... ... and you remember this was the Vietnam War the domino theory\nYou know if if you lose Vietnam the communist will take over all of Asia and then they'll come to California and they're going to be under your bed before you know it and we're doing the same thing in the middle east it you

Clinton he's the only president to curb abortion and\nHe's also the only president to make the balance the budget balance he's also the only president in our area that has turned around and um put restrictions on welfare\nWell none of those things that Democrats and none of those things are things you attribute to a Democrat and yet it was a Democrat president who did it why because the Republican Congress and and work it out that way\nAnd I remember your right Patrick because I remember a lot of Democrats criticizing him during his term for doing that and but yet when young when you look back and won he got done\nHe got done quite a bit and he got it done not through executive order not even really doing too much with the media he literally sat him down ... slang worked out and it it really it didn't work out well no\nBut they the Republicans couldn't stand him having success sure and then when George Bush became president they ... the Democrat wouldn't let him have any success and they wouldn't work with them\nThen it went on became president to be honest I laugh at the person that was saying about impeaching from you know while you look at it and reverse one Obama came in they want to impeach him because he was an American\nYeah and and and that was for most of his term here's\nOn it exactly our ears they want to get rid of him 'cause he was an American both

problem\nBut have they done anything\nNo they know your while the ... year you know you're working on the fact that the these guys can't get anything done so it's it's not hurting you and that's a
