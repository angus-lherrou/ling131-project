we've got a call from from the north hills hello are you there about voter I Am I have a new show Dan\nHey thanks for having me on a actually my call wasn't about voter rights but uh I can certainly\nAre there are a lot of hot water a lot of cold water on on that kind of hogwash [laughter] um you know voter voter it's it's not wrong to ask people to identify themselves and anybody that says that you don't need to identify yourself you have to identify yourself open up a bank account you\nHave to identify yourself to go to the doctors I mean you have to identify yourself and do a lot of things why wouldn't one of the most important activities\nAnd in our country as a citizen why would you not be asked to identify yourself\nWhy Dan I mean I I I Know you didn't plan on talking about this and and and and I didn't necessarily plan on talking about it either today but I think it's an important part because keeping\nIn restoring integrity in our elections is so important and making sure that every vote is legitimate\nAnd up I don't think it's too much to ask\nPeople if you're going to rent a boat at a state park or get on an airplane or get your prescription drugs\nI don't think it's too much to ask that an ID I think it is legitimate to say not everybody can afford it id and and if we did have voter id requirements to say well let's make sure that anybody that wants to or an id to vote has one but\nI agree I think uh from from the baseline of whether or not it's it's right or wrong I I don't I don't think it's wrong but I don't and for every\nTen or Fifteen bucks to to get an ID I don't think that's too much to ask somebody I mean people run around with brand new phones I mean I I don't think that's too much to ask that for somebody to have ten or Fifteen dollars to get an id but\nThen I think I I think we're a lot of common ground there but I don't want to to take away from what you wanted to call in and talk about if it was her\nWell your your last caller\nA lot of common ground there but I don't want to to take away from what you wanted to call in and talk about if it was her\nWell your your last caller or you know and and this was the common this seems to be like a common thread for for Democrats is all Democrats or for the working man and boy you gave to the Republicans gave all these tax cuts to the rich people\nAnd and it's just not true it it's just not true um you know yeah the the ... of Republicans are the the wealthy they pay the vast\nI got to interrupt it those those words are not sending them ... Republicans wealthy you know what I'm saying I mean I I I don't want you to I don't want you to buy [laughter] don't just by enter except what what a lot of people want us to think right okay well so sorry about the wealthiest\nThe wealthiest paid like Seventy eighty percent of the taxes\nThere's a lot of well the Democrats right then I mean absolutely absolutely\nBut but the but the vast majority of the taxes are being paid by those rich people Republicans or Democrats and I'm so tired of hearing this narrative that oh well they're going to be paying more attack they're not going to be paying more taxes\n[laughter] well you know most of them don't put anything in any way\nSo I come to this I come to this the decision on what party to register as very surely very organically I was my my family is a blue collar democratic family dad worked in a union\nThink my parents were all Democrats too I ran for office I went to college as I mentioned first getting my family to graduate from college and I had to make the decision and I was a political science major my Republican or Democrat\nAnd I think everybody that makes that decision\nMakes it for some philosophical reason or their family you know they're raising the Democratic family here I heard that a lot knocking on doors\nBut I don't think it has anything to do with what whether you're wealthy here you're poor or not\nBecause that's not the the platforms of the party so um I agree with with with with Dan that there's this this is deeper than whether you're rich or your poor it's about the policies and the type of government that you think is responsible\nIt's not about whether you're rich or poor we back after this break\nEvery morning learn the issues with ... a morning news\nWeekdays five to nine\nAh

Audrey Russo what's going on [noise] hey great\nShow tonight we actually had an opportunity\nTo interview sort of like what we do every year at Pittsburgh demo day which highlight\nThe companies that were completing their time over at ... year an apple lab and these are innovative tech companies that got a little bit of the funding and we sort of roll out the red carpet and have a chance to HAVE QUICK interviews with all of them\nSo after they've done their pets they walk on they talk to us and then they head into the crowd where pot with investors and people in the community are interested in seeing what's happening\nSo it's a fun so you're going to hear about sixteen companies their pitch is what they're working on it's everything from things related to heart where\nTwo new way to the hiring too you name it it's just the variety is just so exciting and you know very often that's how these companies start so it's a fun\nOn this is quite a big step a Pennsylvania fact we're the first day this may do this\nUh the aim may and the state mental size had been advocating this for some time see one of the positive only treating patients substance use disorder um there are windows of opportunity when the patient is willing to accept treatment\nIf you can't get them started ... at that point they can go away and be back in they may overdose or you may lose them to follow completely\nSo one of the problems we've had in the past\nIs that if we wanted medication assisted treatment which is the evidence based probably the best standard treatment we have to help these patients if they decided they wanted to go into it we would have to go to the insurers\nTried to go from anywhere from forty eight hours to five to seven days to get approval for the medication before we could get it by that time the patient was lost in some cases that had overdosed in the meantime\nHours now we can work with them right away and help them out of our expenses are these medications\nTo be honest with you I Can't tell you the cost of hand uh they are not cheap and it's why divided the ... is it as a as this new bill dot the ... one of each one but there was some little ones\nThe three that we talk that most often are not the only uh buprenorphine which is usually mixed with knocks them which is our opioid antagonist ticket for being abused and the third one is a um long acting the locks on called Vivitrol got that one I Know is several hundred dollars for those\nThat we've seen that when people are getting that out to descriptions but the other medication I Can't tell you off hand\nNow that one I Know is several hundred dollars for does because we've seen that ah when people getting that through prescriptions but the other medication I Can't tell you off ...\n... what did it take for insurers to agree to this especially your this is the generally recognized most successful way to treat addicts\n[noise] the insurance companies as a general like to think that they want to have some supervision and what's going on that things can be overused\nAnd we all are concerned about that physicians want it back to the mess as mad as impossible ... have you seen them prioritization yes it's not just in this issue but in other things like ... and other medications is that when the physician goes to the paper or the time to get the authorization is very seldom turn down\nSo we never really understood why we had to go through these hoops so I think the uninsured are starting to realize yes this is a problem that needs some new way of thinking it are thinking outside the box by removing the ... for this to get these patients the medications as soon as possible while they're willing as well worth the investment\nManager John Gallagher is where the future of the Pennsylvania medical societies over your task force reacting to the news just recently reported that major health insurers and Pennsylvania will no longer require prior authorization for prescriptions on medication assisted treatment for substance abuse\nI'm Dr Gallagher how long has this been the preferred form of of of treatment and how and how would these drugs being developed\n... what happened over the years the first method we had was methadone and methadone was originally developed as another opioid pain medication we found that it was more long acting a less easy to abuse and say we found that by substituting the opiate ... I'm\nUsing methadone to replace the opioids they were receiving either by diverted opioids by heroin on the street\nThe biggest problem that the substance user has is that if they start to withdraw they get very ill and this is illness like the flu magnified by a hundred fold it's a terrible experience and that's what keeps the ah views are\nGoing to get their medications so with time all they can think of is how do I not get sick and this is what leads to the secondary things like crime people's feeling to get the medications silly medications mother people because I have no access to it how it went on the street so by replacing this and saying okay here you're going to have your medication\nYou're going to be watched we're going to be working with you are going to give your counseling to see if we can get you off the medication long term\nThey take this away so we can cut down the crime rate cut down the overdose rate cut down the bad behaviors that go with it and these patients can live a life just like any other medication\nIn this or tried to think of the opioid crisis as a chronic illness just like diabetes hypertension schizophrenia that when we had the crack medication\nThose patients can live or take care of their family raise their kids and their normal weight which they can't do without the treatment\nAnd you're not talking about some trial is speculative measure that's what you're talking about has been proven overtime as as a as a form of treatment\nOh yes it's been shown over the years it's been given\nTreatment has to be a multi mode all and there's a role for the medication assisted treatment the civil for the seven set programs like Alcoholics Anonymous and narcotics anonymous and his role for cognitive behavioral therapy motivational intervention\nSo you have to find the best way for the individual there's no one size fits all when it comes to this\nBut a combination of these methods working together medication assisted treatment with proper counseling is probably the best way to go and when we see a base that gets into medication assisted treatment\nAnd follows with that they had the longest duration of treatment and the best outcomes\nAnd when we see a patient gets into medication assisted treatment and follows with that at the longest ... treatment and the best outcomes\nWhat percentage of patients what'd you say are are ultimately successful\n[noise] I Can't give us the number on that 'cause it's very hard to tell\nYou is it more likely or less likely to happen\nWe think it's more likely I think the evidence based on\nThat successful a treatment with medication assisted therapy will out they any of the other method to duck\nDr Gallagher fascinating thanks for thanks for joining us and congratulations it sounded like this is my pleasure this is a good step a it's\nA great first that was the first day in the country to do it's a theme that oh wow that's incredible yet we as a\nLovely will be the model for the other states because we have to get this this but nationwide and the ... and the state medical sides all working hard on what\nPennsylvania's and often the first so congratulations on that on the Internet so it's great\nDr John Gallagher is chair of the Pennsylvania medical ... these opioid task force you heard him say Pennsylvania is the first state in the

cycle the congressional leadership fund which ... which is by far\nThe highest spending super PAC in this race they spent more than Ninety three million dollars on TV ads\nIn house races across the country um and we also then look at the D triple C which is the Democratic congressional campaign committee which uh is doing the same thing on on the other side for the Democrats are they've spent about sixty five million dollars so far\nBut when you look at some of the advertisements are they're running a do most the most hold up a two to fact check\n[noise] well uh what we did was right about the most misleading once a ... there are some themes in air the Democrats are hitting very hard on the Republicans on a health care particularly the pre pre existing conditions\nUm one ad for example in Ohio I'm misleading Lee a says oh isn't in Ohio I'm ... Iowa [laughter]\nA misleading Lee says that fifty percent of the known elderly and the third district have pre pre existing conditions and yet the represented there voted to deny protections for the health care coverage\nUm but the if not fifty percent well we're talking about people who buy health care on the individual market were only six percent of Iowans get their coverage\nSo uh yes it is an issue yes he voted for the Republican bill but it's not fifty percent\nAnd what issues are Republicans trying to use against Democrats\nAlthough it's interesting Republicans are going after a individual ... they did a lot of background checks on these candidates that are running and they're being very specific about\nTheir individual foibles\nA so that that's that's where they're going after for example and and the and again you know they are distorting and exaggerating saying as a as a on both sides for example in Virginia there's an ad that attacked the candidate there of for saying she's a risk that we can't afford\nBecause she taught in his ... school coral terror high\nA turns out that she was applying to work for the CIA or in Virginia a while she was waiting she was a long term substitute teacher at this school a that got the nickname terror high because there was a man who had\nGraduated before she was a substitute teaching their uh who was involved in a chair a um attempt well he he was arrested for trying to kill President Bush were plotting to kill President Bush\nYeah so really I mean her warfare had absolutely nothing to do with a ... ... and the nickname was purely that or a nickname mirror I\nWrite and these are the kinds of things that you see it you take a some ...\n... of information from someone's resume and totally distorted [noise]\nI see that in the run down that you set us in advance of the interview you've got an example from a a Pittsburgh congressional district or I don't know if you have it in front of ... in front of you there but sure ... in Pennsylvania you say the uh the Democratic campaign committee claims are represented in my Kelly and and I worry about is not worth\n[noise] yeah uh [noise] with\n... campaign committee claims a representative Mike Kelly and and I worry about his net worth\n[noise] yeah uh with is\nVery misleading so what what they claim here is that Mike Kelley basically a has gotten rich while in Congress or it starts out saying two thousand and tank car dealer might Kelly is elected to Congress and while they're his net increase it net worth increased by millions\nWell the support that ... D triple C provided to us show that actually his net worth decreased since he's been in Congress [laughter]\nAnd it I won't even get into the convoluted way which they made this a try to make this claim hold up yeah but the fact is\nThat when he when he ran for office and twenty ten he had a net worth of thirty four point six million dollars as of today without us up today as a a two thousand and Fifteen it was Eighteen million dollars almost half\nAnd that's the most recent data that we have available and that's what the D triple the base this TV ad on\nThey would have been a lot better at selling cars [laughter] at least financially or would have been yeah we are joined by Eugene Kelly ... the director of fact check dot or you can read about uh all of these stories and these examples on their website fact check dot org Eugene ...\nYou know people are used to seeing these distortions now the trouble is unless you know something or have some inkling or or involved it's really hard to sort through these stories and figure out which ones that you know may be mostly drew and which ones are really total fabrication\nIt is very hard I I'm In the first congressional district in Pennsylvania want another one of these ... heavy rotation of TV ads and unless I go and and start to review those individual that\nI I don't know half the time half the time I Do because it's my job um I Know when they are distorting kind of the national issues but on these very specific issues to deal with on a personal level\nAnd it's hard it's hard to make that determination and hopefully their news organizations out there who are looking into it and people can find a resource\nOne good resource as I said is fact check that they see T.

working on this statute change a for many years up to twelve fourteen years and I think each time it comes up in the house and Senate um their support for it and the\nThe statute include you know coming closer to changing it um it takes one more step so I think this week it took one more step um that\nObviously still failed but I'm actually cautiously optimistic that we'll get this thing done or may not have been this past week but obviously a the Senate now does that it needs to bake\nA some changes in terms of where they're headed with reform I think everybody needs to realize that this bill was put forth by the Senate originally [noise] and that window that we're looking for survivors are those in the past those are outside the statute of limitations\nIs the sticking point and I think we're getting more and more a support from senators individually as to this being an important part of the bill\nLet me ask you a little bit about that as we just have about a minute or so left I I Know you and others are continuing this work or to not only change the law in Pennsylvania but around ... around the country um uh how how much momentum do you feel you're getting because of what
