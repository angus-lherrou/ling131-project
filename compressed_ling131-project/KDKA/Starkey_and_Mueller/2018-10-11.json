say\nEveryone is trying so hard to save their own church but I think this whole merger has set us up for automatic failure because they changed our math schedule and ah then they're going to have a head count and based on heads and money\nIt will determine which church stays open and which church stays clothes or goes closed\nAnd we had a very workable a situation with father Chantilly at St John Fisher for nearly a quarter of a century he even came out of retirement\nOr to come back and serve our parish family and bishops who big stood at our alter one day and promised her father Jean ... could remain at St John Fisher as long as he wanted or as long as his health allowed and all of our prisoners hard that beautiful statement\nAnd ah we would not have a shortage of our church if they would let the people that footage until they notice help out with these masses we wouldn't have to change our math schedule and I just think it's a big smokescreen to cover up this will be stuffed fellas\nWell let me ... and and the pay for it in effect as what they know you you're you're actually it's interesting you're one of several made that observation let me ask you a couple of things sure when you say set up for failure ... and that always connect with me because I'm I'm very mindful of that in a variety of businesses\nSo if people move the goalposts for instance and they say the goals change that's always a bad sign\nAnd ... if you're saying that now we're going to make a determination that almost by definition will lead to failure because there will not be as many people and there will not be as many dollars and therefore we're going to have to put\nFor we're going to have to put a particular parish on the block or merge or do something else that's what I'm hearing you say\nThat what I said what and I really believe it because I've talked to so many people at our church they're willing to walk away and lose the church for the sake of this stuff\nWell yeah we know that we know that but we're real quick and I've got about Fifteen seconds how feasible is it to go to the ... say wait a second you stood up and said the U.S he can stay he wants to stay

out financially they have now at ... high at that rate and Hi Ed ... likelihood of awful\nA lot of parents have been asking questions and now it's a time when parents are signing up kids for activities and the thinking especially if you have girls which one should\nMy daughter Jolene so I did a story on the Girl Scouts a couple of weeks ago it's aren't kids burned out or you can see it there and that really talks about what the Girl Scouts you do and now today I have a story on the boy scouts to learn more about\nWhat they do what's new and also what hasn't changed that take a lesson\nFor this family from the moon being a boy scout is in the genes and it's an Eagle Scout they're great grandfather and great uncle where scouts and Karen ... can Boy Scout camp\nThere was a rifle range tractor and I was a medic for the summer\nKaren always tagged along and her brother scouting events as a kid and so did Aaron whose six so when she was allowed to officially joined Cub Scouts this past\nSummer it was a dream come true of a family\nThing for all of us so it's really\nNice of unexpected prefer the\nCub Scouts now accepts girls and Aaron likes that she gets to do what her brother does really\nThat they can pay for this\nMyth it's convenient and makes it easier for them to be part of the same organization the boy scouts which is very twelfth grade open to girls this coming February\nPeter who's in sixth grade has been scouting as long as she can remember\nShe likes that his sister gets to do what he's been doing in scouting\nTo really get to see the world and a different picture and behind the scenes where it's community service whether it's cleaning a trail um learning how to shoot I taught at a target the correct way\nCan knows the difference it's made in his own life\nAlliance I'm positive view of themselves and\nTheir community and how they can help other people as well as um cells\nAnd well Boy Scout and goes back generations it's also looking to the future and changing with the times by becoming co ed\nAnd we're already in a world where girls want to be on just to the famous boys you know the corporate world on and port so we have the opportunity now for them to work together in an environment that maybe can challenge each other\n\n... do you make a point beyond that I hadn't thought of before noted for a lot of families um having their kids in one organization real ... is a lot more convenient for them\nWell it really is in kids have so many activities these days they're busier than ever inconvenience is definitely one factor that parents consider and so\nThe boy scouts definitely are making it easier for some families by having both in the same I mean what a cue family the snow salad all of them die hard Boy Scout fans in fact I never knew this but Karen told me that\nThe boy scouts have always allowed girls in the older program so there are certain like a venturing programs for about high school age kids and she did that as\nA you know a high schooler herself and that program continues today as well\nBut what is the reaction because you've been talking to both Girl Scouts organizations and Boy Scouts as this has on folded no we've we've understood this Milford for months and months what has been the reaction from girls go on for ...\nWell you know in my story I did with Girl Scouts they just wanted to make it clear that they're not merging that they are two separate organizations I think that some information that's been put out by various organizations\nUm may was not very clear on that so they want to make it very clear that they are a single sex organization their goal is to help and support and girls and you know as\nA woman myself who did Girl Scouts his daughter did Girl Scouts there are advantages for girls to be in a single sex organization I'm particularly in terms of the confidence so every kid's different every\nFamilies need is different and I think it's great to really look at both and see which is the best fit for you\nAt all clear how the numbers are turning out or the boy scouts or drawing much from the girls go\n[noise] you know I think uh I haven't heard actual numbers yet because really it's right now is when they're just starting to enroll people census announced that just came out and may run run it'll be interesting to see you're right if the numbers for the Girl Scouts change 'em because son decided to join us ... I've heard some joining boat\nSo there's no reason you can't do both of you absolutely love scouting I mean they both offer high adventure they both offer wilderness they both are so many great things and um it's a tough choice because they are both great but how wonderful that there's so many great opportunities\nSo the ... the um the Cub Scouts were the first to store clerk and girls are correct\nRight they're taking girls right now so if you have a younger a girl who's interested you can sign up right now go to kids dot org\nWe have a link to the website or about the boy scouts and the Girl Scouts or you can find a trip outweigh and then starting February they're going to start reading ... older girls it ... what are called\nScouts BFA ... formerly called the boy scouts ... that'll that'll be able to start rolling this winter's not very far away\nKatie Katie these Christine Sorenson with today's kids bird segment Christine thanks as always\nTell my private they\nCan get a new summer coming up on three forty five [noise]\nBut trafficking whether to get her time powers ... fifty one south on top of the hill what are you got Scott\nBanjo things or march or in a moment over on the ... found signs of the park ranger between the boulevard or the allies in ... held tunnels for an approach is before Second Avenue\nYou're slow through point state park and across the lower deck of a foreign through Cambridge heavy on Second Avenue\nFrom the tenth Street Bridge all the way down towards the mental branch started to get through hazing want as won't find Greenfield avenue out bad taste in one avenue\nHe's Carson's flown from ... metal out towards backs Ron rode out by park right west heavy parkway center out towards Carnegie inbound delays begin at Carnegie aren't extroverted three fifty five from Nebraska but Syrian senior care network traffic center I'm Scott snow blower on news radio ten twenty ...\nAccuweather says mostly cloudy rest of the afternoon not as warm in fact temperatures are going to be steady are slowly dropping through the sixties partly cloudy breezy cooler tonight about a lower forty two degrees Katie ... news time it's three forty six\nTogether Hi Martin Blue Cross Blue Shield in Allegheny health network share insights to reduce cancer treatment on my hands when does seem a level of success by marketing aging together and we're helping to gather for you is it together for help dot com [noise]\nLet's get to the one better for us going over to orange today's after being diagnosed with a concussion Matt Murray was on the ice before the ...\nPlay Las Vegas tonight at seven on AT and T. sports that are he says he will be honest with the team as he recovers now he won't play tonight Casey to Smith will start trusting jarring called up to back him up at our current course had to follow the forwards it to help back on defense given they've given up a loving goals and to gain\nI think we have to come back to the park little hard to reveal that support each other better out there and that sort of think it feels like the last ... we were one and done and then those old areas in them that something has to be better at\nAll a matter of likely bench for ... like in likely a net for the nights Marc Andre Fleury played last night ...

starting to see that\nThe cost of wages the labor costs are rising they have to because we as consumers are going to demand that we can't have\nThe uh the CPI the consumer price index the rising to point three percent and then have us just make you know let's say two percent that would be terrible so we have now gone beyond that point I should also be really clear that\nThis is a bad five days stretch okay it is that six percent down in the U.S and the five hundred and five point nine of the doubt eight point seven and the NASDAQ\nThat said you know all the indexes are still up on the year we're talking like we're just had the worst thing in the entire universe all these indexes are still higher on the year and we are still\nFairly close to multi year highs for these indexes so if you're a long term investor men don't sweat it you should just be riding this out stick to your game plan don't second guess yourself\nI think that's the deal I mean I think you're absolutely right I mean there was a time or imminent visit happened to them for two years ago you looked at these numbers\nOr you know people wouldn't would really be jumping out of windows now it seems like we all we ... we do tend to take it more in stride and we're so you know what I can bounce back this will be tomorrow\nAbsolutely and you know the funny thing is that let's say that you are right let's say that five days ago you were the smartest person in the world you said yeah I'm going to sell [laughter] right ... ... you know what it means to try to get back in it is hard that his whole market timing it very difficult to get to\nMarket decisions on timing precisely right it is why every single long term study shows that market timing just doesn't work so why don't drive yourself crazy your long term investor you're in it\nAnd by the way if your country being to your IRA your four one K. you for a through D you got this cat you should feel better than you did ten days ago you're buying at an eight you know six to eight percent discount and we love that six to eight percent discount in the grocery store for all of a sudden it's in the stock market doesn't feel quite as good\nAs ... as well as you mentioned the ball home mortgage rates which are bumped up to four point nine percent this week\nI Wonder what impact are that's going to have on the housing market or I Know the inventory is still a lot of places over there aren't enough houses to buy but um we're kind of ... people on board with all due to know before these rates go over five percent\nWell I think you you would be right if they could find a house to buy and that is truly the challenger right inventory still remains fairly low and so if you look at inventory\nPlus higher mortgage rates plus you know look there the the there's a generation of college graduates who have come out of the\nThey're experiencing university and they had a tough job market they're carrying a lot of debt they're delaying the purchase of a home\nAnd you put all these factors together and it's understandable that\nHousing affordability is actually at a decade low so yes if you run the numbers and you're ready to buy and\nIs it by and you can afford a four point nine percent mortgage don't worry I mean four point nine Joe will tell you he and I bought houses along with it just that were far more extensive\nHe'll presuming you can afford it it's okay but the real downside is if you're reaching I haven't run the numbers and the recession hit how would you survive if your income didn't look exactly the same guys today\nAs always
