absolutely\nUm first buffalo and talk about the uh the unemployment rate OK even in your ad in the news here is that part of the reason that the unemployment rate has dropped is probably due to the hurricanes that hit\nYeah I Do see that I Do some of that because of people don't have jobs to go to and don't have anything [noise] um I lost my train of thought okay today and\nAs far as creating jobs well I'm In a position right now the lecture notes that Westinghouse\nLaying off people and my family happened to be one of the ones that got hit so if everything said great why are people like Westinghouse laying people off and talking about having a second layoff coming up to\n[noise] um and as far as what was going on with um the union\nThe Trump is is not for unions because one of the thing is I was telling you about before what was happening at the VA while they are even though the judge upheld\nThe three executive orders they're now going following through and uh have have filed an appeal on that and and you got the situation going on with US Steel and right now\nAnd lastly on cabin off [noise] I'm not going to get into Dr Ford and that whole thing because I still say they made that into a he said she said and if bill a distraction I was not for Kavanaugh from the very beginning\nAnd the main reason that Trump is pushing calving off is in the beginning he got his list from his federal society\nAfter um Gorsuch got on to the Supreme Court he had to update the list an addict cabin on name and re think Kavanaugh Scott out you know and it's because he's still the one the one judge\nThat belief that you can't indict a sitting president and any thinking that you know the president can't be touched and that was the push around calving off and even Mitch McConnell did not want to have to go through cabin off because he said it was going to be difficult getting it on\nOn getting him approved so that's the distraction with Kevin off\nAll right let me let me and and you did an eloquent job there and I didn't want to interrupt you and you you presented your case a perfectly so let's just move on to this and I want to try to get the thoughts of some of the listeners because you know we are approaching you know the mid term and then I I just ask Anthony so let me just throw these issues out to you and you give me your thoughts are okay\nYou read that OK manufacturing jobs opioid epidemic public schools um energy grid or protecting seniors better tax base protecting veterans and again this is all about encouraging you folks to get out and vote and if you haven't registered registered to vote\nSo what do you think Amy of all of those things heading into the midterms what are some of the big issues do you think\n[noise] um I'm going to say always protecting veterans um they've given the most and asked for the least\nUm for the I think that the energy agree to something that has to be looked at because now you know what everything that's going on with Russia all the spying 'em and him and Trump to pay the thing now which China [noise]\nUm but uh we have to be able to to protect our own protect ourselves we our environment I mean everything has got to start going underground especially with all the things that are going on with the um\n[noise] with the with the floods as well you got to be paying attention to the environment or there's not going to be any reason to get out and vote because there's not going to be a planet left I'm trying to think what else did you say\nOkay I'm like you said what about public schools\n[noise] um [noise] public schools education needs to be addressed um\nUh\nI and my big thing too I still go on go off on this on having guns and protections and stuff like that in school I Can't even imagine what it was like I I've never never had to go to school worry about having to be patted down and go through to go through a metal detector or let alone\nI'm kind of sad isn't it ... whether or not I'm going to have a piece of paper and pencil to take notes on\nYeah and it's sad and you know what in in in this just goes to show you that I'm speaking from my my heart not from being a Democrat or Republican\nNo Child should be worried about what they're going to have the the tools to be able to learn or if their life is going to be in danger because someone's carrying a gun so we need to get away to find more research sources in whether it's paying teachers more hiring more people getting more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting care it party leaders their feet to the fire and the Democrat or a voter should be doing the same thing so they're saying it's it's it's never been better for a politician not for the citizenry I I you know that's that's all that's what I Want to start what do you think about that that I got you other stuff that\nAre yeah let me let me just kind of say one of the things kind of time to time where you were talking about why I agree with you it kinda goes back to and it's before the millennials before generation X and I think we baby boomers\nHave a lot to say about why we should be looking at ourselves in the mirror and blaming ourselves for what's happened in our country\nBecause we got into an age especially with our kids were was winner take all nobody wanted to have any kind of one thing in the way of healthy competition you know and then we started handing out trophies for second place third place for a place that place explains everybody had to get a trophy\nBottom line is you either we're a winner or you couldn't accept being a loser so they created all of these other trophies for people instead of a good\nHealthy scrap something that is competitive it leaves you exhausted at the end of whatever it is four quarters or for periods if it's some sort of sporting event\nIt should be a great stepping stone to teach you how to handle all life's ups and downs and rejection and support and acceptance\nBut more importantly it should teach you that a healthy debate is the best way to go well guess what you exactly what you said moments ago Harry it has to be we win everything and you have nothing to say we want to leave you tattered and literally in shambles at the end of whatever we're debating\nWe're debating there's no sense of let's just shake hands and say let's go about our separate ways unless live to fight another day of the country we live in now\nI say yes Rob and that it's it's not as\nIf the people or going to a horde aren't going to want that though the politicians they don't care they got they got money they're going to pass the health care systems they're going to have their own senator that's the biggest\nMillionaires pop they're going to come out good so it's up it's the little people like that one thing I uh I'm In the pan Iraq by the way out for the unions and one good thing or was that an Anthony brought up was about a a visa or the tax the tax credit that went out\nYes there is no money there is you can go on vacation when you all ... trillion dollars\nThere's there's no money the money is going to come from somewhere and if some guy who makes forty thousand dollars I think he's a big shot\nA like a you know that it's not it's going to be title matter if that's not going to be caught and they're going to do that at at night when nobody's everybody's asleep on the all they're going to be ... I think\nThere was something like that two weeks ago where a medic casual Social Security both things are going to be affected\nNot not not not think it's a common Joe who's going to be heartache\nWell no this I think in this country the reason why we're so upside down\nBecause we're looking at minimum wage is supposed to be a life sustaining jobs those jobs for young people in for seniors looking to supplement their income or for people who want to just socialized get out and do something\nAs opposed to sitting at home and dying on the vine but the problem is we have lost sight on what a good job is listen if you don't make at least Seventy thousand dollars a year\nYou cannot have a life worth sustaining lip lifestyle when it comes to your children meaning paying for a home getting good health care being able to afford an automobile all of the bells and whistles that come with it\nI mean that's what a middle class paycheck is today between Seventy and a hundred thousand dollars a year and until we start to realize that\nWell guess what we as a country are not going to ever get this country turned around look why do you think the steel workers and all of the union workers back in the sixties kept\nAmerica up right in main street kept thriving because they weren't making subsequently what would be compared to that amount and then as far as what I'm saying today we have we have no conception of what a real middle class jobs in this country and that's why we're having such a difficult time Mary\nI I agree with you at the middle class is very very important rom and now it's sort of getting divided either you out there is so much so much money out there\nIt's just it's but it's getting the very few have that little guy he's not getting I just want just like like you said Seventy thousand you go to war you do your work kept doing medical\n... a little house your family that's all right so that's but it's a it's it's the money is shifting the very last slash and that's a it's a and there's more and more money out there too it's amazing I I'm I'm just ... all the stuff that's going on you know\nWell you know one of the economy is getting better it is getting better has given all that good Harry it's getting great a much better I mean the economy is steam rolling\nThat's why you got to swallow your pride and ... and if you are so quick to judge in both people out of office then when we start to see the tumble weeds return than I Want you to call me that and say you don't want I voted with my conscious than I Do what I\nMarches and I do what I Believe was right now it may be right for your conscious but is it right for America for the next generation look a lot of times I voted for people that I might not have been all and on but I believed in their message in what they were doing\nLook I voted for Hillary Clinton folks okay but I see the results of President Trump and what he's doing\nHe's doing exactly what he said he was doing and there's been a refreshing to actually see a politician doing that\nI mean folks like him or not everything you sit on the campaign trail as far back as the Iowa caucuses he said he was going to do this this and this and he's doing it what else do you want\nSo now you're going to throw him under the bus in his administration by voting those members of Congress out so he won't have that control
