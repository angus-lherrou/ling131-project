blow out for a couple of minutes and then all of a sudden there's cool air coming out at the registers\nI turn up the thermostat a little bit higher it'll do if they think hot air will come out for the minute I think one way or it's coming out is there a problem with that term is that\nI Would bet not I would bet it's more of what they call the unlimited switch 'em so I ... just had your furnace service have them come back and have them come back and take a look at it just come and tell me\nExactly what it's doing and have him come back and take a look at it I Can't picture being\nYour thermostat I'm an addict you're more if it's a what they term is a fan limits which on it as far as how much hot air and then it's winding down and so forth that that's a quick unprofessional guess though\nYou go right for heat and left to your air depending on what was the color of the show it'd be saying well my son is blowing their OJ Rob if you got hired as I said I was freezing I'm like my senior like to ice cube what's going on here and I looked in here I had the air conditioning on I go to Sharon\nIn butler Pennsylvania hey Sharon walking the gate to gate radio\nThank you a morning gentleman learning I'm I'm having a problem in my basement and I have multiple floor dreams in my basement and garage it's an ethical garage mhm and periodically I get an odor coming up for my for giants okay and it's not sewage nothing's backing up into the basement garage\nIt's just a smell that permeates the basement and goes up into the the house now um I did try pouring water down all the drain thinking that maybe there was a trap or something that dried out\nNow setting next water with bleach and put it down and I'm not saying I was wondering if you had any idea what it was and if there was a product\nI could use to eliminate that are\nWell you've done the right thing or by pouring water down those trains are I don't know if you have the type of drain that has the trap that you can see for the type that is beneath the floor I'm at\nMy feet beneath the floor there's nothing doesn't fall to me\nThere is no bell shaped designed to the floor drain itself\nOkay ah I Would do two things first I Would not be stingy with the amount of water that you put down each of those trains okay with\nSeveral gallons down those trains the ideas to to fill that trap and then allow it to stay filled okay so that would be my first thing they'll be stingy go ahead and put a five gallon bucket of water down each of those trains\nThe second thing that I Would do is a lot of times the accumulation and those drains over years ah will emit a followed or that is very hard to control unless you get rid of some of the build up where the debris or on the pipes for themselves\nAnd for that we always recommend a product called drained care\nUm it's an enzyme based products so it's not an acid it's not as strong a solution of\nA synthetic chemicals it's all natural you pour it in the drain and you don't have to be shy about that either because it's not going to do any harm um you pour down the drain and you let it a kind of naturally eat away some of the build up that's occurred over the years on those pipes and that can help to control it\nAs well the third thing that I Would do is if you've done all those things the third thing that I Would do that the smell of sewer gas and the smell of a dead mouse are incredibly similar\nSo if you continue to have that problem in your basement look around for a dead road and that is very common people will search and search through their dreams for this smell a sewer gas when in reality somewhere in the corner there is a dead chipmunk or dead mouse so don't rule that out those things are all really important to check in super simple\nOkay now the product was called drained care\nCorrect drink care it's it's green is a clear bottle is the green liquid I'm very very safe to use non caustic um I I Would make sure that I Would you know make sure that your bleach is out of there so rents that bleach out of there but other than that allowed the drain care to work\nAnd uh you should see good results but again don't eliminate the thought that there may be a dead a little dead critter down there somewhere\nOkay sounds good thank you for the advice\nWhile you're like looking at me 'cause I actually I was thinking about that [laughter] I just I was you know me I'm this clean freak and I'm honored and he's my kitchen sink and I'm like what\nFor the advice sure why why you like looking at me because I actually I was thinking about that [laughter] I just I was you know me I'm this clean freak and I'm underneath my kitchen sink and I'm like what side poor some cause I don't use my sink as much because I'm a bachelor okay some does not like I got a ... the washed so I thought maybe had among some water there and it actually did go away but\nYou know that's a very good idea to uh you know look into the

which is just three months away and I thought you know\nI Want to make sure the family has something just so they can make that next transition and lo and behold I get an email from Tracy Edwards telling me that today we're going to be talking about that and why AAA becoming the choice of many\nPossibly me to take that next step when it comes to deciding their life insurance policy in terms of how they want to basically move forward in their life so those that they love taking care of\nAfter their life so Tracy good to see you today along with a trip and crews will be can travel in the first half hour we're going to focus on life insurance and I think people are going to be very surprised on what you're doing a triple a central\nYeah yeah Robin dug it morning and good morning Pittsburgh and uh you know this is a\nYou know we talk about the different business lines of AAA well we have to offer everybody knows road service of course you listen to the show for the last\nUh twenty six years we've been on the air\nOr we talk travel but we also have those other uh\nAh yeah and the price will include you round trip transfer or to the airport hotel transportation to and from the game six nights hotel accommodations luggage handling a one bag per person three meals are included two of them into the pre game receptions\nA reserve sitting to two games taxes or two days for the included features as well\nAnd you can ask for a about the uh the air transportation obviously a from Pittsburgh to Fort Lauderdale is included as well obviously\nA for this one and the raid on this\nUh per person is based on double occupancy in his one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine dollars\nPer person based on double occupancy six nights accommodations round trip there you're two tickets a two to one ticket for each game so that's two tickets so we have some sight seeing and therefore you and I can tell you that the hotel locations are really really good on this one and what a great time to get out of Pittsburgh\nAnd I get away and go to Florida is in a in the early part of February because we all know what it's going to be like here\nThe other game I just want to mention real quick\nI is the penguins versus blue jackets this was a one night motor coach trip uh it's march ninth through the tenth\nA and a we'll have a transportation for you have met her coach transportation\nOr this when you have your one night hotel accommodations at the ... convention center down in Columbus\nA reserve sitting for the blue jackets gain\nA while that an exclusive AAA penguins logo gift to ... as well two meals are included a and we have some sightseeing will have set up for you as well taxes and gratuities on included items\nAre in addition of course we have our AAA tour manager with a with a group to make sure they go smoothly as well so uh we have a a few states sold on this one as well already a and we do have a uh some seats are obviously available so give us a call one eight hundred\nThree five for eight seven six one will get you all set up here for the uh the penguins season and uh they they were lighting a lamp off the other night Rob did the nine I watched I saw the first period it was three nothing at the end of their first and then I look up the next morning and I heard a a lit up what nine times uh so I was a pretty good game\nOn course had to uh also of course Mr Cosby got a goal and they just see in forty six saves from from Matt Murray that's good yeah yeah that's that's real good but\nWhat amazes me is the fact that penguins fans will travel Tracy\nYeah they do and you see it all the time and uh you know one of the destination as you said a lot as in Columbus ah you know it's it easy for a low easy drive for a motor coach to get there um and we take care of all the arrangements for you or you know on that trip and of course you see him in DC you see 'em\nAll blue jacket tickets are going to really be in demand especially for Iowa State plays like they did last week against Purdue [laughter] that I left ... first thing I thought of when I saw that a win talked Tracy off the ledge what what happened there do you know what ... does anybody know what the hell is\nFind a story on that raw because I was a thirty nine thousand feet during the game so I didn't get to see it I didn't know what I was going on in Atlanta I was going to find out the Phoenix and I got the Phoenix and the the sky kept coming up to me he goes hey ah you know what the score is for the high stakes\nSee it I didn't know what I was going on and Atlanta I was going to find out the Phoenix and other Phoenix and the the sky kept coming up to me he goes\nHey ah you know what the score is for the ... of course I had a shirt on or something out of this and I said no I don't I just got here I just I didn't get a chance to look cases where they were losing but they'll come back they always come back\nAnd I looked up the score and I said Twenty one to sex in the end of the third quarter so ah yeah the buckeyes took one a write in the right in the get out and bought it\nWas back quarterbacking Purdue I mean he actually was the quarterback of the Miami Dolphins corps hall of famer I I'm Still shocked\nYeah yeah that makes two of us well I'm a little nervous next week 'cause they have Nebraska so a\nLow fully they'll they'll go right the ship but why do you think penguin fans love to travel I mean I I mean let's face it I mean you could pretty much had them playing anyone and in the phones are going to ring off the hook\nWell the reason why they like to travel and especially travel with triple a is because the everything is taken care of job\nAre looting the ticket ... yeah including the tickets are and ah just to give you a little bit of background on the tickets when we go out looking for tickets we go out and get the best price tickets we don't try to get the you know the the cheaper tickets to keep the cost down or whatever the case might be because\nAt the end of the day the pain when fans want good seats\nAre great experience and uh that's our goal a triple a is to give everyone a great trip in a in ... when they're traveling on these penguin road trips I guess the game as the probably the big reason why you're there so we want to make sure that we have the uh the best seats for every one\nUh you know for these games so that that that's the big plus there and plus you get to do some site saying we do we take them off the beaten path a little bit maybe places they wouldn't go to on their own some opportunities as I mentioned down in Florida and and so forth so I think that uh that that is the big key why a lot of people travel with AAA to go on the road\nAll right and you can get everything you need a AAA dot com slash rated that whole tenor of that he just mentioned then you want to call right away even do today are stopping one eight hundred three five or eight seven six one now crews of the week royal Caribbean anthem overseas\nYeah what's nice about this Robin and I know I don't have much time to get all this and so folks visit us a triple A. dot com slash radio or for the itinerary is the the the specifics and so forth for these trips but uh I I have three sailing so we have three failings\nA little bit different itinerary for each one\nUm they'll go over the first one real quick we have an April twenty six through may fourth\nAnd what will happen is will will motor coach from Pittsburgh or to New York\nOr the Cape and then that will sail from Cape liberty or New Jersey is where the ship all your aboard the ship but we do a pre night overnight or in New Jersey so we take our time getting there we don't have to worry about any delays

Sabbath services [noise] also I'm told that there was a [noise] a brisk say a a a a Jewish shows circumcision a ceremony\nOr in the basement that he went through the building shooting almost indiscriminately a shouting these anti Semitic\nA spouting ... about all Jews must die\nA he has been taken into custody we do not see that but we do know that um [noise] he shot through the building the people are huddled are trying to others of fled uh and that are in in the initial a response of law enforcement of one police officer was shot\nI read the report or any scenes that it's a conservative a synagogue can you describe what that means I'm\nA conservative synagogue is one that um is a traditional yet open to a change in adaptation to my ... I think it's easiest way to uh to say [noise]\nSorry [noise]\nThank you so much that I think and if\nWe are still I'm Out here with us we were just speaking with the c._e._o.\nAnd the Jewish Federation of greater Pittsburgh we are here and a staging area we hope to also hear again from Mayor Bill de Vito he had come out to us a little bit ago with the Pittsburgh Police spokesman Chris there he said once he gathers more information he will address the media\nSo that it will likely be the next day from us we're at the corner of Murray and north ...\nYou just heard from him he said that he will now go and alert and many people and he described for um for many people that are watching beyond Pittsburgh what this means for people in squirrel hell and for people of the Jewish faith\nWe of course will break back in whenever we receive another update here at ... at the corner of marine\nAnd north ... which is where they had the media stage they won't let us get any closer Marie avenue what the staging Center for police it has seemed to die down a little bit right now in terms of the officers that were running through in tactical gear and ambulances we still hear some sirens and the defense right now we're going to continue\nYeah I could die down a little bit right now in terms of the officers that were running thrilling tactical gear an ambulance as we still hear sirens and they just stand right now we're going to continue to talk with neighbors anyone who possibly could have heard the gunshots were only a few blocks from the tree of life synagogue every now and we're going to send it back you guys today I'm\nFrom San Francisco to ask for the Arab Neal again again last apple that more full three officer shot that ... percent or ... I live up here with us from San ... getting her information from first ... or ... or five by pro gun handy\nAdding the necessary a provider that there may be additional that's eight confirmed there may be additional police won't be able to say until they have a full grasp of that situation let's go to Andy right now here I don't know [noise] and you go ahead you're alive [noise]\nOkay so we are we are back here at the north on Berlin and shady ways we're still about a block away from the tree of life for the synagogue\nWe see people that were in the search services this morning or they are now at the perimeter area I've spoken briefly with some of them are they are they are in shock and slowly the the reality of\nA horrific situation is sinking in and uh and they are now in mourning and they are crying I've spoken with them briefly um police officers and detectives or telling us to hold off they are trying to take\nStatements I'm from these people they are now going to do sort of a a forensic\nUm mapping of this of this event and they want to take witness statements\nUm before they talk to any media to find out what happened a re recapping we know that a suspect is in custody after a shootout with police are on the third floor the synagogue\nThis after he shot and killed at least eight people\nAre we know that in all three police officers were shot\nA and wounded we know that one a police officer initially\nUh was shot a ... not in the not in a a a life threatening manner but may have been shot in the hands of we know the two officers were shot in the exchange of gunfire with this ah this government on the third floor\nA but we did not know the extent of their injuries\nWe know that uh there was a negotiation that the gunman was injured a and that there was a negotiation and that he eventually crawled into the custody of police uh we did not see the gum and we did not see we did not see him or to be taken away from this vantage\nUm but ah he is in custody and police are taking statements from them [noise] ah\nWe know from police sources that he came into this building that was crowded with the ship bought and uh people attending a British ceremony and indiscriminately shot up the building a shouting anti Semitic statements that all Jews must die\nA we know that this is a hate crime we know this is a a a horrific mass shooting that\nHappened a throughout the United states of America uh but now it has happened within the city of Pittsburgh in this very quiet a\nKnown as a squirrel hill known sometimes as a Jewish neighborhood probably about a thirty forty percent a Jewish pots\nThis is known as a scroll hill known sometimes as a Jewish neighborhood probably about a thirty forty percent a Jewish population but a known throughout the throughout the history of of the city of Pittsburgh\nAs a as having a large Jewish population that is why this uh apparently why this gunman um selected this neighborhood and the synagogue back to you\nAll right at any uh quickly before we go we heard there may be you know several dozen people attending the Sabbath services just wanting to know where\nWhere are people are they still are on the scene have they been taking some of what the status of those who were uh witnesses and not among the injury [noise]\nUh [noise]\nWe may have lots of ... when we want to get back to make an ... former president of the trans why it took a little provide a little bit more insight and something to take place on a Saturday morning like I'm\nThinking of his name is Michael ... he's the immediate past president upstream I synagogue he said he stepped down from the position a few months ago and he's going to speak with us right now he can offer some insight about what I Would have been happening happy hour that the gunman went inside the synagogue what had been happening around nine forty five right\nForty five there was three when\nThey're three simultaneous congregations\nServices that are being held in the main part of the building tree of life is having a service that has about a forty people and it just below that service area there is a\nBasement area where new congregation would be having bury Shabaab service they would also be happy to have around for thirty to forty people\nAnd then just the Jason to tree of lights a service area congregation ... is an a and a rabbi study room and they would have a proximity Fifteen people and there are just off all of these are just off the main entrance to the building\nWe're hearing reports that people being found in in a tree on and in a basement to the atrium it's just that entering that entrance way area\nThere's a common atrium area where you could it's a central part of the building it leads up to the services but often times there are people milling around in that area either going to the ah ladies or a men's room or the coke room\nAnd I'm a person that's walking past the corner Wilkinson shady at that time can I Walk in freely is there anyone that would greet me at the door or stop me not\nTypically on a on a day to day like today uh the the door is open a it's a religious service you could walk in and out ah only on the ah high holidays is there a police president President at the entrance\nYou mentioned to me when you were president ... again if you're just tuning in you or that they'll they'll live in the immediate past president how big of a concern was security for for you\nIt was a a major a concern for me for us a return we're working with a homeland the department of homeland security to evaluate a\nExit routes I just spoke to our a maintenance person who was able to get out because the doors were easily open from the inside to allow him to get out of the building\nBut it was a major focus working with bread or see any of the the Jewish Federation he's a security expert what to do when an active shooter situation active\nShooter training we're working with the other synagogues on what to do with uh something horrific like this happen\nElse have you talk to you that was inside it\nWorking with the other synagogues on what to do with uh something horrific like this happen\nTo have you talked to that was inside at the time of the shooting in what they told you so far\nUh the main person the one person that I did speak to I Know really well the ... the maintenance per se one of our maintenance people there he's been there twenty five years is usually a very cool and collected person he was shaking he saw a\nOne of our congregants down ah\nHe but he knew he was in the who's in the bathroom and he was able to get out of the building or again because these exit doors were\nWorking well when I I just can't tell you how thankful I Am just to have been to that one piece of a one task that homeland security told us to do\nBecause in the past including pushed through the accent they learn\nEasily opens and uh they had said these on them so that they couldn't open either way but now a day when he was able to get out I mean he could be alive because of the ones that my my son\nAnd you find there were you when you found out that they had a conversation\nThat I was heading up to the service I mean I'm there every ... I was there last night for service I when I go up there on ten o'clock in\nThe in the morning and uh one of the vice presidents that I work with on facilities now but I stepped down he called me he works for the city emerged since the management and he said he just got word that there's an active shooter a tree of life go up there and see if this is true and I try to get up I only live a block away from a\nJust continue to arrive here you know this was an all points bulletin up people came from a law enforcement came from all over the region the Pittsburgh SWAT Team and the Allegheny county SWAT Team\nWhen I got here this morning a they were a ... officers were crouch behind vehicles are heavily armed a heavily armored\nAre ready to go in um at one point uh sometime around ten thirty or they did all a storm the building and that's when they were able to trap this uh this gum and on the third floor and that's when this uh this situation all ended\nRight now I'm the ah the the ... do do I'm told and the others uh the governors on his way rich Fitzgerald who also lives in this neighborhood\nA are setting up some sort of staging area and there'll be statements or later but right now Ken this neighborhood is in is in shock and awe and dismay over of what has transpired here this morning\n[noise] candy thank you for that let's go now to John Sherman way and live again PNC Presbyterian Hospital John what do you know about any victims being treated their [noise]\nUP MC just issued a statement a couple of minutes ago can as saying that they are treating multiple patients Harry UP AMC praise be as we speak let me step aside\nSo you can see the emergency entrance behind me I Will tell you there are two police cars they're backed up to the emergency entrance and multiple ambulances parked along the walkway headed over towards the main entrance to the are\nI've also seen a few family members who've arrived here and run inside the ER heard one gentleman say my wife is one of the shooting victims [noise] ah it's business of a very active situation because we still have units coming in police cars arriving there was a police car they pulled in by that had a member of the Pittsburgh SWAT Team in it\nOr they went inside the hospital or his it's just very active now a little bit earlier as since this is a level one trauma center and we see another Pittsburgh Police car are coming into the ER is I speak\nBut because this is a level one trauma center and they are designed to handle situations like this uh they went to their highest code bringing everybody possible end of the ... walked over there a few minutes ago\nAnd there were a number of uh shall we say gallon up a mass downs the whole bit um medical personnel standing on the porch\nRight outside the ER waiting for the next patients to come in as well as a number of uniformed officers there are police here obviously in great numbers and in some of them are heavily armed or the situation here we do not know whether the suspects been brought here or not but we have seen detectives arrive\nWhich would lead us to believe that he may very well be here and being treated as we speak but UP AMC says it will issue more information as we go along here this morning\nBut right now they literally are trying to sort out the numbers I talked with a U. P. M. C. spokesman poll would and I ask you have a number of how many people were you trading here\nAnd he said we're hearing numbers but there are conflicting so we're trying to get that all sorted out and so that they can put out the information and obviously at some point we will hear from the medical professionals are here at U. P. M. C. press being their level one trauma center as to how many people they're handling how seriously wounded they were [noise]\nUh and obviously mortality numbers at those are in existence here in\nHeaven knows we hope they aren't the situation again still unfolding we hear sirens periodically\nSo far in existence here in heaven knows we hope they are\nThe situation again still unfolding we hear sirens periodically of more units coming this way although that is starting to subside substantially which is obviously very good news\nBut the worker to monitor here Ken and and at this point all we know multiple victims but they're not saying exactly how many victims are being treated here at ... pm see for his material hospitals and this is this I mentioned it is a level one trauma center this is what they do and what they do well so\nThey had everybody and their brother in that emergency room waiting for the people coming in from tree of life as soon as we know anymore numbers I'll get back to you with that but for now from a new P. M. C. back to John\nJust to clarify did I understand you to say that one police officer brought another police officer who was injured in his own car to the hospital\nI Will tell you Ken that\nDidn't that is what it appeared\nNow I couldn't get close enough to the officer who was going into the ER to see what his situation was that is what it appeared\nFrom standing on the other side of the sidewalk they came in with a cyber lights going ah pulled abruptly up to the curb and uh the SWAT Team member was helped inside that whether or not that is the case I could not verify that I Would just tell you that that certainly would have helped inside the walk on his own\nWe injured ... absolutely walked in on his are John thank you so much we\nStill don't have an exact number the last decade God was eight confirmed they ... a ... and now hearing that that number could have ... I understand that there are multiple enter ...\nUm that we don't know exactly the number online either three officers injured and we do know that and we are waiting for confirmation out on the name of the stuff that is in custody and possibly in herself right\nMaking Schiller a can join us five Megan understand or just one moment we'll verify way of making available\nIn the meantime I just to bring you up to ... all took place around the ten o'clock this morning at the tree of life synagogue that's located at ... in the squirrel hill neighborhood\nIn the tree of life synagogue they were actually three congregations that he was out of their home is they're ... on the a shooter came in through the front doors started to ... a chance to anti Semitic statements all Jews must die as something that ... had heard that the stuff that was yelling as he entered the synagogue\nA multiple people shot in that first floor and that is where four people were killed\nFor additional people shot and killed on the in the basement and that is where the new light congregation hold their services and then the stuff that can solve went up to the third part that's where the officers were finally able to ... surround him and get him to surrender\nIndustry and using the word crawl to describe the way the suspect gave himself up after this confrontation on the third floor of the understanding is that the suspect this white bearded man a name working we're working to confirm a was captured and injured in the process but we don't know the extent of\nThe suspects injuries are one of their notes altered ice ... all the rights was supposed to play Westinghouse today for the city league championship you will not be surprised to know that game has been postponed because of a [noise] because of the shooting happened very close to all their eyes high school\nI got our time was also on the in the morning and she put out a statement just a short while ago than the shooting in Pittsburgh It's MORNING as an absolute tragedy I've spoken with local leaders and ... and the Pennsylvania state police and will provide any resources to assess local law enforcement and first responders and we know they're going to need assistance\nQuestion let's go back lived out in ... in any [noise]\nIt's all star trek our local law enforcement efforts respond are going to have a question let's go back lived out anti she an anti [noise]\nWell can I mean people are just in shock here um you know the the reality of this is is a is slowly sinking in or maybe not not even right now you know just think that uh as many you know we we've confirmed that eight people are dead or\nWe're hearing that as many as ... eleven people are dead a shot by this uh this gunman or who came into the synagogue a this morning shouting anti Semitic\nStatements all Jews must die and shooting indiscriminately I'm here with Marvin fine a Mormon used to be the city solicitor for the city of Pittsburgh right and ah you live in the neighborhoods and uh\nUsed to go to this go you go to another synagogue now but what's ah what's the reaction to the neighborhood\nHaven't really talked to anyone in neighborhoods does matter of fact oddly enough I got the first reported this shooting for a friend in Canada or this or\nListen to hit the international lines apparently quickly now\nIt's just an awful tragedies is uh\n[noise] it's one of the things that we've come to expect in this country now with all the hatred guns\nHymns something's got to happen to bring us together is is\nThings look really bad now you're saying guns in hate guns and hatred or what led to this this uh [noise] um\nThere's always been hatred of Jews in this coming out more\nMore anti Semitism in the country I think there's more anti Semitism maybe not more anti Semitism more outspoken anti Semitic is\nNow you are longtime resident no squirrel hill I'm a longtime resident we we haven't had there's no tension in this neighborhood that you could\nDo fear no this is a great neighborhood to live in in a just a terrible tragedy for neighborhoods or\nThe you know life has changed now for good and and squirrels\n[laughter] I don't know if it's changed for good that's a\nI mean it's still a good neighborhood and the pay for still fundamentally could this uh [noise] I don't say one bad\nPerson with a gun can change the character for the neighborhood [noise]\nSo you know what's going to take a long time for this to sink in you know the information that we do have you know I've tentatively identified a the shooter as Rob our or we know that he's forty eight years old uh you know he's described as a heavy set white male with a beard\nAnd we are told a as Heather mentioned governor was on a scene here\nWe have yet to hear from governor well if we've also to to talk with mayor built due to accept a couple of passing words he said he's currently just trying to get up to speed with the latest information and he is expected to address the media\nAll the you probably heard on a very quick update from Pittsburgh Police spokesman Chris how Mary all he would say for us right now is it's still very active situation multiple ...\nAnd now they tell us they're going to need us to move out of the way as they get another Pittsburgh Police cruiser [noise]\nOut of this area again worth a staging area Marie avenue and north um Berland [noise]\nWe're going to send it back to you guys in the studio and um we come back to us in a little bit hopefully we will get another update from Pittsburgh Police within minutes out here and the staging area all the media has congregated athletes intersection and we are hoping to talk with city officials in just a few moments matchmaking\nThing to uh some comments on Twitter coming out from Jonathan Green black the c._e._o. of the Anti Defamation league quote we are devastated\nJews targeted Shabaab morning at a synagogue a holy place of worship is unconscionable our hearts break

in addition to the eight fatalities from there is an unknown number of wounded we noticed multiple patients have been sent to P. M. C. Presbyterian Hospital\nA it is possible that other hospitals in that area may have received patients were working as we speak to gather all this information and to find out the extent of those injuries\nAnd and they believe that that number may have increased because we do not know the extent of those injuries we don't know what some of them more life threatening as they were rushed to the hospital\nWe also know that three officers were injured I'm Andy was hearing from some of his sources that one of the officers math and strengthen the hand but again we don't know that the ... the other two\nUm than we are still working to get more information on some way or the parents to save one office are carrying another helping interesting another officer in St ... where we understand a number of patients are being treated\nUh people are saying this is an anti Semitic act because of what the gunman said\nThe gunman was heard a shouting anti ... anti Semitic rhetoric including all Jews must died as he began indiscriminately firing at people at this congregation or a tree of life this morning a tree of life one of a several\nProminent synagogues in a squirrel he'll section of Pittsburgh uh there at the corner Wilkinson shade you have a ... a reform congregation and Fifth Avenue not far from saint Peter [noise] uh from Saint Paul excuse me you have um\n[noise] uh you have ... which is just a couple of blocks away I just tougher shape you have enough of this is this is a landmark in the Jewish community it's a it's part of the foundation of squirrel hill and it's it's almost impossible to imagine the number of families the number of lives\nThat have connected at some point with his congregation for ah for some type of ceremony for relatives a observance of something it is the kind of place that has that has been a part of many lives over time reading many generations\nAnd we know that if in fact that people even here at Katy KF a friend you know people who attend to their attend themselves um we are still working again to get all of these health confirmed eight people confirmed dead that we know of\nWe understand that when the gunman entered as Ken had just mentioned was shouting anti Semitic slur thing all Jews must die reportedly\nI'm In the first floor on the first floor a we understand that\nShannon Lynch shouting anti Semitic slur thing all die reportedly [noise]\nI'm In the first floor on the first floor we understand them better where four people were shot and count the number of other entered down in the sand where new light congregation home they are starting to than than they were making about ... minutes into it for other people shot in ...\nWe have enough they now from John ... at Presbyterian Hospital John go ahead [noise]\n[noise] yeah we're waiting are still to hear numbers from UP AMC I'm exactly the number of people we have here but I Want to make clear one thing that uh you'd be MC called me to let me know the suspect is not here [laughter]\nI talked to Allegheny General Hospital just a second ago and they told me that they have one patient\nAnd they're being treated they would not confirmed that it was the shooter\nWhat they did indicate that there is one patient in Allegheny General Hospital is being traded treated the risk to come to you the emcee facilities now again UP MC egg issuing a statement just before\nA Nunes saying that they are treating multiple patients hearing you PM say they're not giving us any indication on the severity of the injuries but clearly there were a lot of ambulances that arrived here and a lot of police officers has arrived here\nWhen you step out of the ways you can see what's going on behind me most of the ambulances that arrived early on with the victims have\nNow cleared out of here of for the most part will we have is a heavy police presence that in fact I don't know if you can see him at the moment that there was an officer up there who has a canine unit [noise] um they're just making sure that this the our\nArea is very secure and there is a there's a logic or to the idea that they would not bring the shooter to the same hospital where the victims game but again Allegheny General Hospital was not confirming that the one person that they are training is the shooter\nA flood the UP MC has told us very specifically the shooter in this did not come to a U. P. M. C. facility he was taken somewhere else and of course HGH is the only other level one trauma center here in West in the Pittsburgh area\nNow you'd be MC tells us that they are still trying to sort everything out inside they have apparently a lot of people that are dealing with\nIn a range of injuries are the severity of which would they have not reveal to us as yet but they called everybody and their brother into the emergency room as they do in a level one trauma center in a situation like this\nSo that they would have multiple people on hand\nTo handle the victims at one point there were quite a few of the medical staff completely down with a mask on and everything standing outside waiting for the next and victims to arrive in an ambulance I Will tell you now but that has changed a everyone is inside at this point\nAnd again the detectives in fact the the first vehicle you see there by it looked like he was three homicide detectives who got out of it and went inside a lot of questions to be asked about the victims when they can talk\nClearly and we've also seen family members arriving here want to go back to something that we mentioned a little bit earlier where there was a city police guard\nWho arrived lights and sirens I mean he was flying and he came up into went directly to the entrance to a ER and um [noise] they got out ran around the other side and it appeared that he helped a a a SWAT Team member\nOut of the the vehicle and inside ER we could not see at that point by Eddie injuries or what exactly the SWAT Team officers situation was but clearly he was delivered here by a fellow officer in the foreground\nBreeze or what exactly the SWAT Team officers situation was\nBut clearly he was delivered here by a fellow officer in the foreground eh you can see now the police canine unit that he was walking in the area and uh the detectives a returning to their vehicle is well the situation here actually very calm at this point most of the [noise]\nObviously the activity earlier to bring the victims here has subsided and now it's just a matter of the professionals VP AMC and their trauma wandering unit are doing what they do to minimize the damage that was done by this shooter and again I Want to mention again\nThe shooter apparently was not broad and in fact the emcee very specifically called me to say do you ... that the shooter was not brought\nTo U. P. M. C. facility in Allegheny General Hospital confirming just before I came on the air that they are treating one shooting victim\nOr at their hospital and again uh\nBe given I joined the\nWe didn't have any productivity out of rain here on\nSearchers and other\nWere to think the president the fair and one of the things he said he said they had a maniac maniac walk in and they did not have any protection and he was asked if having an armed security guard at houses of worship would help and he says I hate to think of it that way but perhaps things would have gone differently if somebody would have been\nIsrael now are expressing it's shocking concerned about what happened here in Pittsburgh this morning Israel Opry assistance\nTo the local community here following this shooting minister Naftali Bennett Israel's cabinet minister for diaspora fares are committed following the um the ward that they received there when they received the news but\nAre these people had been killed in Pittsburgh this morning a minister says she's following the news with concern as instructed Israel's ministry of diaspora fares to prepare to assist the community at every possible way of getting our hearts go out to the families of those killed and injured made the memory of the murder be blessed\nEleven forty five ... about an hour ago that was the last Halloween got an official updates\nFrom UPN the on the patients that are being treated at ... pm the ... they said that they are treating multiple patients they're related to the incident at tree of life synagogue and the squirrel hill neighborhood as rapidly changing situation will have enough data center to become available and John shall we have been there\nFor several hours now this morning working to get some more information seemed to learn that at least one person\nWith being treated at age ... H A there is some question if that\nCould in fact the the the stuff back to what appeared to be injured when he was being taken into custody that warning\nOn at this point we don't know we don't have confirmation on where that thought that was taken still also waiting for official word on his name eight people confirmed dead and ... is hearing that number could grow a estimating that there may be eleven dead but we again are still waiting for officials to get those numbers\nJust a further noted you may not have seen the entire interview with\nUh estimating that there may be eleven died but we again are still waiting for officials to get those numbers\nAnd just a further note if you may not have seen the entire interview with President Trump there she was about to leave for Indianapolis he's going to meet with young farmers and he said he would speak more about this but his initial message was a expressing sympathy and saying well they have this wasn't that perhaps had there been an armed guard\nAt the synagogue this morning I'm witness maniac walked into the president's words uh this this may not have happened [noise] governors\nHung wants to release a statement he is actually on scene\nAt the tree of life the synagogue and have released a statement after arriving there this morning saying the shooting in Pittsburgh this morning as an absolute tragedy I've spoken with local leaders in my ... and the Pennsylvania state police will provide any resources to us that's a local law enforcement and first responders\nHe goes on to say that the senseless acts of violence or not who we are as Americans my thoughts right now our focus on the victims their families and making sure law enforcement has every resource they need that's coming from ... in our town with earlier this morning on\nBut we know that kind of executive rich Fitzgerald on saying they're built to do on saying police chase fire ... I mean they are all all hands on deck there they are trying to assist those who need help and also to figure out what exactly happened this morning why why\nThe ah the bottom line as we speak now at almost a quarter to one is that a suspect is in custody victims are being treated at the hospital and again the questions\nBees are going to continue for a while and we await a briefing from police we have several reporters on the scene in squirrel hill they have been on the move a little bit as police sort of changed the boundaries of the scene where they're allowed to be and as they are presumably begin to set up\nTo give us that first official briefing when we get to hear from the mayor the county executive\nUh so we're waiting for those details and of course the entire Pittsburgh bureau of police\nOr the entire workforce the city of Pittsburgh so many of us uh in the city at large waiting to hear about these three officers who were injured or you know gunfire rings up that people make the point whenever there's um\nAn instance where people go running out of gunfire it's the police officers who go running toward that sound of gunfire and does the hearts of this whole city or go out to the pits were bureau police as we wait to hear more information about this officers who were injured\nHow seriously you of those injuries are and what happened on that third floor this morning when police confronted\nThe suspect and eventually brought him into custody\nI'm Ken on that note about the the people who are helping we've been talking this morning about that community\nThat scroll hill community is tight knit community and stuff and it struck by with the Pittsburgh Post Gazette our new partner just posted a short time ago that um a couple and their names are adding Trevor horse they brought doughnuts and coffee out for people at the scene\nI'm a neighborhood known for its strong Jewish community she simply at at the last line they simply wanted to do something to help their neighbors and that's what's happening right now people are reaching out they want to be there they want to show as much love and support as they can and this man's tragedy that taking place this morning\nI make and tell us and it's taking with pass rabbis to add to that from the synagogue we've heard from ... who was working with his police sources to get some more information about the suspect\nUm believe to be um an a for a in his forties possibly a white male with a beard is pretty much what we know\nUh just set the scene once again what was happening this warning seven services tree of life congregation and it is a building where three distinct congregations meat you have the main tree of life congregation you have a new un another congregation and most\nBuilding where three distinct congregations meat\nYou have the main tree of life congregation you have a new un another congregation and moved and not too long ago called new light\nCongregation they have their services in the tree of life building's basement and then a third congregation door had dodged a smaller number of people who maintain the rabbi study they all were having Santa services this morning and as the former rabbi Chuck diamond said\nUh Jews come late to services um he said that was fortunate today because perhaps there could have been more victims when the gunman a came in with evil intent and he said as I mentioned earlier\nHe said he thought about this this type of thing happening all the time all the time instead of being able to concentrate on\nThe service on prayer on bringing people together this was a thought he had in the back of his mind constantly he said there's hate in this world that we have to have tolerance and fight hate by doing good things acts of love and kindness it's if\nWe can all here these things we can I say these things but for those people who are victimized this morning [noise] uh it's um you know there is any immediate need for\nHaving to park exactly and that's um you know there are lots of reasons why this happened or a greater context to it but for these people in scroll hill this morning it's about killing these immediate one's very raw right now that\nWhat we don't know how many people fall into the Pentagon at the time of death on mentioned that some people may have arrived late and that it's a good thing but we don't know within three congregations and the Pentagon how many people were there\nWe understand when the gunman entered the synagogue adjusted for or around ten o'clock this morning on NBC and described him as a birth thing and I can't sing anti Semitic statements saying at one point all Jews left dying opening fire\nWe understand that on the first floor where the trans lifestyle hold their services\nOn that for people were shot and killed there are multiple other wounded in the basement then another four shot and killed\n'em and then more wounded and that location I we understand the gunmen went up to the third floor and that is where the eventually surrendered and was wounded somewhere along that process that described as crawling out in the surrender\nI Believe any Shane with us now some new information Andy [noise]\nBook in which still on the scene things are are kind of winding down around the synagogue um today are are searching the building a you know ... they are leaving no stone unturned to find out if there was anyone\nElse with this gunman of it is believed to at this point that he acted alone and um you know that he had no other accomplices I Am piecing together information about the gun\nThere are so you don't belong to a tree of life synagogue but you certainly know people\nWhat are you thinking this morning you said you even heard some possible names of the people that could have been killed or or one\nAbsolutely we do not belong there but we have a lot of friends and family or some family members that belong and\nYou know where we're just starting to hear trickling in of other names and you know possible injuries and it's just [noise] he\nCannot even imagine that it happens right here in your own neighborhood and he can't feel safe anywhere

to find out\nWell as the numbers because we heard early on that there were as many as a forty\nOr people inside the synagogue when the shooting started and it certainly talks about the um the number of people but we don't know how many people were actually injured or before the the fire the shooting a was stopped so we're still waiting to hear and what I can tell you is\nWhen we do know that the shooter was injured or in exchange with the police but early on reports that uh he was brought here apparently are not true you're the emcee called me to tell me that the shooter was not brought to

of investigation will be taking over the investigation they are expected to hear much more friends are all coming up at four o'clock that's in just a little shy of three hours or here right now at the corner of north on Berlin and Murray out\nRight now you're listening to decay TV coverage of the shooting earlier today at\nTree of life synagogue and scroll hill this mass shooting requires an expert look at this and we are now turning to Sarah daily who is an expert in mass shootings and Sarah welcome to communicate radio thank you very much for your time this afternoon\nThis and we are now turning to Sarah daily who is an expert in mass shootings and Sarah welcome the communique radio thank you very much for your time this afternoon\nNo problem it's unfortunate that it has to be under these circumstances\nYou know what are you ... from what you were hearing and seeing in the report so far\nI think the choice of a ... a a very crowded synagogue at the time of a a warship at a during the ... bought\nA definitely leads us to believe that this is someone who is anti Semitic or potentially a white supremacist especially when we look at previous attacks on other Jewish community centers and and areas of warships\nAnd is there anything that you can feel comfortable in assessing regarding the shooter at this point even though we don't know name we don't know with that there's not a whole lot more if we don't know who the individual is at this point [noise] uh what however in your experience candy with us from this if this is this drawing from\nFrom what we've seen of other mass shooters he'll have attacked religious institutions particularly Jewish institution they tend to be older than the average mass shooter out they've had more time to share their their\nIdeals with people with with similar ideologies um but I think that this is definitely going to require a larger examination of is history where these ideas came from a if there were any other organization or groups or individual who had collaborated on this plan a\nIs it likely that he was at tree of life before he decided to go and commit this famous accident\nI Can't speculate about that but there had to be there was likely some type of planning or forethought beforehand if he knew that it was going to be at a warship or as a crowded time at the synagogue\nSo all granted we cannot speak about the specifics of this particular case but is it typical of mass shooters to map out and plan or are they more reactionary at the moment in something just set them off and they think of where to go and that's the place\nGenerally with most mass shooters we see about Seventy percent of them plans for about a week or more on that because their goal is to typically have as many casualties are fake holidays as possible\nAnd then when you say a week or more is that just for the specific location or are we talking about also the idea of feeling the need to have the firearms at some point I mean how do you get from\nGoing backwards from a mass shooting what does the trail backwards ... were heartened to walk us back to the genesis of a mindset of somebody who becomes a mass shooter\nIt differs database and motivation but a lot of times the think one of the things that we look at is not so much the each individual factor like violent video games are it's\nA life stress air but more about the the conjunction\nOf multiple events like a history of mass violence versus some kind of ... or in addition to some kind of event like being fired going through a divorce or we can also ignore the a kind of current divided state of the United states now on the recent events with\nA acts of violence with the bombs now to hide democratic political leaders both\nPast and present so when we look at it it's not just about the individual but also the environment in which it's happening to the national stage of a divided a rhetoric in ideologies\nSo do you believe that the incidents over the past week may have had a trigger effect or a spark effect for this individual\nBelieve that the incidents over the past week may have had a trigger effect or spark effect for this individual\nAt the possibility that it may has kind of illicit call to violence for for people who may not have otherwise been inclined to do so\nIs it reasonable then to think that there are others who may be a tipping point then there may be incidents like this around the country\nIt's a possibility of copycat violence um we're just kind of incited violence especially um you know with the bombs from this week not\nBeing a detonated or not not having any victims ah that say it's going to call to action but I I that's only speculation on but I think that this should be a time when we're on\nHigh alert especially that religious institutions or or those as a kind of marginalized or ostracized groups\nNow when you talk about religious institutions are we are you suggesting all religious institutions or religious institutions\nOf particular minorities I mean there there's a difference between um the Jewish people and the way that they had been targeted historically by a different groups as compared to other more mainline did nominations do you think\nOr are they all are meeting to take a closer look at security measures at this point\nThey absolutely should do a synagogue any kind of ... a Sikh temples or or a Muslim places of worship but I think Christians Catholics\nA Methodist Baptist everyone needs to at least added security plan and evaluate these types of ah that the potential for these types of attacks and their response is\nIs it enough to just have security measures in place as far as you know cameras and doors and things like that or are we at a point in your estimation that we're getting to where the armed guards or a necessity within places of worship\n[noise] I think that it's something we should approach and consider but we should do it with caution and think about the effects of what that might do especially in places of worship or in school that might have a negative effect but I I think it's something that we need to consider and we need to start with assessments of what resources are available for institutions\nAnd we're talking with Sarah daily assistant professor of criminology law and society at St Vincent college and an expert in mass shootings what are you looking to discover next ... next pieces of information do you think are critical that come forward\nI think if there were any one of the main things that I Would think that that he had any kind of other plans if there were explosives or bombs you looked at the immediate threat if he had in a co conspirators someone who help them plan this ah because you want to defeat was that kind of current threat now\nBut then moving forward you want to look at his history in any kind of military history if you've ever been treated for mental illness if he is getting married if he has children they're just any kind of relational\nBut uh these folks rate for their ... the emcee but here at president per se and we'll have to wait to see a little bit later the out from the surgery we also have you not though how many of the\nPeople that we're talking about our police officers we heard in Nebraska there were four officers who were wounded unlike the right thing but\nWe have two that are some of these people who are surgery are in the police officer\nJohn ... joining us on the disc Institute of Pittsburgh News I'm John thank you very much of that you two are covering the news as you have it I Want to get to Dr Tom Brophy who is with us right now he's a a board certified emergency room physician and he's joining us on the disc Institute of Pittsburgh new Zion Dr\n... are you there are some here okay sir\nYou are not add U. P. M. C. or add Allegheny general is that correct\n[noise] well uh when I can say I'm I Am at a youth AMC facility oh I'm but I Am not as a facility in downtown Pittsburgh so uh I have not received any of the patients from there's a tragic event\nTo the best that you can help us ah go into the emergency room ... what kind of things what kind of situations are the physicians dealing with in a mass shooting like we experience today\nYeah absolutely uh you know I I made my rounds at various emergency departments that I've worked at both a though the west Allegheny health system as well as you've GMC system and you know we're\nAround at various emergency department and I've worked at both uh the the west in Allegheny health system as well as the U. P. M. C. system and you know we we always have the Radio's on the\nEMS and police radios in the background and so um we usually\nDo get to a a a an alert when something like this is going on so early in the um the announcement that there was a shooter situation many of us are physicians were made aware even myself even though I'm outside of that demographic area\nUm and and the way that it works at the majority of level one trauma centers in Pittsburgh we have three level one trauma center as we have\nUm Allegheny General Hospital we have ... she Presbyterian and we have UPN seat a mercy [noise] um [noise] the way that it works is\nThe traumas are handled it as a combined effort between the emergency department staff as well as the trauma surgery staff and most of the employees that are part of that a response team I have a text pager and and that that you'll get an alert that says um you know as a\nThirty five year old male a multiple gunshot wounds you know arriving ah with with a five minute ... Ga or seven minute ETA\nSo this gives you a a a little bit of time sometimes it's only you know thirty seconds to a minute a ticket to the trauma resuscitation bay where those coordinated resuscitation efforts take place\nNew or their special consideration is given when you're dealing with not only just won a gunshot wound but might potentially multiple gunshot wounds how does that complicate the treatment for potential son brings his actual victims\nTo absolutely I mean it is they're they're all kind of handled in the in the same way you know we go back\nTo ... to the basics of airway breathing circulation um you know the the the first priority is to stabilize those vital aspects of a person's uh wellbeing so um that you know ...\nDepending on where the gunshot wounds are um you know sometimes you're dealing with trauma sometimes you're dealing with something much different like extremity trauma and as you heard from John shovel I just recently\nUm you know just because of ... is in surgery doesn't necessarily mean that you know it's a critical injury it could be a gunshot went to the hand uh you know that require surgical attention I'm\nLike that the gunshot wounds of course to the to the head to the fore acts in the abdomen a you know tend to be that the most life threatening and um you know in emergency medicine we very much follow a trio charge\nA protocols and as you know a ...\nUm you know you define who is the most critically ill and uh and and they get that the tension or on an as needed basis so I I Can't comment as far as um you know patients that are being treated because of course this is a half hours just privacy related [noise] um I Can't tell you that\nYou know I've heard that there are patients at all three of those trauma facilities um Allegheny general ... um and I I have no doubts about\nYou know one of my colleagues in those hospitals are working a very hard because there who are ready for the patience to save lives and that's one thing that I\nDo want to say is you know we're all kind of shook up by this tragedy but you know what what's interesting is I I have several friends who are you know as time the tree of life synagogue and and some of those friends actually are the physicians that are treating of these ...\nThese people and and so I Can't imagine you know the the emotional impact that's having on them um that there are trauma surgeons in both health systems you know that are members of the Jewish community that tend to a local Pittsburgh synagogues and um\nUm that there are trauma surgeons in both health systems you know that are members of the Jewish community but and a local Pittsburgh synagogues and um you know but ... everything gets set aside when it when you're on the treatment side you set in motion aside\nSet in motion aside and and you know you you treat the patient as diligently on to quickly or as needed and um I my my hearts go out to all the first responders and all the police officers but also all of those people on the the treatment side of those emergency departments who are working very hard to say people's lives\nBoard certified physician Tom Brophy joining us on the ... Institute of Pittsburgh new Zion doctor thank you very much for your time\nThank you sir I Want to get back to more of the investigative aspect of what we're looking at at this point a police saying that they have the suspect in custody they believe that there is only one that is a finished scenario at this point\nAre with us right now Paul VI oh let's see is a a security expert we've had him on a couple of times on the KKK radio afternoon news this past week and Paul welcome back the KKK radio talk to you again\nThank you Robert always a pleasure\nNow at this point to what what are the authorities are looking for what kind of pieces are they willing to put together if they believe that they have the man who's done the shooting where does the investigation go from here\nThat's an excellent question but nevertheless there's several components of this so I think if you think of it in lanes but first lane we have is the actual crime cedar crimes who did it in the stock itself\nSo you have a an armed police officer that's going to be stationed outside it's going to control access to that to ensure the class he does not get contaminated what they're doing right now while they're investigating they're building a case and making sure that every every eyes dotted every teacher has crossed crime scene tax will be\nThat numerically numbering any and all tracing physical evidence they find on the crime scene and securing all that information again to present a case to the district attorney's office\nSimultaneously you've got investigators that will begin to sort of questioning if possible with us that while that's happening you have the legal side of it that they're moving for search warrant search warrants for a home for homes cars vehicles\nA laptop devices any sort I pads or or phones that really is is ... is a considerably difficult part but a crucial part of the investigation rather because police now need to know did he work with anybody\nWho is he communicating with how long was he saying this war in essence that lens right or the intent behind this as well as to constructed this type of horrific shooting\nDid he in any way shape or form conspire with anybody else so there'll be going into website emails texts that said it was so those three lanes are all going right now simultaneously\nDo you believe that someone like this works alone is that how mass shooters typically go that uh they don't involve or for tell any miss to anyone else or do they in this day and age especially in social media give some type of telltale sign\n[noise] while they typically do you work alone Robert but we also know that they talk about it now the fender such as this from a behavioral side which is the other side platform that you'd be working in this particular case\nFrom the radio side they will tell people what they're going to do quote unquote get even plants they they'd brag about it and that's why party investigative process will be looking in scouring any social media related um platforms that this individual had been on interviewing neighbors et cetera had he talked about it so yes\nThey do they they typically work alone in the execution side of this but the planning side of it it's not uncommon for them to tell a multiple of people's what\nThey were going to do when they were going to do it\nSide of this but the planning side of it it's not uncommon for them to tell them multiple people's what they were going to do when they were going to do it\nWe're always told see something say something and I've asked this question to a previous guests I Want to ask you to view is well\nWhat are we looking for and what we say I mean there are so many people who were on line right now butter spewing just absolutely vile hate\nAnd even though there are so many that are doing that you look at the percentages of people who actually go to this point whether it's shipping bomb packages that we talked about earlier this week we're doing this right like act\nIt's a very very small number of people proportionally speaking what are we looking for\n[noise] well you know Robert ... that frustration the public feels is justified because as law enforcement and government will need to do a better job at defining what is something right\nWe need to narrow down that scope\nOr so in answer to that question and this is what I tell folks everywhere from town hall meetings on air or wherever it folks\nThe thing that I didn't want to emphasize is if you get a gut feeling if someone says something and see if they said well if you if you see their physical appearance change if you see their behaviors change to the point where maybe they used to go and I attend certain functions", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Cook and Poni", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "27"}
