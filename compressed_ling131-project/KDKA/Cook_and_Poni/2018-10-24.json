saved\nOver Seventy five billion dollars in consumer prices\nAre at thirty billion dollars to residential forty five billion dollars to industrial and business either [noise]\nAll right when you think of who is using natural gas now we pretty much understand who those folks are but what about who you see using it in the future [noise]\nBy taking the future uh it's really going to continue to grow as part of a as at the plate sees develop here\nThat's got mixed up there and our largest energy source is a you have over thirty four percent of our national energy coming from the natural gas which

Seventy Seventy five billion dollars in savings that's over six hundred and fifty six thousand jobs in the three states\nUh and it's a over Ninety billion dollars a year in economic activity and then think about for residents show prices not just money in our pocket book but if you take low income fixed income families you know the average family spends all in this region about thirty five hundred dollars on energy costs\nFor a family at the poverty level that's over ... percent of their income on energy really that much it is mine for most people that we pay six to eight percent so getting this this prices down like we have is is you know real implications for those folks I mean they're making choices between\nYou know feeling themselves and having the heat on in the winter uh that's

for ... minutes dominance I mean we are not only able to uh you know supply ourselves but we can now use this particular if you look at Europe which is overly dependent on Russia for their energy

here let me share something with a a lot of folks say well what's in it for me or if you look at what's happened in the way of gas production of Pennsylvania and I often compare natural gas price seem to two thousand and eight\nConsumers at our local utilities Columbia people's their natural gas purchased natural gas rates are Seventy percent less than what they weren't two thousand a passing it on the ... passed on to the consumer and now we're generate more of our electricity with natural gas\nSavings on the whole cell power generation side has been forty one percent less than what it was you know when when re cats were coming back in two thousand eight and two thousand uh it's been an enormous benefactor\nNot only to consumers but we've got an impact the that spread broadly ... sixty seven counties ended with governors and makes a statement\nThe industry doesn't pay its fair share we paint one point five billion dollar gotta crawl before he was an absolutely right one point five billion dollar spread broadly to all communities across Pennsylvania it's been an enormous one of the governor was talking to a hundred and twenty\nAbsolutely right one point five billion dollar spread broadly to all communities across Pennsylvania it's been an enormous one of the governor was talking to a hundred and twenty projects just a few weeks ago all funded by the Marcellus legacy fun and I would tell you\nThe education center at the Keystone country alliance visitor center up in central Pennsylvania was parked dealt with some of that money as well talk about that rally real quick\nVisitor center a four hundred square feet we attract four hundred thousand people year conservation education is our number one goal we want folks to come up their experience so country at the highest level get to understand what this animals all about what it takes to live their habitat clean air clean law the pristine mountains\nGreat place to come visit now uh I'm not going to turn this into a political platform but I have strong beliefs about what's happening so much so that I'm spending a lot of my off days going up promoting this midterm election of significance of this industry in jobs\nVia social media I'm a Democrat and I was saying it again only to make a point you have to step outside your comfort zone in what many people believe a Democrat to be and look at the big picture\nThis is about a job not just for my children and grandchildren but everybody within the sound of my voice their family and their future and keeping their economies driving in their communities because charity begins at home I mean you want to take care of your home town and I see what's happened because of the show petrochemical plant [noise]\nAnd if you're going to go into that place that you're going to ... cast your ballot just for the sheer fact of making a change because you don't like the way a person you know combs their hair or whatever their political beliefs may be I Believe my thought processes that is very selfish\nBecause this is about jobs first jobs left and right now I don't see anything in this region who is who is doing more to do just that then the shale and district\nI Would tell you one thing that people don't realize it's not just about heating your home and cooking your food and dry and your clothes eating your water it's nearly every single consumer product that we touched they manufacture with natural gas all steel glass plastics chemicals fertilizers powdered metals pharmaceutical medications\nAll manufacturing with natural gas we now have we went from a period of\nOf scarcity and high price of the product to now abundance and affordability to drive new manufacturing jobs\nI grew up in central Pennsylvania I've lived here my whole life I look around my board table it's not a bunch of Texans it's guys from Pennsylvania gals from Pennsylvania and we want to do it right we like to hike and bike and hunt and fish you camp and do all the things everybody to limit your son right\nLet me jump in here because this misnomer about if they're from Texas I don't care where they're from because they're spending money here there there's a we have seven new hotels that have been built and more to come in around that shell petrochemical plant whether the license plate says Texas or says Pennsylvania it's all going into the same economy and they're taking that paycheck back\nTo where they're from in the last time I checked we're all in this together United we stand so this is about helping everyone across this country\nFurther their job shells and if it has to be right here in my backyard I can live with that\nYou're looking around this vendor hall you've got eighty some vendors in this room whose businesses all rely upon a successful natural gas industry and I would tell you they're all\nIn business growing jobs grown economic opportunity for Pennsylvania's future jobs for our kids I ... I grew up not far from Nikki Stern no country alliance offices and Ben is that grew up and do boys I've watched my entire high school class lay down for jobs\nNo longer we've got the ability to grow new manufacturing jobs at home keep our kids at home working in our communities to make a family sustained wages\nJob soon I I Know in a perfect world it can't be perfect but I still care about nuclear energy and I still care about the coal industry and I definitely care about their steel industry and I've said this many times if you're from here someone your DNA you've got steel running through your veins okay talk to me how they can all work together\nThe steel industry and I've said this many times if you're from here someone your DNA you've got steel running through your veins okay talk to me how they could all work together yeah absolutely\nI Would tell you that you know the steel industry and I know the former chairman of US Steel John service in the in the house today is actually here to there some of the presentations that we've been a partner with us good\nGuys having to live or something you said to me when I interviewed him many years ago I've got a responsibility to thousands of retirees along with people that are still working here today that guy gets\nIt was right focus there is no doubt about it but the steel industry has a huge benefactor of our industry the wind pipe that were put it in the ground today to deliver these vast amounts of natural gas out only to communities across Pennsylvania but communities across the U.S\nAnd ultimately some communities across the world tomorrow we're going to have a program from Stanford University to talk about global energy poverty there are three billion people in our planet all across our planet\nThat don't have the creature comforts that we have it on they don't have running water they don't have sewage they don't have a air conditioner refrigeration for their food they they they cook with water dumb\nDr ... and that actually helpful and they live shorter lifespans we can actually use Pennsylvania natural gas now to help fuel some of those countries of the world with our pundits ordered them to us to get it absolutely we no longer go to Russia or Saudi Arabia they get they get in the U.S\nAnd you know I have to believe that those countries in the president talking about having another meeting with Vladimir ... when they're in France celebrating the one hundredth anniversary of the world war one arm assist\nThey understand especially our commander in chief it's a

shale inside it as a show coalition conference\nWere loaded with a lot of information or and or\nExit butters and information as it relates to energy of the past or current and the future joining us right now for a few minutes is Lauren ... he's a\nDirector of technical affairs or with the Marcellus Shale coalition and the lord first and foremost thanks so much for taking time to join us for a few minutes I appreciate being here yeah thank you um [noise] let's talk first and foremost about this event what it means or from your perspective the the the\nAnd say conferences the eight year that we've we've hosted it as the coalition ah it's really highlight the advancements in the innovations that the industry taking them for the last ten years since developing a development in the Marcellus in Utica basins has really started here in Pennsylvania\nAnd uh our membership our industries in our companies around here are showcasing and highlights\nA large reservoirs of natural gas to help put Pennsylvania and the Appalachian base in at a competitive advantage with respect to low cost abundant sources of energy and fuel for the entire country at this point\nYou mentioned the words I Know horizontal perhaps vertical what did you mean so\nThe horizontal directional drilling is what was uh was was a a technology advancement that was perfected or in two thousand four by range resources and and the ability to drill and turn it horizontally when you're a mile underground\nOr drilling vertically and then turning that drill bit horizontally or took a huge advancement technology and not only was the advancement technology something that was a a radical development it was it was something that had to be economical economically feasible at the time to do as well\nUh with the cost of energy ah ah ah you know really skyrocketing back in that in that time and\nAnd uh and so that development occurred and so you're talking about companies right now that\nThat are drilling horizontal lateral to access a these are natural gas reservoirs almost four miles or so one mile deep and four miles horizontally they get access to these these vast reservoirs natural gas that's\nImpressive so it was a basically developed to two thousand and four and you also mentioned first of its kind so we're we're two thousand and Eighteen was that the development ultimately that ability\nSo in two thousand Eighteen were selling and we're seeing a the industry drilling faster more accurate more efficient or wells at at at this point in time they're drilling deeper so the Marcellus if you're looking at the strata Marcellus his first a mile deep Utica is even deeper\nSo they're coming back to these wells and these pads again and drilling deeper and accessing new parts of the ... reservoir to unlock more of that natural gas so that's where we're at\n... at the excellent tell me where we are in terms of the big picture and more specifically if I go back those ten years of course it was\nInitially consider to be a boom and Pennsylvania in this area was sitting on something no one else does ah and then of course the market gets involved and you see some ups and downs and and so forth where are we today relative to those expectations\nThe expectations I think a lot of the wells have actually gone above and beyond the expectations which is obviously something that has put\n'em in when you put a glut of anything on the market you're going to experience some ebbs and flows in the market and I think we've seen that I think we've also seen that infrastructure is critical we need to get high point in the ground we need to get this gas to market so those prices kind of bounce back up so the price is right now are are are half\nOunce backup we've seen the recount bounce back up in the last year a and we we we've seen more pipelines come on line to get that gas to major markets like Philadelphia New York and in other parts of of the country\nThe excellent one last thing so we often hear about folks are over these ten years or so many years concerned about the safety or in one form of the other or has there been progress to the extent that there wasn't even a problem at the outset\nWell I I think one of the problems at the outset it was on the perception was on All right you're drilling this deep and it said this higher pressure we're talking about higher pressure wells and I think out of the gate we needed to do or do some more education and I think we've done that\nWe need to get folks to understand that we're over a mile deep and the ground much deeper than any groundwater table and and we've we've made innovations in strides in innovations to case in cement and multiple layers of casing Smith to protect those groundwater we've also commissioned a number of different stuff\nUh made innovations in stride and innovations to case in cement and multiple layers of casing Smith to protect those ground waters we've also commissioned a number of different studies to show uh that uh that\nThat this activity is not not contaminating sources of groundwater and and universities have actually done those studies independent studies as well like the University of Cincinnati\nPenn State university they've commission studies show that this drilling in this activity in those in those formations is not polluting and not contaminating groundwater\nWell our thanks for the time thanks for the education you out for a man of course a lot of folks listening sexual welcoming I'm looking forward to the next couple of days here always stop

got shot up on the field right they were shooting the guy was shoot if the Republicans and\nA and there's been a lot of aggression towards Republican candidates like Ted Cruz and ... and ... for

you a couple of things to each of first well let me going to comment first of all I I don't see this as being related to the Democrat Party or Democratic Party I I just I don't see that I don't think the people the DNC are sitting around watching these plans and if they are we're in a lot worst place and we know\nThere are looney a yes or on all fronts you've heard me mouth off as it relates to

detonating for convenience sake\nAnd that this is therefore not not only not that many for convenience sake but they're they're not detonating by design so that we're sending a message without any great harm you're trying to gather some conspiracy brothers a little bit hard for me to buy into\nWhy not it's it's it's right before your eyes that's the way I see it that's the way a lot of I'll bet she passed away a lot of Americans are seeing a ...\nOh I don't have any doubt that a lot of people's I don't I I I ... I I acknowledge that there was what five percent of me that a new okay ran through my mind when you want me to say I mean I understand that\nBut I dismissed it I mean I I mean that doesn't mean that
