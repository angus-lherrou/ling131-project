apprehend\nThe kid before he came to school I had not really thought a whole lot about guns in schools until that day but all of a sudden I saw my son in a situation where he\nWhere he might have had to re act to a gun being in school now arming police officers in schools is that going to prevent something like that from happening no it's not going to prevent it does it give police officers and another tool to use men on the other side of it I'm thinking wow you have a\nEmotional or sometimes they're rational middle school kids with guns and now you read police into that mix I'm not sure

he can't [noise] not that he ... his arms like\nThe president did and then watching the president do the same exact actions are about the other politicians I said oh he's just watching what they're saying not marketing the disability and that was very important for me\nTo see that in what I saw it last night was\nThe president marketing the testimony\nNot the actual\nUh a doctor herself for her story seems to be\nA following by the wayside with each company day with the a story about the doors to story about a claustrophobic and kept me on a plane that's why she couldn't fly and um her best
