I'll talk about stocks and bonds will start with bonds I think maybe the big takeaway I Would have in terms of the bond market is there's not an incentive today to take on a lot of risk in your bond portfolios so you should mostly stick with safer bonds\nAnd if you think about bonds there's kind of two ways that you can reach for yield and take on more risk in the process the first would be to reach out for very long term bonds which typically have higher yields and short term bonds\nAnd the second way would be to take on credit risk in other words lend to borrowers that have more questionable I'm a finances and as a result\nTypically pay you a higher yields so in terms of um interest rates\nAre you can on a two year treasury today or in about two point eight percent if you buy a thirty year treasury much longer\nOr the yield is only three point three percent so it's only about a half a percentage point more to lend to the government for twenty eight more years now what would happen if interest rates rose well based on the map a two year treasury note would lose only about two percent if interest rates rose one percent\nHowever a thirty year bond would lose Nineteen percent interest your interest rates are rose one percent so what's the incentive to to go out and buy really long term thirty year treasuries right now I don't think there is one\nOr the other point would be a in terms of taking on risk with lower quality corporate bonds and today the amount of you'll pick up you can get on lower quality corporate bonds is historically low\nAnd I would wait you know maybe for more economic turbulence in the future and higher interest rates on corporate bonds before really a a moving into that sector in a meaningful way so in the bond side of things I I Would say you you can get an appreciable decent yield playing it safe today and I would continue to do that\nIn terms of stocks I Would say the outlook is fairly balanced and I would point to to a very positive signs and but I Would also point to two areas of caution\nIn terms of the outlook and and I would point to one wild card as well that would probably a swing things in either direction so in terms of the positives the economy is growing\nFast growing very strongly about four percent per year now if you do the math on twenty trillion dollar economy\nThat's about a trillion dollars are almost a trillion dollars in economic growth you might expect over the next year and a you know that's a big guy that that's that's a lot of economic growth for chunk of change I could change yes for companies to I Try to benefit from\nUh the other thing I Would say about today is that it's a really good time to be a corporation it's a really good time to be a business we've had these big tax cuts\nUh we've had a you know really deregulation\nAh companies have this when fall and money they're buying back shares so about a trillion dollar has dollars has that been estimated that companies are going to spend bind back\nSpend bind back their own shares and so that provides a good tell when a to stocks so there are and I'm definitely some positives however there are as I mentioned uh some points of caution and um I I think they're meaningful points of caution one would be I think stocks are on the high side in terms of valuations you\nCan look at a variety evaluation indicators and you can pick one that says just about anything but if you look at what I'll call a composite indicator if you throw together you know ten or Fifteen different valuation\nIndicators an average of them out it averages out to say socks are on the high side a from a valuation perspective and typically you know when stocks are on the expensive side they don't do as well and and typically there's you know some more downside risk\nAnd the other thing I Would mention is just that this is the longest ever bull market at this point equip thing even what happened in the Nineteen nineties and so statistically speaking\nA that would suggest that ah you know now it's not a time to be taking on a lot of risk or just because the stock market has gone on for a long time or it doesn't mean it has to uh turned down but again statistically speaking\nAh it it you know you just don't want to be taking on a lot of risk at this point so I think the it's a it's a balanced outlook and in terms of what is the um the wildcard\nOr what could break things cause things to break in either direction I Would say it is the outlook for inflation so inflation continues to be low\nHowever we're at the point in the business cycle\nWhen economies typically start to overheat and inflation typically starts to pick up so in the past we've had unemployment be as low as it is today at three point seven percent we have had inflation be as low as it is today at two percent but\nWe've never had both happen at the same time we've never had such low employment and ah such low inflation and if inflation can stay low then you the stock market has a lot of runway and can you continue to do quite well\nBut if inflation starts to pick up and starts on pick to pick up an unwelcome pace well that's typically when the Federal Reserve starts to raise interest rates more aggressively\nAnd typically that is the type of dynamic that happens you know at the end of a a bull market so I Would say again a balanced outlook for socks and watch inflation as the wild card\nSo after a hundred years the fed has finally met its mandate of full employment and price stability\nAnd that that that's a great point Jamie and they're taking a little bit of a victory lap if you listen to the recent speeches by the Federal Reserve\nOr officials and I would say maybe it's a little bit premature I'm there had been Nineteen recession's over the last one hundred years or Eighteen or of those recessions were proceeded by Federal Reserve interest rate hike so I Would be I wouldn't be so quick to us like the football here\n[laughter] rather than the ... the ... about a year before a Janet Yellen moved on a\n... a reporter asked that question and she mentioned I'm not sure what what causes the end of of bull markets and a reporter and reminded her of at the fed has ended every bull market and she actually had a good chuckle with that she said yeah you're right so I think hopefully they're aware of it\nAnd I think you know I think there's some arguments out there where you see the long end of the curve and we're getting a little technical here you know falling a you know pretty ... pretty loud sign that the that the markets might be thinking that\nThe fed is should be kind of wrapping wrapping up the tightening ... when you see that long term fall\nThis this new fellow that is a running the fed now Jay Powell he's cut from a different cloth than that\nThe different cloth than the previous several said a a chairman\nSo ah Janet Yellen the previous fed chair and before her ... and Alan Greenspan\nThey were all academic economists and academic economists like the run models and ah um you know computer models that get predictions for the economy and I'm Jay Powell is not that clock is actually a lawyer by training in a banker\nAnd she has said look I don't really trust these models to predict the future as well as a economists say and so what I'm going to do is just watched the economy\nAnd respond accordingly and if I start to see signs of inflation and I'll start to raise interest rates more aggressively but until that happens I'm going to stay on the sidelines of bit a little bit\nWatch wait and see and maybe only raise rates are gradually so I think on one hand that is promising for the stock market because it means the fed is unlikely to prematurely raise interest rates and choke off the economic recovery on the other hand\nIt could lead to a mistake if these economic models are right and today they're predicting inflation or will increase or if I'm if Powell is wrong and waiting too long to raise interest rates than inflation could a spike more than we would like it too\nWell there's a there's a saying that the that you know I think one of the accusations are one of the complaints about the fed is a you know the market calls it behind the curve the fed tends to be behind the curve more than its head of it in\nA while I think the markets would like the fed to keep rates lower longer I think there is a worry or where you go back to you know kind of Volcker and and you've got to do if if you're too far behind the curve you you have to make some radical moves and brand and shake the market\nAnd other people have talked about it is the fed takes the punch bowl away from the party dry in the party gets going you know they haven't taken it away you\nKnow All right well we are up against the news of want to remind folks number here in the studio eight six six three nine one ten twenty eight six six three and I won ten twenty wide open phone bank we welcome your calls will be back after this\nVery one is Bob Bob\nI'm a veteran we hit a line in Vietnam as America's veterans face challenges ... there I think he's been never given up hope ... helps veterans of every generation get the benefits they burn\nI finally admitted that might be TST I wasn't doing well\nSo veterans can reach victories great and small\nNow I Wish I'd found Amy sooner\nMake during enjoying each day\nSupport more victories for veterans go to ... or\nHeroin mixed promises but all it really does is take heroin can take your job your house your family maybe even your life\nLet's say again to the\nTo use an example let's say your income was fifty thousand dollars a year your\nStandard deduction would eliminate if you're a married couple would eliminate the first twenty four thousand so that would be that income would be wiped away\nBut if you did that with qualified charitable distribution\nWell now that doesn't even count and you're fifty thousand dollars worth of income so if you did a thousand dollar distribution your income would only be forty nine thousand not fifty thousand so right there you get you get a deduction above and beyond the ah the standard deduction so\nDepending on your tax situation depending on your gains depending on if you're still able to itemize or if you take the standard deduction\nThe qualified charitable distribution might make sense and I think if we were to panic over simplify it if you take the standard deduction I think the qualified shared all distribution would probably be are better bet\nI think you're going to get a bigger bang for your buck a in terms of a a a tax breaks than a gifting the highly appreciate it stock now there's there's kind of a way to do both\nThere's um a there's there's a couple of different ways that what you could do is you can take those highly appreciate it shares and you can put them into certain um trust certain uh of vehicles that will allow you to take\nSeveral years of\nA future distributions and include them all in one year so uh there's something called a donor advised fund that let's say you had a hundred thousand dollars worth of stock and you wanted to give that to your church over the next ten Fifteen Years and that stock was was very highly\nWas very highly appreciate it but you can do is take all that hundred thousand or fifty thousand or ten thousand or whatever the stock is you can put that in what's called a donor advised fund the personal donor advise fun and you would get a a charitable deduction all in this ... in this tax year\nAnd that if if you have a year where you have a great deal of deductions that may get you over that twenty four thousand dollar limit where you're able to take advantage of those deductions\nBought the nice thing about the donor adopted vice funds that you don't have to give that all to the church or the charity today a lot of folks like to kind of spread that out over time ah for various reasons and you can do that so you could take advantage you could eliminate all of those capital gains today\nAnd you can spread the gift out over multiple years so\nThat's a way to kind of maximize that gift but again depending on your situation or that the the the qualified or distribution straight from your IRA might be the way to go what you'd have to do is just just crunch the numbers on all of those things and and and see what ... days actually\nIf you give X number of dollars from the required middle of the nation that exact same dollar amount or put on the tax return\nThat I mean yes that that would be a dollar for dollar elimination of the income\nUp to a hundred thousand you get a hundred and ... doesn't have it's not limited to you're required minimum distribution um but it's up to a hundred thousand very good so it's a great opportunity and that's how you it's great way to maximize the return\nOf thank you All right and very informative I've been just doing appreciated stock\nYeah and that's a great way to do it but I think Saturday yeah that's that's if you're gonna gift if they appreciate it but I think that qualified charitable distribution might be able to get you a little bit more\nNow I'm going to look into that problem or what\nWell thank you for the call it was wonderful question All right let's let's grab another caller let's talk to Mike from McKee's port Mike ... good morning\nGentlemen good morning go ahead with the question\nMy question is ... ... what is your outlook for the foreign markets and the emerging markets are for ah for next year\nSure well thanks thanks for the message or in in terms of the outlook I Would say it depends on your\nTime horizon and if your time horizon is longer multi year I Would say the outlook is quite bright if your time horizon is short or I eat a few months or the next six months I Would say to expect more volatility now maybe twenty Nineteen you know kind of falls or somewhere in between\nBut maybe first I'll talk about why the long term outlook is bright now and then I'll talk about why do you expect more volatility over the short term\nSo Brian where you go to that we're going to be up against the break let's take a break now so hold that thought hang on the line Mike Hold that thought because we also got a question very similar an email question from Philip\nOr saw

try to to knock Penn State or not and not know the name deep into into their territory and you have a ball rolling to the end zone then you try a really ugly fake punt which now ... teddy about this

like they're always turning left because they are I Am Kurt Busch is going to start from the pool at Talladega in the fifth playoff race while you think that brand just work so well I mean on and off the track ... I mean no\nMatter what it used to be a southern thing but I have so many friends right here in pets Pittsburgh that loves NASCAR\nYeah I guess that that they get it the the the team owners the drivers are for from the the top of the organization all the way through the individuals that are in the pit crews\nAre they they seem to get the the marketing aspect of it and that's the most important part of it that\nThat these guys become visible everybody recognizes them uh but those people that that follow this you know they they have the you know they call it who's your driver who's the guy that you follow as as far as your guy and and it's a brand it it's one of those things Rob I think it's either you really into a deep\nOr you you don't really care much about it but there are millions upon millions of people in the United states that really find that to be something that is much worth their time effort and energy\nAll right let's talk about uh the penguins it's so early and I mean it's real early for me to even get excited to where I Want to take a stand either way because I I think you've got to wait 'til like after Christmas to really start diving in dissecting any hockey season the penguins has so much talent\nAnd I know they've had some injuries including Murray but to concussion but they're they're going to be fine\nBut it's just amazing how these die hard they lose one game where you know ready to run up to defeat flag but anyway Pam was losing a shoot out to the Canadians\nWhen you look at these guys and you think of Malcolm and you think of Crosby in you know feel cast where the hat trick the other side still doesn't get enough credit as far as being offensive force I'm just I'm just real comfortable with this team I mean I don't know what else to say\nAgree with you it it's it's I guess it made for bad radio because right now it's just that guy let's just get through\nAnd that you had you know a hundred plus miles an hour and you get get another one in the beak and all of a sudden now you're out for four months at a time so that's not a good thing especially when I speak encourage that injury in practice and and you gotta figure you know what the heck's going on with that why is anybody shooting the park high\nAt practice but you know those inadvertent type things can happen\nSo it it it can be strange but you had had happened to pick with a with linebacker ... has a non contact injury during ah during practice on Tuesday and he's out for the season with a knee injury so\nUh that's that's all we talk about all these practices in the various sports in the Alan Iverson was famous for that that practice law you know we're talking about practice\nA but but in order to become good enough to show your whereas in a game you have to practice but there's that fine line of if you practice into hard then you get hurt\nYou have you been practicing for a decade sooner or later they got to put you in the game you know what I'm saying some of these things just gone entirely too long and I think there's too much examination and they they tried to you know analytical and they want to break every aspect of the game down\nBottom line is all the coaching as great\nAll the strategy all the play books are but for the most part the teams that usually when\nOther teams that have the most natural athletes and you've got Crosby going north and south Crosby and Malcolm\nNo matter what the game plan is more times than not you're going to shoot the puck and score that you're you're exactly right it's like the playground I mean you know you go to the bumper the fifty five Buick and I'll I'll throw the football if a guy can jump higher than the rest of the people I I mean I Know coaching important but see now here we go folks some\nRevved up because I'm I'm lacking asleep when I'm frustrated it's been a long day and I'm just going to tell you point blank\nThey make way too much out of coaching strategy when you listen anybody who's concerned about the penguins all I Need to tell you is this\nCrosby and Malcolm are also not that they're not going full tilt but they want to be around for the long haul they understand they have the ability it's kind of like of sending was here and we were out in the parking lot\nAnd he gave me a head start to three Seventy six okay he can still be me understand what I'm saying so you you just have to look at the big picture\nWhy not wait a minute is this the same guy last year was praising the solvent as the ... you know the the big deal and it was such a big deal when they brought him to Pittsburgh instead of hairs were coaches really earn their money\nKnowing when to call a timeout alright that's when they earn their money but for the most part if you look at any great team and the history of sports it's who has the best athletes who has these died I was like I was telling you about ... viewpoint Marino on this pit team right now in his heyday\nMan ... Notre Dame one player and don't tell me one player doesn't make a team\nAnd there's no eye in team you put Marino behind center as a freshman with all due respect the guinea pig is in that game he ... them from five touchdowns you get me Tony Dorsett as a freshman and put them in that backfield now against that Notre Dame team they walk away by two touchdowns win that game probably\nRemember how good those ...

I think he's steady solid\nBut I also think that you need that gazelle at that white opposition in today's NFL just like any to Carson when's that Josh Allan uh Ben Roethlisberger a Jared golf that prototype six foot five gun slinging quarterback\nYou need a wide receiver who is over six five or at least six five who's got a vertical eat that's out of sight\nWho nine times out of ten in the back in the end zone when they go up for the ball he's bringing the ball down and he's getting your six and I don't see the Steelers having anybody that can do that ... I think too much pressure on juice misused her and way too much pressure has been put on James Garner\nWas it that you know a few years ago ... going into the draft wasn't that the thing to bend was campaigning for I Need a tall wide was a big wide receiver it really has an ever gotten that answer\nNo and listen and here we go again for those of you who weren't Calexico barest fans I was still am and I think you know he may be retired but I think he's got his life together I Hope and watch me say that he'll be in the news [laughter] I Hope not because I like the guy\nBut um I ... and I thought was going to be the guy didn't happen\nAnd if it came down because he was smoking weed we all need to get over this and make it legal and let's move on okay\n'cause I ain't no different than Johnny unite is going down to the bowling alley and swam and a six pack with his buddies after a big win and you know getting a dry ride home it it is what it is is two thousand Eighteen I don't do it I'm not saying I'm a big proponent of it but we all have to grow up and we've got to see the force through the trees but I Do believe\nSomebody like to real prior could make a huge difference and not that you have a hard time putting people in the seats but I guarantee I'd be staying up to watch the highlights if he had a career game for the sheer fact that he grew up in that great community of Jeanette me just me\nAnd it's a stranger on though if you look around the NFL it it you had a trade deadline coming up the end of the month but it's it's the NFL is not really a lot like major league baseball where you see a whole lot of guys move or some ... very rarely will you see a trade and usually it's not player for player it's usually player for draft picks and things of that nature\nBut it it's just not something that is real common place in the national football league but there is a trading trade deadline and this is for those purposes so there is a ... there are possibilities for it but I think the problem that you have is can you trust the words that are coming out a ... mouth as far as yes a coming of lesson do\nListen he's a kid okay I'm not calling them I don't know but they don't listen to any of that stuff and let the ruins do what they are great at Mr Tobar do what he does when he's back number twenty six I'll say look he's back I'm not going to listen to any of that stuff look in his defense he's like\nOne blown knee I'm done I'm grabbing as much cash as I can because I'm at that point of no return once I hit that third decade\nThat third decade there's no going back okay to Michigan State and coming out as this you know this jewel of a running back looking Adrian Peterson I'm watching them shaken hands after they got throttle by New Orleans\nAnd I'm like people forget how great he was at Twenty one and what he did and you know he bangs ... up and things go south on him you get some bad headlines so it's fleeting and the NFL they have to make as much as they can\nI'm telling you and I'm going to ask you this because you're around them more than I Am is he or is he not one of the most\nPure athletes and natural athletes and for him to play quarterback at Ohio State and then make it as a wide receiver not just somebody who was putting the shoulder pads on but to do what he's done\nThat's a pretty big story I think and it just goes to prove that he is a good athlete maybe many people would say including me a great athlete oh yeah I I\nUse which gear for from Toronto but yeah I mean yeah Oh absolutely and I watched him train Rob it it's amazing how how ... he is and when he runs those routes and he was he was coming off of a bang up ankle this past spring\nAnd I watched him into some of his workouts it's is workout routine is is our Jewish to say the least\nIn this is the guy that you know maybe some people think well these guys just go out and play and that's not true man they these get when they work out a lot of people talked about LeBron James and does he need to practice\nThe you watch the practice regimen that these guys go through Rob it is grueling and that's why they're able to do the things that they can do on the court they they have a natural born ability but they really hone those skills\nWell I used to be such a proponent of uh deion Sanders and people without me going oh he's not a hall of fame baseball player but he was good enough to make it to the show now and at the same side of a different sport he\nMade it to the hall of fame and he got into the super bowl and one that Super Bowl and has been an MVP I listen they're rare and I'm telling you right now and then we're going to go to break\nBut if I take to route prior right now\nAnd I go look go out to LA we're going to give you the\nFirst half of the Lakers you're gonna play alongside LeBron James I could take 'em out of a street clothes put them in that purple and gold I'm not saying he you know do a triple double but he wouldn't embarrass himself\nI Believe you are correct I'm right I'm not about many things but I'm right about that All right we'll take a break we'll come back much more still to come with a great

thinking there's only one Drew Brees ... played in a different era how's it going to happen\nAs swelled somebody once said I like your response this kid has shown me a lot and I know what's your early

has a whole lot of flavor to it I think the titans are kind of you know just one of those middle of the pack type teams but I I like the ravens are to be able to to cover the two and a half one this one bam also has the ravens teddy\nGuy like the ravens I I think they're going to have a big comeback this week uh comes against their game last week a Flaco a while I don't like the ravens a but I think ah Tennessee is just not shown anything\nPublic service announcements whether all four of us have Baltimore so anybody go get everybody that you know working with the outback every way\nAgain just because my mind's always on the Steelers do you think that maybe the Steelers some of that locker room stuff did get to them and they weren't able to focus and maybe there are a whole lot better and if they come out and when this one by three touchdowns it was premature on all of our borders to think that they're going into tank\nOr I Am in Ted I you you you're you know see that locker room stuff especially at the at the lower levels right now but not a big\nBeliever that that all that stuff that goes on in the locker room really matters that much I think once you get on the football field and I I'm I'm also not a believer that have pre game speech does that much for you after the first series so uh I don't think that the locker room stuff really matters chatty\nYeah if you're in the pros and you need a pre game speech draw a but I think that what they do have is now the defense of played has played together for a while they're starting to communicate better that's probably the biggest problem they had and I think they're getting a little bit more confidence in Connor and what he can do\nOr because of what he's done so I think both\nSides of the ball I think once again they start slow but I think they're I think they're picking up speed I'm not cutting them out from anything but they need to win today\nAre Carolina plus a point and a half Redskins I'll take Caroline at a point and a half I go ahead Greg\nI'm with you Rob I I I think the Panthers you're kind of going to get going I I still like him Newton and so I'm I'm all about them I don't think Jay ... is a is the right answer and not long for the Washington Redskins bam also has the Panthers or\nTen oh scary another one where we all have [laughter] I liked him ... men this game a lot [noise] all\nRight so let's take the colds getting two and a half against the jets colds I Will take simply be of for the sheer fact that I Want to see Andrew Luck get back to where he was before that injury because I hate seeing anybody never get a chance to ah redeem themselves after getting hurt for playing such a physical game go ahead\nAll built up you're talking about prior for a half hour earlier and it and how good he is Robin you yell at me down you didn't selective his group but uh I'm taking his guys I'm going to take the jets do they ban\nHas the gold steady [noise] I like the jets to today I I I think ah the coast just started and and think and I think a lot just as an\nA lot just doesn't have the surrounding cast a to really make a major move so I'm going to go with the jets\nYou know one of the nice stories along with Mac of course in the defense Mr ... you know he's just quietly gone to a major market top three market in the country and playing good football and the bears good enough to where they're giving the dolphins six and a half I'm going to take the bears 'cause it's a feel good story Mitch ... and the points go ahead\nYeah and we saw a lot of ... he was at North Carolina when he took care of the Panthers a few times and uh yeah I I I'm I'm starting to believe in him but I'm also starting to believe that the dolphins aren't very good\nSo uh I I Will take the bears as and bam also has Chicago so the way they played Cincinnati last week at early on maybe Cincinnati isn't that good and we're going to find out where they are and it you know one of those things this league it's it's so hard to predict but yeah I mean the way they ended up with Cincinnati is more like what I think they are\nI tell you what do you think I think ... is a Chicago Bears type quarter back all the way and I cannot imagine what what is going on in Oakland right now after trading ... back\nTo I got to go with the bears I I just can't imagine uh other than they can't wait to get the Vegas\nSpeaking of the raiders are getting two and a half taken on the sea hawks I'll take ... and the raiders getting two and a half against Seattle\nI'm joining you on that selection I think that uh it's about time that they get the ship right in there and Oakland and and hopefully it comes about now um you know\nThe sea hawks they've they've kind of had a little bit of a resurgence I'd still don't believe in their defense of back to ... go petty nobody's nobody's ever called you feared or have they\nSay\nOh I thought oh yeah [laughter] All right go ahead and take it ... bam has a sea hawks just for those listening at home where you think\nLike the sea hawks I just think Oakland deserve mass [noise] I think they've got problems from top to bottom so and I think a a sea hawks have had a bit of a resurgence and are starting to play well together so I'm going to take Seattle\nOr when we come back as we continue to walk the line with Ted are no this was weak six ... market black and gold Sunday show we've got the cardinals and Vikings the buccaneers and falcons the rams can they stay undefeated taking on the Broncos the bills and Texans the chiefs and patriots the forty niners and backers\nAnd the Steelers at last report getting a point and a half taking on AFC North rival the division leading Cincinnati Bengals they will tear it up and kick it off\nAt one o'clock crude market black and gold Sunday show rolls on after a quick break and the latest from CBS Radio news Katie ... a radio everyone is Bob Bob\nAnd what we really need is a better quality sleep the new

outside of plowing ahead straightforward seeing an opening peripheral vision all of the above cars to play defense of wine\nAnd the guy who played with a lot of success when they weren't recording ... Jones had twenty six or in in in in one year when playing for the rams he used the head slap obviously to a distract his opponent what you are not allowed to do any more but\nDo with Aaron Donald does undersized as such a high level I I think again it goes to that category yeah you learn the technique it's repetitive over and over but it's natural talent to yeah\nYeah and there is and I'm sure he's been well coached but uh you you don't have to be that good if it goes to work with air and Donald fears strong kid now I Am\nA remarkably huge lower body strength slower ...\nNow it's just it's it's one of the good stories in the NFL nice to see that he got paid for his hard work OK teddy who do you like\nWho we picking the gathering Ramsay already took out like we already got ... [laughter] my goodness go ahead Doug rams are giving seven through the bronco we already got his ... we got a ... I'm Sorry you know what I got so caught up in Arab Donald and I was thinking of like a holiday I'd go at their Donald team whatever it is\nSo if I Would put jak snow in a wide receiver with this team jacks no of course you played at Notre Dame and was one of my favorites was a kid playing in connecting with the catching passes Ruben Gabriel what a player from the seventies looked slow out there today you think\nLike max muggy if you put max muggy and the line up with the Steelers today would they'd have to time in more than our glass you think ... we wouldn't get on the field [laughter]\nHe'd have to buy a ticket to go to a dollar being that you guys are in business and neither one of you know this but you know I'm all about business I think it was Willie Davis and max McGee\nWho started Taco Bell if I'm not mistaken or something like that that became a huge French fries across this country so I guess you may be time slow on the field but you don't have to be slow when it comes to making good business deals and that's why I think\nIf you're Donald and you're out in LA that's got to help and that's one of the reasons why LeBron James I think one out there and\nI thought it was a little Chihuahua that started talking and then\nIt was the you're closer I but it was that the Mexican chain\nThat had all of the problems with their ... teaching what is it really tatty yeah up in Minneapolis yeah I remember we built that race track cup of Minneapolis Tokyo's it was a legend up there\nSee this is why we have Mr are no 'cause he's the smartest guy in the room I Love it I Love it I mean now that's a nice story I mean it really didn't have a nice ending are there are several\nFood changed that actually got much like Columbus Minneapolis became kind of a Center for food chains and they they had a good business model and he really knew how to how to do it\nSo that's pretty good stuff okay here we go I still think Josh Allen is the Arab parents and I think he's going to take buffalo to places that they never thought were possible they're getting ten against the Texans I think how can you not smart money has to be on the uh the Buffalo Bills so I'm going to take the Buffalo Bills getting the ten points\nSee that's when you when you preface that by smart money that's how you know that I'm going the opposite direction 'cause anytime I Would have been about anything it was going to be the dumb money uh so I I'm going to pick Houston and that's all I have to do to explain it is it's dumb money uh them had I don't know you\nHad that debate week last week so the temptation would be to go with you but I got to go with the bills\nGetting ten points on this year than just I don't think there's that much better of a team so I like buffalo\nListen speaking of smart money I don't want to say anything but I actually have had George Washington on a dollar bill said to me you're stupid [laughter] you know what I was so I mean so I Know a little bit about the smart money and not so smart money okay here we go Kansas City chiefs patrimony homes they're getting three and a half against the\nPatriots can the young gun out gun the gun in the NFL today no I'm taking the patriots given the points that's not today but then I and I\nYou know cats and I ran we're scheduling the chiefs actually play to Sunday night games in a row which I I I don't think that's been done before but anyway um so are you got the patriots I Am Kansas City I think my man Travis Kelso you're going to put on a show\nTonight and uh some picking them bam has the patriots and an eight to ... when ... routes talking about the George Washington and he needs more Ben Franklin sucked into\nIt ain't happening but I like that has killed either\nHe'll take either one it's just a matter of a matinee\nListen and make it rained baby listen I Do want to ask you this though he is she is nice to see seems to be I mean I like he's just good for the game Travis Kelsey yeah he\nHe's he is when one of the one the nicest guys I've ever been around really really good guy down to earth ah if he were here we'd be sitting around now tease each other and and just having a

on the interviews after the game because it just I find that it's intriguing as to\nI find that it's intriguing as the game itself and he just seemed like a really decent human being I don't know just just about\nCleveland Heights high school really really classy little nice little school outside of Cleveland or a you know certainly a diverse community in which he grew up and it's just a now he's one of those guys he ... it's hard to not root for a\nWhile you know who else came out of Cleveland those little suburbs another clash actor you always root for John ... ... men snatched right All right Doug who do you like in that ballgame teddy chiefs getting three and a half against patriots\nI'd be in the Cleveland State grad you got to be for all those guys got it at a looking at it I think uh the New England has had too much time to study the Kansas City chiefs and I think this is where they get their uh come up and salvo\nLast year was the other way around but I think it was just happy to talk ... uh I think ... is a little bit her but I think he says that every week that it goes up as big game so I I just like New England and this it's got to be a great game let's face it\nForty niners getting tan against the Packers I think this goes to prove that a lot of folks are still wondering when the real Packers will show up and I think it will be in this game so I'm taking the Packers given the\nTen yeah it is the Monday Night or right\nYeah yeah man what a bag or not who\nWho's elected this one um I\nI just but they didn't know ... ... drop below was going to go down either I'm a good point yeah with with CJ best third in there now for the\n... you know his ... his grandfather Bobby Beth there was a one of the one of the guys who was behind the Washington Redskins to enrich about I'm I'm taking no I didn't know that yeah really huh\nWow a class act and a former football player for the old AFL San Diego chargers\nUm but that that that doesn't mean I'm going to be rooting for him and guy and nor am I going to pick 'em so I'm taking the Green Bay Packers and bam Green Bay Packers petty\nI like to invite to I think this game could be over by halftime [noise] uh I think Roger ... needs to have a big game I think he's got they'll come into this with a real chip on his shoulder\nWhy is it the mystique that will get the Steelers the wind despite being a point and a half underdog I Believe in is plus we'll have more when we walk the line and pick our final game of week six Steelers Bengals less than Fifteen minutes away in Cincinnati they kick it off at one

with Mike Henry senior vice president of residential lending a delta bank Mike ... thank you it's good to be here interesting story that was out this past week or a survey that was done that showed that Pittsburgh ranks number one in the country\nFor the ratio of student loan debt to mortgage debt and the issue of the number of people who have more in student loan debt than they have\nIn mortgage debt and what's really curious about that is two things one there are a lot of people who have quite a bit of debt front and overall Pittsburgh ranks and the top twenty five in the country\nBut at the same time uh Pittsburgh also ranks as one of the most affordable ... places to live\nAs compared to countless other cities or around the country so um we're talking about both of those issues one getting a mortgage for affordable housing now and why it's so attracted to so many people and then to the idea of refinancing some of that student loan debt\nSo that people can get it back down to affordable interest rates and get it down to one particular payments and save a lot of grief aggravation and hopefully a lot of money in the long run too\nYeah exactly in fact I'm I was just recently at our Virginia Beach offices we did a mortgage is from others there which is the first time homebuyers seminar that we do\nUm and we had a very good attendance considering it was our first one and afterwards\nMultiple people came up to me and that was their number one concern student loans I have these student loans summer into ferment summer not into ferment but how's that going to affect me and qualify and many thought the actual dollar amount of student loans they had impacted it more than\nFor the thirty year fixed rate mortgage and worked for point seven five percent so we haven't hit that threshold so and then as we typically do we wait wait and see what happens with the market before we move intra day like some lenders do around the country or that there'll be moving in mortgage rates during the day as the market moves with it\nUm but we we like to keep a more stable environment that's better for us and better for our customers so we're still four point seven five percent\nWill probably have returned lesser some strong movement in the ten year treasury\nIn the near term but certainly still a very good interest rate we got complacent with interest rates in the threes for a long time they've been in the mid forces here now they're starting to go the other way which is something that everybody anticipated mhm um and it's still you know when you look historically we're still at a point where interest rates are\nAre are very inexpensive and more relevant at once the market takes over versus the fed propping it up with buying treasuries and mortgage backed securities then you'll see interest rates where they're supposed to be\nWell let me ask you this just at a point of curiosity with I said no longer buying as eight in the past and you just mentioned it's virtually that during much of anything at this point is there talk about them selling yes what they've purchased\nYeah that would be the next phase if they once they start to sell at you you could see more volatility and the bond market that doesn't mean the bond markets gonna shoot up to some high number like four or five percent of the ten year treasury\nAnd more keep my mortgage rates aren't tied to the directly tied to the ten year treasury but that has been the benchmark for the last well as long as I've been in this business since the late eighties that has been the benchmark for\nMonitoring the direction of mortgage races to look at the ten year treasury it's really based on mortgage backed securities and the secondary market where the pricing ultimately comes from mhm uh but that you know that it doesn't mean that will happen it just means we'll see begin to see more volatility as they unload their portfolio overtime and\nThat that really hasn't taken hold yet either so we could see\nYou know a couple of years here of rising interest rates\nWith a thirty are fixed at a four point seven five what are we looking at four Fifteen\nFifteen or four percent okay in this the first time I think we said that\nIn a long time four percent on a Fifteen year absolutely yeah it's about one or three days off it's all time low which is doing five eight so it's a four percent right now and and the ... very tight so you have short term rates catching up to the longer term rights and so it's almost flattening a little bit um\nWhat are we looking at if we were to do or say Fifteen year home equity loan\nFifteen your home equity loan you're probably in the high force I mean when I probably ... year into the four point six four point nine range mhm um and that's going to depend on how much you're borrowing and the loan to value so that it varies some uh but\nIt it's you know it's all relative and we've seen course or things like home equity lines of credits the tide prime those have gone up as prime went up um in September\nI'm In September so we're at five and a quarter percent of the prime right now\nNo of and once again choosing between a Fifteen year fixed rate and a Fifteen year I'm home equity loan\nSo a lot of it depends on how much are borrowing and whether or not it makes sense to go one way or the other based upon closing costs that there are with a conventional mortgage that you really don't have at that level with a home equity loan\nRight exactly it really comes down to exactly that closing costs than when you look at uh the closing costs on your standard mortgage um many of those costs or fix not all of them are a percentage of your loan amount some are but the majority of them actually aren't\nAh so if you took that number and you looked at a fifty thousand dollar loan as a percentage of that loan it may be more cost effective to do a higher interest rate on a home equity loan and not pay the closing costs are have very little closing costs because when you look at the we look at the ... how long does it take to repay\nSo if you had an interest rate of\nFor three or four percent and versus an interest rate a four point seven or four point eight percent how long would it take\nTo recoup those closing costs if you're paying for first four point seven\nAnd it can be a long time on that loan amount because that the closing costs you're paying let's say there are two thousand dollars is a much higher percentage on a fifty thousand dollar loan of your overall financing costs than it is on a four hundred thousand dollars on\nA so you're going from you know four percent up to half a percent in in cost so on the higher loan amounts that can still make more sense to pay the costs and you can finance those costs into your lungs it's not a check your right out of pocket you can if you want but you're not required to\nYou can finance those into the loan and so we look at the economics of it how long they're going to take you to recoup that costs which is long term we get paid the least amount of interest with total cost on higher loan amounts that makes sense to look at a mortgage on lower loan amounts typically below Seventy five\nYou're looking at really doing a home equity loan first linked position if you're looking for a Fifteen year term or less\nYou know as individuals are trying to weigh all of this out\nIt can be a bit confusing and a bit of a struggle to do that on your own ... this is a good time to call dollar bank and talked to someone and have it all explained and make sure that you're really comparing the things that you ought to be to see what's best for you\nYeah exactly and we will help you through that we can we can help you with the said looking at the payments how much it costs exactly are going to be for you and figure out what is the best option for you in our loan officers\nConsistently do that um if you're looking to refinance and and we're actually seeing about thirty percent of the applications coming in today are still refinancing\nA mess with your typical mortgage maybe twenty or thirty year mortgage I'm over still seeing refinancing of first mortgages on the home equity side as well so it's still something that's occurring it's still very good interest rates compared to what you might be paying now and that's where you start what what is your interest right now is it worth\nYou know refinancing down to this interest rate\nI mean if your interest rate on a thirty year fixed rate mortgages five percent it's not worth refinancing to four point seven five it's at six percent six and a quarter [noise] still very much worth it and I end the phone number to call this eight hundred three four four five six to six\nThe information you need as well available at the website ... bank if you have any questions You're welcome to call an eight six six three nine one at ten twenty eight six six three nine one ten twenty\nAnd when it comes to refinancing people refinance for a whole lot more than just what the interest rate happens to be sometimes you refinance because well you just have to write that our family experience are divorced\nHorses that take place or their life occurrences and it's quite possible that the amount of debt that you otherwise wanna collectively put together into one payment that total amount of what your refinancing of credit cards and cars or whatever [noise]\nCouldn't be substantially more than what you have left on your home on your home loan so it makes sense to the written refinance all of it under one lone once again\nYeah absolutely a consolidation type of loan is very common um and and you need to look at that and I've had cases where a customer had no mortgage on their property but had over eighty thousand dollars another debt now so we restructured in into his morgue and save tremendous amount of interest look lower the payments dramatically\nAnd was able to then you know use that as a tax deduction which still does exist you still get a tax deduction for interest on a mortgage\nI'm so those kind of benefits far outweigh the thought while my house is free and clear that that was the financial accomplishment and it certainly is but not at the expense of having additional debt somewhere else at a at a higher interest rate or are very high payments on the short term that that you can't afford that doesn't that doesn't accomplish anything\nSo by by using your home equity to refinance weather's which a mortgage or a home equity loan out to consolidate that is probably one of the number one things we still see today um especially if if it's some credit card balances that may be Thirteen Fifteen twenty twenty nine percent\nOr you see all of that I'm Still existing today\nAnd maybe you you're the equity wasn't in your home we've seen home values rise over the last two to three years so it may be more equity in your home now that you weren't able to do some of that maybe three years ago and now you have the opportunity and the interest rate today is still very good for for that situation\nI'm my camera is with us more coming up in just a

to have the person who has made me be separated now have to actually still signed the mortgage they're not on the note and they can take themselves off of ownership but we have them sign a mortgage or something that would be considered a spouse or waiver because technically the spouse still has ride the one that's leaving\nStill has rights to that property and those cannot be in the bank can't be subordinate to those rights so\nUm there are situations where if you're not divorced yet you're still participating at some level by signing some documents to release your rights and then release the deed so if you're still married and you transfer the deed than there's there there's no taxes associated with that either if you're divorced there could actually be tax associated with\nUm the deed transfer as well if you're you're dating and into one name but it is something that that you can do um we said often\nAnd um it it's a it's considered a refinance of your existing mortgage into one person's name and the question I'm asked most often is can I just take my husband or my wife off of the mortgage got were getting divorced so I just want them off the mortgage and you can't you both sign for that long\nUm and so you're both obligated to repay that long we can't remove a bar where the only thing we can really do is refinance into one name he I Would go with today's current interest\nRight yes theoretically if you could just remove one name well why couldn't you just theoretically removed\nBut I guess that's true yeah yeah absolutely yeah so that that helps with the logic there yes\nYeah [laughter] so you have to go through the process and fortunately dollar bank you guys um have experience with this know how to go through all the people got 'cause I Know what I
