Can't believe what I just saw\nBut here's the most amazing thing the last time these two teams in the world series Babe Ruth was reaching for the Boston Red Sox\nBoston run [noise] you got a team with the highest payroll in Boston [noise] third highest for the LA Dodgers break Bentley Waynesboro graduate producers on the fan big part of the ... a pirate based on network I mean a real seem had noses baseball I'm Talking to him today\nYou got to go back to the fact that payroll matters and the bigger the payroll the bigger bang for the buck the better team you're going\nIt was his baseball I'm Talking to him today\nYou got to go back to the fact that payroll matters and the bigger the payroll the bigger bang for the buck the better team you're going down and I know Milwaukee was closed for closest only good in horse shoes [noise] how are you ever going to have you ever going to compete if you're a fire why should I Do know that\nYou can be when you're at the absolute bottom of the payroll scale but but if you look at some of the runs that have been made by other teams\nNot now the brewers they did it make a run but they didn't invest this year you know they they came out into through some big on some money out there that when I got ... they got Lorenzo Cain um so that you know it wasn't like they didn't put some money into trying to get themselves to the level that they did in almost work that went on at fourteen game winning streak at the end of the year and they were in the hunt\nUm baseball's a funny gay men and a seven game series\nWhile it it generally will show you who's the best team it doesn't necessarily wanting get taught you get three good the oh three pitch usually get really hot you can win a series I like that and still won so is it usually going to be the team would that's been the most money yeah because they've got the best player so usually that's going to happen but\nUh you can get on and baseball you don't have to be the team to spend the most but you got to be able to spend a\nLittle bit to convict fire will tell me the issue being that you work with vantage managed to bring you deal with professional football you know there seems to be a whole lot more parity in football than there is [noise] baseball ... pi sliced differently it's absolutely\nAbsolutely so in the national football each team has a salary cap that they have to stay within so each team is only allowed to spend an allocated one hundred and forty eight million dollars in salaries per season on their players that doesn't mean that they can only spend that much in cash because you can spend\nSigning bonus money they get you over that because signing bonuses are pro rated over the life of the contracts you give a guy at ten year or a five year contract and the ten million dollar signing bonus that Johnny Mosley only county two million dollars in each of the years of that contract\nPlus his salary so you can spend a little bit more that's why people will say well the cowboys are always outspend you're\nOf the cowboys busy they get they put more money into their situations\nThe raiders won't outspend anybody and that's why you see situation where the raiders are selling off a guy like ... because they don't want to pay him now rather have droughts we've come in and and go that direction that may change once they get the last ...\nSad to say one of the most historic branch out as a major league baseball Baltimore sold off many China because they couldn't afford to pay him either so it still is kind of like to have an ... in Chicago right now they're they're spending ... during the third largest market in the country and\nAnd they're they're playing pretty good football this year as well too so I\nThink we're we're fortunate here in

one point I think that uh the giants are really really right now and and that the Redskins or the class of very poor division so I'm going to take the Redskins or as did Brock\nAh I Am also I think

of energy left for them to re surface here in income back even though they're going to be with out there on field leader in volunteers perfect uh I still think he's the bangles can come back uh enough in this one so I'm going to take Cincinnati that covered the three and a half\nRock has also daddy\n[noise] uh I'm going to take the bangles because on test perfect is not on the field I think that's probably they will use thirty or your ... to ... that are just a plus or the bangles\nOr I think there's a much better team I'm going with the Bengals giving up points I'm half point scares me a

to take Baltimore I think their defense is just that good and I don't think uh having just a quarterback Carolina does is going to make that big of a change a good back but uh I think uh the uh ravens will come back and it hurts me to make that [noise]\nNow this is a good story Andrew Luck finally starting to get a sea legs looking better every week through I think four touchdown passes last week good enough that they're giving the raiders three I'm sticking with Andrew Luck who's had some luck of late and that's good for the NFL and a great young man who I think he's\nGot a lot of football left in his life even though he's only been in the leg a few years but after the injuries that he has suffered a lot of people were wondering if you would even be able to get back on the field I think

just how how tenacious as a trainer and a fighter and we could grow singers and you know how we live but they were talking about when he fought as or Charles for the second time as you're Charles one time heavyweight\nSo he's a gross singers and you know how we live but they were talking about when he fought as or Charles for the second time as you're Charles one time heavyweight champion won the title of force field here against Jersey Joe wall caught\nAnd both of these guys had were under a hundred and Ninety pounds and I'm thinking about this the on the water and Tyson Fury fight coming up they're both like skyscraper six eight six nine or eighty five inch reached they weigh like two hundred and Seventy pounds [noise]\nWhy do you think I find it more fascinating wouldn't rocky and as you're we're fighting in an alley two hundred and twelve in his prime and Joe Lewis at two hundred pounds and his prime\nThan I Do these ... I mean they're they're great fighters and I'm going to be plugged in like the rest of the world but I think this is one time the bigger just doesn't seem to be better when it comes to the heavyweight division dead [noise]\nWell don't forget Joe Frazier's yeah yeah he was only about a hundred and Ninety five two hundred pounds when he got in the ring a you know that's just the bigger guys have a surface to to the top\nAh and then you know obviously light heavy has it been expanded a little bit so those\nAre those guys have a a different way class they can go in and honestly the heavyweight division just isn't the marquee division anymore you really have to go down the middle weights uh Welter way said that's where the talent seems to be accumulating right now in boxing and his baby because exactly what you're saying\nWatching to six eight hundred and eighty pound guys slug at it and I thought I thought the NFL was poor\nBut uh you know that that I like watching the middle weights and the and the speed and the the the kind of boxing skills that they have but I think it's that there's been a terrorist and talent in the heavyweight division and it's that it's just surfacing that these guys are there\nYou know and as soon as such love for those fighters back then and you know there was a program that had with our ... legendary of bankers news anchor covered World War two radio just journalists did for many years going in person and what you even as good as it was back then they would actually go on location wherever these certain celebrities were\nUp even JFK John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis big time stuff well they want to grow singers\nTo ah talk to rocky Marcy in a while he was training and also to as your child training camp which was not too far from where rocky Mars and it was both of these guys show articulate so humble\nAnd compared to how all of these heavyweight fights are today where they have millions and millions of dollars very humble and their training facilities their dads are uncle that the guy who's been cooking steak for them for like Thirty years\nBut it was just such a ... it just made you appreciate it and I wish some of the athletes of today could watch more of this stuff on you to see who who the people were that laid the foundation\nAnd one thing about more CNN when as you're Charles in Joe Lewis in all of the people that we were just talking about from that era there was a reason Ted they called it the call it the golden age of boxing because these were not only great athletes who really love what they did passionate about what they did\nBut whether it was rocky Marcy Anna who was an Italian American or as you're Charles or actually served in Italy during World War two they were speaking Italian back and forth\nI just thought boy if you could really take a big picture and step back on how you want the world to be watching these two guys together on that and what our Merrill program that's what you would want the world to be in and I just wish we could have more of that today especially with these athletes who have such an opportunity\nTo do so much more financially than those two and others of that era ever could have dreamed up dead [noise]\nA lot of those guys wound up broke very shortly after their careers are and so you know they didn't have the big money and they didn't have the high I mean they that the heavyweight title was considered but top ...\nUh and so you know they didn't have the big money and they didn't have the high I mean they that the heavyweight title was considered the top athletic achievement in the world at that time it was followed by everybody and yet they still did make the kind of funny but these guys are talking about even when you reduce it\nIn the flight the dollar and the terms that they had back then but most of it is because of promotions that T. V. social media all that stuff you've got to be able to differentiate yourself now from a marketing standpoint in order to get the following and so that's what they do\nYou guys there there there have been studies\nAbout people in their their their names that you know or if you have a an interesting name and in in whether you're bound for success you name a kid as heard in the beginning you're either going to make 'em really successful or are not successful it'll\nLet me tell you about as you're Charles and then I'll get off my boxing soapbox but this is why I Love the drama of the sport and why I Will be plugged in on December first pay per view when they get together Dionne K O Wilder and of course Tyson Fury [noise]\nNineteen sixty eight as you're Charles was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease he was the original Cincinnati Kobe before Dave Parker by the way a any ended up bounds who will Germany died in Nineteen Seventy five\nBut just I always loved him as a kid for some reason because of his tenacity of some of the fight to the rocky marched into work ethic I mean my chandeliers nose was open like a fillet able to stop it years ago so Charles probably would have won that fight but they just were so competitive but he's seeing these to talk and kind of intermingled together on this program\nThey lived up to everything that I thought they were as a kid when you're dreaming reading those boxing books and\nAnd hoping they are the nights in shining armor\nAnd and just see how he ended up but at all times he was grateful for what he had who he was in that moment that he had in the ring and to me we can all learn something from athletes but especially in that time and in boxing it truly was the golden age of truly I Believe a great sport and despite coming up\nIs going to be a good one and a lot of people are going to be talking about it and we're going to be doing with saying so let me take a break we'll come back we're going to finish on the NFL and

[noise]\nI'm Angie know along with Mike Henry senior vice president of residential lending a dollar bank Mike good to have you back thank you good to be here let's talk about interest rates first sure we keep hearing about the fed looking at maybe raising interest rates one more time before the year is up ... a day we have some numbers that have come out this week regarding housing\nAnd I'm Wondering what's happening with interest rates and what do you sing at this point\nActually interest rates are still relatively stable they are higher\nThan they've been most of the yard work four point seven five percent on a thirty year fixed rate started the complete range of interest rates this year has been from four point three seven five to four point seven five and a thirty year fixed rate so we're still in the historically low category\nUm but it is bumped up a little bit I Do read some of the same articles you're seeing some of the reports that\nYou know their housing sales are down a building new build applications are down some but I think that's a bit seasonal at the same time there's we still have a shortage of Homs available for sale\nUm so that's affected that as ... I think more than interest rates certainly\nIf people were looking for homeowners one writes for foreign threes versus four point seven five I don't think there's a major deterrent I mean certainly some level it is um but but overall the ultimately prices will adjust\nBased on that interest rates change over time so you'll see homes that home prices may be a little bit as interest rates go up that historically has been accurate\nBut with a little bit of a shortage you're still going to see some pressure upward pressure on price so if you have little higher interest rate and little higher price that knocks some affordability out of it but in our market I think we're still very good shape\nUm we were actually we've actually seen over the last um three to four weeks\nSome affordability out of it but in our market I think we're still very good shape\nUm we were actually we've actually seen over the last um three to four weeks a little uptick in mortgage application okay um and of course we're our rates are still below five percent and there's many places that are five percent or higher that probably helps um but certainly refinancing his as trailed off but there are still people building homes and buying homes\nDo you think the interest rate move may have had more of a psychological effect on people more than an actual practical one because\nIf they're really that great of a significance to any mortgage payment for an interest rate that would move a half a percent where people were more comfortable and buying when it was close to the fourth quarter as compared to four seven five\nNow yeah I mean ... ... ... the the differential is probably depending on your loan amount of course the higher your loan amount the bigger the differential ... on average thirty or forty dollars a month more him maybe fifty dollars a month depending on the\nPurchase price or the loan amount that you're looking at so [noise] um if you're talking you know a seven hundred thousand dollar mortgage on something of that nature and it was interest rates have a little more impact um although\n'cause I didn't get the one Ninety into it financed and my ten thousand that I used to buy a lot in the first place with the existing house would that then count\nYeah as long as the after improved value so after all the improvements are made is two hundred thousand you would have a total acquisition cost of two hundred within thousand being for the purchase of the home a hundred and Ninety thousand so yes you could use ten thousand as your downpayment that'd be a Ninety five percent of two hundred thousand okay the Ninety hundred Ninety thousand but it would be used for the improvement\nWould you have to do it as all one purchase in order to properly qualify for a mortgage could I go in and actually and say you are I'm interested in getting that property\nI Want to buy it I'm going to hold it and then then afterwards come to you and say okay here I'm ready to move on this now I'm ready to go ahead and begin to build process could either and still get that loan in order to improve it and still qualify the same way\nYes you you could do it either way um you you might want to know you qualify before you acquire the property but sure you could pay cash for the property and income in and say here's my contract here's what I wanted to do as far as far as improvements and we require that there is\nOne contractor ... multiple you can't beat her own contractor so we want somebody who's experience either home builder or home improvement builder\nThat we know is going to oversee the project and make sure that work gets done in a timely fashion and get completed as per the specifications that you were given so it meets the plans and so if it was a large projects like that we may divided into four or five different draws and so we'll send the inspector out so let's say the first one is gonna\nYou know get all the interior framing done and dry wall\nUm we'll ... we'll send an inspector out to say that as complete completed per plans and specifications and where he released the money to the contractor and the different phases go we keep doing that but we send out an inspector to make sure that it is being completed\nUm and so that protects you this ... and also protects the bank you know that the funding done correctly and is this something uh\nUh they're not shorting something that should have should have happened otherwise\nYou know that's a great idea because one of the frustrations that I hear consistently as people who decide to go with the home remodeling route that they'll get somebody\nTo pay them and then the work takes forever to get done\nAnd it sounds as though the system that you have in place with these draws that are available upon inspection that you're making sure that everything is done in a very timely manner and there is that continual incentive for the contractor finish all the work in order to get paid\nRight exactly and that's exactly what we do on a construction on if you're building from ground up\nUm maybe we have an builders are custom to it it's a six or seven draw cycle including an amount that we hold back at the very end to make sure all of the worst complete before I make the final payment okay so we have a good system and people are very knowledgeable and understand the process and builders we work with the some we do several hundred homes a year that they know exactly\nWhat how the process works and how to manage the contract during the the building process\nSince we're using this property and the scenario of two hundred thousand dollars in borrowing one hundred Ninety\nAs we're going through the build phase interest when do you start paying interest on that one Ninety and as a kick in and uh graduated level as the draws or then paid\nIt it really depends we have two different versions one is that you started making normal mortgage payments immediately and the money's sits in an escrow for larger projects\nBut then paid but it it really depends we have two different versions one is that you started making normal mortgage payments immediately and the money's citizen in escrow for larger projects we can look at\n'em doing it like a construction law where you pay interest on the loan as the amount has drawn so if you have a two hundred thousand dollar loan and your first straws fifty thousand dollars really just pay interest only on that fifty thousand during the construction period then there's a second draws say another fifty thousand now you have a hundred thousand dollars\nAnd you're paying interest only on that as well so it is the payments increase as you're building\nIn interest only payments and then once it's completed you start your regular full mortgage payments but it is considered one loan and one closing so if it was a I just like a construction zone okay if it's like a six month period of building let's say\nYou'll actually have three hundred and fifty for\nA month left on the\nFull mortgage payment as opposed to three sixty if you're doing a thirty year that's three hundred and sixty months so can we start the first six months of constructions and you have payments for three hundred fifty four months\nI helped me out with this I'm writing now this scenario the individuals renting they want to own a as they're renting they have to continue whether things being completed right now\nThey can afford everything easily\nOnce they're no longer renting but if they're going through this bridge face for six months whether renting and they're dealing with this mortgage issue for the construction [noise] well what are the qualifications what is the approval process in order to ensure that they can get the property and at the same time be able to keep on renting where they are now\nIt's kind of interesting 'cause if you're renting we don't really include that is from your debt to income ratio um and if you're building a new house okay if you own a house and have a mortgage we do could that be the only way to eliminate that mortgages to sell the property so we do qualify you with both mortgage payments the old and the new if you have an existing mortgage\nOr what we look at is what will the debt ratios be what are they before and what are they after so there is this compensating factors that you're going to be selling the house and and build in the moving into the mind you're building so we have more flexibility on the debt to income ratio is there is a limit their that's possible you wouldn't qualify we\nCan't go super high but we go higher than we normally would knowing what the processes that you're\nGoing to sell that house and move into the new house\nSo we'll we'll have more flexibility on the debt income when we look and see what it's like okay after year after your house is sold and you're in it\nGoing I'm Mike Henry is with us he is senior vice president of

you went to work you had a meeting you wait you'll lunch\nYou had another meeting\nYou wondered how is anyone supposed to get any work done around here with so many meetings you left the office you took the train you wait your dinner you brush your teeth\nUm all the income and your family including overtime um\nIf you're if you're married or there's two of you mhm who are buying the house but only one of you is going to be on the mortgage we would still use the other person's income or or validate their income\nTo make sure you're not over the income limits when it's when the term household income as you say okay let's back up a little bit more how did you buy a house only one person has their name on sure well only one person on a mortgage Sunday and you can both but you can buy a house together to people\nUm and only one person beyond the mortgage the person who's not on the mortgage can be take ownership of the property but they also signed the mortgage which is the instruments securing the the loan they don't sign the node which is the agreement to repay\nThey do signed the mortgage was their subordinate in their interest to the property to the bank\nSo if for example if that\nIf there were two people on a property together and only one of them is on the mortgage\nThat loan went into default the person not on the who is not the borrower and not say well you can't foreclosed 'cause I own this house\nUm you can't foreclosed on me I wasn't obligated to pay the debt so they have to sign the mortgage which subordinates their rights to the banks of the bank but could foreclose if it ever came to that now so you can um purchase two people can purchase a home and only one of them being on alone and there are there are some\nLogical scenarios for that especially if it comes to credit or interest rates are you know if you have one borrow that has the better credit score and enough income to qualify you might be have a better interest rate a typically both people are on the mortgage 'cause they both want to build that credit\nThat has the better credit score and enough income to qualify you might be have a better interest rate a typically both people are on the mortgage because they both want to build that credit and have a mortgage on their credit ... profile but there are certain certainly scenarios where it makes sense for that not\nHow can you ask someone to a mortgage at a later date or do you have to refinance to make\nThat you'd have to refinance to make that happen um and so it would just be a new law\nYou can't just simply add somebody to the to the point where they leave you qualify you\nYou just mentioned a couple of upsides to the idea of doing this are there any concerns\nUm [noise] well if you're the non borrower and the other ... doesn't pay the bar where it doesn't pay\n'em then you run the risk of losing your home and you never obligated to pay a mortgage no you you know that going in because you're going to sign documents you know releasing your rights to that property in the event of a foreclosure so you're you don't have first lean over the mortgage lender okay\nA possible okay at first in a is the one who obligated themselves to pay back the mortgage person be ... is an owner position however their subordinate to the bank right could person be make the payment at first in a decided to stop\nIf somebody was making the payment nothing will happen as long as the payments and being made on the mortgage nothing you you won't go to a foreclosure situation um\nSo it doesn't really matter who makes the payment that could it could be somebody not living in the property if my kids were to buy a house and I wanted to make their mortgage payments or I could do that and I know ownership interest in the house okay I'm\nA scenario where you have a couple and the one decided that I Want to al ... and I'm gone and the person who's left doesn't have\nThe obligation to pay the mortgage but they're the one who's there living the person who actually has the legal obligation to pay back the mortgage is living on the other side of the country right the hours and it was living in it can stay there keep on making the payments that they can afford to do so and not have to worry about refinancing back into their own name\nIn theory no um 'cause if you're an owner of the property and you're paying that mortgage no you're not getting any credit for it if you tried to apply for a new mortgage live it's viewed differently um so there's there's some pitfalls to that especially in that scenario that is a common scenario where there'll be one person on the mortgage but to people on the property or one just simply living in the property\nThe other one decides to leave and potentially stop making payments you do see that my we've we've talked about foreclosure here the\nSo number one reason we see for foreclosure as divorce or somebody who doesn't want to make the payment for whatever reason so it it there there's that would be something where it ... you could stay in the house as long as you were still making the mortgage payment um if\nThey need to consult an attorney about their interest I mean if you have somebody who decided to leave a no longer be a part of this any more but their name is still on\nThe property they are still lifted owner and you decide you're going to paint in order to be able to stay they could come back and claim ownership rights and next thing you know they get the value of the property in Sherry and what it is if you've been paying and all this time\nYeah yeah you're both you're both still on the property only once obligated to pay the mortgage if you're worried about equity you're staying in the house or somebody wants to hurt somebody then at that point that's where you get to and Neal can I get a lawyer and the only solution that really is to you really would be buying out that person\nPaying off that existing alone and you could use a new mortgage to do that\nOkay All right let's get back on that rabbit trails [laughter] it was a fun one to be out there that are interesting and it's very real I mean that that out Oh yes light a bit I'm sure there are people who are listening right now say Oh yes I live that situation yet we have\nYeah it is interesting and it's very real I mean that that out Oh yes light a bit I'm sure there\nAre people who are listening right now and say Oh yes I live that situation\nYet we have cases right now where it the more typical is where you have a couple of getting divorced and one is leaving one wants to stay the other one doesn't want to help make mortgage payments or are they want their equity other property so it's a very there there there's always a
