that\n\n[noise] on behalf of Mr President thank you for giving us hope again\n[noise] grudges\nLaws and by the way it never wrestle him [noise]\nI don't know [noise]\nThat your body slammed my\n[noise] I\nRemember as a room\nA lot of the leaders from other countries is talking about all sorts of things that I heard about it that we endorse read very early but I had heard that he body

wait a minute I Know Montana pretty well I think it might help him [noise]\nSo maybe it's the reporter in me that has a problem with the president talking about\nBody slamming another reporter\nBut I'm also a little bit concerned you know in a hearing that audio is one thing but seeing the video and seeing the president say those things and then looking at the people behind him um he and and clearly there they're going to be the borders and the president\nBut seeing them ... they think this is so funny they don't think it's disrespectful they don't think it's frightening somehow or another that I'm most seems more frightening to me than what the president had to say so I ... but again\nI'm a reporter so of course I'm going to take that personally that's going to have very close

that's probably one conversation but a Thirteen year old takes a brand new BMW\nIt is time out or whatever debate that's probably one conversation but a Thirteen year old takes a brand new BMW um was this mom right or wrong for having that reaction\nUh I'd like to hear what you have to say about that as well the other thing I wanted to just throw out there was this morning we saw to school districts in our area Mars and Bethel park closed their doors today because of threats\nThat were not a whole lot of detail a lotta times their threats that are written on a bathroom wall sometimes their threats that are posted on social media not a lot of details on what prompted those two school districts to close their doors today\nBut um we're hearing more and more of this and\nSome time uh people argue that the media shouldn't cover it that we're only giving a publicity to kids who are doing bad things kids who want to see their schools closed 'em but I think that sometimes districts have to err on the side of caution\nJust because of what we've seen so far if your parents from one of those districts you had to punt this morning you had to make other arrangements\nUm because all of a sudden school was closed if you're a working parent they can't take time off from work or without not being paid you have a tough decisions to make you don't have a lot of time to to make those decisions\nAnd you don't have a lot of time or to make other arrangements\nThat the job situation but is it better for the district to err on the side of caution shut their doors 'em or not so those are the two other things I Want to touch on ah like I said we've got a couple of folks who still want to talk politics\nAnd I will not begrudge you this opportunity to talk about politics will do that\nI Want to talk about spanking I wanted to talk about schools closing their doors\nIn other words this is the Inside Story and there is still so much to talk about we're in our secondary I'm Lynn

most the biggest one my son was a freshman in high school and over the course of the week he lie to me and or a teacher\nThree time wow okay third\nTime with the charm he was trying to get out of trouble and try not to let me know that he was flunking so I made him right I Will not lie to my teacher the where my parents a thousand times\nI've thousand times in a while\nAnd he is now a freshman in college\nAnd he never lie to me it got about a great he ever live teacher and said oh I heard that he was honest because he didn't want to write any more\nSo that was the one time only assignment

P. M. C. feud\nMedicine and today we're we're going to talk a little bit about some another healthcare topic but I I really want to get into some other important issues that have been a facing Harrisburg for for quite some time I'm specifically jobs natural gas industry\nInto things that were important to me that I I think impact people's lives quite a bit uh but don't get talked to talked about enough student loans and the rapid increase in student loans the interest rates and the fact that a lot of people are getting a a degree but can't find a job in in their particular field\nUm and and also vaccines and whether or not the\nUh people should should vaccinate vaccinate their kids are on the the recommended CDC level um there's a lot of questions and even some bills before the general

tonight's mega millions Jack ... is worth nine hundred and Seventy million dollars if a Pennsylvania person wins\nHit the jackpot after they're twenty four percent federal tax rate after the

uh tonight is a um a nine hundred and Seventy million dollar mega mega mega millions jackpot and that meant a\nTim wanted to give us a call and talk to us about taxes on lottery winnings hey Tim [noise] hey\nYeah I thought you said nine hundred and sixty million but the lump sum three game\nYeah I think I think after after taxes after taxes or\nSomething to offer you hear one third and the government takes two thirds\nWell no I think part of it is that the lump sum is less than ...\nSo roughly one third and the government to extra third [noise]\nWell no I think part of it is that if the lump sum is less than the annuity it so you have two choices if you were lucky winner um\nWow it's based on your annual and got my vein but that's actually a guy I don't know what to do it at a public education or education in general you know America spans as capitalists on spending and education at all levels and when you look at where American students ranking math\nAnd reading or a threat to us [noise] you know so I guess my question is why\nIs the cost of education going up the way it is if any other industry did that I mean people would be screaming [noise] corporate greed [noise]\nAh you know the increases in tuition costs ... can you talk about that a little bit [noise]\nYeah you bet thanks to I'm a I think you so\nThe um the reason I first of all Tim this is something I spent ten years in the legislature working on 'em and it's the what I was trying to focus on was making sure that\nThe dollars that we spend in Harrisburg and that come from property taxes I'm to the tune of about thirty two billion ... and as Tim mentioned uh we rank Pennsylvania ranked in the top ten states in education spending on a per pupil basis\nAnd when you look internationally um we're number two a second to luck Sandberg on the amount that we spend in this country for for education yet\nWe don't rank anywhere near the top on on performance and what what what Tim the reason for that is because we've got seven thousand fulltime administrators seven thousand people not working in the classroom\nGetting the highest paid salaries\nGot five hundred superintendents five hundred business managers\nUm we we have a tremendous amount of of of administrators that are taking dollars away from classrooms um and so we spend a lot of money that doesn't make it to the classroom\nYou know a look at the high stakes testing we've done now granted we've recently repealed the Keystone exams or in some instance we we allowed for school districts have alternatives you know Harrisburg doesn't always have the guts to do the right thing so we we we we compromise instead of doing the right thing we've given but we did it we we did take a step in\nAnd yet reducing the Keystone exams but our kids are still going to school a hundred and eighty days a year a hundred and eighty one days a year\nBut they're spending ten to twelve days are teaching to a test\nThe Keystone exams alone took over a billion five one point five billion dollars um to pay for it um and it wasn't an act of the legislature that passed the Keystone exams\nSo my my approach has always been let's invest in kids let's let's let's give the money to students to find the best education setting for them ... for for them\nYou know every kid learns differently we know that's scientifically it's proven kids learn differently in a different paces on but we have for the most part a one size fits all education approach\nUm now granted there have been some changes when you look at cyber schools charter schools and by the way most fibers in most charters are public schools\nThey just don't have a geographic boundary like a um our traditional public schools um but we've got to we've got to create competition um and and I think that's how we will we will improve um statistically\nVersus the rest of the world and we'll have a more efficient but I'm\nI'm a ... a better a better chance of investing in our our kids in our classrooms if we if we infuse ...\nI'm I'm a ... a better a\nBetter chance of investing in our our kids in our classrooms if we if we infuse competition into our education by by the way we we we have we support competition in every industry\nWe welcome competition because competition generally\nIncreases I'm a product it increases the performance of the product and decreases the cops why in the world would we not want that in our education system just based on what Tim set alone the fact that we're spending as much money as we are yeah we're not getting the about the output that we want\nWe need reforms Harrisburg needs reforms\nWill be back after this break [noise]\nFrom about five thousand for fifty one cell phones half of the hill we have an accident on the outside\nOf the

more legislators were willing to voluntarily give you information and I was joined by state represents and Bernstein who\nLike myself post my my expenses on my website\nIs it true Dave I remember reading somewhere that around that time two thousand eight right as I was getting to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania was an importer of natural gas in and we already turned it to to the we're in a net exporter of natural gas or soon to be\nA oh yeah absolutely Jim and let me give you a little bit of background in two thousand eight we've produced\nAbout a quarter of the demand of Pennsylvania consumers are into the lake two thousand ten early two thousand eleven we became a net exporter from the commonwealth perspective to our country and today we're producing a little more than twenty percent of America's natural gas supply\nOut of the borders of Pennsylvania when you add West Virginia and Ohio into that\nWere already supplying a quarter of the nation's natural gas supply I'm from the shale region that we have here at our fingertips and the one thing Jim you were talking about the conference one thing that's got to be pretty neat next week at Stanford University is going to join us that\nTalk about global energy poverty there's billions of people across the planet that uh that don't have the kind of energy that we have an advanced economy when they don't have\nYou have the ability to turn on their ... they don't have ... refrigeration when it gets cold out they burn watered down in their homes or the heat or they cook their food with the same and as a result they live shorter life spans today what\nTechnology we can move some of our natural gas the places across the globe that need energy badly then joined the kind of creature comforts that we have an home in our lives every day\nI mean what what you were you're talking about just baffles me of how much went to\nBe able to do all those things to take care of our own heating utility\nIt ... me of how much what to be able to do all those things to take care of our own\nHeating utility or demand and\nWere choked up from the New England market we could be helping to reduce stairs to weaken supplied around the world who our allies so that they are less dependent on on\n... ... ... a natural gas yet we still have people here every single day\nFighting this industry\nNone of the frustrating thing doesn't that get you so like gets just get exhausting days\nIn a gym there does need to be the battle lines I think the battle lines have been drawn because some people think that we can\nFeel our nation's ravenous appetite for energy completely with renewables and all I Would say I'm not on the show to do a battle with renewable energy I Would just say that yeah we produce about one point six percent of our power in the state of Pennsylvania with renewables\nAnd we don't have the capability to meet our our demand for energy with renewable today there was no better partner for her knowable so natural gas because\nYeah those those sources of power are are interrupted ... were a base load fuel that can be brought on cheaply and brought on in a very clean fashion I Would tell you that\nA lot of folks aren't talking about it but word at twenty six year low\nIn carbon dioxide emissions we're we've reduced the missions of nitrogen oxide shopper dioxide particular missions in ... folks want to try and paint the picture that our errors dirty our air is cleaner than it's ever been as a result of now burning more natural gas for\nThe electrons we used to the fire everything we do in our homes\nYeah but I I also want to point out that was\nUh if if we could hypothetically or a power America in the world on a on a on a cleaner I'm a cleaner option ... what's that about economic conversation in a real is a conversation about that but I Want to point out the hypocrisy hypocrisy\nThat ... that that that the that the left and and and I'm not saying it's all on the left but this this this idea that those are on the left\nStates like Massachusetts are are powering their states or their commonwealth with renewables\nIs factually inaccurate isn't Dave I mean they're importing to seem natural gas they're picketing they're just doing it from Russia they're importing oil from countries that don't like us\nYeah you had and you suggested they add to that a tanker it was actually a French baffled that was loaded and part with Russian Ellen gee uh in February March early April sitting in Boston Harbor primarily because not only New England but New York in particular\nAs choked off the ability to move additional natural gas supply in the New England and how hypocritical when you've got eleven combined cycle gas fired power plants\nThat are providing the primary electricity for the city of New York so they've got this unquestionable appetite for natural gas in New York but God Forbid if everyone anyone else has the capability to use the same products in New England and as a result their utility rates are off the charts as compared to Pennsylvania\nAnd and you know they say the reason that they're importing a tanker with Russian Ellen G and the reason they've had to
