know uh because I'm going to give you several reasons millennials women and former Republican is like me because these papal this group of people just don't believe everything the guy says\nAs gospel you know and and you know yeah sure they dropped a lot of regulations they they um don't a lot of what Obama did but\nAs the last caller said the long game of dropping all these rags and policies to

gene saying that everyone is doing better under Donald Trump she should only speak for itself\nI think the economy was heading headed toward better times before President Trump don't get me wrong\nIf the economy has continued to get better but what moral cost I personally think it is a cost I'm not willing to pay and believe with someone else in the White House the economy would still be fine and

us the cost of healthcare access to high quality health care\nAnd for nearly the last\nDecade or Obamacare has has dominated the policy in the political debate on health care or in the state and in this country and I and I don't want to diminish\nUm the the the impact and the consequences of the federal government getting even more involved in our health care but back home here in this region we have a a unique\nBut over the last five years we solve this problem happened in Harrisburg\nAnd then we started to see it happen in the southeast because Highmark is obviously a statewide insurer with customers all over the state and UP AMC continues to to grow their network um and every time that they've competed in the same region\nOne or both there is no I mean both parties I think failed to reach a long term solution here but they have uh\nThey've been denying or threatening to die I access with people with the the wrong insurance card and I think it's completely unacceptable let's not forget these these companies received hundreds of millions of dollars of tax breaks because their their provider sides\nAre are purely public charities they're non profits they get grants millions of dollars to build their facilities in the state budget\nTheir ... ... the premium payers the the insured they're\nPaying a for these facilities and the thought that they would lose access because they had the wrong insurance card I think is outrageous I think it's also a outrageous to say that they're going to be out of network and they're going to pay even higher costs for those services healthcare costs\nAre is out of control health care represents one sixth of our economy now or it's confusing and and and constituents in in in insurance premium holders are that\nAre left in the middle and I just think if these companies want to operate like Amazon Google um and a private sector fortune five hundred companies then they shouldn't get tax breaks\nThey shouldn't be at the budget table begging for more tax dollars um they should be run like a private company or if that's what they want to choose ... and and and listen we're going to talk later today about a tele medicine and

think it's it's\nIt's disgusting to see legislators you know kind of punt on this issue time and time again\nAnd then most recently right if that wasn't bad enough I introduce a bill within Frankel or five years ago four years ago a to force these integrated delivery networks if you're going to be a provider and an inch or you're going to have that much integration\nThen you should accept people with every insurance card you have that much market dominance that you should not deny access to anybody with an insurance with insurance\nUm it was called any willing provider any willing insure 'em and what happened was it got derailed I'm at the last minute um\nBut it was a good thing in some ways that uh it was derailed because we got a five year consent decree at the time the attorney general the governor force the two parties at a table and we got this five year extension um the problem was over those five years we didn't put any more permanent solutions and place\nSo now June thirtieth

U. P. M. C. has been a\nA pretty pretty open throughout this five year feud with Highmark that are are they want to they want to shift the insurance market\nThey want to shift people that I have a high mark insurance away from it to their own insurance plan or or to uh uh to national insurance or options that had been been in this market um and and I think it was a deliberate uh\nA tactic or a to to to

want to have an insurance product and you want to be a major provider um you need to accept people with every insurance card\nUm and and unfortunately that legislation did not get across the finish line but I'm the good news was uh the two parties are forced to the table um now once again I'm the reason I think that we need to have to continually talk about this issue um is because there's millions of people's health care at stake and\nThe health care landscape in this state is evolving community hospitals that have been here for generations are gone\nI'm a now with the the the

just think there's a lack of courage on this issue a there's a lack of courage to to figure out a ... a long term permanent solution and I'm a free market conservative\nI think one government puts his nose where it doesn't belong they usually leads to problems but health care is not a free market industry it is a highly regulated\nMany times involving non profits to take a lot of tax breaks\nOr they're not private companies and I think they have an obligation to to treat those patients that want access to their doctors and their family hospitals\nAre we've also been talking about a property

P. M. C. concussion protocol if they let me set or because they didn't deem it bad enough\nIn because you had the wrong way because you had the wrong insurance that you would well because\nI have a ... it's a UPN the hospital and so\nCommunity and how I understand it and I'm pretty sure that is correct is that you can see hospital would have decided they unique concussion protocol\nI could have then been referred onto the UPN the concussion clinic that because they didn't deem it bad enough I could not and\nAnd then been referred onto the UPN the concussion clinic that because they didn't deem bad enough I could not and I went over to a a ten which I have a wonderful doctor but I knew who I wanted to see with UPS and see\nAnd what it basically got as I feel that people don't realize\nCome July nineteenth every one that you love it you can see if you have high mark and shark you're done\nAnd then you lose all your doctors and I every time I go on appointment I Try to talk to people about it very casually and they're like oh now I see them now I'll be fine and I'm like no you want and I just think that the public\nFirst of all is not as informed as I thought they were and secondly\nThey need some how to become more informed said that they make good decisions for the next vote that we have coming up because it's critical we're too small\nOf a community and the Pittsburgh region to have to choose between research and world class medicine and another hospital that's trying to emerge out of the ashes you know aid\nHGH with wants a wonderful hospital but they're struggling and I I just think that we have we're so close to being able to access that world class medicine but ... says sorry three guys can't agree ah what's going to happen to you suffer for it\nAnd I think people don't realize that we're going to be cut off in July\nYeah but I think you're right in in in seniors are finding out that the they may be a cut off as well when they thought they had\nA you know some predictability or into the end of next year but the Supreme Court decision in July said no that the seniors are are are also a a susceptible to uh uh the changes of July twenty Nineteen and I think you're right I I think\nThere's a there's there's a few different solutions obviously the parties could reach a contractual a solution um uh you know I just recently reading that you know one of the experts said there's absolutely no chance they say they're done uh doing business with one another source of the contractual solution won't work\nI'm there needs to be a legislative solution um and the governor\nAnd the governor candidates and state representatives and in in in state senators need to be talking about this issue I mean health care is a is a political buzz word um but what we need is not talking points we need solutions\nAnd and when I presented for four years ago within Franco was\nA solution bring to me some other solutions or if if if that means that people will will keep access I think another salute excuse me another solution\nIs to to go after their their nonprofit status I Know the attorney general address Shapiro recently said that he's he's keeping an eye on this issue um and um [noise] my hope that continues um it it needs to continue um because\nThey're they're eating up as time goes on more and more of the market\nUm and we have less and less options and if we're force these two systems to each built out their own well\nWe're going to see is even more buildings even more hospitals we're gonna have to have a second children's hospital in western Pennsylvania even though we have I think\nOne of the greatest children's hospital I have a two two almost three year old son and uh he's got two broken bones already and uh he's not even three I'm ... and he got to see amazing doctors have children I Would hate to have to say well you got to go get the other insurance Carter this this this\nFree um and he got to see amazing doctors had children I Would hate to have to say well you got to go get the other insurance Carter this ... this this insurance company has to go out and and build their own children's hospital um because then we have resources that are not to not being spent efficiently\nAnd um and and and I and I think you're absolutely right Susan that we need to make sure that candidates are talking about this issue coming up with solutions and then we got to hold them accountable\nWritten yesterday was the last legislative de ... realistically uh that that the legislature by the time they reconvene it'll be in January but we can't start talking about this issue in January\nBecause as you mentioned July uh July first next year we're going to be stuck with having two separate systems and and people are going to lose access\nThink it's a paramount that we keep this issue in the forefront Susan thank you for your passion I'm into right now we'll we're going to take a take a short break to get the triple a traffic
