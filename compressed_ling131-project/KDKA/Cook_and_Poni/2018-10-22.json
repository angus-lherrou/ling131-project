about this morning but\nSince we've kind of venture down this road I'm going to keep going down this road and I'd like to hear you weigh in on it\nIt's not that the whole idea of pre existing conditions and whether or not they should be covered by insurance is one of those things that I thought about I knew how I felt about it um but it wasn't something that\nI Would debate or discuss with friends I just always felt that a book should be able to get coverage and then a couple of months ago I was diagnosed with breast cancer and the more I thought about it the more I realized that that them is now me and\nI wondered over a long haul what does this mean for my insurance coverage if I change jobs if I go somewhere else\nI now have a preexisting condition they stay with breast cancer when you when you cross the a five year mark than you are considered uh\nUh you are a breast cancer survivor but does that continue to go with me so when we started talking about covering preexisting conditions you know sometimes when you when you were healthy\nYou don't think about it too much you you just kind of take things\nAs they come you wonder well why should I have to pay for someone else I'm about life changes things and sometimes things come up that literally will knock the wind out of you\nAnd you now find yourself in a different position which changes your perspective now I say all of that to say that's why I think some times\nThat passion the mean spiritedness with which we debate these issues becomes significant because your life situation today could change dramatically tomorrow\nAnd I think sometimes that's where our politicians get in trouble do because they they vote one way because they think that's the right way\nAnd then there's a life changing event\nAn event

best deal in town\nUm [noise] the more you see\nHow things change and so maybe it's just because I've gotten older\nThat I'm looking at things from a different perspective but uh when you talk about paying 'em pay more for\nPreexisting conditions and there isn't a limit on how much people might have to pay so what does that mean you could have to pay thousands of dollars a month if you have\nA pre existing condition um [noise] it's a conversation that I think we need to have openly and honestly and not necessarily a conversation that divides us along party lines\nI'm not sure how much I can
