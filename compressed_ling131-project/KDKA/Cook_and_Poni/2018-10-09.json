Pittsburgh Marathon ... we're going to be doing that are coming out of the break [noise] so I mentioned earlier I got a lot of views on that and\nI'm not so sure in some respects just doesn't benefit to Pittsburgh Marathon um will give you a reason why we say that\nIn a few other things there's always the one word we hear a lot of these days is backlash\nWe hear all the time particularly in a context or we consider\nQuite honestly there to be an end mob isn't the right word here people have the right to do what they're doing online and so forth and expressing their points of view I bet it'll be considered that way by a lot of people and the flip it that is support than seemingly goes ... proven over the years that they can withstand this\nBut makes money money money money money it'd be very very careful\nAbout dropping a partnership with chick fillet over accusations that they're openly homophobic and transfer but human highschool football game lightly you see how many chick

long time ago\n\nParticularly when it comes to topics like this don't tell me I have to accept your view but I'm not allowed to have mine in that in its essence is how we get into so much

is this something that people are burning up about I heard it I read it I moved on that I reconsider that and I felt it was probably something because it's an emotional issue probably\nAt least a conversation\n[noise]\nI don't know folks I just think that we get to the point of ...\nAnd if we're going you know we don't we don't there are certain elements of everything we don't want to normalize look around turn on the television listen to the radio read a newspaper and go on line there's a lot in today's world we don't want to see normalized\n\nBut there's a lot of different ways to protest in a way that I think it could be more connective\n\nIf this is important you either way eight six six three nine one ten twenty those are my thoughts\n\nNikki Haley yeah those are seriously I mean you know we can make this a bit who's going to replace her and\nGo into a long line of of of things that are funny although Volokh is not funny it's scary\nI Want to get more reporting as it relates to a a Bolton and Pompeo reportedly being shocked blindsided having no idea this was coming I Know it was a heavily guarded secret even people that were big time Republicans weren't told in foreign affairs\nWell let's get right to it\nMost people here this they scratch their heads they know she's a politician they know she's on the rise they know or profiles never been higher and her support is through the roof and they got to be thinking of themselves okay what's going on here\n\nSixty three percent of American voters approve of her job performance only Seventeen percent said they disapprove in a recent Quinnipiac University poll twenty percent had no opinion\n\nSeventy five percent were Republican sixty three percent were independence fifty five percent were Democrats fifty five percent of Democrats\n\nWho am I a today you know again there's a couple ways to look at that it's going by a and it's all straight up and that's that and what we saw is first glance only glance one dimensional no need to look at it from three dimensions forget about it\nWe don't think like that so then we get into these other scenarios\nThat's how we think that's our

have to jump in and jump out now they're getting ready for that\nBut she put herself in a position where if something goes really hey why are there she's on the list now again she would be on the list

if they had exactly the same deal from somebody else money wise trade all that comes with those types of deals if it was already out there it's likely considering the lightning rod that that chick fillet is for a lot of people\nAs for a lot of people it would have already been done\nI understand\nThe sensitivity I Would not want to see a name of a sponsor of an event that marginalized African Americans\nI I I wouldn't that would not work\nBut\nWe're we're in a place where the guy who called earlier from ... is this the United states\nAren't you allowed to have a point of view on things of

your last caller or the other callers said you know can't you have a point of view and I want to piggyback off that a little bit and you said well I wouldn't want anything that would be defamatory towards African Americans but see this this is the point that I think we arrive at in this country whenever you say\nOh well the the us defense league world could could we have that because they marginalized Palestinian I'm about I'm a black lives matter well they I I think people have a lot of problems there are a lot of different groups of lot of different problems with them I mean\nThis this is the problem whenever we started doing all this tribalism and to mine too my viewpoint on this the left encourages tribalism like you would not believe it's like they encourage this oppression Olympics\nKind of mentality and this is where we arrive at because of that\nYou know I hate the cop out and say they both do I I Know that from your point of view Dan is conservative that how you see it [noise]\nUm I I think that they're both guilty and they both have blood on their hands um again I Do use as a cop out but I Do think the far far extremes are tend to do that and I mentioned before again I'll go back to the line and this doesn't apply necessarily\nTo a corporation unless you consider again a corporation as being a person is treated like that by the law\nAnd it's a phrase that I was a long time ago don't tell me that I have to accept your view but I'm not allowed to have mine because\nOnce that starts to happen then you have total intolerance you have you have you have

there yeah ... and and unfortunately you know okay so ... who wins\nWho wins in that scenario so if I said to you I don't think Christians have press gays they they say I just don't agree with your lifestyle so or would we allow a Muslim group then and Muslims are are famously\nAgainst gay marriage more so than Christians are we going to allow them to sponsor the marathon none are they okay or or\nDo they not fall far enough up on the on the victim hierarchy to be able to do so\nHi Dan thank you uh sponsorships you know as I said earlier you got to be very careful about you know this is not a legal issue in first of all we've got to put down into some perspective this is not a legal issue\nI'm\n... and I'm going to say again you've got to be very very careful when it comes to sponsorships because they don't just fall out of a tree they typically involve a lengthy amount of work a lot of negotiating\nSharing a lot of time a lot of effort lot of hands on deck lotta selling doesn't just happen overnight and they get a multi year deal not as significant I Do know that\nThe bizarre marathons you get more buzz right now for an event in may there ever could reasonably of ... in the middle of October\nI don't know if anybody over there was done the the dollars and cents but I assume that they did that would be part of the calculation what's the fallout\nIn terms of numbers are runners or other sponsors you say you're there you know I'm Out\nWhich would have already been checked as well versus the money we got the stability that we got\nThen there was one thing that the guy from Douma attempt on as well ... these are my words on his does this really get in a way of running a race\nAnd again I'm empathetic and ... and supportive of so many of these rights does this rise to the level of low of ... of something that's so invasive and and so provocative it's so damn knowing\n\nThat you put it in the same category as some others that maybe more universally it'd be
