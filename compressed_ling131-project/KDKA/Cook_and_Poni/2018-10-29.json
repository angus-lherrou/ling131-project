me that this happened here in Pittsburgh I always say to my wife you know we have such a great city here where we live I don't think any of that crazy stuff will ever happen here and I was really naive\nAnd believing that we had something special here in the city of Pittsburgh people leave and come back and my wife and I were in a bar in Rome Italy and it was a Steeler bar and\nI just thought we had such tight community here and that I honestly lived naive believing that it couldn't happen here and it's just gotten me so angry and still upset today that it happened here in our study that we had someone like that living amongst us here\nOr who called himself up Pittsburgh or or Steeler fan or a penguin fan it's just really bothering me Alice\nWell I appreciate you picking up the phone and sharing that I mean I appreciate your candor I appreciate the ... actually you know it needs no combat for me I mean you you you you said it quite well\nUm and yet I have to tell you Jason I'm the
