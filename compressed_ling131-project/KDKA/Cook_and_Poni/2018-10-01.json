for TLC laser eyes centers Well Zach it's been since April I Know you're thrilled because you don't have to buy expensive daily wear contacts anymore and a lot of people have asked me about TLC so what's your experience been like so far my vision and great plus it's changed the way I look at the world\nI'll give you an example I was talking to a co worker and he was meant to give out his vision he said between the cost and the discomfort of dealing with daily wear contacts he's set up and looking for a change\nI told him I once had the same issues but those days are over thanks to TLC laser eyes centers from the consultation to the lasik procedure itself\n\nOwns ingesting here is that was a horrible thing and I don't know what happened there I don't even know if there was a girl in that vein but I'm telling you is I had two issues with Kavanaugh I I'd issues with her testimony in that a specific time space place streets that kind of thing but I'm not a cop so I don't know if that's your regular\nI've seen it in court I've seen folks were to pardon this dance my problem with two things my big\nIssue with Kavanaugh I thought he was brilliant I thought the writing was emotional I thought it was beautiful times the lobby has for his family that he choked up like that I get that way\nI get all of it they angry felt\nVery similar to Clarence Thomas have you seen the Clarence Thomas of the same thing he went off he really did he went off he called a special form of hell\nBut for Supreme Court justice to come up with this left wing conspiracy during the Clinton years ...\nIt's not healthy for him to go off like that that rage so can I trust him as my conservative voice on the Supreme Court I don't know can I trust that he won't be biased based on what I saw in those hearings alcohol as you decide I don't know I really don't\nWhat what I've done bounce them I Would have found a woman third on the list\nPittsburgh was second I Would have placed a woman and they were given her a shot just me just me money there\nThis is what it is except the alcohol issue I'm Still challenging anyone out there any man or woman out there who loves\nThere who loves to be here to tell me they've never been drunk ever in their lives go back fifty years if you're Seventy\nOr if you started drinking when you're twelve and a father and his fellow stud\nEight six six three now when since ... one where you at all that much um honesty here one time in your entire life you've never been drunk or outrageous camera on the same blackout drunk I'm saying drunk on the same grain alcohol party drunk I'm saying drunk\n\nAnyone just be honest this guy had these logs in these calendars is that you love you're in love drinking beer and sometimes drink beer on week nights you know oftentimes went to parties and often times there were a case but not a hundred and ... one time was he drunk or out of control\nI don't believe that and if you believe that that tells me you're biased right unless you can prove to me you tell me there's not one person after thousands\nListening to support my premise here\nBecause what they were trying to do is kind of basic rights folks trying to get them to say yeah I was drunk a few times I was belligerent a few times then there were leading them into you were so belligerent at times that you\nLost control\nAnd that and if you could lose control once you're gonna lose control several times\nRight certainly certainly\nBut just like the folks that I say are so biased these days and so part is in these days there's no one person out there that can tell me that an entire life never never drunk ever from drinking beer and they love beer\nI don't believe it\nNo I've been married to my wife Fifteen Years right\nWe dated for three so we're we're talking about almost Twenty years of our lives so drunk one time\nNo really\nOne time and that was on me it was at a big party news party in Dallas and it wasn't forcing them to drink but there's all these different drinks and she likes those flavored mixed drinks and I gave her to many\nOne time\nOne time she got sick and it was that night so can you drink an entire life and not be drunk sure my wife once I can say once and she's never mentioned in college but she's a special person just as I'm guessing you are\nBut you can't tell me there many people out there with their entire lives they love no he uses the word love beer\nSo is he a liar I don't know if he does in January ...
