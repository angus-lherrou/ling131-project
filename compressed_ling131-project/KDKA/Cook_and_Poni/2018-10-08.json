don't want to delete this thing\nUh this is why I Need help I'm going to have to delete this thing ah oh lord I'm all over the board now All right so in any event will have to fix that it's ten twenties are well aware\nSo check this out [noise] this comes from well places your favorite CNN but as favorable to the Republican\nThe new NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll Republicans had closed eight ten point enthusiasm deficit with Democrats in July it's down now to just two percent two points so let's be honest at that point is awash in\nJuly Seventy percent of Democrats in sixty eight percent of Republicans said the mid term elections were very important now eighty\nIs if the election were held today would you vote for them a Republican candidate your district has been cut in half from twelve to six points between mid September now well what happened between mid September and now the Christmas gift\nIt was bloody it was awful but it could in fact to energize the Republican base article goes on to talk about a new ...\nAnd it shows that are fourteen ... point lead\nBy the dams in the generic poll in mid September mid September is now down to seven that's cut in half\nMy question to you is how do you see those numbers clearly reflect the trend more favorable for Republicans and Democrats and frankly if you look at the timeline they reflect exactly the time we've just referenced the cabinet proceedings\n\nIs very clear from all of our conversations not I mean literally every one but but the time we dedicated to it\nThat those who believed that in judge Kavanaugh looked at it as a hit job pure and simple\nI tried to add other elements to it to make you know make it work harder for its so to speak although we went with he's going to be qualified and is going to be confirmed\n\nBut the truth is that if that type of thing holds that mindset holds that's got to have a very very powerful effect because that means in particular the Senate would stay Republican in particular ... you know we've looked at\nThe ... the uh the house that's totally different\nBut in terms of the Senate if the Senate is seen as having ... strong specifically the house Republicans by Republican voters there's there\nThere's going to be a lot of reason for them not to turn their back on the Republican seats there was another reason as well and I don't get to it but let's just say that those Senate races aren't as easy to pick off as a house ones are but this underscores a major issue that we talked about the very beginning when I said\nWho's fired up\nWho's burnout who do you think is going to benefit and does it really matter because things fly like this anymore fly\n\nSo this article quotes Glen Bolger one of the very best Republican pollsters according to CNN [noise]\nSeeing a significant jump in veal Pete voter interest in the elections this week the damn intensity advantages melting away two things one I figure it has to be Kavanaugh fact da to remains to be seen if it last\n... di di\nDi ... campaign should not assume their turnout concerns are done\nSo if you're a Democrat and you've just watched all of this what do you say if you're a Republican

as people that can be very influential in how this works out in November\n\nOn the flip side of it I think there's a lot of Republicans at least right now who are not only happy and high fiving but there are thinking to themselves were now back in the game back in the game now but in the next four weeks\nThings well beyond all of this give me the president can be any number of things that sets

with a ... poll as well as ... a show that basically whether we're talking about enthusiasm\nNot a lot of action today to be perfectly honest\nAnd that's fine except that it runs counter to certainly what the current thinking here's which links to to to gather now once I bring up that Hillary and\nBill sort of live nation are doing in the evening with President Bill Clinton and former secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was joined conversations for North America beginning after\nThe midterms to in Canada to the United states and then nine next year then\nThe light and people got wired up the Clintons man they drive people\nAs a matter of fact let's read this art it comes from bill ... on Twitter replying to me I I Can't read it straight the Democratic\nBlind blanks are still in the ... one sentence\nThe Democratic blind blanks are still in the IRS they should walk through every Democrat should be fired replace with Republicans and we can play the same blanking game they played bring on twenty twenty and blank Hillary and bill I Know that you're a girl\nThanks bill\nAnd then of course if you manage miss it earlier I accidentally pointed out that you can call me at eight six six three nine one ten twenty I accidentally had said ten forty and then I went through this saying on Twitter saying oh my God I can see people now over running the IRS with calls from Pittsburgh\nDJ\nDJ sway has been going back and forth with me all day so just thinking of this people call it the IRS by mistake like\nOur favorite dropper of knowledge from homestead the IRS is ready for Jerry\n\nI tend to agree with you Mr sway\n\nBut here is what's gonna here's what the midterms are about\n\nAnd by the way I yeah I did think that she was more qualified candidate based on our professional background beyond that it was not a traditional time\n\nSo here here's a very good breakdown I found and this helps out with them in terms of nothing else we all know that the Dems need to have a net gain of twenty three seats I've given you all the factors that work in favor of that earlier including just history\nAnd people are going to say well that's all changed now hundred years of history is changed by what took place in the last three or four weeks and as damaging as I think those three and four weeks word of the dams in some respects\nI'm I'm not so sure that that's going to last fall for weeks believe it or not because I just think that we're so distracted so often so frequently by so many different things\n\nI Do think that an energizing Democrats we had color say that as well\n\nAnd that you know they're going to run through the walls they sent us in particularly women who we've talked about a lot on the broadcast\n\nBut the biggest reason the biggest reason why the Dems have a better chance at getting the house\nIs because of the numbers they need a net gain of twenty three\nAnd over\nTwice that number I seen forty eight forty nine seats are toss ups\n\nLittle lean here literally there could go a long way but in terms of four weeks from now\nRight now I'd say it's more of a wash based on what we saw it for weeks and is the way this country goes\nLike God we could we could be in a completely different place\nIs different with the Senate though and and all they're all you need to know about getting the Senate or not being able to get the sun is very simple numbers so is the numbers folks\nMost of the thirty five seats that are up for reelection in the Senate\nIn two thousand Eighteen or already held by Democrats so it's not as if it was a lot of wiggle room there if they would prevail\nThey need to they they need to get Republican seats and those are fewer\nSo that is that\nI mentioned earlier about the people getting fired up about ... bill and\nI I have to tell you that [noise] obviously I was on the air when all that was going on at least during a general talk but man they are real lightning rod I mean I had a handful of people calling saying please put them on\nEvery single night and and one woman in particular said they ... they know no lines they ... they cannot\nBe embarrassed and that's polite lot of people just
