[noise]\nGood thank you for taking my call your program immensely most jobs making [noise]\nUm have a question on um\nThere's obviously a vacuum where I'm cold air warm air causing the condensation is that fairly normal um\nFor the use of shutters and your windows or you have a window issue\nYes it is um what I Would recommend um I Know it's nice to shut the shutters in the evening when you go to bed I'm there's people that have the blinds that they pulled down there in the evening\nBut what you're doing is you're preventing the heat or on the inside of your home from circulating to that window so you will find a drastic difference if you leave those shadows opened one evening the amount of conversation that you'll have the next morning will be a lot less\nUm also there's other things that you can do is to make sure that your cold air returns about blocked in the in the room\nUm a lot of times people have furniture over or block and Nicole their return um it's good to have them open um what type of window do you have in your home though\nUm I [noise] it does it with the windows were style ah when I bought the home and I'm really embarrassed to say I'm not sure\nHow is it would window vital window of I Know\nThere's a vital window okay um well vinyl does expand and contract and you could be getting\nSome ah air infiltration through the vital windows or through the cracks in the bottle of framing um but I Would suggest I'm keeping the shot who's open that will help reduce the amount of call and say should\nYell out out also a lot of times John when we're talking to people with condensation and furnaces kicking on an Arab movement and so forth with that\nUm ceiling fans believe it or not or to Memphis help in rooms itself or ... circulating the air and also when we're dealing with the condensation building up on windows in shelters in particular most shutters\nYou can still closed ... leave him crap that you have the slaps on the shutters and you can use the slots to your advantage to still let air in without blocking without you know having a privacy issue or a lotta times when people ask me and I'm In a house and so forth\nAnd it's just the typical window blind if it's a slant pipeline\nHow The Slants open or if it's a pleaded pipeline\nLeaving inch opened on the bottom of it so condensation it's all about air movement um and so the cold air returns are huge uh having them not blocked\nA lot of the new construction though actually put the cold air returns on the ceiling side of a wall not the floor side just to prevent people from throwing furniture in front of it\nUh but it's all about air circulation in a room itself so I'm just different tricks that you could try to keep that condensation from building up so just saying okay it yeah that's the window is maybe older and it's a vine or something but it's it's air movement that's inside it's going to\nHelp to relieve the aid that condensation ice built up and so forth\nSo trying some different tricks with their movement um I'm a I'm a huge fan of ceiling fans a lot of people don't like them\nOr bothers my wife that I'll have a ceiling fan going on in the winter time but you redirect the Airflow so it's not blowing on you you redirected so you have reversing ceiling fan so you change the direction of the fan so\nThe air is pulling it up off the floor and onto the ceiling and around and you're going to get more air movement and if you keep that shutter\nOpen to slap it's not the whole window shutter open 'cause you want the ...\nFeeling and around and you're going to get more air movement and if you keep that shutter open the slap it's not the whole window shutter open 'cause you want the privacy but if you keep the slots open and you keep the air movement in\nThe room itself can drastically decrease the amount of condensation you have on that window itself\nAnd sometimes even to the murder fire\nIn the middle sized to now they look like or with furnaces kicking on you have most homes have humidifiers put on a maybe you have the humidifier set to hire and turn down the D.C the humidifier that's on the furnace itself\nYeah that was one of the things that I did do a thinking that was the problem mhm it did help so sure unfortunately there's not a cold they're returning every room\nNow that's unfortunate there there should be but then you're into leaving bedroom doors open and then that creates another whole privacy issue depending on the dynamics of the family\n[noise] All right hey thank you for the call we got a lot of all there were a lot of home a lot of good stuff coming in via the right automotive text wind best deal in town and this isn't a window question but it is a true value and proven show so we will handle it for

from product development\nReader Williams hey marina good morning hello everyone or are you\nGood how are you I'm spectacular ready for her trick or treating I Am going as a a slightly bowling middle aged man [laughter] alright er oh liquors bars on your life just gave you my snicker when I was gyms age I'd go though that's okay now I take the candy bar or a listen we're going to get through this amazing trip\nAnd it all the years we've been doing this show\nI have never seen a trip like this that truly is fascinating to me\nIs it's um we've been wanting actually how this came about as we were at one of our um I was at one of our board meetings with our board members and we were having dinner and I was sitting with one of them and uh they had just come back from ah the one on one of the ... maybe maybe the Bush in Texas\nAnd they said you know you should put together a trip um for presidential libraries I think it would go really well so what we're planning to do this is our first one we're planning to do a series of them so we're going to start out with the Reagan and the Nixon as you were eluding to earlier um for a trip to California\nSo we put this together um to to depart in April April twenty eighth\nUh like you're saying most people when they think of Richard Nixon they think of Watergate right that's kind of the first thing that comes to mind but you don't think about out how in a I I didn't even think about how\nUh how well liked he was he had one of the largest landslide reelection victories of all presidents he went to a forty eight states against McGovern um and he was he was he had a really high approval ratings he was a really well respected president at the time something I didn't know until going here um but that being said\nWhat was really really impressive about the Nixon Library you know ... contrast thing the Ronald Reagan library which is very polished and really shows what a great communicator automatic Ronald Reagan was the Richard Nixon library is very open about\nKind of his his ... his blunders and where he and his shortcomings I mean the first thing that happens when you walk into the libraries you you watch a\nA ten minute quick synopsis of his biography and they lead it raid off with Watergate and how he and and the elections that he'd lost and how he was\nPersistent and he kept coming back they say that he you know he he was a big fighter and he kept coming back and fight and eventually you know that led to his eventual victory going to the White House but very well respected guys so much so that when he left the White House I didn't notice either\nHe was a very close advisor to every president after him including Bill Clinton which uh Clinton was in office when he died anyway you get to that you get to the library you get you go through this video\nAnd then you go through and that's where you start to see ... you know he came he came into office during some really ... times right you're talking about Nineteen sixty nine or ... and when he came into office\nAmerica was kind of in a dark place and he was seen as somewhat of unifier a few years into being an office um\nWith things like a silent majority speech really cool really cool uh things on display at the Nixon Library such as an authentic piece of the Berlin Wall that's something you get to see walking through one side covered in graffiti the other side completely clean an actual piece of the wall\nOr you get to see the gun that Elvis brought him when he visited him and that's a very famous yeah so do the Elvis brought a Nixon the gun which is honest and they got past the secret service to everybody's surprise or you get to see a lot of the memorabilia from when he was running um you get to see\nThe oval office re creation now this is something you'll see it any presidential library what's unique about the next one is you actually get to go in and walk around it sit down at the desk having her picture taken poll as the president a very cool very cool and I'm here saying I could be the first female president\nI think that well there may be a few before ya that says that [laughter] it it it it's really neat but\nI think the the highlight of this uh this library\nSo it it it it's really neat but\nI think the the highlight of vis a vis library for me at least in probably for most people is the location that it's built on right so you go out back and you see a little old farmhouse\nAnd then you realize that the actual farmhouse where Richard Nixon was born it was built you know he was he was born on on farmland his family is very noble or out in Southern California and they preserve the house\nOver the years even though the Nixon's moved out of it they preserve the house and the cat that an adult can you go through the hell yeah you can join the house it's really cool how did you go inside and they they they they got it back to as authentic as they possibly could to you know the era where he and the brothers and the next and clan we're a growing up\nUh and then re beside that is where him and his wife pat are buried so that's that's not really awesome\nYeah ... ... S C I guess you don't you just hear the passion\nFrom a guy that millennial a young guy exactly as it is really it's it's really heartwarming to me and I know Rob you know I'm very passionate about my political beliefs but it's it's so nice to hear somebody interested in in that so this trip is now it's only five days it's not\nI mean a lot of our a demographic for AAA members is I'm older you know fifties sixties seventies but this is not just\nFor that and there's a lot in here for everyone including the libraries to learn your history as well as the trip to Santa Monica who fund peer night you know restaurants shopping as well as the Warner Brothers studio Guided Tour so\nI mean you get to see the behind the scenes on that so it's it's really cool to hear um somebody from the youngest a younger generation out there right now that has a passion to learn about the history of our past presidents in the in the country\n... let me tell you where am I had was when he was when I was his age actually told him I got to meet an interview and exclusive Ronald Reagan I was like Twenty one years old okay so that was a big deal he was running against Jimmy Carter obviously and the thing that I took away from it was his hair was brown not black\nIt always was black on us and yeah but he was just because you had a black and white yeah right right right right and he was\nJust amazing individuals but to have a chance to go to these libraries right and so and and I'm so pleased that you talked about Mr Nixon that way because he truly was a a a legend of a president when it came to foreign policy so that that's a good story\nYeah that that's the you know they have they have a big exhibit about the diplomatic ah strides that he made with China for example that's out there yeah but and they also have really cool a giant exhibit of don't forget to the moon landing happened\nUnder Nixon's watch they have a big exhibit for that and outside you have um you can see where Buzz Aldrin recreated the moon landing and wet cement on the grounds of the library pretty neat\nYou know you're you're creating a picture for the listeners too I mean I Would be enticed lamb and I go to Jerry Leiber where's this library again this one is or isn't Yorba you are but\nYeah it's in your book health care and so this this is a pool is about forty minutes from where the forty fifty minutes from where the uh the the Nixon libraries I\nRe reading libraries but in in California that it could be like five miles but yeah with traffic forty five minutes so it's it's not that far between the two by with Iraq and Hungary is also bad you're going to be stuck in traffic palm trees California would\nFail it so it's interesting for me as a millennial but I'm also a kind of guy who loves is er I'm a history buff yeah and you know I Love especially when it comes to presidential history but even if I wasn't it's a very into\nThe millennial but I'm also a kind of guy who loves is er I'm a history buff yeah and you know a ... especially when it comes to presidential history but even if I wasn't\nIt's a very interesting library for that aspect but then you have like you mentioned the other parts of this trip so I think this is a trip for maybe a multigenerational generations of different kinds of people you have one person who's into history but somebody who's into celebrity\nCulture you've got a lot of things going on with this with our ah our tour or something and it's again it's only five nights so it's very affordable and I'm also I don't know if you all were listening for the at the first segment\nThere is a great crews that you can add on to it and make it a nice long vacation AAA dot com slash radio you can linked to the cruise it's a princess crews out a round trip out of LA and then we can help you with your overnight hotel and the group will be flying in the next morning to start the president elaborate tour so\nUm it's it's gonna be it's going to be an awesome experience we also have\nRobs giving me you know we we have like a minute and then okay so um while we were waiting my my uh my expert die product development person and sent me a tax because I knew we were she was planning another presidential\nTrip and this one is a motor coach to are we don't have the date set in stone yet but this one's going to be good to it's on the Hudson Valley and you're going to visit um FDR's home oh the library\nEleanor Roosevelt's cottage Vanderbilt estate in West point so that's going to be a great one to sow we'll make that a feature trip of the week here ... similar to that once I went out and I was just let me know I'll I'll send you out there I'll do cleared and thought it's All right [laughter] All right so\nLet me just leave me with this about Richard Nixon 'cause I've always been a fan of Richard Nixon's and I've always thought he got shortchanged\nBobby kennedy was one of my favorites too and tragically we all know he got assassinated and someone who is very much smarter than I when it comes to politics Dr Terry Madonna of Franklin and Marshall said\nHubert Humphrey probably would have won the Democratic nomination 'cause he was that popular believe it or not and it was a uphill battle for Bobby kennedy for a number of reasons but even if it were um Bobby kennedy\nHe still believes in many historians believe that Richard Nixon and what is still one in Nineteen sixty eight that's how much they love this guy but they loved him why because he stayed the course especially after losing a very close race\nBy being a hundred thousand boats to JFK so\nOne thing about Richard Nixon he may have went out in a tough spot\nWith the guy was a heck of a fighter who fought back more times than not and left an amazing history and you can see it at this library one eight hundred three five for eight seven six one lots more to come the Reagan Library is next with the very talented young man that is Jim guarantee stay with us on Katie K radio everybody\nRemember thinking mom had ice in the back of her head like or a superpower was spot in trouble before it happened well now it's time to protect our

out in April where you get to see presidential libraries ports of Los Angeles and the two presidential libraries that you're going to we're going to be the Richard Nixon library which we just talked about and the Ronald Reagan presidential library and I talked about how cool the the grounds of the Nixon Library are you know you have his birth home yet his burial place\nA but it's tough to beat Ronald Reagan's presidential library because just the location itself is just stunning I don't know if you've ever been to California no okay so if you haven't\nWhich I hadn't until I got out there it's almost like it's a completely different world that's ... that's ... ... you think to yourself I'm In America still because you're you're due to drive to the to the Ronald\nReagan presidential library you're going through the hills and mountains really as a semi valley um which are just breathtaking you're talking about Washington so I think the Allegheny uh the Allegheny Mountains change going out the turnpike are high\nI didn't think I'd see mountains is high in America absolutely stunning and of course the weather's always nice out there you wake up on a kind of a ...\nLike any mountain chains going out the turnpike are high\nI didn't think I'd see mountains is high in America absolutely stunning and of course the weather's always nice out there you wake up on a kind of a dreary day like this today and you kind of miss being in California but you get to the location which is it's ... it's the library itself is perched up on a mountaintop is kind of the best way to describe it\nUm and\nIt's it's silent and serene and it's beautiful and you you see the mountains on one end and if you look far enough you can kind of see the ocean\nAh and ... without\nEven going inside you're already sold then you go inside and it gets even better\n[noise] you go through you go through the library and given that he was and referred to as the great communicator I'd say that's pretty that's that pretty much\nAccurately wraps up what this library does for his legacy\nYou get to go through the early parts of the game for his life stories photos from his upbringing times in school um love letters to Nancy the wedding cake top or from when they got married\nUh photos that as a ... you know he was an actor is this really cool green screen exhibit where you get to be in a movie with Ronald Reagan so they might guy yeah it's cool yeah so so you stand on the green screen and ah there's a teleprompter that feeds you those lines from the movie and you read them off and then they slice it together and you get to\nA you get to look at you with Ronald Reagan in movie so yeah I'm\nOn this trip you can be either I'm the president hasn't or you could be the first female president um gets her picture taken in the oval office and then you can go well actually that's at the end of the threat but at the beginning of the trip when you go to Reagan's you can actually be in a movie with\nYeah that is right you can start for bonds though as\nWell and then and then when you get when you get a little bit farther into the Reagan Library there there was another cool ah no but I guess you'd call and then exhibit where you stand at a at a podium\nAnd you get to read off of the teleprompter is cool yeah so I I never I ... you always see it from you know the side of the audience where it's the tilted pieces of glass but it's really cool to see actually how it works or the teleprompter but you get to stand there and you can read off as a as an ... address from when he was first elected um\nYeah so the the the whole library you know they have they have the oval office you know they have all these exhibits\nAnd they have a very haunting exhibit actually about his assassination attempt is going to ask you about it yeah so that they actually they actually have somebody there who warns you before you answer it just to say you don't have the heads up there's going to be gunshots um you know it's just that it that is pretty uh\nIt it it's pretty scary but even even with the assassinate with the assassination attempt\nYou know even with all the exhibits they're such as the suit he was wearing that thing it's there such as the X ray it's there is all there but even with that\nMan was funny though yeah he was cracking jokes all the way through your all Republicans ... ... email but he looks up at his surgeons instead I Hope you're all Republicans and I would have the surgeon same response he said I'm today Mr President were all Republican there you go I'm\nNo yeah yeah he was the great communicator but to the library itself I mean\nYou need you need ...\nYou need a day at least to get through everything accurately but you know\nThe coolest part I really you know I don't know if we're going to have to come back and talk about no you're good and then two more minutes the coolest part\nWhich everyone will say which is probably their ... their crowd achievement at the Ronald Reagan presidential library in the semi valley is Airforce one\nNot a replica of the the air force one the plane itself which was surprisingly similar to a plane that I Would get on out of Pittsburgh international that was it like you look at you look at you look at it today and they also have you know\nSelf which was surprisingly similar to the plane that I Would get on out of Pittsburgh international that was like you look at you look at you look at it today and they also have you know they also have the presidential limo and they have a president Johnson's helicopter there um\nAnd you would think oh no the air force one I bet you have to big high tech airplane yeah not so much you know may maybe today it is but back then it was it was kind of just an everyday common Boeing you get inside and you actually you see the cockpit\nYou walk through the plane you walk through where they preserved where the president was set up front then behind that was like the chiefs of staff and you know the general media travel at the media were on the tail of the plane\nAnd his place in a while [laughter] got to print media you're lucky [laughter] just walking\nThrough and it was it ... it was she was first of all it really is a thing really hide it\nFrom this conversation and this is why I get so frustrated with people today and I remind my children all the time\nThey agree or disagree with the politics the party is still the respect of the president's exactly in a trip like this I think that it instills in what all Americans should be thinking about no matter who the president is are there political beliefs of the party they belong to\nYou you you got to respect the president for the job that he and maybe and I hope some day she does\nIn this plane had Republicans and Democrats on it right doesn't matter it's a cool plane you're walking on air force one you're walking where the president ... and that you know it it it it's it's they actually have it set up into this big\nYou know the whole the whole hall is a giant air force anger with these big beautiful glass windows where you can see all the valleys and hills are they actually have a pub down on the on the ground floor which was imported from Ireland there was a it was it was a pub that\nIt was originally called the belly ... but they brought it from Ireland Ronald Reagan visited it on his trip to Ireland\nThey deconstructed it in Ireland brought to America reconstructed it at this library or in honor of his Irish heritage you when you go when you go on these tours it's like OK Republican Democrat doesn't matter this is cool\n... these are some pretty cool things a lot of really cool exhibits I mean it's just neat looking at an actual representation of the oval office spec by suspect the actual size\nYou know Ronald Reagan's is full of course of all of a little box of horses and and the cowboys but now it's it's just neat and this trip is an inexpensive way to experience as I'd\nLike to California is if you want to do that on your own\nYou know at that that that can be that can get up there\nAnd you can and it can you can get it done but then you gotta time everything and nowhere to go and and and we have the people they're the experts that are going to help you through it whether it or if it for you yeah getting you from one place to another and I'm dining with you and I ...\nJust the experience with a group is is\nPretty special show what I'm Wondering when the great president and his Donald J Trump has his libraries\nI Know it's going to be all gold sloppy [laughter] I don't know a\nReal you know forward that I may be at the Trump Tower for put it in Atlantic City on the boardwalk why not you know have some fun\nWith it so I'm libraries do either of you know ... how do they how do they\nMay pay for them and ... I don't care how even if it is my taxpayers' money in its history yeah I mean you look you see how it made him smile a young person it engages them and history and as long as you're engaged in history you learn from it you move forward from it\nAnd I think what it does and you could hear it in his voice no matter your age where I have to have respect for the presidency okay we'll come back we're going to talk about this are cruises a week but a great job by Mr guarantee and if you want to get on this trip\nOne eight hundred three five for eight seven six one I stay with us Steve Hoffman is already hear many can at coming up next our on ...\nAnd this trip one eight hundred three five for eight seven six one All right stay with us Steve often is already hear many connect coming up next our on kitty cat radio\nFor those three to some of however many you know ... if I had a deer ... then I have to say\nThat the punishment if you're going to cause a thousand dollars or more with the damage to my car your dinner fast\nRemember thinking mom had ice in the back of her head like or a superpower was spot in trouble before it happened well now it's not enough to protect our home and family and spotting troubles way tougher\nThat's my parents' trust blink blink video cameras are motion activated so placing them around your home is like having ice everywhere\nBlink cameras or wire free set up in minutes and run on to double A. batteries last up to two years brilliant technology\nPut a blink camera on your front porch to spot package sleeves and wanted to alert you if a stranger is looking around the yard\nAnd parents love blinks live feed auction electric checking from anywhere using your blink smartphone app so you'll know when your kids get home from school\nBlink camera systems are back in stuck and right now the Fifteen Percent off that's right Fifteen Percent of all security cameras visit blink protected dot com slash radio for offer details that's blink protected dot com slash radio like as an Amazon company limited time over terms and conditions applied\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rates stays locked\nRemember thinking mom had ice in the back of her head like a super power was spot in trouble before it happened well now it's on us to protect our home and family and spotting troubles way tougher\nThat's my parents' trust blink bleak video cameras are motion activated so placing them around your home is like having ice everywhere\nCameras or why are free set up in minutes and run on to double A. batteries last up to two years ... technology\nPut a blink camera on your front porch to spot package sleeves and wanted to alert you if a stranger is working around the yard\nAnd parents love blinks live feed auction the electric checking from anywhere using your blink smartphone app so you do when your kids get home from school\nBlink camera systems are back in stuck and right now there are Fifteen Percent off that's right Fifteen Percent off all security cameras visit blink protected dot com slash radio for offer details that's blink protected dot com slash radio is an Amazon company limited time offered terms and conditions applied\nOnly getting a radio when he was a radio was anytime anywhere\nWhere they had a [noise]\nBoys so as far as I'm Katie ... a radio [noise]\n\nThe news on the hour sponsored by their works really\nI'm Lindy Gillette at least Fifteen people are dead after a suicide bomber blew himself up at a polling station in Afghanistan ISIS and the Taliban has threatened violence but the country's election has still brought higher than expected turnout CBS correspondent Charlie Daggett explains why from Kabul\nIt's a very important election for a couple of reasons he's a parliamentary election they're going to have those two hundred and forty nine people into the let me just to give you to take years they're twenty five hundred candidates who are now buying for these positions\nDevoting we'll continue tomorrow at polling stations that experience problems only about forty five hundred tend hers were open instead of the plans Seventy three hundred because of security concerns\nSeveral democratic and Republican lawmakers are questioning Saudi Arabia is claim a journalist Jamal could show he was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Turkey and a fist fight that was ... the international here CBS News correspondent Jim Taylor\nWe need some justice we're speaking with Shireen ...

I was over to the office before coming in this morning agents are running around like chickens with their head cut off trying to get everybody\nKnow I'm really proud to say that we've conducted since October first over sixty educational events all throughout the city of Pittsburgh and around and since Monday Rob are folks have assisted over six hundred Medicare beneficiaries\nAre actual real life events let's talk to the folks that want answers because this event is underway and they're looking for them and that's why they're calling us here today to get those answers Robert in McCandless welcome to Katie K radio with Steve and Brian from any can act how are you\nRobert\nYou there okay\nRobert's not there so let's talk your stories go ahead Steve yes\nWe had just Thursday Thursday we had a gentleman in our office Ninety One years old Rob from Bellevue\nGoing through his situation he look he's on a security blue plan was hammered paying three hundred bucks a month almost two eighty you know almost three hundred a month all his doctors or UPN see doctors\nSo he was worried what am I going to do you hear this all this stuff about Highmark and UPN see with his current plan he will not be able to see any of his doctors come July first of next year\nSo he is obviously panic he takes some eye drops do these eye drops are expensive odd jobs and Highmark worked out a deal with him this year to cover these odd jobs are not in any formula Larry they're\nNot in high marks they're not UPN seas so if he keeps his doctors and switches to U. P. M. C. insurance he's going to lose payment for his eye drops but his doctor then this is the part that got me fired up this morning\nHis doctor told him don't\nWorry about it\nGo with the U. P. M. C. insurance because this Highmark and UP AMC you're going to mend fences at\nThe eleventh hour Rob\nAm here to tell you there's not going to be any mending fences we talked with attorneys from UP AMC we've\nTalked with attorneys from Highmark neither side has an interest in making amends as a matter of fact they just keep building more facility as the sons down in the Jefferson hills area stop the U. P. M. C. south building you know UPN feast trying to build facilities everywhere\nIt's because they're not formula Larry they're not a network\nLeaving Steve it's prime what if I Want both\nThere's options available to access to both ... there is that option available Brian there are carriers during national\nCarriers with\nGreat reputations that give access to both Allegheny health network doctors UPN see doctors and I should even not in the third robbed they\nGive access to independent facilities people facilities and doctors aren't affiliated with either network you need to learn the facts and you need to make sure you have the information so that you don't make a mistake that could potentially costs you tens of thousands of dollars and twenty Nineteen\n\nOr let me just jump in here in ... tell the folks again when if you want to join is the number to be on the program eight six six three nine one ten twenty you can reach us a dollar bank and some access ... to ... dot com and you can Texas on the right on the middle of my best deal in town the Dow directly with them\nOne eight eight eight eight one eight many one eight eight eight eight one eight many one eight eight eight eight one eight\nSix three three four now Brian for some reason people find that comfort zone and these two big names that dominate the marketplace but in reality once said talk to the folks that many connect to understand that there are alternatives out there and just because it's not the name you're familiar with does it mean that it isn't a program were planned that can't not work for you correct\nCorrect and Rob let me be very clear on this\nYou know there's a difference between health plan and then health system and I think in this particular region people get the two confused so\nYou know for everybody out there that might have access some work with UPN the hospitals and doctors it's fine and there was some of the most reputable groups in the country you can still keep access to all of them that doesn't mean that your health plan has to be UPN the health plan\nIt's difference between health plan and health system you want to have access to your doctors and hospitals Steven Brian we understand that the folks American act we get it\nYou also might want access to the Allegheny health network\nI completely understand that to what we're trying to say Rob is that you can have access to both networks and not get caught in the middle of the cross fires of this debate you can have access to both networks it's just a health plan\nIs a national carrier health plan and there's multiple ones out there to choose from that still have the same types of premiums and the same types of out of pocket benefit costs and benefits you Rob\nSo you can still have the best of both worlds you don't have to get caught up in the middle of this and I think as a medic like that's what we're we're pushing hard more so than anything else if they still have access to all of these systems yet have a health plan that can still give you a competitive benefits and competitive premiums\nAnd that's that's the big key don't limit yourself on ... on choice don't settle for something that may not be the best option and I and I'm not even saying Brian at Highmark or UPN scene may not be the best option for your situation but you're hurting yourself if you don't explore the opportunity and the option absolutely\nAbsolutely we just did this with my aunt robbed she was in last week you know here's somebody that was on UPN see we went through her we did a compliment comprehensive review of her plan when\nWe finished with her because of the type of condition that she has she's staying with UPN the and that's fine\nAnd we're not here saying that you shouldn't be with you in the health plan or with high marks were just saying at this stage you need to be exploring the options because there is going to be a reduction in network for these customers in twenty Nineteen and our concern is we can't predict what your health is going to be next year to year after\nOnly are you concerned about the money people are spending and how they can actually shave by getting a hold of the folks who many connect but let's face it Brian is Dee\nNot only are you concerned about the\nMoney people are spending and how they can actually save by getting a hold of the folks at many connect but let's face it Brian is the once you get to that age and I am knocking on the door you guys haven't even seen the welcome mat yet but I'm On the porch OK fingers on the button I Need many connect I Need answers\nYou one convenient so last thing I Want to do\nIs if I have to have a major surgery I don't want to travel fifty sixty miles from where I live I don't want to make it as convenient as possible so family obviously can come and visit but more importantly than I Am comfortable in my surroundings when you face the world of surgery alone\nYou need all the comfort you can get and that's one of the things that you guys can at least help people if it can't be planned a meaning down the street maybe around the corner but you'll find something to meet their needs\nWe would definitely will and will do that in person will do that over the phone however you're comfortable doing that we wanted to make sure that you have the best plan for you and even maybe more important than convenience Rob is getting the best Dr facility for your condition\nWe don't ever want people to settle for a second best or third best we don't want people getting advice from the wrong from the wrong places you know you may love your doctor and your doctor may be outstanding he may be the best primary care physician in the country but the fact of the matter is is he's not an insurance expert\nHe shouldn't be advising you on your plans so I Know there are people listening today that went to the doctor's office and they were told you have to have X Y Z insurance that continue coming to us it is simply not true understand your choices and options that's what we're here for\nAnd and brand you really need somebody that deals with this every day to talk about the fine print to explain it to you because if you're trying to read some flyer that you get in the mail and you're going to make your decision on that you're going to shortchanged yourself\nWell Rob you know if I have to fake\nI could probably ties strengthen my ... string to the other end of the thorn off on my door and slammed the door shut and all my own right I'm sure you know ... people can do this themselves but what ends up happening in the end that has ended up becoming you know potentially more painful and bloody it doesn't need to be that way there's a reason why there's advocacy groups out there like many connect\nUm we saw that there was a neat in the marketplace for it and we also understand that some people might feel uncomfortable with meeting with a stranger in their home so we have the capability for them to come to our office and for many folks you know in this age demographic in particular Rob traveling is not always that easy for them we understand that too We're the only organization it in the region that has\nA call center staff that it's fully life and so if you prefer to just do business be at the phone back and forth and have a relationship with somebody over the phone\nAnd a concierge at our office to work with we have that too\nSo we try to make sure that we cover all the basis for folks that they have the capability to be able to work with our farm because we believe there's that much of a need for it and I can't say that is enough not just today but also in the future\nYou know we work with our customers on a year to year basis your plants are going to adjust and change over time it's just so happens this year in particular there's a major change happening in the market and we want to try and get the voice out there as much as we possibly can that will knowing where here for you\nIt's not going to cost you anything additional your premiums and your benefits will remain exactly the same as if you went to the character ... you're just now got to have an advocacy third party relationship that they are on your behalf\nListen and we have to get to a commercial break but we're going to come right back if you need answers instead of just sticking around until we come back I'd go to your phone down this number talked to one of their representative\nIf you need answers instead of just sticking around until we come back I go to your phone down this number talked to one of their representatives one\nEight eight eight eight one eight many one eight eight eight eight one eight many one eight eight eight eight one eight\nSix three three for if you want advice now while they're here for the next half hour Brian and Steve polish eight six six three nine one ten twenty eight six six three nine one ten twenty\nRemember thinking mom had ice in the back of her head like or a superpower was spot in trouble before it happened well now it's on us to protect our home and family and spotting troubles way tougher\nThat's why parents trust blink blinked video cameras are motion activated so placing them around your home because like having ice everywhere\nCameras or wire free set up and minutes and run on to W. batteries last up to two years Bree in technology\nPut a blink camera on your front porch to spot package sleeves and one to alert you for strangers walking around your yard\n... where do you see I was telling the during the break you know I'm ... three and a half years away something like that I mean I I don't see this much changing so many connect does your services over the next five ten years more than ever so this is just really the tip of the iceberg would you agree\nYes would definitely agree on that one from you know what happens if\nYou know of laws change in DC\nAnd healthcare is reformed at the Medicare level there's already been conversations and talks about it we've had had happened back in the early to thousands when Medicare Advantage that the country as a whole and there was a big shakeup back then there was also the institution of the part D program and prescription drug benefits\nTo for us to assume that there aren't going to be any further changes in the next ten to Twenty years I think we're all fooling ourselves there's always going to be adjustments and the key is who's your advocacy who's the person who's the group that you can reach out to that's really going to give you an independent point of view\nIt's not going to be the carriers direct\nRight I mean if you call a Ford dealership Rob and you're looking to buy vehicles are not going to talk you bought a Toyota and it's understandable it's business we get that\nUm that's where I think ... that's why when we came up with the idea that we thought wow there's no independent advisory service or in this entire region for people to reach out to and get an honest independent free of influence point of view\nAnd the have that along with now a dedicated service representative so you can work with on an annual basis as your health care changes over time I think is critically important\n[noise] All right here's the number again to join us eight six six three down one ten twenty but while they're there today and they're going to be there for a while I'll call them direct\nOne eight eight eight eight one eight many one eight eight eight eight one eight\nSix three three for let's say Hi to Barbara in do you know boy Barbara welcome to getting care radio\nHi um I'm In this high mark ... pm see debacle and have explored and going to meetings with different um know carriers I'm currently in the advantage plans with Highmark which had been very pleased with\nAnd um I look back now and I've talked to a Medicare advisor a and really fight this was where I wanted to go with their um planned F. how ever\nThat as a supplement plan and I've been with an advantage plan and it hadn't been told that you cannot switch or if you do it's very expensive the older you are so and I understand all the planets are the same um [noise] so I guess\nI'm asking is that true that you cannot go from advantage to supplement and um I enjoy having like my prescriptions all covered in an advantage plan that I don't have to go find party day somewhere\nUm so that's my question if I Would choose sides say say for example am I able to go from advantage to supplement\nThe short answer is yes but there are some complications for some things that need to be considered when doing up Barbara there's health underwriting then has to take place when you go from an advantage plans to Medicare\nSome things that need to be considered when doing that Barbara\nThere's health underwriting that has to take place when you go from an advantage plan to Medicare supplement so you'd have to answer a whole list of health questions they're going to pull your health records to make sure that you're not buying the prescription that you take could affect it things like height weight do you smoke all those things play a factor so\nUm I Would definitely say it's something worth exploring but there are or Medicare Advantage plans available to give you a lot of very similar benefits will not the same\nIn terms of what a plan that put off or there are things that can cover you just like your Highmark plan has covered you for years probably at a a better premium and give you the ability to go to all the doctor networks all the provider networks and places like Johns Hopkins in Maryland in Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland so\nThere are those options and I and I would definitely want one of us to sit and dig into more details with you\nI Wish we could kind of now the rebel yell at me because will eventually have to go to commercial again and we don't want that\nFive or thinking of asking for an appointment yeah and you want to just call the author and when you go and listen to different companies are upset the meetings and then\nYou know I'm I've been in the medical field all my life I understand this process it's just really ... look at this company or service company versus is like what am I currently paying what do I currently have\nAny left guy if I were to get ill\nYeah even if you want to call the office we got people that are standing by in riot and the more details at eight eight eight eight one eight Matty we also have some more events coming up we do a lot of educational events\nSo you could get the schedule but we'll being cranberry and Oakland and craft in probably on the east side of the city again so if you call the office you can get a a schedule one will be holding events with our wraps as well and that's usually one of us doing those events so maybe I'll get to meet you in person\nOn there you go that great [laughter]\nThanks Barbara good call Barbara let's take a short

women's particularly the women in Japan consume about Thirteen milligrams of eyes on in their daily diet now that's really interesting because\nThe thyroid itself requires six milligrams of iodine on a daily basis to function properly\nDay six milligrams keep that in mind\nAnd breast tissue rate they they absorb about five milligrams of ... of iodine daily so right there you're up to eleven milligrams\nOf iodine that you require on a daily basis that's ... that's not even counting the rest of the organs and your body and every cell in your body requires iodine now what's the already
