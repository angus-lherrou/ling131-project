for that but um it just seems to me a little excessive you know we talk about kids being kids\nAnd a lot of neighborhoods don't even have a trick or treat anymore a lot of neighborhoods don't celebrate it or they have very organized functions I Know ah\nMy church as one of those trunk or treat events where the kids just go to the church\nAnd uh you know so there are different kinds of ways

a lot of people don't celebrate Halloween totally get it totally respect it um but for those who do\nTheir kids should be allowed to trick or treat until they feel like they're too big let they feel

that might be Roseanne like the woman who cuts my hair\nNames are important\nI say about what's his name you got eight six six three nine one ten twenty so when you go to church\nYou go to church\nBecause of the church the parish itself obviously you've you've selected\nFaith we got moved past that that's an obvious choice and and the basis behind the faith we will pass that you're not a non believer going to a church we're not going to go into that but do you go because\nBut do you go because of the Paris itself you go because of the priest is\nIt and they should have this coming down with the reorganization that's going to guess take effect or be voted on or otherwise move forward on Monday as I understand it with the Pittsburgh dioceses\nIs still not settled real well with a lot of parishes and more particularly a lot of parishioners\n\nKnow somebody just consider to be a necessity there's nothing else you could really do it's a reality the situation we all know the financial score we all know the number a of a decreased uh baptisms and a a variety of other important events attendance masses\nAnd so forth so maybe it's just a question of survival are survive ability that's how I've always interpreted it\n\nI don't know how it re juvenile inmates energy I don't know how to read juvenile inmates spirit and that's where you can help me because I've not been subject of this type of development in my face maybe you could let me know how that works\n\nThere was a lot of people can make a very easy argument that instead of it actually read\nYou an aiding safe that it that it has a negative impact on it\nI don't know these people it's a new place\nI'm from Pittsburgh I don't like new I certainly don't want to have to travel I have my routine I Know where I'm going to park I Know where I'm going to sit in church\nThis isn't new not like I'm you know breaking news here but we've got a big multi year investigation and work up\nThat's going to go into effect and these are some of the questions and I and I I don't want to be I'm just going to run on this by you and I'm going to try to be as sensitive about it as I can\n\nWe accept that there are problems when it comes to the financial aspects of the church at least as it relates to hear more locally\nAnd merging in managing these parishes as part of it for the reasons I just had a moment ago there are others who might look at it and say\n\nHow exactly we get here yeah there's been a decrease in all these matters that I just mentioned these rituals and things of that sort\n\nI Wonder if there's a little bit of auto mighty how did we get here who who who put us oh what created a scenario where we needed to go down this road\n\nAnd more specifically one of the loss of faith come in now if we want to be very very micro we want to look at the most recent and all of that it's very easy to just take a look specifically at what's happened here at the grand jury and that's that but that's only forgive me icing on the cake or something that's been happening for a while as a matter of fact you can\nPerhaps make the argument that if this has been going on for a long period of time this is the chicken in the egg I don't know what comes first\n\nIs no one ever I bring up the church people have strong reaction and I do have two lines available eight six six three nine one ten twenty and after the second one I'm going to be done I'm going to let you take over\nOver but you can see an argument that would say of this problem that has been highlighted of course in his address to a Geisha and has been going on for a long period of time\nAs well as the fact that we're just become more secular arrived generally unless faithful less religious if you will\nThat there was an ability that these would all combined so that we would have less attendance less mass you know so forth and so forth\n\nBut if their payments that have been going on for a period of time\nTo cover and not an expensive\nIs it leaves worth asking whether some of these consolidation that are done for survive ability\nOr on one hand very likely but not the only reason because having financial resources
