heard Teresa from the south side you've been on for a while here let me pull you up good morning how are you you're on Katie K radio only\nHave one day I just have a comment about this black ... yes\nMa'am business I'm like I'm not really for it but what is the difference I mean I don't expect you to have the answer between a black wearing black face and wearing a mask because one block Obama was president\nA lotta kids went trick or treating with a mask or Morocco bomb a mask and nobody seemed to get upset about that you know\nAbout it but I watch the nightly news every night and I want to know what's going on in the world and I I I'm thankful that I'm not in these hurricanes right but I I I Want to see what's going on and I want to know what can be done\nSo at the end of the day do you feel empowered argue uplifted do you feel I'm proud of your community of your country how mean how do you go to bed at each night this is something that that you do habitual you watch the news how does it make you feel\nWell when I watch the news like with hurricanes are see the good innocent people and you know I I I Can't imagine\nWorking your whole life to have a house and to all these belongings and and\nThere's nothing left shoulder and there's not there's they're standing there like it's a you know what\nAnd that's that's so well said when I was uh when I was a student at the University of Colorado in Boulder um if I was a junior and we were given an assignment to take these big clunky video cameras and they had these attached video decks that were just miserably cumbersome and to go out and to to try to tell a story and the camera\nAnd so I watch my classmates they went out and they did you know went to the local bar and God you know video of people drinking and eating and conversing and whatnot and there was a tornado\nThat had come in the night before in a town called ... and about Ninety miles from Boulder and I decided to get in my car\nAnd I was going to go to linemen and I was going to get video of what this tornado had done\nSo I get there and there is a state police trooper blocking the road and I kind of lie and I'm like hey I'm with the you know the news in Boulder and I flashed in my school ideas though that was anything and he let me and and and I pulled up and I wasn't prepared for what I saw\nI Know I wasn't prepared for watching people pick through the remnants of their lives and it was\nI sat there for a while and I didn't do anything I first was embarrassed 'cause I I was invading something so private so her personal story devastating and I felt almost gross like who are you what are you doing\nAnd then I started filming a little bit of video I'm it changed me it it changed how I've viewed my neighbors it changed how I've viewed the stories I told and if you ever watched me on TV I almost always when I was interviewing somebody I was almost always touching them\nBecause you can feel people\nStill through through the through touch and and I would feel them\nAnd tell their stories do these weren't just like assignments these people they left fingerprints on my heart you know and and and that's what that massacre in Williamsburg did it it wasn't a fingerprint it was a grid there was a ... it was a stomp and I just feel like this this noise and so much negativity out there and\nWe could be listening to one another and doing so much more and yet it doesn't change right\nSo what you're saying is a when you you found this out a young age yes are you change your whole outlook\nAnd you're exactly right or somebody tells you to have a good night okay they probably said that a lot of people but if you if you put your hand on somebody's shoulder and say ever goodnight\nWriter wearing a lot more are so many of the people I was just having a conversation\nBut if you if you put your hand on somebody's shoulder and forever goodnight\nWriter brings a lot more there are so many of the people I was just having a conversation with an African American friend of mine this huge man wonderful man he was telling me that in his neighborhood when when friends say goodbye to each other they say\nBe safe and be safe imagine that fat be safe\nWhile ... ... there's so much going on beyond comprehension we all come from these different backgrounds we need to be more tolerant of our individual ignorance I I Can't tell you what other people are thinking or feeling I can tell you that I Love your phone call Tim and I want to thank you for making it\nIt was a it was a pleasure speaking with you so thank you

they're staring\nThe pot on racial divide in my opinion it was it was a program about cops being called on whites and it's safe\nWon't cost so called on black it's not safe and it was sort of a big big slant on all cops now do I believe that some cops are racist yeah I Do do I believe that\nAll of them are racist\nI Do not last night on New Amsterdam it was the same thing [noise]\nAh cops are only killing brown people my point being is when people talk about Trump's during the ... the Democrats starring the pot everybody's got their hand it ... that is to shows\nOr completely against\nThe

Love\nTheir metal detectors there so you know which is again it is a sad reality of life in twenty Eighteen and unfortunately you can argue about why we are where we are but I think not allowing them\nTo defend themselves and hello the children because we're worried about guns sending the wrong message to kids I think is disingenuous\nDo you know what I mean yeah I totally understand\n... well I'm interested I Would like to wrap this last half hour up with other people's views on that because this issue of arming the security guards in order to the police who who basically keep our children's safe the security guards to keep them safe\nArming as security guards in order to the police who who basically keep our children's safety security guards you keep them safe\nIt's I'm On the

Curtis on the north side now cruise you want to go back to a different issue good morning you're on ... radio with Wendy how are you\nOh yes I Would put your black faces you know like the picture of liberation issue but for you're talking about schools and it was turned down your news reporter there are not many shooting matter of fact I Can't remember no shooting striking place and city school\nBrilliant point that is an absolutely brilliant point and when I asked him Myron this morning what she thought about this decision she said she thought it was the right decision she said these school shootings or not happening happening in urban schools and you bring up an excellent point amen\nThey're not taken place there's all these people you you figure the shooting that take place within the community but they're not taking place in the school you're right you're right within the school building is not happening that's another problem [laughter]\nBlackface blackface was not a

immigration is you go to everybody\nTalk about immigration fell through the border but I guarantee you if you look at our major cities where there's a large immigrant community from your I bet you those numbers that flow into this country for our number ... come across fell through the border\nSo it would help when they talk about immigrants coming into the country that\nThey would include that total immigration of the country not just felt for the border that you can pick out that you could only see with your uh they're not listen to the language with your ears\nSo you think that the immigrants from other places and not necessarily from Mexico or from any of these others you know the south of us communities you think that the European immigrants and people from other places are not being included in that conversation\nOkay they're not being included in up to date far outnumbered that so called caravan\nRight how do you feel about the caravan what do you think should be done when they when those people and I I haven't checked recently Curtis I have to be honest with you but I my last number was Seventy two hundred people men women and children walking this way which is just if you think about that\nAct and how desperate anybody has to be to leave where they came from which just I Would just ask you a history\nOf America right on why they got on the wooden boats and came all we're across an ocean\nAnd landed here so what do you say ... what are your legal immigrants coming to this country to get away from what they were running from freedom of religion right that we owned firm layer that that same thing that founded this country is what they're doing\nSo what should we do then how do you handle at the border how do you handle such a massive people and did you have to see them you'll have to ... them on I'm sure some are sick can you imagine the pregnant women who are\nA massive people and because you'll have to see them you'll have to have them on I'm sure

another greater than narrative her today ...\n... hey I hear you but what I'm saying is the crisis that we're facing right now that's coming our way how do you handle that what do you do a little more than that\nFor them people out of ...\nI don't know I never said they were pouring no no I hear you\nSaying that but this is the groups that you know what people say oh we take 'em out we need the help we got to give them well are we are going through this even our president said well next thing you know we'd be getting a little regard this as the impression that\nAre going to do with but Curtis what I'm asking you is what's the solution when I when I agree on the problem right there you go to\nOpen up the borders just like they for everything else that's all I mean I'm not saying that open borders but you allow a certain number of immigrants to come in from every place in the world\nI think you're going to have Curtis I appreciate your phone call please do not think I'm rude but I'm up against a break ... thank you very much I Hope you have a great day\nBecause I was in time I enjoyed talking to thank you\nUm I think this is going to open up kind of a can of worms here right

um with with some professional so in the industry um and uh I think we've we've got\nAt one o'clock and also a tool caught possibly another after that that means that effectively we're going to have called windows or in the back half of every hour and I very much look forward to having those conversations with you uh and we have on the one hand a wide variety of topics as a matter of fact\nI'm looking at my sheet from yesterday\nThe truth of the matter is I didn't get any of it I didn't get to the air force and coffee I didn't get the hell away and I didn't get the organ transplant pot or anything of that sort\n[noise] because we all know what took up all the oxygen now today we have the Saudis changing their story this time saying that the murder\nOf a Jamal could show that he was in fact premeditated wow that's the development\nAnd we'll talk about that perhaps we also have course more bombs are and we will hear the latest from CBS News as they updated but as always rose will be

one of these package of bombs or a ... or devices a and a ditto Joseph Biden that would be uncle Joe the vice president former vice president times to a couple of different ah ah devices are directed to him\nSo we're we're obviously seeing a very clear pattern as to who at least the recipients of this uh this escapade are are are and are having said that uh that has led to a ... a lot of discussion a lot of finger pointing a lot of\nUm assumptions presumptions and things of that sort which are really on the dark um the reality is that as we talked about yesterday\nA good idea and is each and every one of these devices are bombs comes out and becomes public and for that matter those that perhaps aren't even public the tar\nThere every single time they come about and they get more information and more material from the closer we are to having this resolved\nThat doesn't mean the speculation is going to die off that doesn't mean the finger pointing is going to die off it just means that the ladder it borders on\nIrresponsible ah and ah if anything uh is uh just out there um without much background or information and probably just fits narratives that are convenient to all of us\nHowever\nAt eight six six three nine one ten twenty as we go through the bottom of this hour to twenty five and then ultimately\nTo the top of each hour I Want to hear from you as what you're thinking yesterday clearly we had a lot of traffic on this it was real time it was live we were dealing with that and of course\nThe event down here and a lot a lot of items to handle all went perfectly well looking forward to doing that again a today are now\n[noise] couple of things the president had\nUh one of those events last night and of course he had a statement earlier and we read that statement to you and we had some follow up from Sarah Sanders and we did that as well\nEr and then last night uh with the world watching he gave a a series of comments about the rhetoric as we're

here's my deal with this I feel that\nI feel that it is not inaccurate news I feel the big differences in his intentionally inaccurate news\nIn other words the the majority of the media just cannot thin Donald Trump every fiber in his body and they make it a point every day to to try to hurt him\nIn any way that they can\nIncluding the fake news that's that that's what the majority of a you know anybody that believes that supports Trump feels is they\nJust don't do no no there's no question about that but again I I forgive the pun but I'm In an energy conference with shelves so I'm going to use it against let's drill down for a minute okay when you say the majority of media\nThe fine in your mind\nWhat the media is like do you have pets liquor sources just tell me what you mean\nWell I'm ... I'm going by a anecdotal evidence that I watch on TV NBC CBS CNN\nOkay no major networks except for Fox Fox has course slanted have they they have their own bias I agree with that also but it it is just unbelievable\nHow they attacked this guy and like I've never seen anything and of course every President Obama was attacked too and I get that but I've never seen nothing like the way that the media attacks Donald Trump and are they from the highest up in the ah\nThe executives in these media corporations can't stand him and they do anything they can to try to hurt him any way they can and\nAnd I I don't like I like I understand how people like you take it and and run with it and and I understand it puts them in a\nDefensive posture because you know what was so sick of it then we support them in ... when he punches back where like yeah it's good it's about time somebody does and\nSo that doesn't mean that is typically I over gives it Brian isn't that just the tip of the iceberg even if in fact you believe what you just said see I I I characterize the media is much broader than you but I understand that you speak for a lot of people to characterize what they see on TV\nBut ... you know if you're saying a majority of networks are presented as you described\nUh then I I I I Would agree that most of them are either neutral or not in favor Donald Trump but to suggest to me that they then are acting\nOut on an agenda to remove him and to make him look bad you start to lose me\nAnd then we get to the point where it's the top item of everything and I'm running out of time here I'm a I'm lost and I'll describe that when I come back would be like Brian I appreciate the call a he had a point or two there we could build off of a male is Ken and coming out from downtown Pittsburgh on Katie K radio\n\nI'm from a foreign power by mouser nice on her fifty one sounds on top of my own good news on the outbound side of the ...

Sam\nJonah Goldberg is an editor with the national review I ah hopefully do not have to introduce what the National Review is if you spent any time in the political media spectrum\nBut the national review was founded by William Buckley and I'm not going to go any further because I'm going to assume you know who William Buckley is and if you don't know how conservative he was and what the publication of went on to represent\nProbably a little last year but this was what he put out last night and I retreated it with the words\nAnd I think it adds to the conversation we're having right now my biggest beef with Trump apologist these days they admit Trump allies and says you're responsible things\nBut they denounce anyone to their rights as disloyal for saying so and anybody to their left for hypocrisy because ... said something bad to\nMaybe that's why he's the editor of the national review because that sure as heck was a lot more to sink and what I've been trying to save for months although I think I've got my point across\nThat we make everything so relative that\n... were were easily of the mind that we can be dismissive\nOf of what our absolute mistakes\nBecause relatively speaking so on so made a mistake as well that gets us know where\nIt doesn't excuse somebody else making a mistake\nBut when we get to the point where if you are intentionally whether

serve\nTheir guilty of it there are some media sources and some with in those media sources that are just as vulnerable just as culpable to adding and ultimately worsening\nThe situation but I thought that that tweet hit so much on a ... and again to be clear that comes from the editor\nOf perhaps the most conservative publication we have\nThat seems to be very important to have to point out because if it comes from a source that is aligned to a different political philosophy it immediately gets discredited it immediately gets rejected\nIt immediately gets dismissed as in effect not being a a a valuable\nNot to be incredible because it doesn't feed what a particular group of people want\nThat's wrongheaded that's not good thinking that's bad\nThat's not\nThe way intelligent people in a TV electrodes in a little kid country needs to operate should operate must operate in order to do intelligence things\nI understand as I said many many times the message of those that did voted for President Trump this is not about two thousand and sixteen here I understand where that all comes from it took me a while\nBecause I Would castigated based on the idea that I thought it was limited to
