the fact that that whether\nPittsburgh likes it or not we were hurled a very suddenly into a worldwide spotlight and\nIndeed um [noise] you know in front batteries for bad reasons is that there is no\nNo no bad advertising well that was bad but\nAt the same time the whole world is watching us and a couple of the guys I was with last I point out to me\nThey watched our mayor and fitzpatrick or whatever or or or ... executive\nAt soldiers and sailors he colonel yeah about how how unified we are yeah and how uh there was a posters around the city of your love thy neighbor no exceptions you had these two guys were in a worldwide spotlight\nDecided to not just show up they said that left that left a very very bad world um opinion in their opinion mhm and that's a tough one and no one was

based upon our principles and how we love each other and the two guys who are out there and by the way it was just pointed out last night as well these two characters these two gentlemen were elected by the majority yet they decided to speak on behalf of the minority of how people feel that was a bad ...\nWell you know I I don't know if if they are speaking for the minority because we've been getting you know the the comments and calls that are are saying similar things\n... regardless of the side you know I mean and so people are are are regarding the San ... some people say that was good that what the mayor did other people are saying no you can't do that so\nI don't know and also you know I mean Allegheny county he ... voted for him Allegheny county did not vote for Trump Pete did not take Allegheny county so if you want to get political about it there's that\nUh you know and I understand that sounds like a great dinner conversation though\nWell I tell you what I was in a life that are at stake because that was one of the few Republicans at the table\nNow and that was fine it was fine [laughter] you know they may\nMetal notes to some other awards describe our our uh our local officials one was ...\nYeah and and and and they said that was a very smog a way to approach is to look good and and they commended a Trump and they said you know what he's damned if he did he

business since ... when I was the Jerry ... funeral Dr Jerry Rubin a which is no need for the better part\nOf my adult life and I couldn't agree or disagree more with her because the Jewish people\nHave no better friend than Donald Trump and I believe that and I promise you that there are many Jews didn't believe that and they know that\nAnd that's fine if she doesn't care for Donald
