I I think on the one hand you probably see this guy\nAs a circus Barker somebody you lose an enemy somebody who is against the president and getting incredibly outspoken last night calling them a moron\n\n\nAnd there's a there's no doubt what you think about what his motives are and it's very frequently noted who his most notable client is and the industry with which he's affiliated\n[noise]\nIf you're a Democrat you're probably not all that cool about the guy as well particularly after bringing up a scenario\nDuring the Kavanaugh proceedings that a lot of people considered somewhat unbelievable\nAnd was cited as well as getting in the way of serious allegations potentially against\nJudge cabin on very much actually diluted the entire argument made it easier to attack the one potential good one because of his really outside the box version of what happened to his client that's how the thinking goes\nAnd the dams campaign particularly thrilled with him because he is like Donald Trump in the sense of a wants to fight\nNumber two things that the national leadership of the Democratic party is way too soft and so now you have this external maverick\nAttacking the establishment of a major party enough that all does that sound familiar to Donald Trump it should\n\nNow there are some distinctions between Trump and my ... one Trump had been around for decades better or worse people knew who he was your name recognition\nNumber two he had presumably some success in business if not a lot and it made presumably a lot of money\nHe didn't just happen on the scene of the last Eighteen months\n\nSo I'm not sure that gets off the ground I Do know that there are indications very interesting piece in the Daily Beast that show in detail

Newcastle on ... on the show\nHey thanks for taking my call\nSo I have a gut feeling that I've been out in the whole story may thing as a Trump created wag the dog situation that that's just my theory but so far it's been controllable that created a media frenzy that's better than Trump favorite so far overall on I think I have an idea of the presidential candidate would be a great distraction and\nReally a great orcas creation so far\n... explain that a little bit more because you obviously you have more in your head on that it worked out through for me\nWell I mean everything that's been out in the media so far has been really has had really minimal fallout for Trump\nRight and you know it just smells funny to me I don't know why I just have a gut reaction to it than I think the credit somehow oh you think the Trump accredited\nHis team I have a feeling\nAnd what's the benefit of that they can't get her to the makes it look like a victim and sure it makes me look like I'm like the worst father in the world but there's what to gain from that\nIt's it's a distraction that the media frenzy created around something that really has no merit that it's keeping everyone busy\nI Gotcha and he gets caught out whenever he wants it\nAnd I'm a Trump supporter and and that's my thought of like\nOkay I appreciate it or by the way you sound like a a guy with ten thousand dollars laying around Europe in Newcastle how would you if you can invest in ten grand or what would you do what would what would you do that just go to the markets or would you go into some of these more developing areas like pot and stuff like that\nOr I'd probably do something a little more secure and say\nYou sound like a reasonable reasonable man young Mike I appreciate your call I\nAppreciate that You're welcome there's nothing wrong with reasonable\n\nI mean let's be honest I mean the president yesterday had just a few too many tweets right we talk about this on the show that just a few too many\n\nAnd the name calling\n... ... you don't need to do that with Stormy Daniels you you just don't I mean\nI [noise] you know this is the president\nI mean I get out and not just going to moving needles and all of that and and and people have to make a decision whether that type of president is what you want 'em and uh you know ultimately if if if that type of style overwhelms policy a ... D away for a lot of people\nIf policy still is something important to people and for that matter people find appealing than it overshadowed this type of stuff\nThat I think it all and\nAccording to people and for that matter people find it appealing than it overshadowed this type of stuff that\nI think it all into equation\nAll of it I don't want my president tweeting I don't care about this last night I don't care\nIf a president to each every single day God Bless America that's all he does I don't want him to tweet\nSo it's not Donald Trump issue\nWay too much parroting of the\nSaudi Arabia line pretty early in the process that plays into a narrative against um didn't have to do that and for that matter the guilty before proven innocent thing that they used on Kavanaugh\nWhy distinction between that and Saudi Arabia\n\nSo I didn't consider and his best day\nI Do consider it a good day right now at twelve forty three Eighteen on a turning second quarter clock\nBecause an eight six six three nine one ten twenty there's only\nOne line available\nDaryl and Peter as you want to talk about politicians and Michael ...\n[noise] yeah I guess in general um you know like a Hillary and uh\nUh holder and a Barbara Boxer and such you know the people aren't going to ... they're encouraging other people to do it they're not going to do and there's there's some nuts out there that'll do it\nAnd a lot too awful long ago some kid had on um some sort of a ... hat McNamara grade or something that guy throws a a drink on his face and you know I mean it's and I'm really surprised if there is not more media coverage about it that uh I mean we just can't have this\nYou know I totally agree with your conclusion I may differ with you but I think it's I I Can't say it straight down the middle because every single day is a different you know we you could point to feel I can point to a couple of next day I can point of view and you could point to a couple or whatever I was trying to say but\nThe reality is that you know it it it it's it's so far below what America should be it's not even funny and it it's so far below and and let's be honest the president has rabble rousing enough to inspire people to do some crazy things as well\nAnd I haven't I'm not sure I've seen any not like a you know the demonstrations I just haven't seen the the conservatives the\nYemen see yeah see I haven't seen anybody get hit it off at a Trump rally when he was running a campaign\n[noise] well I I don't know but I'm just saying I haven't seen any of these rallies or rallies I have seen where uh you know and and these people banging on uh the Supreme Court door is\nNot a fan of that I agree I'm not a fan of that I don't I don't I don't want them I don't want them in the hearing room I don't want them in the hallway put them in the mall I always say there\nAnd also ah my understanding people being paid the protests\nBy well that's that's both sides but that you know that but the reality is I don't I don't have I mean seriously I Know there are folks say well that's democracy and I got good friends disagree with you on that no room for that I got no room for that at all I agree with you\nI encourage you to believe that there are examples on both sides including those start out by the president let's go over to the minister of traffic Scott Stiller\nTravelling traffic on the fires ... our vows are nice on on fifty one south on top of a hill we haven't overturned vehicle accident meow found sign of our current was between Mark Twain center and green ... lane restricted you received your on the line all the way back through the forefront Donald's on the forefront of road back down onto the boredom\nYou translate right lane restricted you receive drove away all the way back through the former tunnels on the forefront approach crack down on to the border of original point state park the lord I can afford to Cambridge is moving along fairly well you're coming in on the ... side of the approach you have delays beginning before standard street is you're headed towards the ... branch\nAAA traffic on the fires prop you buy UPN see our next border twelve fifty five from the brands but Syrian senior care network traffic center I'm Scott similar on news radio ten twenty Katie gay\nStick a morning news [laughter] something extra rubber band man ... you can learn\nDeborah ... hey good morning over ...
