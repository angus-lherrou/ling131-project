the traditions and I'm expectations would be within the faith\nAnd that it itself I did not say don't ever come here and matter of fact I Want the president to come here I just wanted to be done in a way this not violent of of of what I mentioned it's certainly not inflammatory and it just played straight\nLogistical parts getting a lot of play\nAnd I I can only imagine you know the that that doesn't make any buddy's life better\nA particularly those that are hurting um and with the exclusion of them quite honestly we deal with logistical problems around here all the time I mean just as

in a different level All right so once again let's get over to the calls are big cousin day if you're in Robinson what are your thoughts you hung on for a while I appreciate that\nHey I was a yeah you know what here's the thing that I'm thinking I'm what I Would say you're President Trump is come in and worship and what are your other callers that just keep your mouth shut you\nKnow just be just be a ... full I lead your presents the other thing on the um the logistical problems those those are two the mayor or on another radio station early today and I think this is a real chance for\nEvery president not just from the say you know I don't need five hundred Secret Service agents snipers car armored cars mortars artillery ... me to go on among the people that are like it'd be president\n[noise] there's no reason it was in a normal security procedures of\nCity or I mean look squirrels going to be a lot of cops was we will ever face there's we TV up you're going to your show

seven or eight guys and the lawyer\nAnd were in armored Cadillac will get there will come to the service will will will respects and then we're gone\nAll right well that addresses that to a certain extent although thanks to have a couple of things number one that's certainly not protocols you're well aware that might be a statement that ... some of those concerns and I understand that\nUh I can remember when President Obama would come here and I was up the hill doing radio and I got to tell you what when you see them come down with the helicopters and the\nAll those vans and vehicles I mean it's almost breathtaking or they're not going to stop that I'm particularly in a situation and quite honestly uh is incited right now is inflamed right now\nUm we also have to point out we don't know what the plans are I mean at least the best that I Know and roses continue to keep us posted in Scottsdale and a heck of a job out there today as always with you know I don't know what the plans are he has talked about going to see the officers in some of the injured and and and as I Believe families but I don't know how that latter part would work\nIn light of all these other matters so therefore I'm uh turned my attention to land in Brighton heart a high you have a thoughts on the Jewish traditions on death can you share those with us\nWell yeah um some\nWarning callers were pretty much breaking down along the lines of well don't come at all or yes the president should come and then that was a woman who called and very thoughtful woman very informative um and da da da da da da and she explained to us how\nUm the grieving process takes place or and I and some of the tradition surrounding a grieving and the Jewish community which I appreciate it learning about\nUm so then\nAfter this call ice all things sorted drifting away like you know in a manner that I see on Web forums sometime or somebody makes an original post or apple question now along comes some person\nThat'll say something you know just you know they're off to the waste is steering the conversation into an entirely different directions well now we're talking about\nUm either a\nDon't come a ... okay well it's either come later or or don't come at all so\nTo me I I think people have gotten the context of why people are\nOpposed to him coming here in the first place it's about this letter Rick right at the end so people are you know they're signing competition or something uh\nYou know like ... I got to go but I Would tell you what I I appreciate eerie capital this morning 'cause I heard some voices that were saying things that I have no room for particular day like today quite honestly\nSecond of all uh the rhetoric and so forth needs to be discuss I'll tell you what the rabbi said or one of the rabbis and I think is very very important to that uh and it isn't it is obviously a backdrop as to people's reticence in having just visit right now I'm I'm focusing a little bit more on\nWhether they should be done right now and\nAnd how that fits with tradition and the rules are going to get Scott I'm like\n[noise]\nTroubling traffic on the ... our vows are nice on the one sounds on top of the hill good news only ... in the south rebels wrestling for an avenue\nYou know for this president it's all about optics and we have three instances where he could have done in the right thing by the ...
