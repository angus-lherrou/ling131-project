relates to a\nWarming climate we showed that often I get it I mean it's just too complicated and nobody wants bothered with that\nBut this was as relates to beer and we need to talk about how we're going to lock arms we have to we have to forget our differences friends I mean if there are you hear me on friday said let's make it a beer friday\nAnd there are some weeks when it's like we need to have a beer friday\nDon't worry I'm\nWas with you on friday at least here\nAt least here but I was having a beer friday\nBut it was more joyous one lives on the other hand or something that you know cross was all demos it crosses all political lines and scientific schools of thought\nAnd personal beliefs and here's the problem the production of barley the main ingredient in beer\nIs likely to drop substantially due to severe drought and heat extremes\nWhich will become more frequent\nAs the climate changes according to study which is the first to quantify the effect of climate change on beer which of course is the world's most popular alcoholic beverage which is hard to believe considering what they do in Russian vodka I mean they put a serious dent in it\nBut that's another story\nAverage yield losses of barley range from three percent the Seventeen percent\nDepending on the severity of the conditions now most of us are Joe and Josephine lunches and\nSo to us you know we

about the United states but I Do care about the listening area and it's very important\nThat we talk about how we're going to work and protect our way through this\nSo this guy from the u._k. says something stupid like while the effects on beer may seem modest in comparison to many of the other impacts of climate change all that I didn't highlight any more of that but I did highlight this and this is very very important to me personally one of the most affected countries\nWould be Ireland where beer prices could increase by as much\nAs three hundred and thirty eight percent by two thousand Ninety nine\n\nUnder the most severe scenario as for consumption or global amount of beer consume could fall by as much as sixteen percent okay can we get back to the Irish side of me for a

bikes and then uh about are these people to keep a write in a a lot of liberals\nA number on the line is when they bite Blaine that's around the city of Pittsburgh that would get them in and people say ... people don't like bikes that Dr first of all most of these people that I see they don't follow the stop signs\nUh it's just ridiculous they don't bring money into the city most of the time they ride their bikes and they go home there's no revenue with them\nI mean and it's yeah it's a you don't want to get in front of them because you don't know which way the ... gonna turn or they're not going to turn some of them use their hand signals most of them don't show to me it is a a\nIt's a hazard until they get a plan to have a some kind of trail that goes around the city and not\nIn a

everything and although bikes of lit up to the Christmas tree here\nSo you said that you know there's a couple of things that are problematic and most importantly if I might was a safety hazard part of it and you also so they don't bring any revenue and I I don't know what that pardon me so I don't lose the car bring revenue in\nWell they don't buy gas it most of the time a lot of them and bring your own lunch is they don't die or how many how many I mean the ... with a bag just something we went to the stores and and spent the money uh and and and and bringing money into the city\nNow I'm not by not by I'm not buying that one uh joined I tell you what a lot of people that do use the bikes me and so what their their self sufficient when they come in but the reality is is young people younger people are drawn to cities that have that opportunity so stood up itself is you know to me I Can't agree with you know the hazard part\nI mean look I mean that's that's obviously something that a lot of us who didn't exactly grow up driving around bicyclists in our lane\nHave always found problematic I get you on that now there is a trail officers trail right up the mall and river right as you're driving on the parkway east so I get that if I had to ask you one thing that you would do for this play commission what would it be to make bikes less of a hazard in the city other than to just not being there at all\nUm as I said that there would have to be a a ... you say there's one that goes up they have to do better with putting a\nA bike trail coming into the city from from different neighborhoods all the way down open whatever okay way\nDown right okay let's go with that a number one less thing I Would offer something it's novel its new voters Shay I've never heard anybody say these words I'm taken for granted credit for how 'bout bike cops how 'bout by police\nSo when I've got some giraffe who's driving down and he does it give me the left or the right instead of gives me a finger in the middle of his hand instead of that I get somebody who's able to say sorry you just did something wrong here's your ticket\nOkay that will work but let me say real quickly about you know the people that continue to write about uh liberals skiffs and they have nothing else to do they have no life\nBecause I wanted to write and you find people that have a lot of people I Know may be liberal maybe Democrat but they're very conservative they brought up ... been brought up with morals which a lot of times these\nPeople I hear that say they're conservative and Republican that's not\nWhat I mean it's too hard you know you want in a sweatshirt you officers 'cause I didn't know the conservatives were attacking I mean they do every day and vice versa what is it what did you see the sent you off on this\nWell I think every day if you listen you don't have too many liberals calling up attacking the conservatives because we know what they're about we know that say as long as I could call names in in and and make themselves feel good they don't have a life\nThat they're happy so if you go back and listen to how many people call theirself Republicans or

go for the rest of it\nSo the ...\nWell a couple of things I mean first and foremost a I think that the Affordable CARE Act was a generally speaking more well received than\nUh the Republicans give it credit for that doesn't mean it wasn't flawed as a matter of fact you can make the argument was designed to ultimately fail\nWhich is in fact it was in terms of the finance was it was bleeding bad a lot of people uh you know we're we're signing up more again that are given credit for and it did take a step toward nationalized Madison that um you know a lot of people felt was overdue\nOr on the flip side I talked to people in private practice a lot and they'll tell me that it\nIs a and it has a bit of an ideological bent but it also and\nIn effect says there are a lot of alternatives that people can turn to for health insurance that doesn't require nationalize support\nIn it and as you're well aware could get very ... very quickly yes they've tried several times Republicans had fifty I think I lost track after fifty something because it became a running joke to me but ultimately is they you know this idea of\nTaking away what a ... and this is the biggest political part in this was going to be a huge part of the midterms in a huge part of twenty twenty is\nA dams running the idea that health care is at risk and specifically that if you had a pre existing the Republicans are trying to cut it out now that's where a little the debate begins as to whether it's real or fiction\nBut I think that's one area you're going to continue to see a lot of debate on because a lot of folks do not want to even have that happen that being something is too big of a step backwards\nWell so the Republicans\nAre the party of the F ... or you know management cloud\nOh it is not hard to understand all that uh those who are in the\nHealth care is earth with looking at the bottom line obviously they don't want that to deal with someone who has a pre existing a problem that's got a call from other so it is not a surprise at all of the Republicans would like to do something about that\nWell they also as I got to run it thank you so much that that is that that is certainly one point of view there is another that says that you know how to fund whatever the version is I think that's one of the problems why the Republicans have generally not in support of been\nNot just supported by a poll numbers on this uh but also just generally have found a a problem is because a lot of people don't know exactly what's on the other side other than to get rid of it\nYou know a lot of people that I've spoken to learn a lot smarter than me say that the idea of going about this was the concept of here's how we're going to make it better rather than rip it all down and go them get themselves in a
