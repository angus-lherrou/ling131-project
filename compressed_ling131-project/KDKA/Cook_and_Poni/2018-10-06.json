cases like if you're doing kitchen cabinets or what have you in those gaps that's where the trim pieces come into play so any type of typical would piece of trim\nYou could take up the gap and look really great because you don't really see the difference in the elevation it takes the gap and it levels out so you didn't like just quarter round or ... or anything like that you could apply that and then painted the same color as the wall color and it'll look I can really nice high and finished\nYeah and the other one Rob a lot of times you can actually go\nTo one of the the stone countertops ... companies and they can make you a trim strip in a specific color specific sites and so forth and it can be and here to the old one to fill those gaps itself\nAll right sounds good let's keep the cows come and here's a Joe in plump up next for anti I'm running Mike Brown is just getting the true value home improvement show my joke\nA warning a I have a shower in my basement and it's a town mhm and uh about a week ago we noticed at the bottom there was a water coming in is there any way to detect where the water's coming in without tearing the tower part\nYeah that that stuff's so if I ever either drought aid that child bomb shower or yeah and you actually have ... you know exterior water I presume exterior water coming in through the through the lives don't know I'm not I mean I ...\nThe ah well\nI took to cover play it off and looked in there and it didn't feel like it was leaking right there so I'm assuming it's coming from the outside\nOkay well you know one of the ways to determine whether or not at the exterior water problem or you know water from within the home one of the things is that if you notice the water's ... consistent regardless of the exterior whether you know what I mean so if we go through a period of ...\nBut you know a week or so dry weather and we're still getting that water in there\nAnd then chances are much more highly that it's coming from within the home and you've got a leaky pipe somewhere um yeah so you definitely got a challenge of what I Would do is say Disney any probably chase the two lines that are going to the shower like take that from wherever the leg of some of the hot water tank up and over and and map it down and see I Can't\nSee uh where they go I see him at the top but when they go down a I Can't see where they connect to the Vail mhm go there the whole I got in Arizona you about a three inch hole\n... and I can only see a little bit on each side I Can't see where the connections are\nYeah well one ... neat little totally do make and I know we have it out in ... rent it it's about approximately twenty four inch long camera you know it's got a little bit of flexible arm and it's a little handheld cameras and it's great to put behind walls and things of that sort\nA it's used in electrical applications if you if you if you're you know if you're getting a short in electrical you can see behind halls and things of that sort so that might help you in that particular case\nUm but he obviously I Would be concerned by this because you know obviously water coming through a grounded you know they usually that's a fair amount of water pressure behind there so that there's\nAny chance that this is in a corner of the house where you have a gutter down spout connection right out nine okay it's\nMy uh gutter is about Fifteen feet away\nOkay I mean 'cause that that's the other thing you know you do have to determine where it's coming from and watching it but a lotta times outside itself um ... if you go on dry are days when you know which we don't have too many ... in Pittsburgh anymore sometimes it's a matter of\nTaking a garden hose out there and looking at different places around the house and actually spraying part of the house to see if you can trace where the water's coming from but down spouse a window wells are probably the two most notorious\nProblem areas of houses in southwest Pennsylvania\nOkay hey thanks for the call we're going to take a short break we'll come back we're going to jump right back into your phone calls coming up and just a couple of moments a behind every

all about the age of ... of paint on the wall or something like that for sure [noise] sort of water first before I\nHave this fall off my break tell me what was it just\nSeems to find a way anyway\nYou are absolutely correct if it's a a larger amount and a constant flow of water just stopping the water on the inside the water is still going to find a way and it's just going to move and go to the least path resistance so\nYou are very very correct in saying if you can stop the source of the water coming in whether it's puddles in the yard and you want to use hydro block to prevent them from coming into the house or just\nLandscaping and terrorist thing and new planning or something like that on it but uh you know the ...\nThe gutters into down around her and I think it's working directly absolutely um\nAh that this young lady had a much seller and mud sellers are notorious I mean notorious for no matter what you do they always have I must the smell um they always had a little bit of extra moisture you have a\nUsually a cement slab on top of that there's a lot of times the rain is just a permeating down through the floors and so forth\nAnd that's why I really wasn't quite as concerned\nI'm with her case of having the water it didn't sound like\nWater it didn't sound like a severe dirty of constant flow from the outside yards and so forth but um\nAny time you have water coming into a house\nOr whether it's the basement whether it's the cold shoulder the mud sellers to the garage or everything like that you're always better to uh find out where the water is coming from and then stopping it and that's why we've talked about a lot this past year product called hydra block when we do a hydra block\nJob you have to know where the water's coming from Europe to know where you're going to send the water to\nAnd then you have to have some approximation as to how much water you have because a lot of times the single board isn't enough you have to do a double board or triple board and it collects the water moves that away from the house and prevents the water from coming into the house but\nTo answer your question you're absolutely correct before you just take you geo and put it on the wall if you can find out where that water is coming from and stopping it\nYou're it's more of a permanent fix than a temporary fix\nOkay\nAll right Rob let's move on to our next call and say Hi to Tom and Kennedy township Hey Tom welcome to the true value on the ... radio morning [noise]\nCome on guys how you doing today good good morning I got a question\nHere is getting a little bit older and uh I got trees around my house in of course that leaves off into the gutters and I've been looking into and guy\nPossibly those companies like leaf guard leave filter in a mhm mhm I promised share everything a cage for it that way and I just wonder\nAre they worth while do they do their job is you know as\nYou know you know I'm just saying yeah\nWell you know one of you know it's all along this product lines one of my concerns living in western Pennsylvania and they may be able to ... you know convince me otherwise is that with ice ... ice backing up is such a problem and having those gutters completely sealed\nOr you know during the regular rainstorm sounds like a great idea of the water runs down over top of it the the natural course of the water talks in and drops into the gutter and works right\nUm my concern would be with that system is that once you get freezing freezing thought during the winter time it seems to me that you'd be much more likely to get ice backup and ice damning and that could be very very bad and you know if anybody has experienced that on the in every once in a while like every three five years we get that weird\nYou know snow free snow freeze and we start getting it back up\nIn one said ice backs up and freezes on your gutters because it's on the overhang and then you get a warm day any of the snow on your roof all of a sudden starts tracking back upward underneath the shingles and then down in ... inside the walls of the home and it can be really bad so my concern with those products is ice damage\nThat 'cause what I what I was wondering if uh maybe they get rid of the water but she is a little leaf shaped come down and play\nOn income for how will get a check\nYeah ... yeah I I you know the gutters are interesting here in western Pennsylvania I you know there's really no miracle answer we love got her stuff I think it's great it's one of the best options for you um you know I but I've never I still have not seen the absolute like old yeah that is absolutely ... got her stuff\nYou can get a lot of leaves a pile up on top of it that they don't drive the wind doesn't blow 'em off I mean might have to get up there and blow them off things of that nature\nUh it got her stuff what we found him in the best most effective way to keep an open cell phone so that the water will go through\nWater will go through the doesn't freeze up that way the even in the cold she won't get the ice pack up and then the leaves and what have you do not go down the downfall too so that has been our most effective retarded and keeping your gutters clean and running has been the got her stuff and we we sell stuff like the leaf guard\nOr whatever brand you want when I Want to say uh we have ones like that as well too on that just really why we liked the gutter stuffed the best\nNow and I have to concur with my with all the options are are with all the pricing that it's out

reservation center or sop into an office today on the ... center is one eight hundred three five for eight seven six one you can also go to AAA dot com slash radio and click on the link that we have therefore you for all of the departures that we're going to talk about here real quickly this morning\nBefore we get into as you said the car care month um\nCouple of special that are just phenomenal if you have some vacation days that you haven't used yet don't lose them this is a perfect opportunity listen to this Rob November first\nThere yes good morning our Rio\nGood morning so we have Joe Vasquez our auto um car care experts from ah he's out in our eastern PA region but he's joining us live this morning on air welcome to the show Joe\nWell thank you and your segment was ah was great to remind us all not to put our ah summer clothes away too fast\nThat's exactly [laughter] exactly right\nI'm actually I'm taken off next week for a quick get away with my sisters and my mom to Myrtle Beach and I was I was doing just that last weekend putting away my summer clothes on Michael I Need a couple of things to I had done on down to the beach but\nUm that being said getting my car ready was part of that so this was a perfect time for me to review everything that I'm this is the time of year that you want to do especially here in the region that we live in with the snow I'm sure to fly here shortly\nSo I'm just you just tell\nOur listeners a little bit of why its AAA observes car care months in the month of October\n... AAA observe um October as park or a month to help raise awareness to vehicle maintenance and repair as we had an underwater lunch\nAnd traditionally I'm very very quick cold weather changes in very quick warm weather changes cause a many breakdowns at one of those um items batteries that um don't seem to survive those quite changes in temperature\nInteresting so it's a good idea to get our batteries check then I'm assuming\nIt's it's a great time of year to have it checked\nOkay um so what do you recommend as preventive maintenance not only right now during October as ... but probably year round I Would think is well\nWell it's it's always a good idea to make to oil make sure the oil is changing the fluids or track regularly\nUm items other items is to make sure to the tires have proper tried that and condition\nWait we went over battery but it should be should be tested 'em and battery turtles plane as secure and it's always a good idea to have a certified technician a road test the vehicle and inspect the brakes on suspension on a vehicle\nAnd no better place to do that then one of our auto approved stem repair facility right\nYes approved auto repair facilities chat forty or more items on members vehicle with any paid service\nYou know it's so if you're just going in to get an oil jak they're going to check all that other stuff too\nAnd many of them have go past forty items and have their own list where they check up to sixty Seventy items\nWonder if we get we have a great network facilities\nOkay and so speaking of that how do we how does a member or a listener find one of our auto repair on centers\nThey can they can find a list of approved auto repair facilities I triple A. dot com\nWonderful wonderful and um we also I think have a little bit more information on the AAA dot com slash radio ...\nIt's radio you scroll down beyond our cruises of the week with celebrity you'll see a little bit of the information in there um to direct you to the correct click page for our auto repair services on and then also Joe it's a little bit about um what the benefits are\nThat when a member does go to auto repair I Know you stayed it already that they go above and beyond by checking more than forty items that what what else are some of the benefits\nThat the members will receive a twenty four month twenty four thousand mile warranty on a quality of qualified items if\nWhat's let's as an example if a particular a part that the members decides that have installed doesn't carry that warranty the the facility will let the the member know that\nUm the members will also receive a ... percent discount on parts in labor up to fifty dollars and who is an extra fifty dollars off their their auto repair today\nYeah for sure for sure\nAnd that that can't be used with any other items and as as on normally uh normally a price items so if an oil change as a Nineteen Ninety five oil change it wouldn't expect that this count on that because the oil change cost for the facilities probably thirty nine forty dollars\nWell interesting that's showing that discounted item right away what your great great\nUm so you also um made mentioned a little bit earlier about the forty point on vehicle inspection on and that's with any paid service so and and explain that a little bit when that's paid service I mean is that like\nWhat I mentioned earlier would that be just like a simple oil change and then they would do all of those other tax as well\nYes it could be a simple oil change the vehicles could be in for a life over a very minor repair and the facility will do a forty point inspection and we also have a a time of year between a January and march on it typically the slowest time of the air for any auto repair facility\nOr our members can get a forty point inspections I'm done at an age or facility without a page service so it's a it's a plus for the facility to have people come in and also people are getting their vehicles track that are a very very um fat time of year for for most vehicles yeah\nAnd the best part about all of this in my mind as a single person I'm woman in in in society is that when you get this and you keep the maintenance up on your car the less chance you are going to be stranded at the side of the road and and and and and then in the winter months we know that\nThat that happens a lot for many different reasons\nAnd stranded out there waiting for 'em to get a roadside assistance of course AAA members will get that service um faster than most but and it's it's just a sense of security knowing that your drive when especially when you drive a many miles on vacation or just to work in back\nThat you know that you have that security that you've kept up to date on all this maintenance and they do check for those things even when you you you are not thinking on that like you're getting an oil change and that's what I'm thinking about okay it's time to get my own change I'm not thinking about\nThem actually checking all of these other things forty things to say the least\nMe just give you and I have a list here and you can see in my hand to learn what he did a bunch of videos and you enjoy doing a great job but just to give you an idea how they go the extra mile and they give you a thought process of they check everything and that's exactly what you were saying\nThe airfield or how many of us think of the year ... right well you need it and it basically they check it by taking the engines airfield and you can hold it up to a sixty one lightbulb if the light can be seen through much of the voter is still clean enough to work efficiently and that's a good thing and you know Joel one of the things to we've talked about quite a bit\nWe've talked about quite a bit having stuff in your car especially if you're going over the river and through the woods Thanksgiving to visit family snow shovel snow brush\nFlashlight with extra battery were batteries window washers solving which is a key and I scraper close a rolls of paper towels jumper cables gloves hats blankets\nWarning devices players were triangles drinking water non perishable snacks energy or granola bars extra closed first aid kids basic tool kit screwdriver pliers adjustable wrench mobile phone in car charger so all of that stuff is essential isn't a joke\nGift that that's absolutely correct always be prepared\nOkay until I think we're going to take a quick break and then we'll come back\nWe're not taking a break like a minute we have another minute so a question I wanted to ask Joe is when when when my when I Do need to call 'em AAA emergency routes every service and get towed um do they do they cause it's been awhile luckily knock on wood ... you know it's going to happen [laughter]\nBut do they ask you um the the the tow truck driver did they ask you where you want to go do they recommend on the auto repair facility\nHow does that when you when you calling for service for the call counselor or ask you if you have your auto destination and if you don't they'll ask you if you would like to go to and approved auto repair facility\nOkay All right and then what what's the advantage did they tell them the advantage when they're on the phone with them right then I'm going to the auto repair facility\nUh yes they do okay and that they've been they've been trained as scripted to do that\nWonderful wonderful so um I think will break now and then we'll come back and we have a few more questions that go over with Joe and some more tips in points for auto care month yeah Tobar\nLots of good dug a tip still to come and remember\nJust to get the car toad what that costs would be it pays for the membership to three times over in some cases so before you do anything before we continue to discuss anything\nThe thing that I Want to leave you with going into break is is if you don't have a membership get one one eight hundred three five for eight seven six one one eight hundred three five for eight seven six one and\nYou get the peace of mind to keep it on the road even with the snow when you know you have that in your pocket or purse that triple A. E. central membership\nAnd remember for everything that we're talking about on the program triple A. dot com slash radio and pick up the phone and give them a call one eight hundred three five for eight seven six one we're stopping at one of their many officers right here in our region will be back to morning\nImagining a better bank starts with looking at the savings rates most banks offer in saying really capital one is building something better you can open a capital one savings account with one of the nation's best savings range from anywhere like here for here\nOne of the nation's best savings rates opened on line at a capital one location or from anywhere that's banking re imagined what's in your wallet for consumers only offered capital one and a member of the icy copyright twenty eight in capital one\nAnd you know an ad from dad [noise] alright save money on car insurance when you bundle home an auto with progressive\nAnd approved auto glass locations and they all offers similar benefits to the approved ...

everything in this business and I was kind of perusing through it I think it's an incredible paper it's impartial and I think nobody gives you a spin on business and how news really affects business like the wall Street Journal and been a fan of it since I was a much younger man and I'm Still a fan of it today\nAnd you know a lot of the stuff that you hear that you're really makes news from Wall Street Journal Mr Meredith talked about in his morning commentary on ... singer money on you and he'll be here tomorrow tolerable Leno and Mary and cheaper [noise]\nBut the thing that really jumped off the front page with Susan Collins walking and she's voted gestures you know Kavanaugh that vote now going to a vote this afternoon and I said on the very early hour of five o'clock\nThis morning that this could be the best week the president has ever had in right away all of the detractors were hammering away at me I mean literally taking every shot that they could I mean every opening they could find they would take a shot\nBut I stood tall and I just kept continuing to move forward why because I think this president has done the exact same thing when he has been hit with just about anything that would have destroyed any mere mortal especially a sitting politician\nMm I Am a veteran I lost both legs in Vietnam\nAs America's veterans face challenges da da\nVinci was getting my

[noise]\nI I just want to ask you this question [noise]\nWhy is it that even when I bring good news to the table and I mean let's face it jobs this is the best it's been unemployment since December of Nineteen sixty nine December of Nineteen sixty nine\nJust months removed from landing on the moon show this guy really is shooting for the moon and he is creating jobs but why is it that no one can accept it and this cabinet story\nI I alluded to Newt Gingrich yesterday and boy did I take a a a a beating about that because they're bringing up indiscretions in his life\nFrom years ago when I'm just talking about a true patriot and what he was saying and how I thought he was on point saying that the witnessing this whole cabinet debacle it was a really disintegration of democracy as we know it\nAnd it had nothing to do with politics either and as I also said everybody deserves their moment and justice if they have been abused in any form I grant you that\nBut moving forward as a country wants this gets behind us\nI think someone like Senator Collins senator mansion are going to be looked upon as heroes why because they took\nHigh ground they took the the the I think the good road as opposed to taking that well I'm not going to get involved so I'm going to hide in the bushes or take that dark dingy path\nAnd make this thing even worth so I work so I can grab as many photo ops and get as many boys ... out there amongst the masses but they didn't\nThey said look\nFBI do what they had to do no one could put all of the people in that one room at that one particular time one moment in time so we now have to move forward as a country and this guy has the resume to do that\nNow what I Want to be bred capital absolutely not this is life changed forever absolutely but it looks as though and it's not done yet\nBeing with the folks at first energy and all of the union labor that comes in and does work if those facilities whether it be first energy Stratton or Bruce ... coal fired power plant and I know what you're saying you keep talking about local local local because folks there ain't nothing going on but the rent okay\nAnd we have to be concerned about what's happening locally before we can worry about what's happening nationally\nAnd I'm telling you right now the sooner we get this Kavanaugh story behind us and we get back to the business of creating jobs so be it and I'm telling you as a friend yes I Am your neighbor I Am your friend and I don't care what the color of your skin is what's your religious beliefs are\nIf you can't put food on the table we're all in the boat together and guess what that bode is taking on water and it sinking\nBut now we have a life preserver we have a whole world float in this country and we are steam lining to a new time and there's some place that we come home and another industrial era another time\nAnd that's why I Want to talk about this before I get to these phones what you're getting a little busy you know I've been talking a lot about General Electric of late\nListen if you're from these parts you've gotta love General Electric you gotta love Westinghouse you've got to love US Steel you got to love the new footprint of shell and first energy in these names that means so much to us\nYou know I made a comment about its go the steel company average Koppel Russia I Love it it's great because it helps the trucking industry it helps the railroad industry plus I have friends that are working there taking care of their families and actually carving out\nA little place in life because of this and everybody that's connected to the places that I just mentioned\nWhat do you think about President Trump I Love him he's changed our business we're really doing well as a company\n[noise] so General Electric cannot simply just fade away folks that can't\nSo you had jak well she did an incredible job from eighty one of April to September two thousand one Jeffrey him melt CEO from one to two thousand Seventeen long time\nAnd then John flattery stepped in very short window August two thousand Seventeen September two thousand Eighteen\nI Love one G E did they say you know what we've always used our own people going back to Thomas Edison you remember J. P. Morgan Thomas Edison how they form General Electric I mean this is going way back ... this is an iconic company a great brand who does a whole lot more than electricity\nWell now they've got this guy Lawrence called will just call them Larry okay CEOs are paid to have the longest time horizon of anybody on the team but CEOs are often the ones who get fired when you miss a couple of quarters well that didn't happen edgy eat a lot of comfort there because a lot of success\nBut this guy knows how to counter punch and he understands that name really has a lot of clout to it okay a lot of clout to it\nShow what I'm telling you is\nWe have to find a way to lead jeeze survive long enough to get back on the dial and find their niche because if that company can be resurrected and if I'm President Trump I'm kind of leaning in that direction we're spring and Mr culture and saying look if you need me\nPut me on speed dial okay because of gee can climb out of the dust to stand tall again and those two letters will mean more than just two letters from the alphabet it's another proof that the president his plan is working and art\nAnd our country needs people like gee\nBecause of power we need companies like Westinghouse because of power\nListen I Know all of you would like to see us around that you know rubber tree in a rain forest singing kumbaya ya\nBut guess what you are not going to power a great nation with wind or solar you need nuclear power and you need coal and you need still to build these plants like what's happening at the show petrochemical plant\nAnd I am a firm believer that there will be plastic companies perfume companies and they will start to line up a B C D E F G within a year or so after they continue to do already amazing work that the shellfish far as jobs in this region over the next\nTwenty five years two hundred and fifty thousand and with those jobs you need to feed them you need to call them and you need that housed those workers\nI see all of this unfolding with our president and the people that are following him\nShow this I think if he can get through this cabinet debacle will be the best week he has at an office and maybe now once this is out of the way he can get out there he's going to be an area on Wednesday continue to get out there and promote the people who believe in him that are up for the mid term election\nHelp them stay in office stay on point\nAnd let this guy roll up his shirt sleeves and go to work because all he does for thirty in the morning till the time he puts his head on the pillow other than maybe around the Gulf\nAnd dinner with a family\nHe's all about business she here's the thing that you have to understand guys like Larry ... and Donald Trump they love it it's their passion just like I

percent off any size any color any style of windows\nNow listen you've got Clarence Thomas ... still on the bench a man of color by the way and Jay let me just an endless and for the sake of having a discussion here and you're passionate about what you believe so let me kind of try to redirect your thought process on why I'm so passionate about creating jobs\nYou understand if you are from Pittsburgh and you are a baby boomer or you were around when the steel mills were booming\nAnd towns like Claritin Duquesne andme ... after thoughts alec quip an average they were thriving communities in which blacks and whites live together shop together worship together and worked shoulder to shoulder together on these steel mills\nAnd I don't want to hear anything about racism in the steel industry back in the fifties and sixties because everybody was getting a check and if you could hold a shovel you could swing a pick you could get the job done you were able to get a paycheck\nAnd family stay together they rebuild communities together when they needed a fix a pothole or do they win and watch the local football team together on a friday night it was a public school to be proud of people were wondering where money was going to come from to buy books and tablets\nAll of that was created it becomes a jobs there was any drug epidemic in the sixties there wasn't a crime epidemic in the sixties\nThere was places like plan of Lebanon plan twelve where people of all walks of life all nationalities in al equip a broke bread together and there wasn't that I hate to say it ghetto mentality word today whites and blacks are living in horrible conditions\nNot just in the inner city but in the suburbs because\nBut in the suburbs because of rising unemployment for years the loss of our manufacturing base\nIdle time and what does that mean especially from the white wealthy people who are giving their children money they find themselves on the wrong side of the law because they become addicted to drugs and when they can get the money from mom and dad\nThey'll go out and do whatever they have to do to get that money our prisons are becoming overcrowded all of this stuff that's happening in the opioid epidemic everything is because of the lack of manufacturing jobs are all I'm saying to you is\nEven if you don't like President Trump for whatever reason maybe Jay you're an intelligent guy you brought a great argument to the table today at least let him try to create jobs because of the great thing about manufacturing middle class working jobs\nIt has nothing to do with someone's skin color but belong color that matters that you put into the palm of their hand that they take home to their family and that's green and until we start realizing jobs will fix just about everything and the only reason I'm not saying everything\nBecause I'm sure there are a few of you who would disagree and lose the whole process of what I'm trying to make you stay on point about\nThis man like it might not voted for him or not he is doing things with the economy that no other president has done and\nI Am a guy who voted not once but twice for Rocco down\nBecause of because of the ... there was\nA cat you let's say hey you got to you that racism go buddy you got to do\nBetter [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] oh okay\n[laughter] [laughter] [noise]\nBut listen can't you just for a moment step aside from all of the things that debacle that is the Brett Kavanaugh situation which is deplorable\nEven think about why can't you have to weigh the unemployment numbers have been since December of Nineteen sixty nine can't you just focus on that\nLaughter that are already known as laughter that her\nKnow here's an appreciate the call Jay thanks

up on September the twenty ninth through October the six for one to nine to two well\nBut we're going to talk about something I've been promoting the last couple of days docket were Baucus here it's about the nervous system and the breakdown between the sympathetic and we talked about that earlier today and the parents sympathetic nervous system so he's going to jump into all of that\nBut let's begin by reminding everyone doc about Weiner wellness weak and as we were talking earlier today thirty percent off product it's happening from September twenty ninth to October the six and it's definitely something people should check out\nAbsolutely I see these um these wellness events that we host and for a second there I become a fly on the wall and watch what's going on and I see a we have a large building we have a lot of square feet and those square feet are just packed with people who are enthusiastic about the message that we're sending and what we're trying to do and they're\nMaking efforts to learn about natural health and learn strategy is to take better care of themselves and I'm just like I rub my eyes for a split second and then I come back and it's like wow I'm part of this\nLet me let me just say this between you Joe and Jeff ... you know I was having some got issues and we were talking earlier today about got league aging got his shoes and ...\nSo finally stubborn as I can be I finally listened to Jeff and Joe ... literally turned it around and I went through the colonoscopy and all of this stuff that you go through traditionally nothing was working\nYou know my mother was a big proponent of this stuff you know the respect I had for Dr Weiner they ... they do great work and what he's about to tell you something if you have a question you want to talk to him eight six six three down one ten twenty dollar bank instant access to give it a dot com or you can Texas at the right on I'm On a blind best deal in town\nA um another thing that the sympathetic nervous system does is it will depressed secretion which means that amongst other things we stop producing as much saliva or as much mucus so if you find yourself\nOr in an anxiety ridden state and you feel like I'm I have a dry mouth are caught and mouth and I'm struggling to to get my words out in my mouth just keeps getting drier and dryers my anxieties provoked that sympathetic nervous the example of sympathetic nervous system\nOr in practical application\nAnother thing that the sympathetic nervous system is going to do is that it's going to increase the heart rate we're going to have our blood pressure is going to go up a heart's gonna start beating at a more accelerated rates\nAnd these are the type of um experiences that we have one more frightened we have anxiety when we feel like we're being provoked\nWe're in this fight or flight scenario\nNow in contrast the Paris sympathetic nervous system it calms us down in essence what it does is it ... unwind the sympathetic nervous system so as one goes up the other goes down now we are a um I I have\nThe have the opportunity to treat patients I work one on one with people in the treatment room and I get to get to talk to people about their health concerns in about a where what did you come here for what you want to get out of this experience how can I help you\nAt one of the um one of the uh big things that people talk about is their elevated blood pressure concerned that my blood pressure has been elevated\nOr for people who drive a for a living and they're worried about their CDL license how do I lowered my blood pressure for people who've been told by their primary care physician that they may have a look you're cruising towards a heart attack your blood pressure is so up\nA um you're you're overweight and we got to get all this down you're headed towards disaster\nSo amongst my patient population blood pressure that's a big one so a moment ago in our conversation and we just isolated that the\nOveractive sympathetic nervous system is going to elevate heart rate and it's going to elevate blood pressure\nSo if we want to bring blood pressure down\nWhat we want to really do is just calm the sympathetic nervous system down now I'm not going to deny um\nThere's such thing as park plaque buildup in the arteries are there such thing as information in the arteries and there's a time in a place for specific nutritional supplements such as the er the seven flowers that we carry at the Warner wellness center\nI'm such as vitamin e these are all important things but less for the sake of the conversation talk about some of the city\nAnd talk about some of the simplest things that we can do we want to stimulate the Paris sympathetic and inhibit the sympathetic nervous system in order to lower the heart rate and in order to lower the blood pressure\nSo let's think about some tools that we can use to do this\nThe main part of the nervous system the main part of the brain that inhibits the sympathetic nervous system is the part of the brain called the cerebellum the cerebellum is in the back of the skull and it's it's primarily governs coordinated movement\nSo if we were going to talk about things to do that would involve coordination we're going to start to stimulate our cerebellum\nAnother thing that's going to stimulate the cerebellum in order to inhibit the sympathetic to bring that blood pressure back down um we could use some deep breathing exercises\nDeep breathing exercises are getting as much oxygen into your brain and into your body is critically important and if you come to my lecture my workshops at our wellness week we're going to do some group deep breathing\nI'm I read that and I teach that with every presentation that I make period\nAnd what we want to do is we want to get as much air as possible into our nervous system specifically into our cerebellum and a sidebar\nIf you have ever witnessed I Know that none of my patients are listeners are fan club has ever had this experience but I'm sure we've all seen it on TV if you've experienced perhaps a I'm a drug or a alcohol sobriety test point\nAnd you see the uh the officers are asking the or the suspected in the ... party to reach out with their fingertips and to a touch the tip of their nose or to walk in a straight line along an imaginary tight rope that's a neurological test for the cerebellum\nAnd both of those maneuvers are part of what we call a cerebellum rehab that I teach my patience\nAnd the cerebellum is caught the reason why this is such a good test on the side of the road is because the cerebellum\nIs the part of the nervous system that is most susceptible to oxygen deficit are most likely to most likely to be deprived of oxygen so as we do our deep breathing exercises were going to ... we're going to stimulate the cerebellum\nWe're going to inhibit the sympathetic nervous system we're in turn gonna bring about a more power sympathetic or a wine and dine type of experience and we're going to start to lower our blood pressure and decrease our heart rate\nAnd went when I um when I run through this drill and when we do this exercise in the uh I'm In the workshops that there are wellness week inevitably\nPeople in the crowd will volunteer information about how after only two or three a deep breath they feel so much more relaxed\nOr are they start to feel a little bit more light headed that their body start to become a little bit more synchronized with a with their brain body communication and they start to feel like a whole rather than a collection of moving parts\nSo this this\nNumber one coordinated movements coordinated activity\nStrategy number too deep breathing exercise\nStrategy number three to stimulate the cerebellum and begin to inhibit the sympathetic nervous system and begin to stimulate the Paris sympathetic nervous system and here comes ladies and gentlemen boys and girls of all ages and all my good friends shameless plug for chiropractic adjustments\nI think it just meant was in I'm going to stop you right there because I've been wanting to get to that probably about Fifteen minutes into this broadcast\nEverytime and I've been going to see a chiropractor since I was Fifteen Years of age and I cannot in great nice ... I was in ninth grade my mother said you need your a nervous wreck you need some all be we'll see and you need to go see a chiropractor and it changed my life\nBut every time we would go as a family mhm to get that adjustment and you know to this day it really does feel as though somebody has lifted the weight of the world off your shoulders so all of this in conjunction with what you're talking about is that the total package right\nAbsolutely that um we want to um we want to look at people as human beings as a whole body\nOr not just a collection of injured parts and and you know we see a new patient and they complain about the injury to their shoulder or the injury to their ankle and that's important that's what that's what brought them in here in the first place that's what\nThat's what drove this particular patient to come and seek help but in the process of conversation and examination and and treatment we realize that\nThis person is more than just their injured shoulder just they're injured ankle ... and\nDr ... myself a Jeffrey news Nick Adam we all have our own techniques in our own areas of specialty work and specially interest\nBut the reason why we work so well together as we're all looking at our patients and we share quite a few patients as um whole people we take a whole body approach\nWas listening when we come back a ... getting or boxing or talk neurology but in a in a pain and our travels and why it's so important to treat the body as a whole is he just mentioned so you're going to get into that and he's going to talk more about\nWhat he's

on a plane and ... but the idea of how you can fool when you bundle home and auto may not be the best idea from duck\nNow and the ... the nerves that sin acts together um are of the same diameter so if we the sect human cadavers which is something that you do in chiropractic school in medical school and probably\nOther to like know everything about the body right pretty much the chiropractor ... amazing stories I mean every bone every muscle every\nWe had a we had to learn a lot of really [laughter] we had\nIt ... it was it was a heavy load it really was\nBut um how do you learned by better visualizing it and learning landmarks to say well the nerves that we're talking about lives right here and the reason why no is because I cut that muscle out on somebody's a cadaver and found that nerve and I know where it lives relative to something else\nSo so yeah that was that was a lot of a lot of training\nBut anyhow the nerves of the same diameter ... together and share messages so theoretically\nIf you take a a um like a feather and you brush your forearm and it has that light February across the forums sensation most people would say that feels pretty good uh that nerve\nThat sensation is carried along by one group of nerves that are of the similar diameter that have synopsis with one another to bring that message to the brain\nOn the other hand if we took a razor blade and started scraping somebody's for him I think most people would agree that that hurts and you've got to stop\nWhy do these two messages appear to be so different because they travel along nerves of different diameter is that don't interfere with one another ... now here's where it gets really you're going to find out what a science geek I really am here's the\nI really am here's the coolest thing in the world the um the sympathetic nervous system\nHas a group of nerves that are a certain diameter we said earlier in the conversation at the sympathetic nervous system was this fight flight were all wild up we're ready to go uh we have this dry caught and mouth our heart rate is escaping our blood pressure is rising we're we're ready to fight or we're ready to flee\nUm so the sympathetic nervous system carries messages along certain diameter north\nIf somebody experiences pain the pain of repetitive overuse the pain of blunt trauma that sensation from that damage body part is going to travel along a different set of nerves however the\nSympathetic nervous system and the pain fiber nervous systems are very similar diameter so they're capable of forming together what's called an artificial ... we're in effects\nSo we have this effect the connection between the sympathetic nervous system\nAnd the pain fibers now all of a sudden anywhere where we have sympathetic nervous system which is really the whole body becomes become susceptible to a um to feeling pain so\nI wouldn't say every single day but I Would certainly say many many times a week I have a patient who will say something along the lines of\nI hurt my hands maybe it was the repetitive use of all this typing maybe it was I smash my fingers with a hammer either way I hurt my hands\nAnd now I feel pain traveling throughout my forearm and throughout my upper arm and up into my shoulder and I feel it in my neck and I know how crazy this is sound you got to believe me doc but I I feel it in my upper back and starting to travel down to the other side of my body\nWell that's very real that's a product of\nA ... in artificial ... or in ... between the sympathetic nervous system and the pain fibers of the individual or injured body part so\nWhen we have this kind of a scenario and the patients describing things I ask them questions like is your blood pressure kind of up ... oh yeah\nUh do you feel your heart practically beating through your oh yeah\nI'm following me on this one do you feel kind of like a like a dry caught and he tasted your mouth\nAnd then then patients look at me like wow how did you know that are you Clara ... and no I'm not but I'd really like my patients to believe that I Am and uh we start to realize that um their pain is very real the injury is very real\nBut the treatment is not going to be well let's do something exclusively to repair the mechanics of the hand where the original injury took place which of course is critically important but we have to this is where we talked a few minutes back where we said we look at the patient as a whole body\nWhat is it that we can do to stimulate that patient cerebellum\nIn order to inhibit the sympathetic nervous system in order to drive the Paris sympathetic nervous system back to a wine and dine in Reston digest in let's be pain free experience and turn down the uh the volume on the sympathetic nervous system\nAnd break up these artificial ... says where patients get wound up\nAnd they have a accelerated heart rate their blood pressure went up and it makes the pain that they're feeling travel all over their body and become more intense so no I'm going to finish your thought but I Want to remind everyone we've got some callers we're going to get to them and the ...\nNext segment so for a gym
