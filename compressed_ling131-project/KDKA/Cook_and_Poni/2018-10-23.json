believe but the other thing is when you hear these people it's like a cult following the U L G that you can not find anything wrong with him\nI don't care what you vote for what you do\nThese people aren't perfect and they have this man who is the president as perfect anything wrong with them and something is absolutely scary about that so\nYou mean so you're saying that you know wait Joanne Joanne wait\nSo you're I'm just trying to clarify here so\nYou're saying the people who support President Trump act as though they kind of have a whole mentality where if you are just say anything contrary to ham\nYou're wrong\nHave a whole mentality where if you are to say anything contrary to ham you're wrong\nAre you there oh I Hope you can you still hear me yes I can feel very\nWhat I was asking for Joanne so you're saying that the people who follow President Trump who are his supporters his core they act cult like is that what you're saying\nI and many of them seem like it because this man they way they come across that he can do nothing wrong scotch and you know that there's things that\nThey shouldn't but why he feels about one of the ... the other day on ... this man had just gotten murdered and killed and he's saying oh somebody ... somebody like that\nMean just the things that come out of his\nMom you know what they're doing and Joanne I Will tell you this I'm appreciative of the phone call you're certainly not alone\nI think a lot of people feel that way but what the president of the United states has right now is he has a core base of people\nWho will

says it's fair um family were Holocaust survivors in this they saw this current behavior supporting him as a sort of fascism it's the same thing but you didn't engage that person\nOr I think I'd quit when he called the president of the United states and not see see\nI think that sort of where I you know I wouldn't have said that about rock Obama and I didn't vote for the president at that time I didn't vote for him but I sure wasn't going to go out and call them and Nazi and call him name so I think my tolerance for\nDiscussion goes so far and then sometimes it just gets silly and that was silly to me I didn't I didn't understand that so that's why that caller got disconnected I didn't see that ah the parallel Tom and pen hills good morning you're on K decay radio with Wendy ... good

and a half maybe plus or minus a little bit there so things have stabilized the ... beds and the grand scheme of things one on a one percent down isn't such a big deal but\nComing off of the weakness of the last two weeks a sure is a re pest of people's nerves\nYeah that's a good way to put it a Jimmy Meredith with us Jamie I Want to ask you about\nUh uh the one percent so you guys you smart guys you always talk in terms of percentage is a you know I I Need numbers so the last I saw was four hundred that's the that's the Dow Jones I Want to get to the other thirty right now to talk to them or a world where we go now what's causing this\nOil it's it's a whole bunch of things one more in what's called the earnings season where companies are releasing their earnings for the third quarter and\nWhat drives stock market prices over the long term and what provides the fundamental value is corporate profits a you're not going to pay as much for a company that is less profitable than another company and the and the market to try to anticipate what these profit releases are because you know the markets wouldn't be\nFrom some big names from caterpillar three AM\nAnd those are names those are global names and what that you're doing is kind of\nStoking fears of of a lot of the trade and tariffs talks is it really really settling into a corporate profits and is this something more serious than the markets had a had taken it to be over the last several months\nSo for instance if I look at barons right now they have a story on line that says doubt tumbles for thirty five because a trade war has finally come home the wall Street Journal says us stocks fall on earnings outlooks worry about global growth\nNow it seems as if they are the usual suspects or when it comes to these matters is there anything more pronounced about them now than perhaps other times\nWell I think it it really is you know in in our world we ... we do call this a ... test of your convention convictions imagined playing a game of poker and you think you've got a pretty big hand and and somebody else that's big well that really makes you think do I have is good of a hand as I thought I did\nThe same thing with stocks ... you're buying people have been buying stocks it fairly elevated levels\nThey're buying stocks under the assumption that these companies are going to grow a very high rate and now we're getting a data point that indicates well maybe that things aren't as good as we thought and it's causing the market is the kind of take a step back\nRecurrence their numbers in and say do I really want to own this stock for this price or do I want to look somewhere else\nOkay so in fact people are getting a little bit jittery like you said put it in context ah overall put it in context last couple of weeks as a lot to say about it um but you've always been ... I Can't say I was you've been generally over the last year so working with the other night on TV bullish on the economy I suspect you pretty much still feel the same way\nYeah I think I think at the end of the day I think people are going to be confident in these companies I think they're going to be confident in the current crisis I Do believe this this can be a buying opportunity for long term investors\nThe last thing I Would do for any investor right now is to panic and making radical changes in your portfolio you might want to lighten up on some of the expense of names like technology\nMove it into some names like value and and non us that have been beaten down there's some really great opportunities in those areas but I wouldn't panic I think the fundamentals of the economy remains very very strong\nAh today's not that much different than yesterday other than the market's\nDown so I have only thirty seconds for forgive me the S P is it twenty seven thirty to CNBC with a report today and I've talked to others in the industry is say when it gets to twenty seven hundred that's very important that's a floor that say\nThat something that you have to pay attention to above it's one thing ones bad ones bowl do read into that\nOr to a certain extent I think it does influence short term behavior but at the end of the day it's all about profits and if we get more companies are doing well and their profit releases then I don't think those numbers really matter and we're ... we're going to forget these small offices\nEar Jamie Meredith thank you so much I appreciate it always great to talk to you got it I Know you're busy he's from effort tell us in the ... from Katie Kay\nCertainly traffic on the finest hour by bottles are nice on route fifty one south on top of the ... we\nHave an accident amity street and seventh avenue hitting the bark when he's right now what I was on the parkway in western banks of the tunnels bounds moving along fairly well no problems right now over on the parkway north and ...\nWatch out for slowing down on Perry highway after an earlier accident at Burr Oak tree road are an extrovert at one thirty five from the Presbyterian senior care network traffic center I'm Scott stellar on news radio then twenty\nPrompt or erode aren't extrovert out one thirty five from the Presbyterian senior care network traffic center I'm Scott stellar on news radio events ...
