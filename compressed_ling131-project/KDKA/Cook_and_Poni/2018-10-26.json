I Know we can do that so let's go\nAnd show that there is help out there she said come a long it took her six months to determine that in the living room of this woman's house there was a baby grand piano that's how much clutter and stuff there was\nSo I said you know I Want to do the story but the you know the homeowner [noise] it it's hard to find somebody who's willing to say yes I'm a horror or yes I have clutter issues come into my house and I'll talk to you about it as embarrassing and that as that is so I said to the to the gal the organizer I said if we could find someone\nWho would be willing to speak to me about what it's like literally to have at our house swallow them alive\nI Would love to tell that story because I think that we could reach so many other people who struggle similarly and maybe give them some guidance or some help to basically saved our lives so the next day I get a call maybe two days later that organizer friend was sitting in church\nAnd a lady sat next to her and they started talking and it turns out that the lady who sat down next to her\nWas\nBeing ultimately swallowed alive by her house she had seven six or seven siblings and all of them had passed away many of them had passed away and she had accumulated all their things well what do you do with prized and coveted possessions of someone you love you give them the goodwill she couldn't do that\nAnd the way the house was situated on a hill it was too hard for her and her Ninety seven year old mother who lived at the house with her to get this stuff out [noise]\nSo\nI told the story I had to squeeze in sideways I'm I'm pretty thin per se I squeeze inside ways to get in the front door\nAnd we told his story it was it was an amazing story and I found out her face I didn't want to I didn't want to abuse her\nAnd and and publicized who she was that we hadn't blurred how her face and she sat on the bed and was so traumatized and depressed and\nShe was embarrassed by her house and like I told you I think people will be fingerprints on me and I'm In my heart I I was up for four days pacing and my husband's like what are you doing\nAnd I'm like I Can't get her out of my mind there's something I have to do is that you're crazy just had twins you know what ... what are you going to do for this woman and I said I don't know but I have to do something and the next day I went to the TV station [noise] and I started making phone calls\nI called metropolitan window company talked to John Schmitt sir\nI called Michael's brothers dumpsters I called up pods I called concrete restoration place mold remediation I called landscapers\nI made thirty thirty two or thirty five phone calls to various contractors or business owners asking if they would partner with me\nTo not only remove all the clutter from this woman's house but to essentially rebuild it\nNot one said no to me not one\nI was able to go back to this woman's house who allowed me to tell her story of her basic home falling apart around her and say\nSo I was able to go back to this woman's house who allowed me to tell her story of her basic home falling apart around her and said what a fight what if I told you that we could make this better and she said\nWrite what are you going to do and so we moved her and her Ninety seven year old mom out of her house for six months and all of these builders came in these contractors the Home Depot\nThey poured an outlandish long walk away that was safe for them to to manage\nWe de cluttered everything loose ends Mr live and Robert live and gave us all new furniture\nOh new carpeting we got a brand new bathrooms they had granite countertops they never had a dishwasher all new appliances the entire house was read on top to bottom it was organized\nIt was neat and six months later\nWe had a reveal on the front lawn sort of like extreme home makeover but our own home makeover and she and her mom again Ninety seven years old\nWalking through the house to see all of the parts in it they were no holes in the walls it was warm they had new plumbing new windows\nThe mold we've gone the asbestos was gone they had landscaping they had a new retaining wall even their dog had a dog house it was amazing I have never been so moved by acts of kindness and all of my life\n[noise] and that Ninety seven year old mom walked through the house and said not a word she just had tears streaming down her face\nIt was the most powerful thing a year later oh I should say later that year\nWe were on vacation my husband and sons and I were on vacation and I got a phone call at Christmas Time and it was this woman phoning me and all I heard were the sounds of her grandchildren laughing in the background because they couldn't go to her house before it was unsafe\nBut now they were at her house it was the greatest thing I'd ever heard\nThat Ninety seven year old woman\nJust recently passed away she was one hundred and four and while\nWe don't keep in touch often every now and again we had gone back and forth with each other and make sure we were all okay the one hundred and four year old daughter asked me if I Would be willing to do her eulogy at

got to be a man so that's why I had to ask sorry it's the ... person any if everybody does does one thing every day the one thing becomes ten things because it feels good to do good do you know what I mean it's infectious\nRight and I just think if ah every minister at a church every praised a anybody on the radio would bring that up to people today an everyday make a resolution for next year that every day I'm going to do it at least one good thing to make myself feel good and make somebody else happy\nThink about what that would do if we can teach that at school or if we I Know a lot of

whatever there are stages of grief\nUm whatever I and I was going to it's not like my son died or you know come on let's keep it all into perspective but I remember thinking oh I Wish people would

path changes\nWhy he toured comes but we walk through it and then all of a long time down the road you're like wait a minute that's why that happened right here it happens on a bus I Love the call and

like no you can hub mayor well I'm not that kind of girl I I'm not\nGonna I'm not going to say that with sexual assault or [laughter] you know this is the crazy world that we live and where you know boys don't know how to ask girls out on dates for fear of it being offensive or you know we can't we can't touch each other were say things to each other for fear of offending one another it's like\nBoy oh boy if you hear the stories that are coming out today they they cut through all of that all of that is just\nIt's ... it's noise it's a waste of time by and large to be so worried about everything that we do and say\nSo what do we do and we end up doing and saying nothing\nAnd the whole point of this program however it makes you feel you might think this is a tremendous waste of your time and if that's the case you've probably already tuned out I I don't think it is\nAnd I think it's it's incredibly brazen for a radio station to say hey you with no experience on the radio with no parameters on what to talk about and no expectation is about what you should say go out\nAnd and fill in for Marty he needs you need some time I think that's tremendously brave and I take a chance here I take a chance I show my children take a chance to take a risk there'll be stupid\nBut take a risk do everything to the best of your ability but follow your heart follow your heart believe in yourself I Want to read a couple of more of these\nI Love this whole makes me think how about this one\nToday after my mother harshly judged me for what she read in my private diary for the first time

I was going to make a beer friday but uh you know we've gone a different direction obviously\nI understand and it's just one man's opinion but I think the vast\nMajority of Americans regardless of their political persuasion are sick and why acts like this you know I Would think this guy at some type of mental illness I cycle nobody got hurt effect will they caught this individual and um this is the world we live in yeah\nWell that's what the governor said the other day and you're right I agree with you I Do agree with you that that uh you know uh you know we see the numbers we see the poll numbers we seen the percentages but you know we'll be really neat is to be able to have the hard numbers because I\nI mean ... the people that are so freakish ally out of touch with reality\nOn the FARC streams there are the loudest once they're the ones who get all the attention and so forth and unfortunately their power is so strong and the media is all too happy to run the water for them on both sides that they frame\nWhere we are they framed the conversations they frame you know our attitudes and ultimately the divisions and you know I've said it before I don't know whether I I don't know as long as I Am here it ain't going to be like that I'm going to welcome everybody but you know what you're going to get for me\nNo question I enjoy your show I completely agree with your

shaken up those are the people I was just talking to from Mike in ... for that that don't help the matter\nThere are those who course or going to run with it and and look I thought it was way way way premature for CNN to run with it and uh and and the you know throw this directly at the president's feet\nWay too early matter of fact I'm not you know until we find out more I don't know what inspired him obviously he clearly if this is if you connect the dots it would appear it's not too hard to figure out where this guidelines up politically\nAs I said and the last hour I Hope that we're able to be in a place where\n\nThank God despite not becoming fatal we still get the message is unacceptable and that there's a behavioral change from the top down\nThe president is a stock straw the
