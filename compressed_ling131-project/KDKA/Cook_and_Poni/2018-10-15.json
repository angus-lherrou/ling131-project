something's missing there\nWell he is so good in in his direction but also in his cutting so he took the play which is usually about three hours three and a half hours is alone on\nA cut it down to an hour and a half\nIn and did it so well and with five actors who play all Eighteen characters\nIt's pretty doggone good I mean and the the performances were wonderful the direction is great but I was

a poll Rasmussen has a news updated for you know news radio tend to want to we are Katie ... a radio\nNo we're not we're shortly aren't oh it's only ten twenty eight oh for God's sakes I'm thinking we got plenty of time we have a a back in ... as I was saying earlier who got this up and running in Nineteen fifty eight and we're our moral addressed the radio and television news directors association about\nThan most of our industries program planners believe he was talking to news directors their fear of controversy is not warranted by the evidence I have reason to know as do many of you but when the evidence on a controversial subject is fairly and calmly presented to the public recognizes it for what it is\nAn effort to illuminate rather than to agitate\nThe boy that is that is that is a speech that I think probably all news departments of news director should have in their offices are especially in these days and times and you know what's funny here's Edward Murrow going back to Nineteen\nFifty eight talking to radio and television broadcasters\nWhat he is saying illuminates now all these windows that I have open in the studio and perhaps you do do on your computers the computer now and all the information that we have in our hands yes it uh it it can illuminate it can agitate\nIt can do all sorts of things and it was really our choice as to how\nWe use it but today is the anniversary of that speech October Fifteen to Nineteen fifty eight and I thought it was important um to here\nAnd it's also ... Eduardo ... voice those guys were easy an not easy to edit but it does the because the the way they spoke so directly\nAnd so straightforwardly you could find the beginning and the ends of their sentences [laughter] but he really that's been tore into just just great Edward R Merle\nI'm at the end of the half hour there I was talking about pride and prejudice we saw hamlet on friday and pride and prejudice which is running at the O'Reilly now and a ... it's it's it's really good uh and I got a text that said mice as this person says my son received tickets from his school to go see pride and prejudice at the ...\nAnd prejudice at the O'Reilly Theater wasn't sure what to expect had never been to the old Riley but we had a good time the show is very entertaining and I laugh more than I expected to I did too I thought it was really going to be\nA English drawing room comedy so to speak a and it it it it certainly has that aspect it stays true to you know what was intended in the original a book and and the adapt to play\nBut they play it kind of as a comedy\nAnd the laughs are hilarious and the imagination is also underfoot you kind of get a chance to and I think theater's doing that a lot more now as Shakespeare did you kind of saw behind the scenes you know that they're actors they're not ... portraying as somebody that you say oh that's got to be no you know it's an actor portraying somebody else\nA but it it it ... you kind of get to see some of the\nBehind the stage stuff\nAnd I'll just leave it at that but it it's really a ... it's really a powerful a um show on the rise the ... are coming in saying okay let's say or going to do here in Pittsburgh she came here from Seattle and she's a jumped in with both feet in the hands over at a also I got a a\nTax or somebody says we're talking about hunting a gentleman that called up about that ... and in this person says I have no problem with hunting\nBut how can the previous caller be okay with sport hunting but be disgusted by trophy hunting well you know everybody has their own feelings\nUm good uses goes on and so you made the point perfectly that no matter what type of funding it is no and if it is really necessary in twenty Eighteen but there's a lot of people who would disagree with that and I will leave that there that is that is your own personal I'm\nA discussion to have with yourself and and you can decide as you wish to go a yet to come up on the program some some of the stuff this is interesting thing with a with the president and I simply mean it's an interesting situation we were talking earlier about\nArabia situation and the and the killing of the journalists we we believe he's dead we've not heard from them for almost a week now a turkey is a saying that they they had a tape of this murder we were talking about this alleged murder perhaps it was put on an apple a risk phone\nAnd a wrist watch and uh that was disputed on Saturday but the Turkish are saying is that ... the news media somebody in the news media was saying perhaps it I think it was on CNN that perhaps a turkey was listening in and was able to a survey all\nThe ah Saudi embassy and the president has said that he talked a too that the Saudis and they said no we didn't do it\nUh and he said well so maybe maybe it's a road I mean it\nIt it it's kind of gets into what he was saying about putting you know when we're talking about\nUh the the election and the meddling and he said I asked him and he said no so what are you gonna do so it it seems to be the same narrative on this although he has dispatched a palm pale are um secretary of state to\nSaudi Arabia to hopefully get to the bottom of this and if somebody was saying earlier I guess it was had\nA how to do a diplomatically and not by simply threatening and saying if you do this we'll do that but somehow coming to a conclusion and perhaps keeping them as a\nUh I think is most important to keep them as an ally but somehow or change the narrative of this but at the same time getting to the truth of what it's all about it is a touchy situation than it is something that could really get out of hand if not handled correctly but this is this is a pretty big deal\nA ... as it goes because ah it also affects\nUh it also affects selfishly it affects our gas and oil prices and that affects our economy ah which is one thing that the president was saying\nHe didn't want to get a ... have touch because of the um relationship we have between gas and oil and sending them planes and weapons\nAgain it's always about the money isn't it

Wednesday night I Will watch a trip like traffic on the five gathered burgers watching\nWhat's going on out their\nGas [noise] Donnie ... nothing really pretty well for us around the ... traffic on the five thousand find out there and he found that the one south on top of the hell no accidents in your way\nVery little traffic the parkway east on the downside enough to get as you make your way into this world how tunnels and firefly lessons I've seen of health or actions twenty ain't no problems on that in downside out\nPerhaps getting over what may have been a little bit of shock of not having a lady on in the lineup a and on the other hand I'm sure living on bell is looking at this as so often happens with with athletes\nThat you you think that the team can do without you and then you know so you you kind of have this with no resolution to it\nAnd then you realize that fine them over and that that's a shot and it's got to be a shock for a living on bell now probably for the first time in his career looking at this and and you know that ... that there is that voice in the back of his head saying maybe they don't need you after all maybe they get along without you\nAnd that ... at once that seed planted either in his own head or in management had that do we need this guy um\nThat's that's not good so that's the that's the dark part of a rather joyous day here in Pittsburgh because I all I could think about ... watching that game yesterday\nWas oh no if it comes down to this and they lose this game Twenty one twenty there I thought today is going to be held to pay\nBut they pulled it out and it was really a beautiful everybody's blitz and nobody watches brown wow integrate a great throw from uh\nFrom van and uh he he deserves a lot of credit for that that was it that was [laughter] it traces the game but again you you don't look so much of the game was played you just look at them wrong and lost columns and that's how you go today\nIs a a very a historic day we were talking about this earlier a Sears\nBankrupt um hundred and twenty five years I don't think there's any company that was is more um has to do more with the history of modern times here in the country are moving off the farms and into homes and\nAnd so on the progress of the people than Sears the Sears holding company filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy today after failing to make a hundred thirty four million dollar debt\nPayment um and ah the bankruptcy filing is the latest most significant milestone in a long decline but the company wants best known for pioneering the mail order catalogue everybody waited for the Sears catalog featured nearly everything the American consumer my desire\nOr today however series is drowning in five and a half billion dollars of outstanding debt\nHedge fund manager any Lambert took over the company and twenty third teams both companies biggest investor in a major lender and tasked with orchestrating uh difficult turned out they got hit with you know being and too much debt\nAnd the fact that more and more people are going to stores less and less and yeah you have the rise of online you have the rise of Amazon or it's so much more convenient\nThan running out a but Sears is you know anybody who anybody who's listening to the show now\nAre probably at one even if you're really young or perhaps at one time series was a must go to place certainly for the holidays or back to school or any of those kinds of things and losing that it\nIs really quite a big deal it I I remember you know getting the Sears catalog and looking through stuff I mean we we had one at the mall but it was fun looking through that catalog and finding stuff and you know one of the big\nCompanies that is also a part of this and I don't know how this is a line but craftsman tools and lawn equipment and you know things like that the craftsman\nThat have that logo on them uh I don't know we'll we'll that go off to somebody else were they beat will they be on\nTheir own because for a while I remember when I when I was growing up in the sixties or we're working on cars a craftsman tool set was and I still\nThink is the king of all two sets and have you got the craftsmen automotive set that had all the ranchers ... it's a ... industry drivers\nWhen everything and it came in the big metal a case a ... you really didn't need anything else and they were the guaranteed for life I I recall or maybe all tools are I don't know but but it was that's what you wanted those big old chrome slugs and a boy they they\nJust phenomenal I have a set and uh\nYou know you cherish them and I remember my one of my friends are grown up Doug ... one year for Christmas and we're probably\nFourteen something like that we started working on cars fourteen Fifteen Years old and uh he got a craftsman tool set for for Christmas and they were you know they're expensive or even in those days\nBut that's what he got for Christmas and we are all my gosh you know we treated it ... when you you have to take out some spark plugs or a replacement bolts\nHe would always had the shop Bragg there to clean those ... all those screwdrivers up before they went back in the box\nUm and and that you know and have fled across my lawn or a which I've been riding on for Twenty years and the thing is it's just I think indestructible a and continues to run as so many people do but I Wonder what happens with some of these\nUm lines that that Sears ... brought in or was not responsible for but you could always find answers I guess I go to stores or you know operate on their own but um that's really quite a quite a thing that happened today Sears or filing for bankruptcy pretty big\nPretty big deal in America today a triple a traffic on the fire the steak\nAnd I think on the fire just take a look at it I'm\nGoing to run today [laughter] but I Am [laughter] you know we\nWeren't accident free 'til I had to say something that I had to say something

program or with our guest is marva Hayden hill used or she is the executive\nDirector of the partnership for civil justice fun and we're talking about\nThese new regulations that are being proposed are to govern protest\nOr as an eight six six thirty nine one ten twenty talk or text line lower writes\nA more ah Chris I Am all for freedom of speech but in Washington especially they should not be allowed in the Capitol building or anywhere to disrupt hearings those people were embarrassing and acted like bees or is that\nThe kind of protests that we're talking about or or something else\n[noise] we're not talking about that at all and putting aside the right of people to go in and express themselves to their elected representatives I mean a lot of women were coming in and talking about\nA sexual assault that they had experience because they felt that that message wasn't being heard but this isn't about that what we're talking about it's a public street and the sidewalks and the Parkland of Washington DC that are under the federal jurisdiction we're talking about the Lincoln Memorial we're talking about the\nThe national mall Lafayette Park the White House sidewalk the Washington Monument grounds the broad sidewalks up and down a Pennsylvania even including in front of the Trump International hotel these are the areas where\nPeople have historically come and assembled and engaged in the most classic and cherished form of a free speech expression I mean the first amendment says you have the right to petition your government\nFor redress of grievances fats what's at stake here\nUm the uh jumped administrator ... said ah it get bear the cost of clean up after these kinds of protests are ... what do you say about what his administration says about that and that's why these are rules are being instituted a proposed ...\nWell that's not even true because if you actually look at what they wrote and the regulations on their own numbers and statistics it's really important to note that annually the Park Service by its own numbers\nAnd the Park Service should recoup money from those events um because that shouldn't be on the backs of the taxpayers\nBut the court said and said for a long time\nThat facilitating First Amendment activity is part of the core mission of the national Park Service just like tourists visiting the memorial mean are they going to now a set up gates and charge every tourists who wants to come walk on the grass near the Washington Monument or visit the Lincoln Memorial\nOr any of the other important memorials in Washington DC they're going to charge them tickets for the fact that they're treading on public land and that they use trash receptacle while they're there\nI mean of course not this is a direct to target\nOn First Amendment activities and we are urging people to file comments today in opposition to this plan you have the right to file a comment that the public must consider if you go to justice online dot org\nThat's all one word justice on line dot org there's an easy to use foreign we set up a platform that tells you about the regulations you can quickly submit a comment and tell the government what you think about their efforts to restrict and and it is right our First Amendment rights\nFrom our do you think that this is a step toward fascism and in control of the people's right to protest\nReally can't be lost on any of us\nThat at the very moment we're seeing this amped up rhetoric in this extreme hostility\nTo to protesters and these attacks on protestors coming in from the Trump Administration and from others that they have issued these concrete rules\nThat will absolutely obstruct people's ability to access our spaces here in Washington DC and speak out and certainly you know that's always a threat to those in power is to have the people being able to come forward\nAnd say what they think to object to policies to object to plans I mean that's important no matter who's in office\nI'm so again what is the the website and and will these comments or will they make a difference with these low may makers who seem to no longer listen to us but listen to the corporations\n[noise] well it's certainly true that the copper corporations have a\nYou know bought and paid for a lot of our politicians I mean you know Congress is a is a a millionaires club but it doesn't\nThere aren't a lot of folks in Congress who represent regular working people in the United states but what does represent people is our ability to come together in large numbers\nAnd collectively bring our voices to bear that has changed society time and time again when you think of the labor struggles of the Nineteen thirties of steel workers and everyone else it had to fight just for a decent working conditions in for eight hour days\nAnd these are the things that came because the people led and the politicians followed they want to stop her ability to use those public spaces so please go to justice on line dot org\nToday's the last day you can follow your comment and an organization the partnership for civil justice fund we are looking to what comes next if they try and go for the final rulemaking in this form or any similar like form we are preparing to a file litigation to get these regulations and joined\nMara but have you know he'll you're the executive director of the partnership with civil justice for fun we appreciate you a raise in this red flag and we hope people who care about free speech or we'll get involved and go to your website okay\nThank you so much for for having this to that All right thank you time for traffic let's get to it right now\nCertainly traffic on the fire power vows are nice on fifty one south on top
