fall is the most critical time to treat your lawn for for starters we eat is at the time to feed your lawn so before getting the day definitely need to get a good fall fertilizer down right now\nThe fall fertilizer is a different mix to it it has a lot more potassium in potash in it which is what gives the the grass the the strength to go through the winter it gives it the nutrients to lead to survive the winter so that when the spring comes\nHere grasses and starving and it's ready to go\nTo bed in conjunction with that that's when you want to keep the PH level and you're so right so the

equator them and I love the equator it's Lucy tidy via or\nIs it I remember watching people because let's face it our parents they did at all I mean they weren't hiring anyone or and there was always somebody in the neighborhood that really had expertise and what they needed to do\nBut you know you get a washer that's missing or something that stripped or something that's rusted and no ... is around or you know a sledgehammer to do what you need to do so maybe it's a good idea for people like they shop for groceries to maybe kind of keep a an inventory my father always did\nAnd you know the Maxwell House coffee can that was labeled ex while my\nMy neighbors come over knock on the door and then I borrow screwdriver wash or they don't ask for a cup of sugar\nNo but I mean if you have

the way we're up to just as a little clarification Dubai ... says the company by the way the actual product we cells called back to kill so sometimes we get a little confused by that but if you go to the go to the hardware store to get it at like you said Bactrim killed was the product name from back trucks\nAll right sounds good let's go to Carol in the north hills Carol how you don't walk in the ... radio\nThank you for weeks ago I found that the critters sawed it my lawn area about\nNine feet in diameter uh-huh Mm I went online and they\nJust didn't grow up back because critters were probably look for some\n... ... ... and half of the winter time mhm did apply that and I also put taxes are down ... mentioned on line to help keep the critters away okay\nAh this morning I went out and it's starting to the side of the left it again yeah okay and you help me sure sure\nWell okay so we have a really bad problem with the Japanese beetles here in western Pennsylvania the Japanese beetle runs suicide cycle where it lays eggs and then the eggs become the grub and then the grump start getting ready for winter so they started eating all the grass roots\nIts roots you start to see these dead spots and your lawn\nAnd then you'll have like raccoons and\nI'm I'm the I'm ... I just love the grubs they come and they tear up though Ron right\nSo there's only one way to to do to take care of the grubs right now than it was very highly likely that it is grubs it's usually very easy to tell you can literally go out into those dead spot areas where on the edges word it's green lift up the sun and you'll usually see these ugly grubs there\nThe product you use those products from bay are called twenty four hour grub control\nThis is the product has got a chemical called dialogues and the dialogue is is an immediate overnight apply it during the day water it in or let it rain and it'll kill all the grubs in your lawn and does it effectively quickly and literally within twenty four hours the grubs are gone and your problem\nIn in that sense of stopped rate at that point you know obviously we're talking about receding and things of that nature\nThe grub backs is not going to help you um the there's two products that are on the market that that control grubs like grub X\nAnd the season long grub control product from their um their great products but they need to be applied in early spring or somewhere in the neighborhood and generally speaking April it's they applied then and then it it's a season long application they won't be effective now\nUm oh yeah so that that is a little bit of misinformation for you there but the twenty four hour grub control products would be the one I'd recommend it is extremely effective you simply spread down\nWith a typical lawn spread or it has to be watered in that as a crucial thing and within twenty four hours you it's kinda gross you'll actually see the grubs pop up to the surface and die\nYeah and and as far as keeping the raccoons and skunks away wants to grubs are dead ... they're not going to come back 'cause there's nothing there for them to eat itself\nSo please repeat that please yeah\nIt's it's called it's ... it's called bio advanced\nTwenty four hour grub killer plus sets the exact name grub killer plus from mayor and but it made all have that logo on its has twenty four hour that's your key to know that you got the right item\nThank you for the call listening got another writer automotive text message best deal in town from John in al equip a hey I moved into a rural Ninety six year old house where the previous owner let the woods grow up in the ... to the back porch is slow down towards the house I have removed the trees but I don't want to approve the weeds\nAnd have the ... roll down on to the house what grass seed do you recommend that I could plant\nWith the weeds to start converting this wild soil into a yard thank you love the show\nOr the ... degree did the grass it's still there there's a lot of good grass seeds out there so I mean we do have our favorites but what makes\nBlack beauty ultra so unusual\nIs that it has been and and this is another thing we love I mean this is from the Jonathan Green company in burying green and his father and I mean it is it's a family run organizations and and if you get any really high quality ... you know from the most high quality sought farms it's black beauty object ultra grass seed that they're using\nAnd what makes it so unusual is that for one\nIt'll shoot groups roots four feet down into the ground so what that does as you can imagine during times of drought\nIt's more likely to survive the drought and stay nice and the rich and green because it can he can get moisture from deep into the soil\nIt also puts a whack sea surface on the on the leaf of the the the grass that those two things one it helps keep the moisture into the leaf of the lead it also prevents insects from chewing or want to chew on the leaf so you you tend to have a sense of the insect resistant drought resistant and then the the the crew to gall if you will is the fact that it's a beautiful ...\nA beautiful deep green beautiful grass I and you know what in this instance might what makes it even better than it the Penn State blends or the green thumb or the Scots or anything else is that part of the roots growing four feet deep and I mean that doesn't happen overnight it takes a season or two\nBut this was on a hillside so you're worried about erosion or landslide movement or something\nThere's no other seat on the market that's going to get those roots that deep and help to hold that soil into place so I wouldn't worry about there's weeds there there's different grasses they're so forth\nI I Would just over seed that area are now with that Jonathan Green product\nAnd it's it's going to take hold now before the frost in the snow and so forth and then it'll be dormant but come spring as soon as the ground warms up that seat is just skin is about ... you wouldn't believe\nAnd within a year or so totally take over all those weeds and um you know have a nice ... on it but that seed being on a hillside like that would be the only choice I doubt that the\nBlack beauty ultra by Jonathan Green\nKuti gras ...

times when you least expect it turned out to be a trip of a lifetime\n[noise] well it's something that I think a lot of people haven't thought about it you know sort of like\nIt's so close that you don't always say oh yeah let's just drive down there I mean you can drive the car and be there and an hour but you don't think about it that\nSometimes when we think of vacation we're thinking of you know going further away where a day trip as Tripoli used to call it a steak Haitian you know a day trip or a car they used to call it a car the car case you know big cars should they Carson that said she said my old brain cell got a little out\nBy the man that gets credit for that as Jim Raymond\nVague Carson and you know something like that it's a quick day but you know you spend a day away and you come home and you feel like you've been on an extended vacation you've had a good meal you've had a good group of people have camaraderie saw the show saw the lights and it just gives you a whole new outlook on the next day so it's you know just some nice little\nTurn off the everyday world and have a little fun\nYou know I I Love to watch these episodes and it's sad but we're kind of getting down to the end of parts unknown with Anthony Bourdain ... you know and and and he said something the other day because they were kind of talking about you know different seasons in places that he\nHas gone too and he grew up in the fine dining industry but he says I like to eat food you know whether I can eat it with my hands you know kind of snack food ah you know burgers stuff that you feel comfortable with fun food\nJust a relaxed atmosphere and I think these big Carson vacations that we were talking about it really is that little joins along the way that you stop the stuff that you Patrick along with you\nAnd the things because you have time and have the convenience of having a automobile which I recommend you go to hurts and rent that automobile and and and you know driving style and not worry about wear and tear on your own vehicle and if you're getting ready to use your own vehicle get into one of those triple a central certified garages and get the wants over\nBut it it it really is just putting your genes on and and going you know dressed down be casual have fun don't put too much pressure on yourself\nDo stuff that makes you happy you know what I normally and that's why I think some of these big corporations are these stay vacations that you were talking about that when you least expect it it can turn out to be one that you're going to remember for your life even more so than maybe some major exotic vacations\nThe thing about Anthony that always impressed me is that with him it was also about\nWas also about the culture and meeting people\nAnd they're used to be a travel agent that I worked with his name is Andy and Andy moved on to another industry but an amazing gentleman and Andy's idea of a good vacation was said he went into the town\nAnd he wanted to go to a restaurant where the local said he didn't want to eat at the hotel not that that's a bad thing but he didn't want to eat at the ... and he wanted to point wanted to go and find you know some little place and a lot of times the little places that you think\nAh that doesn't look like there's anything there I'd like that's the best place you go he'd sit and talk with people he really get a feel for the area\nAnd he'd have a great meal he loved at about vacation and that was always his thing about a vacation was to meet people and on locally and Anthony ... the same way\nWell wherever he has gone whether it's Detroit or\nCome wall alum poor doesn't matter I mean Borneo it's the people that are as significant as the cuisine as the atmosphere share has that favorite beach or national park whatever it all kind of ties in with the food and heritage and it just as much as we love ... and this part of the world\nYou know they love fish in San Francisco so everybody has their culture and he kind of put it into that one big melting pot and started up and he sat down and talk to people about\nThings that met a lot to them and the region and historic landmarks and it just kind of all work and that's why I Love when people call in and talk about their experiences on vacation because they get up close and personal with all of the things that I just mentioned\nAnd that's why you know what every time you go on a triple triple a central be prepared because it just may be one you'll never forget\nAbsolutely and it's just it adds another layer to who you are asked because you experience something else it makes you love that area and that makes you also appreciate where you come from in your history\nBelieve me every time I watch that show either

about why this is just being your chosen profession and why it's still a good way for someone to make a living especially someone who loves to travel and love to travel well\nAnd and you don't even have to have a nationally that love of travel I'd never been anywhere when I first started with AAA yeah how did that happen you know it it well it for me it started out as I have a degree in speech and hearing and when I graduated college there were like three jobs and five million people that one of them\nAnd so you know my parents of course we're like you need to get a job but bell and you need to get a job today and my mother and I were walking through south feels village and my mother at park the car right near one of the entrances and as we were walking by the triple a office they had to sign\nOn the glass window that said now hiring\nAnd my mother said man you need when they're apply for a job\nShe said you know my parents had gotten trip ticks 'cause we used to take a driving trip once in a while\nYou know you need when they're those girls are also nice you need to go in there and apply for a job and you know I was thinking I don't know anything about any of that you know I Want to get a job in my major I went to school for years is what I Want to do and I was I just go apply for jobs so I applied for a job at several places I got hired by Kaufman's part time sales clerks Kaufman's\nWhich certainly taught me a lot about interacting with co workers and the public it was an interesting interesting job\nAnd then AAA called and said well okay if you want to do this and I went through six weeks of training to become an auto travel counselor and I could do trip to excite could do title work\nUm you know we went through tour guide books all that good stuff you know AAA members sold memberships ... refer people to our insurance agency we had insurance agency and I did that for a year and a half\nAnd then there happened to be an opening as a travel agency in my office in back in the day my office was the only one that was open beyond five o'clock\nAll of our officers were eight thirty to five Monday through friday I think it was nine to two or tended to thirty on a Saturday and that was well being that we were in Southfield village we had more hours so we were up until nine thirty at night we were open 'til\nSo I think eight o'clock on Saturday is in the evening and\nNobody applied for the job so they're like you know we need to have this person we went to longer shifts we need to have the six person that five agents and so they hired me on now okay you know we'll give you will give you six months if you can cut it you know both men\nThe rest has been history but I learned my love from that it was just it was the challenge of\nPeople came in with that light and their eyes and they they wanted to do something and and you could be the person that helped make that dream come true and it's still that way all these years later\nSo how many years now forty so okay so you started Fifteen [laughter] can you do you remember the very first trip you booked\nToronto really yes\nAnd yeah we were talking about this and I was in a training class as we can we are talking the other day and somebody said something about what's the first mistake you ever made and I said you know my head was up\nAnd my first mistake was my co workers were busy\nSo they would be like OK here you get started with this and you need help you call you know and so they backed waiting on their customer well it was a Pittsburgh penguin and I have no idea who was I didn't like hockey back then so I've no idea who it was but he came into office in one by an airline tickets have his girlfriend\nCome in and see a game and there was a thing called a um [noise]\nIt was a sort of a prepaid airline ticket let's say it in simple terms and you filled out this form and they got a copy as a receipt and it had a ticket number on it and then you called it into the airline with their payments uh-huh well nobody told me to none of my co workers said calling into the airline\nI took his payment I gave him when I needed to give him and it was never called in the airlines so she couldn't\nGet on the plane and he was not happy\nSo that was my first and you know when you make a mistake you have to be an adult and go I made a mistake and I'm so sorry and triple a made it correct made it right and I never made that mistake again but you know you're that didn't deter me I was young at that point I could have been like nope I just kept on plugging away and forty

it\nYou know the problem with most people they want to stick with what they are familiar with those two names and others that are recognizable but people need to know there's plenty of fish in the seat and they need to at least listen to what you have to say that's why Joe wouldn't you recommend pick up the phone call today and set up an appointment definitely\nThe agents are standing by when you go there waiting to fill whatever question Jeff\nShall I say I call this one eight eight eight eight one eight Medi six three three for today somebody says hello this is many connect how can I help you what should be some of the things that I should ask these people so I can start the conversation off on the right foot because I'll be honest with you I just because of hanging out with you and Brian obviously meeting Joe today\nI'm noticing this stuff more than ever it's like everywhere I go it's like something about Medicare Medicare now's the time you have to do it get it done two days away step up to the plate make this decision\nIt literally is like I Want to just turn the TV off and I want to go to the mailbox I don't wanna listen to the radio and I want to pick up the newspaper and everywhere so I Want to make sure that I'm prepared so when I ask a question I hit the sweet spot and I'm off and running as far as what I Need to do to\nBe a part of open enrollment and make it a seamless as easy as possible so what are some of the initial question do you think somebody should ask you know I think\nAren't quite skeptical enough Rob\nPeople tend to be a little bit too trusting that everything you see or hear it could be true so the first question that I think you should consider is what's in it for the person I'm Talking to\nHow do they benefit from it if you want to add what was their angle what's this going to cost me ... what's it going to cost me well how do you benefit from it ask our representatives how they benefit from the advice that they're giving you and then the next thing you need to ...\nAnd the next thing you need to consider is what is my specific situation I may be sitting next to my wife who's health care needs and situation is completely different than mine\nHow how does that affect the decision what should we be considering so the first thing you should do when you call in the in the many connect\nOr even if you want to call right now and talk to Joe and I know what doctors you see no what conditions you're seeing those doctors for no what prescriptions that you take\nAnd then we'll work from there do you want the ability to see any doctor or hospital anytime you want or do you want to be told you can only go to this network of providers that's an important question choice should matter\nIs it okay if their child is someone who is sixty five and maybe they would rather have them talk to one of you as far as that initial phone call or does it have to be the person\nKnow definitely we actually we urge the children of the members to call we urge to the because we want another set of ears we want another set of eyes so they can help because they're the ones working more closely with their parents will be able to field all the questions answering make get\nAll the I's dotted and T's crossed but the actual implementation and understanding of the program we can help with that also but the other set of ears denies definitely makes sense\nListen you and I are two of the older people in this room right now and win Brian's here we're extremely older people in his room\nHow and I know why I Love these two guys and obviously having a lot of respect for you here and just a couple of minutes what I've met you because of the passion and kind of talking about where you came from the construction world and where you are now during the break your guys worked hard your whole life but I Know how I look at things Joe differently now because I Am soon to be sixty two in January of two thousand Nineteen\nAnd I see why people my age is kind of like when you're younger and your mom says my feet are cold you don't understand that when you're Thirty years old but when you're sixty one on your feet are cold you get it you understand what I mean definitely looking through my eyes that now or a senior citizens eyes\nDoes it really give you a joy to be working with some of these young guys who have this much passion as young as they are you know it definitely\nWhat I like best about it as corny as it sounds\nI Love helping people either whether it does whether I'd get a benefit out of it or not I just enjoy helping people the clients that I have the ones that I've met with they all know\nI'm there for them at any time as well as a medic connect people so we're good for that and these guys they're the ones pushing me I have to keep run an ad of them it's killing me but I like\nIt yeah I I can I can see that but you know what for you to make that major jump what was it I mean there had to be some human connection for you to leave what you were pretty much just abolition to decide to do this what was it\nUp I I was looking at it as I'm In the construction business I don't know too many of them that can retire and pick up a quarter still and I started wondering what's gonna happen to me in Twenty years that's when I decided to make a change into the crew or into an insurance career you know you\nWere talking about the union a lot of folks who work hard with their hands and I've talked to orthopedic surgeons who said everybody thinks of the athletes and this and that what have you but you look at a construction worker man or woman who's done it for twenty or Thirty years many of them their joints are shot\nTheir back has been long blown out and they're just trying to survive pain free to exist so the last thing that they need to do is to make a mistake when it comes to their health care because when they need to get that health care they want to be able to go hey after all my years of work here's my Medicare card please take care of me because you know what I put enough sweat equity\nInto the system to at least get that so there are people out there\nUp there you know we all think people are healthy but there are a lot of people with conditions\nThat they need taking care of in the last thing that they want to deal with is being stuck in the waiting room and someone saying well you know there's going to cost you this and you're saying well I thought it was going to cost me that and this to insurance card doesn't work here but I thought my insurance card woodwork here so you want to get it done right the first time so that's why it's important to get the answers from Mehdi connect\nAnd you just hit on a key point of this whole enrollment period in this region Rob whether people want to believe it or not whether ... pm seat tell you that you're okay you're not you're not okay\nYou are losing access to a portion of the doctors and hospitals in this region\nThousands if not tens of thousands of members are going to have their network and availability and access to a provider network reduced on July first of twenty Nineteen whether they're saying yes you're still covered you could still go you could still not go maybe you can still go\nMaybe you're not Highmark person who has the PPO and you still want to go to U.

C. you can do if you're willing to pay for your services up front if you're willing to pay an estimated cost of your service up front\nAnd let me just say if you're out there and you have you been fortunate to where you've saved a few shackles\nAnd you're saying to yourself you know what I'll just pay the extra why do I want to deal with this\nListen you owe it to yourself to get the most out of the money that you work for him to get that money in your pocket and these guys are going to save your money and we're also talking about sixty five sixty five but there are people who are sixty eight and even older who may be doing this for the first time because of other resources and they too are wondering what's next\nYou wonder no more you get the questions answered and even if you don't know where to start once you make the introduction they'll lead you down that path because this is what they do at many connect every single day of the\nWeek one eight eight eight eight one eight Medi one eight eight eight eight one eight Medi or six three three for many connect\nInsurance dot com Joe ... here\nWe are going to take some phone calls so if you have any questions you and you're listening out there and you want an answer there should be the best way to do it it's simple pick up the phone eight six six three and I won ten twenty eight six six three nine one ten twenty you can reach me a dollar bank instant access kitty cat radio dot com or write automotive text line the best deal in town\nAnd I will get and relate those questions to them or if you just want to cut to the chase and pick up the phone now make an appointment to call them at many connect their standing by right now in the Saturday afternoon and they're going to be back with us next week and the noon hour as well to one\nEight eight eight eight one eight Medi one eight eight eight eight one eight many one eight eight eight eight one eight six three three four [noise]\nWhen you want a spot that burglar when he's case in your home or after he's in asked John who's blink camera alerted him a burglars trying to break in while he and his family were home or Shannon who's blink camera caught a thief stealing packages both times blink video clips were sent a police to help convict the crooks\nBlink motion activated indoor and outdoor cameras are wire free set up and minutes and run on to double aid batteries that last up to two years\nAnd the live feed option let you check in from anywhere using blink smartphone app so you know when your kids get home from school they'll contracts know subscriptions totally affordable and blink works with Alexa\nCameras systems are back in stock and right now they're Fifteen Percent off that's right Fifteen Percent of all security cameras visit blink protected dot com slash radio over offer details that's blink protected dot com slash radio is an Amazon company limited time off\nStuff okay let's take one more call here and then we're going to kind of get back to some things that you really need to know as the countdown is underway but again they're standing by one eight eight eight eight one eight Medi one eight eight eight eight one eight six three three four D. how are you good afternoon welcome to kinda get radio yes\nGood afternoon I'm hearing that they're going to try to bring in magic care how oh now what is going to happen to defeat the whole period in\nOrder to day life twenty thirty forty years to the Medicare program and now we are on Medicare\nThey're gonna have to point out with Medicare care rationing because it will cost\nThe higher the outlook traded in dollars to pay for Medicare for all and I thought it was a problem of insurance that workers event and get retire or get to see it but they would have medical care\nThey won't be ration\nYou know what your thank you for calling and that's a that's a political football they keep kicking around they're trying to figure out whether or not it makes sense to do that across the\nBut it makes sense to do that across the board\nSo I got\nI I understand what nationality health care is that came from a country where do ...

pollution and more and how they're helping people get well naturally so ladies and gentleman be prepared to be educated areas my good friend Dr Joseph hunting and good actor them\n... thank you very much Rob great to see you again\nSo let's get started by telling everybody about yourself and who you are\nOkay um I I hate doing this\nBecause no these are this is the I Love me part you know that there's a lot to love there and you've got you've got a resume building no about\nCan um um my name is Dr Joseph ... when the wind or one of the center on the lifestyle on his oriented doctor with twenty six years of clinical experience as a chiropractor I also graduated valedictorian of my class are also hold a master republic help the grave from the University of Pittsburgh\nAltogether I have over forty years of a broad based background in natural health care\nI use that experience including a variety of testing methods and techniques to help others prevent optimally manage and even reverse many chronic diseases\nIncluding various auto immune disorders diabetes obesity anxiety dementia acid reflux mosquitoes skeletal problems and more we use safe natural effective methods\n[noise] [noise] and um\nAnd the tissue where the oxygen is exchanged is destroyed\nThe flow of air in and out of your lungs decreases with which results in less oxygen entering and it becomes harder to get rid of that waste product carbon dioxide as the disease gets worse shortness of breath makes it harder to remain active\nIt's easy for me to see how this can happen I started smoking when I was about fourteen and a half years old I Would steal my father's pal Mal's which are very similar to Campbell which are non filtered cigarettes I did this to be whole and rebellious at fourteen and a half what was I thinking\nMy father was already suffering from heart disease and he was a young man anyway in high school I joined the gymnastics team and soon and spent lots of time working out on the rings in parallel bars in fact I went to the city championships in Philadelphia on the rings and the parallel bars\nSo you can imagine what a pleasant surprise was to me when it just a matter of three years when I appear to be at my fittest I was unable to walk up comparatively gentle inclined hills without stopping to catch my breath\nIn addition I was starting to hack up brown mucus which I'm assuming was part from the cigarettes that was a little scary and it was embarrassing to walk up and he'll be passed by others who did not appear to be nearly as fit as I did so I quit\nTook a bad year to do so but by the time I was twenty the habit and addiction was over it was the single best thing I ever did for my health and I'll leave it at that\nI Would have continued smoking I Believe that would be suffering from COPD COPD if I were still alive\nTo better understand COPD it helps to appreciate our lungs work so now in your mind's eye picture in your lungs as an upside down tree with the trachea being the Trump\nThe air we breathe goes down or trachea the trunk which divides into two main airways think of them as the two main branches in our lungs pulled our bronco guy which keep dividing it's a smaller and smaller tubes all more and more branches\nUntil they become terminal ... newer as many as thirty thousand of these ... ... each long at the ...\nEnd of the ... tree or the ... the air sacs and they are ... vital absolutely vital to respiration because they're responsible for the primary function loans which is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide\nAnd emphysema or\nIs it can dish it in which those Elvie ally the air sacs at the end of the smallest air package it a bath is you remember what they were the ... the thirty thousand in each long\nThere are millions and millions of al ... disease albio ally in emphysema or destroyed as a result of damaging exposure to cigarette smoke and other irritating gases and particulate matter\nYou didn't ... I got to interrupt you because this stuff is so interesting and you're talking to her being a gymnast in that slight incline and having a hard time stopping catch your breath all this stuff do you think people realize how quickly\nThe most healthiest person\nTheir life can turn around but the good news is because you're born with that extra lung capacity that if you quit smoking your lungs can actually start to regenerate but do you think people understand because I mean people think oh I've only been smoking for a year I've only been smoking for six months but it immediately starts to affect your way of life doesn't it\nI I Believe it it does you know our mind during seemed to go downhill pretty quickly to be by the way yes I could still do iron cross is\nThe most difficult in all sports all of us why don't I don't know I I Believe me I ... the most but I have there's pictures of me you know the other people have it I never take pictures of me which is listen if I could handle that I Would take a lot of mail I mean these pictures of me doing I'm crosses and then going up into handstands and coming down into an L cross you know\nAnd yet very shortly thereafter I'm catching my walking up hills because that's dynamic you don't need to have a lot of doors to do that you just need to have a lot of strength so I was shocked at how quickly that part of my health went downhill\n[noise] so um what what what's going on now um we leftovers emphysema and we were talking about how the air sacs where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place gets destroyed as a result of your exposure to cigarette smoke another irritating gases\nAnd that I'm with emphysema this is\nKind of the uh the details at this point the rules of the lungs lose their elasticity\nMeaning they can't constrict to allow for you to be able to breathe out\nTalks he'll emphysema can result in severe limited air flow in fact shortness of breath is one of the early signs of emphysema as his cheek to understand what it's like to have emphysema let's simulate what it's like the breeze if you had emphysema\nTaken a normal breath\nBut now only exhale a little of that breath\nDo that three times and you will get a better idea of how difficult it can be to just breeze if you have emphysema or their symptoms include chest tightened is frequent lung infections\nWheezing reduce appetite and weight loss although its primary symptoms or difficulty breathing and fatigue you may go on to experience additional complications including you God does your adorable blue or green fingernails especially if their physical activity\nSpecially if their physical activity gay and of course because you're not getting enough oxygen to your brain a decrease in mental Ernest alertness and difficulty performing tasks requiring concentration now let's switch to a different type of COPD chronic bronchitis\nGate with chronic bronchitis it still lining of the bronchial tubes that become inflamed right we're not dealing with the ... right now we're dealing with the bronchial tubes\nAnd there's over production of mucus leading to a chronic cough which makes it difficult to breed in addition to smooth muscle and lung tissue contracts for their obstructing flow eventually what will happen is scar tissue is going going to form in the lungs\nSmall airways these little brunch gills become just down the road and destroyed as\nWell as the big aries ... airways becoming narrow and now you're not going to allow him as much oxygen\nAs is necessary you also have a daily cough with mucus production in fact a daily cough with me because production and difficulty breathing or the hallmarks of chronic bronchitis\nThe most common cause of bronchitis is inflammation brought on by cigarette smoking but breathing in dust or fumes for long periods of time get also be to blame and air pollution will contribute to the uh cause of greatly worsened and
