...\nGood morning and welcome to another edition of asking the advisor my name is Jamie marathon joined this morning right TJ McKenzie DJ's a financial advisor working on our our ... our office DJ good morning walk onto the show what are we talking about today\nOr good morning and thank you for having me or did they were talking about saving for retirement versus a child's education that's a that's a difficult choice for a lot of parents there are many people who argue that education is important right especially when they're talking about some sort of post secondary education\nYou know forty years ago having a college degree was uh differentiate or but today it's almost a requirement to keep up with every other student coming out of high school right\nSo you know as an advisor my role is to help families set realistic expectations and discuss the consequences no both positive and negative of the decisions they make up and tell them they can or can't do something they desire like paying for education\nRight so when when you work with clients what what are some of the pitfalls that parents can fall into\nYou know I think probably the most uh Austin case that we see is a a parent or parents saving for a child's tuition and lose their own retirement\nAnd one of the things we tell our clients is if you can't take care of yourself by the fall your children end up taking care of you in some Tobias who were the financial or otherwise so it's important and critical to take care of yourself first was the education or coming second funding education coming secondaries and you see that in other areas as well\nI'm and I'm\nYou know he could find or you know he knows your situation these an actual in a financial planner and um you know but I Would\nSay it's something I'd recommend you do All right well I appreciate your thought\nJust if you do it in\nThat to my mother did okay she put it in his shoe box in the\nBottom of our closet [noise] um put it in a novel handed\nTo your kids the kids should also have a copy of your will right they should be your\nPrior fraternity and your medical a directive as well correct\nAll right so you put all that and ... then you you see all the ... you know like my mother she had the him she wanted and we did it all wrong [laughter]\nAh anyhow though you know in my situation is that the adult came up we didn't get it one one him right\nAnd him right so um\nBut anyhow or you can lay although that direction and also if you're going to do that now the here's what families fight about\nThe tea service for\nYou know the clock on the wall so you know put that in a letter as well okay all\nRight if the ants Sophie's tea pot or something\nUm you know let them know who you want to get it for your jewelry for your\nHusband's hunting rifle or something like that you know you know put that into well\nRight and so that that Anne's most of the battles\nOkay All right well thank you\nAll right thank you thank you very good good question good question yeah those are the practical\nThings of life a bit I can remember I was there when I think it was my sister that found the box on my goodness and there was ... yeah we didn't get one thing right\n[laughter] well you gotta learn from your mistakes [laughter] yeah\nWell Jim we we have an email question from Steve and Steve says\nMy wife's grandma has a house that she would like to eventually give to us and she's currently living there now and we love the house and would love to move into eventually but are unsure of the best way to purchase the house\nOr my wife and her mother are the sole heirs of her grandmother's house would be split fifty fifty between my wife and her mother\nNow her mother would not want the house and she lives down the street are ready so can you discuss our options of of acquiring the house and and what you believe would be the the most cost effective way to do this All right ah well first of all\nI'm grandma has um ... let's\nPresume that grandma's not worth is under ten million okay so she could gift the house with no consequence now um if the house is going to be used as residents the primary residence\nOr she could a grandma could gifts that house to\nThe wife and the mother and joins name and then the mother the wife by the half interest from the mother\nBought\nThe mother would then have to pay capital gains taxes on her half the sale\nI'm\n... and ... again not to repeat where we went through in the first hour but to step up and all of us kind of stuff yeah it's a sign the current market value it cetera\nNow or um daughter or let me get the names right wife\nCould buy the home from grandma and grandpa take back a note and um then wife and mother in law\nHave to pay inheritance tax\nInheritance tax on the no and then just cancel being dead and this and then I'm\nThe wife for being get us up up and basis\nUm the if Graham a gift to the property and then lived a year um the transfer would be five hundred a thousand dollars you know the transfer and all that kind of stuff um\nThere'd be a very inexpensive way but your grandma passed away within a year it would still be subject to the Pennsylvania inheritance tax but who would not get us up up and basis I'm no\nSo and the other situation is what is grandma's ... state is their asses beyond the home\nCan be done yeah wooded save money yeah it's always better to get something in a gift than a purchase\nBut if it's going to be the primary residence a husband and gifted granddaughter\nThan the granddaughter puts the house and joined name with the husband they would have a five and they lived in it for three of the law next year's or they would have been the exemption from ah any taxation on the resale\nSo um if they're going to live in it for a period of time it could make sense to do it is a gift today\nUm and a husband and wife kid gift\nTo mom the wife's\nMother or an equivalent amount of money a fifty percent interest of the house so there's lots of ways you could do it and hopefully that wasn't too confusing [laughter] ah but I'm the guy banks consideration\nAnd ... are going to live there for a while you're good rented to refer do every year and that\nKinda stuff so\nGood good good and they're certainly the the other [laughter] I was going around [laughter]\nCertainly are a lot of different uh there's as yet a straight line unfortunately\nSo maybe maybe talk to somebody to to maybe how are you you understand your options a little bit better but a good good answer now we have a ride [laughter]\n[laughter] we have about a minute before break him in and and a half um so let's go to a a dollar bank instant access question um the name is this is from rod and he says good morning I'd like options\nOn a strategy for providing in ... opinions on the strategy for for providing income I'm currently age sixty sex working part time until next year\nMy plan is to replace income with an eye with IRA money by placing one third and either an index are fixed annuity MS drawing five percent a year penalty free\nAnd placing one quarter and fixed to float short term notes to supplement current dividends from stocks mutual funds and CDs\nYou see any problems with this plan and Jemma we have about fifty forty seconds so I'd probably didn't have enough time to answer that ...\nThing you could do is buying index and they were to write the absolute worst thing you can do um we're gonna timing is right\nIn this right now short term money as both served in the bills but unconditionally absolutely do not put your money into an index in there\nSo I I think that's a that's a good point and certainly you have talked to an ad nauseam about your feelings on index annuities and and why that's not the best place so I Would say color advisors off air again the number for one to four three four zero nine nine nine they can give you a more thorough answer we'll be right back\nJelly it's almost that time of the year and I know you're somebody who loves to beautify your home from the inside out that's why like Gina drapery in blind factories so important\nAbsolutely Larry and you know what as a woman I'm not going to lie I Will use any excuse to update my home and that goes for draperies and blinds and shutters because it's true you want your home to look inviting and beautiful and Sheena drapery and blind factory is going to help everyone do that\nAnd that's what Lisa and the design team do they can give you an obligation shopping home appointment and consultation you just have to call for one to six six by forty nine hundred or simply book online at ... dot com\nIs good they were just ... a trademark\nAnd I get a copy right on the program and I'm mad at some point you're gonna have to retain an attorney with the guy Geneva this by that\nHe has to keep it quiet because\nWhat's gonna happen is and this happens for though good ideas and this sounds like good very good idea and as somebody is going to change one type font and they'll come\nWith the exact same product [noise] crowd reverse engineering and that's why\n[noise] uh yeah you know he said I wouldn't I at\nThe end they will be nothing you can do about it you can't they can't get my\nBody is one of the question now that the correct that's why when he gets a working model yang I'm you know working application has to get beyond the ideas [noise]\nUh then I asked to ah that that time returning and turn into a lot of ... now there are a ... he's in the community college\nYeah I think he got back on it would be a patent actually I Am a reputable white ... well\nWhat happens is is ah the Pittsburgh technology council and\nThere are um um\nYou know a lot of things that are the colleges and uh I\nDon't know I'm sure I'm the community college has a an enterprise unit and talked to this tend to go the there are and get some uh contact refer [noise]\nOkay [noise] okay that's absolutely but if I knew I Would get that had thank you day they cannot I'm like okay\nAll right to tell him congratulations on is a spirit\nTo be an innovator [noise] All right thank you Suzie great great question um before we get back to the phones Jim I think you had a couple a topics that you wanted to discuss\nYeah um [noise] you know we ... commentary we we talked about the realities of life and\nUm that eighty four page uh it was a psychological on economic survey of the misery of the millennials and I'm\nI'm that the fact that they don't feel comfortable or the but let's say goodbye to market the market right now\nIs that a tipping point and let let's just talk about the stock market for a couple of minutes here\nAnd the the massive binge buying on indexes is slowing down\nAnd uh when the thirty five percent of all money invested in twenty Seventeen bought the S. and P. five hundred index which is a market cap index yeah went up a lot and went up twenty two percent\nBut over half of that game was based on the fangs and so the top ten stocks produced over half of the return in the U.S and the five hundred the other four hundred and Ninety\nOr didn't do so well known\nSo well known and Ross so two thousand and acts over thirty percent of the big companies and the rest of two thousand index have less money for the last three years\nBy their market value is pumped up because they belong to an index than the index bans by\nNow with the absence of incentives so the Federal Reserve ... start and they're tapping the breaks there are no longer\n... renting eighty five billion dollars a month that we're drawing fifty billion a month\nSo that impact them money flows changing the nature of the market and so when I ran across a couple of studies about this situation number one in long term I'm Talking about decades\nOr five factors that\nCan fuel socked returns and they're based on the characteristics of the security now historically French inform our farm in French\nThey went on a bar a prize in economics about\n... measuring the value of socks and the relative a performance characteristics and for the last eight years growth stocks of outperform value on rolling tenure periods of time and the according to farm and France say cat happen\nSo the current market [noise]\nAnd there's a lot of days traders of live and die by farm and French uh formulas and so less ... characteristics of the security market dynamics and economic forces\nNow valued traditionally wins and in the ten year period of time but it is not\nMany studies have found links between cheap beaten down stock prices of today and superior long term buying opportunities in a a superior performance of the market\nOther factors that impacts strong long term returns are low volatility in the day they do share price share price momentum\nThe quality of the company and the band and particularly the balance sheet but also the quality and the management\nNow so far this year only two of the five major factors have aged the a S P number one momentum\nAnd a momentum stocks have led to pack with the gang of almost Fifteen Percent year to date high quality names of followed with about a ... percent\nLove volatility is run by and large caps are run nine value stocks so only pulling a seven percent now going back to this day to to Nineteen sixty three\nAnd a time were you born in sixty thousand a year and I was I was born in eighty six okay well this free days longer than you then\nOkay if you allocated your portfolio ache willing to those five factors you would I perform there should be by two point nine percent a year off now\nUh no you hit it in your opening commentary\nWhy own foreign stocks they're down you shouldn't known them the things are home runs well there's a long term term called\n... version to demean mhm no there is a very famous study by two economists more and Haley in this study was written in two thousand and they and you were here in two thousand and eight\nAnd what have the conclusion of this study investors hurt themselves because they presume they're better than average and investing and manage money [laughter]\nThere's three failures over estimation\nOver placement in over ...\nAnd according to the more and Haley study\nYes dancer two questions number one assuming I have no skill what is the probability of a successful outcome number two if I Am taking a position where the odds are unfavorable\nWord or why hold a particular edge in skill or knowledge and why\nYou should look at that with every investment that you make yeah that's that's very interesting and uh we could do a a year's worth of shows on on that kinda stuff behavioral finance but a work on my ... coming up against a break

the Iran Iraq it is I've seen them before and I think as we come to the end of the season and maybe they get to ten when maybe they do but uh uh I'm not convinced I mean I I think that a a from a town perspective a we still are better\nAnd or if we can put it altogether if we can get the defense a little bit of help um\nWe can make the playoffs we can make a rough one thing I Love about bandits we you know it it's like we're playing that game and I do the same thing it's it's interesting ... you know we are the Pittsburgh Steelers in it I guess it's the same way around the country but you get that feel about being ... you know a Pittsburgh Steeler fan the Steelers nation it's\nIt's one of those have the kind of warm to hurt we think about hey I'm I Am much dealer you know we don't get paid by them but but you feel like it like you are it's really cool\nOver Twenty years I've been rooting for the Pittsburgh Steelers and ah yeah I mean I I feel like a a family owned organization feel like I've been a part of it than a you know contributed at least by merchandise so I I'll say wait till the cows come home [laughter]\nMike Tomlin we talked about this on a video blog I'm Keith Butler these are two guys right now in the eye of the hurricane ... and the parents obviously been robbers burgers going to give you the upper hand\nTom when they looked at him as far as maybe not you know running a tight ship right now especially with some of the things that have happened we laid down ballot Antonio Brown still are pro ball player and and I think one of the ...\nOne of the reasons why he may have been shooting his mouth off because he just wasn't happy with results on the field and how things were going in and I'm not ever going to throw anybody to the bus for being that competitive but those two guys just coaches in really there blame at all if anything when it comes to the lack of success and was it was a star\nBut I certainly deserve a lot of my I mean there's a you know\nAfter you've been in Pittsburgh this long I think are of the fans are a little antsy and want to see it was all in the super bowl [noise] another one and the you know we haven't had that lately uh Mike Tomlin I think is very good coach uh but you look around the league at some of the or how the wheels\nFall off all of a sudden just this year how can you look at the guy and all this success due to promote appearances and all of a sudden one year things aren't where you want them to be and you got some dissatisfied players and if you really want to look at Libya unveils point of view he knows the window short he wants to cash in why not so how can you look at my comment is the problem [noise] [noise] well\nIt's not even so much I think that you say Mike Tomlin is necessarily the problem but at the end of the day you're the head coach oh so you're the one that's going to be held responsible\nFor the same as a quarterback I mean so ... and when he's talking about a quarter back I think one of the things that kind of being glossed over right now because he's not such a popular figure Pittsburgh is the poor play from Ben Roethlisberger particularly last week\nI really didn't step up very early in the question becomes\nDoes he have more of an elbow problem then we know about because what he's really not been doing well a song that deep all that we're used to seeing him V. so accurate with\nAnd is there an issue with with that or that that we you know he's not going to disclose you know Ben is he he's never been one did be shy about injuries after they heal ... we're going to find out something down the road is going to be a little bit\nDifferent than what's been reported yeah big band is definitely been escaping some criticism I think part of that 'cause he's leading the league and passing yards I mean it's it's when you although he's not\nA ... I guess performing in a way that are in the wind calm is showing right on the field and the typically\nAre I mean he's leading a league I saw many turnovers turnovers yeah the turnovers our bat Atari you can't turn of all over and are are you certainly can't turn on or turn of all the way you defense is not creating turnovers and helping you out a so there's there's definitely a some some criticism for big band or some criticism from my time on there certainly criticism and keep butler but\nUh I think before we all just power onto the Steelers and say hey you know we we're we're not going anywhere to season's over uh let's see what we do here today I think a lot on the line\nOr we get back to five hundred a record and uh you know uh it's we're very capable very capable ripping off a series when this is radio you have to overreact when you\nHe's about one more segment from them taking that hamburger back to the new\nBut but I got to ask you and we're gonna keep your one more just over on top of the NFL but can't McKinley I'm really all about urban community about the community by the city about a town anywhere in America and obviously\nNot to during the rust belt but they too have gone through some tough times because of manufacturing and I'm trying to get people back to work and I have so many times people of all walks of life races religions no matter who they are if you put them back to work in working class middle class jobs\nYou got a better community and it's been a long time since I've been to Canada in\nThe late nineties where are they right now on the radar and how do you see them progressing I Want you to think about that give you a few seconds during the break we'll come back I Want to get a part of what's happening in ... right now and what's going on for our friends across the border in eastern Ohio still a big part of this region and who we are\nAnd the thing that always blew me away when I was doing play by play in that part of the world but there were a lot of Steeler fans out there and there were a lot of Cleveland brands of fans round fans out there but we all had that one thing in common we wanted to work one of those\nTake care of our families and we wanted to enjoy a football teams and that's what this region was built on that's what our motel did years ago after the Rudy family is still doing today and obviously the browns are back it I Love to see the fact that Jimmy ... company or seeming to getting\nBack on the right track because when you have a team like Cleveland well that rich history heading in the right direction it's\nGood for the NFL and it gives a lot of people and the regional\nAnd especially guy are brown fans who deserves some winning seasons except when they play the Steelers\nThis is a little bit protective bought a home equity line of credit printed by me Camille rent them home equity loan officer and that it's in bank we all have our home renovation which led and now at the time to check things out\nThat because that is a banking offer a new home equity line of credit customers are lowest rates of the season and Lois four point five percent a PR when you apply now realize new possibilities like a new breakfast board and new addition for your family's new edition\nOr new entertainment area outside whether you're investing in your home or just want to have money set aside he gives you accept the funds when you need it\nA lot of times guys come in and fill in a very dynamically but you but the the they won't do that on for not or they don't have enough talent wide receiver I think breeders are pretty good at running back\nA butt out for more it's kind of been around journeyman running back I mean the sense that the defense is not that great um I don't have a lot of excitement there they're playing the cardinals today or what kind of expect him to lose so\nThat a dog [laughter] not bad you know we're going to want to watch that I was in my backyard I turned a blind now Richard\nSherman who I think get back in the day and and maybe still has little gas weapon attack was the best the best and we remember the super bowl and Russell Wilson to get out of Wisconsin yeah you know you keep thinking for as long as he's around there's hope but everybody in Seattle pretty much said it's rebuilding for them is it rebuilding for Seattle these\nAh yeah yeah I mean at least defensively it is I think as long as you have a franchise quarterback you feel like you've got a chance\nAt least to sneak into the playoffs and it's kind of sometimes the trouble is when you got a quarterback this as good as Russell Wilson he'll probably win seven games and you won't get the top in draft pick you know but uh uh defensively yeah they they they definitely um have lost you know pretty much all the legion a booming and we kind of saw\nOur Earl commas go out flamboyantly with the\nYou know my fingers from the I think ah living on bell looked at him going down with an injury and you know this man I I think lately um bell he could have done it better could have had a better PR firm but I understand where he's coming from you have to get the getting while they're getting\nIs good [noise] yeah you do especially at that position I mean at any other position you might argue a little bit but at at the position he plays a has a shorter life spans and if there are so I mean I understand we're let me also has the Steelers fan I'm not happy about it because I Want to win football games I can almost care less about the Fifteen or twenty or ... you make of the field but the\n... from his perspective I understand the John explained to me how\nSitting out and passing up fourteen million dollars or if he's coming back after week seventies passing up about six million dollars yeah tell me how he's ever going to make that money back well I think it comes down to this um coming down the guaranteed money in a contract or so if you look at what a tiger early got\nIn the off season of course girl is younger than Libya um okay so you're saying well I'll I'll I'll flavor in one year deal for fourteen million but if I get hurt\nAt twenty seven twenty eight years old maybe nobody has given me any guaranteed money after this maybe it's all\nFor someone that when their lives are only three and a half years running back in the NFL you can almost guarantee they're not\nThere is a place called Lloyd's of London you may have heard the I Know I Know I mean you could get better or anything [noise] you gotta go and make some money you know when you talk about short lifespan but you're talking to your money is an NFL agent sure and I like to get it I get it\nBoss I get it now I'm just going to let you because you've been so gracious to hang out with this man John ... if there's anybody looking for somebody even when I decided to write off into the sunset you got the job\nI listen um before I let you go to some of the things that are intriguing Tom Brady five hundred touchdown passes in his career there were ready to write his epitaph they look\nStrong against a or the Colts on Thursday night or Miami are they for real or Carson when Suzie strong enough to get them back\nAnd do what Nick Boles did I mean a lot of things happening in the NFL and if I were the Steelers maybe go after Larry Fitzgerald in at least give them a chance to maybe one or the super bowl before he retires one of the greatest players ever the former panther so what else in the NFL's got you interested well\nI guess the patriots are always the seminal story in the league I mean it's kind of hard to avoid them as they you know you know when twelve games go to the playoffs every year I'm definitely not overweight for them the dolphins are certainly not for real I'm not I'm not buying\nReal I'm not I'm not buying that bind anybody out of that at a division beyond the patriots I mean I think a a Tom Brady gives you an edge that are no other quarterback Tom Brady and build ... and it just it it it's one or two I think it's it's not just one of them\nAre they give you an edge and nobody else does I'm concerned about Philly um I think there are good football team or but again the NFC is tough and I think the Vikings are kinda got a a a rough start to the season and I wouldn't be shocked today as Minnesota\nOr rolls over the Philadelphia ... who's your favorite of this this most recent quarter back class it was it's a pretty big it was a big quarterback classroom and kind of like they could to the class of eighty three with marine on those guys out who's your favorite not out of that group and have they lived up to what you expected well I'll\nTell you I'm a combine watching his way too early to to to to jump to any conclusions but my favorite of wall is Josh Allen I really like to think he's got a big time army he can move around I think you know the Buffalo Bills or may may have something there and obviously there I mean Donald is good and and Baker Mayfield definitely\nBattery went home even though he's not the same class yeah hey we're going to see what he's made up against Jacksonville 'cause they got a pretty good defense ... what makes him so good and you know what and reread setting them on a a a a satellite radio broadcast NFL Network and I thought he really was\nRight on the money he said when he saw him play he reminded him a lot and I said this last week about young Brett Farr who could improvise and there was like in the backyard and they had the athletic ability to overcome just about anything throw off of any foot from any angle and obviously they want to throw the ball left handed as he did last week on a regular basis which still\nHas made this guy such a big splash in the NFL\nMy goodness I mean he he is he is so town I mean the arm talent just pops off\nOf the screen when you watch them play uh he's got some mobility but he didn't really run I mean you know he and he he's also got weapons I think it'd be grateful that you you go to a a coach like Andy Reid who's who's made a career out of uh making quarterback look better than they actually are I think he did that for a long time and\nUh he's been doing that in Kansas City to Alex Smith had the best season of his career or last year in Kansas City so he's definitely the great situation\nBut arm talent is there and he makes great decisions or a similar to like a ... Barbara big band you know or he can always improvise and come up with something special uh I really do like ... ... I didn't mention him 'cause he wasn't in a class with a ... you talk about young quarterback was probably my favorite it'd be ... homes\nI tell you guys you you you mentioned that left hand to pass it he ... to a game early on you know I've been doing my stadium tour into those games in pre games\nWatch quarterbacks will not be you know the the set of quarterbacks part of that warm up reference or is actually throwing ten or Fifteen balls with their opposite hand that right yeah and it's amazing but it and that's that's their free practice routine in their free game routine they always have to\nKind of try to get a little bit of that down as a just in case I'm scrambling going the wrong direction and I can't get it out with one in just ... ... and obviously it's not going to be an NFL quality path but it's something that they do work\nYeah yeah [noise] listen for job man hey thanks for having me I had a black hole factor for one o'clock game here again when they're home we enjoy Greg's going to pick up your tap\nThanks rather ex guys good studies like these young man that was not a nice little retreat on how what is the quality of our broadcast they'll tell you that also makes you realize in the big picture we're not that significant that\nHe did a great job really did a good job with a short break we got a lot of stuff we have to get through penguins and fit and golf and then we're going to get right to the top of the hour walk the line with Ted are no and that will be just in about twenty minutes\nYou know we're rivers casino on the north shore of Pittsburgh before the Steelers right now a three point favorite checking on the Atlanta Falcons good morning\nSmyrna beach where we live in a great town where we work around the town we covered butter and that that\nI watch law Rasmussen roast Ryan tablets your oldest when he did oh what's going on or turn the award winning\nNews radio has Whitey Katie gay speedier tonight after a news we've seen it in one man and a friend request God\nA few days ago someone calling themselves God started sending me random friends suggests just\nUpside down I don't believe in which just got to ... hours a day it's way\nOffering to add on a new NPR yes Los Angeles twelve million in diamonds are still [noise] the opposite of what the next chance for too much\nLos Angeles has a seizure community Madam Secretary can see that will shatter the English\nWorld washer you feel pressure\nAmount of secretary season for me of a new drama God for a new NPR yes Los Angeles CBS tonight\nTonight you want to hear their you know Judy Judy ATV for duty or your TV news it all up and\nEnergy we know you never think about electricity but electricity and all we ever thinking out because it's our mission to make it better for you when they get home\nHas more choices for your energy supply than the utility ... from ... options to plant that help you get back to the community for Clinton details license information and full terms and conditions that pick an R.

Tomlin the bills getting the points correct\nYeah right I I like the way you're thinking they're a had a chance to visit with some of our Buffalo Bills guys this weekend and it was a they got an e complex up there and are hosting the titans I I had a chance to find out that these guys are really ready for this one\nI Would be surprised if the bills don't actually win this game so I'm picking buffalo a dam of course has tightened so he and are going to butt heads on that one Kenny who do you like\n[noise] I like the titans in this game I really liked the way they're playing I think it's gonna be a tough game point could come into play but I think the titans touched down so I've got to go with them\nGiants getting six and a half not enough to get a touchdown but they believe they will need some help so the giants getting six and a half say the people who do the book in Las Vegas taking on Carolina so I'm going to take the giants getting six and a half I think it's just enough to get them over the Baltic the points definitely\nFor the giants really struggled last week with the safe at at New York and uh I I was surprised that I I think that there still is something in the tank with Peyton Manning so I'm going to go on my theory that that was a fluke or that I couldn't believe my lion eyes watching them so badly last week so I'm going to take the giants bam has Carolina\nSorry go ahead teddy [noise] uh I like Carolina I think that what I see it the giants is what they are I have to you as rosy as you guys are with a I'm a giants fan\nBut I I just don't see it not going up against Cam Newton and the crew so I'm going to go Panthers giving away the point\nThis question is how far the Broncos fall and this is the pick 'em game against the jets Broncos\nYeah it is a an unusual especially as good as the Broncos defenses [noise] um so I Am ... I was surprised that that being the line now so we have to do is figure out who's gonna win would have to worry about which in this one but I'm picking Denver them also in Denver what about you teddy\nI like the jets at home uh I think they're going to ...\nUh I think they're going to play on top of the Broncos [noise] you know traveling across country didn't show much uh I got to go with the jets I think they're starting to play better and better\nAll right the well the real Packers up please stand up another pick 'em game against Detroit Detroit shuffling or back for a little bit sitting some people inserting some people I I'm Still going to have to go with Aaron Rodgers even though I'm a big fan of Matthew Stanford and I think he is one of the premier\nFranchises quarterbacks in the leg I just think he needs some better talent around it but in this pick 'em game I'll go with the fact that\nI'm with you rub artist out on the way in here today that a Green Bay has or I'm Sorry Aaron Rodgers has thrown twenty three touchdowns in no interceptions\nIn the last series of contest with the NFC Central so uh uh he's he's got their number I like Aaron Rodgers and the Packers today a lot\nA bam also has Green Bay Ari cutting\nAs scary I meditate Green Bay also revised probably flipped to the other stuff\nThat you're at [laughter] All right job in getting six taking on the Cincinnati Bengals I don't know why anybody in their right mind couldn't see a little light at the end of the tunnel I think Ryan tannahill is proven that he's worthy of that starting job\nSo just for the sheer fact are shaking things up I'm going to go with the dolphins getting a points\nAnd I like to have things shaking and nuts third myself for all but uh in this situation I'm going to go with this third factor and take the bangles or bam also has Cincinnati\nYeah like Cincinnati um the dolphins are quote coach Green Bay are what we thought they were um and I got to go up and go start playing well\nMaybe one of the greatest lines in the history of coach speak Danny green they are what we thought they were they are what we thought they are All right let's move on now next game which the raiders and they're getting five against the LA Chargers so I Will take the chargers giving the points\nI I I also like the charges are still Philip Rivers guy um I I was all about John grew to earlier on ... or something seems ... I'm I'm starting to worry that he may have lost his magic ... the chargers bam has the raiders\nSee here's what happens then you got to believe this we were talking about the McGregor fight okay when you get a little money and you're in a competitive sport in most of the time he literally and figuratively you're getting punched in the mouse once you start to have the five star hotel service and you get to the champagne caviar and you're wearing a five thousand dollar a money sewage\nIt's hard to kind of recapture the magic on how you use to actually eat you know taking shots the face of for breakfast you know so I think that's the only reason why Conor McGregor said no moss and he kept out and I think coach ... I'm not saying going to give up\nBut he's had a pretty good life in in recent years being in the booth during a good job getting paid well doing endorsements and now he's in there's got to study film and spent his entire day at a place that he used to sleep at it now he'd better be home you know hanging out with the family so I'm sure he's experiencing a little bit right now to say the least I probably right\nFrom the you know I think that football coaches summer like we were talking about Supreme Court justices or they don't ever retire because they love what they did Ashton yeah ... and I think that maybe that's what it is I think Reuben from watching the film anyway\nBut now he's he's got to figure out a way to to utilize it other than just talk about it so I'm you know that that's a that's a crazy part of that\nIs what you're telling me roots a bitter Ginsburg is going to take over the the job when he resides that what you're telling me notorious RPG yeah yes yeah I Love her okay ... who do you like in that game that I kind of went on a uh I I've chargers in band picked the ... the writer okay Jennie [noise]\nUh I got to go with the chargers back here all the talk about gardening but [noise]\nUh he he's here for two years from now has its he's here for the show uh I like I liked the chargers anyway uh I Would have picked on but I I'm not I'm not that impressed with what Easter\nI teddy we're going to take a couple of moments you to give you a chance to talk about the U.S see two twenty nine [noise]\nWell I think you hit it I think after a while you hang around

handwriting dime and Chuck no time I Am going to take the Steelers giving the points [noise]\nWell I'm not doing it because I'm a home or I just believe that the Steelers really have their back against the wall and at home\nI I find it hard to believe that they're not going to be able to stand up and in when this game I think it's been since Nineteen eighty six that the Steelers have been oh and three to start a season at home and I don't look for this year to be one of those years that that uh uh reverses that so [noise]\nUm I like the Steelers today or even though they are giving three points the Atlanta Falcons\nBam has selected the falcon\n... take all the time you want to go ahead [laughter]\nI think uh I think that's just the week that the bed and maybe get together a they've ... they've struggled or the first two games or a B has a really bad and getting the numbers that it used to getting and I think against a bang up Atlanta Falcons or get some this week\nUh and I think it's going to be a struggle because the balconies have a good quarterback they've got a good receiving group um but I think that's just a week that it as soon as a beef starts break loose everything else is going to start breaking news\nUh so I liked I liked the or the Steelers in this game [noise] ah I Wish they weren't\nGiving points because they haven't proven at this point that they should be given widespread really three points is just basically a home field advantage so uh if you look at it it's pretty much push game but I like the Steelers and this game I like a bee\nHaving a breakout weekend with a big numbers and and uh my boy Jesse James come in and filling in for um so I'm saying\nThey be Jesse do for it\nTo do you think that the Steelers defensively are going to be able to do enough or teeth to get to that Ryan in is that the key is is pressure more of a key than being able to cover or those things obviously they go hand in hand but uh do do you think the seals can get the met Ryan enough to cause problems I think\nThey're going to have to because he's got two great receivers of course Willie Jones being the primary target but\nUh they're going to have put some pressure on him in order to get those are the defense of backfield shot the they have not played well they're gonna have to step up this week it rarely put some pressure let these guys get their coverage make make them throw the ball faster not sit back\nAnd that pocket as Matt Ryan will kill you if you let them do that and he's got the receivers to do with so that's going to be one of the keys to the games can they get pressure on Matt Ryan so we'll see that but I think it's it's I think the Steelers have been bouncing around being good\nOr they just haven't pulled that trigger yet I think this

[noise]\nWelcome and you know great to have you uh we're talking about mortgages tonight of course a Mike Henry with us senior vice president of residential lending adult or bank\nAnd Mike when it comes to getting that mortgage many people have a lot of different questions uh but the one that people focus on first and foremost his interest rates and because that's ultimately what matters and I want to know where do things stand with dollar bank\nWell I'm an interest rates are very interesting time for interest rates because we saw the Federal Reserve last week raised interest rates again that raised the primary eight to five and a quarter percent but here we are still at four point six to five on the thirty year fixed rate over so we've seen the fed hike interest rates it's a couple of times this year\nOr the economy is growing stronger than anticipated\nSo there's a lot of growth happening we've seen recent activity in the stock market hitting highs once again and\nHere we are with mortgage rates that really are fairly stable now we're getting into somewhat of a flat yield curve meaning you know short term rates and long term rights are getting closer and closer together\nAnd that's not necessarily good for the log into things and we're starting to see some pressure here but as of right now it's still at four and five eight percent in fact why\nDo you think it's staying as low as it is considering the short term rates are climbing\nWell it is simply because there is not just two things either a not a lot of inflation in the market that some of it um and then there's a lot of there's some money now coming out of bonds but money was continually flowing into bonds I mean if you look at our ten year treasury today\nUm and in some cases that may be true but um it's you know if you look at the programs we have available that there are many ways to purchase a home without having a large downpayment without having a great credit score\nUm you have to have a decent credit score you have to have relatively good credit\nRight now the great credit score is\nA great credit score but really I guess would be anything seven forty or higher than fifty is a perfect credit score you rarely see things in the AIDS but occasionally we do um the average credit score on our conventional loans has actually around seven sixty that's what the average will we see\nI'm Elle interesting you know it'd be really you know good credit gr Greg ...\nWhat do you have to be out of seven hundred to get a get a loan absolutely had to do ... absolutely have to be in the six hundred to get a law\nI'm pretty close we are you can go six twenty for conventional loan six twenty is the minimum credit score\nSo there's probably some credit issues if you have a six twenty credit score it could be a lot of credit could be some delinquent sees than of to me that six twenty six forty bucket you're still eligible for conventional financing it's six twenty it's not an automatic that you're approved a but you know if if your debt incomes good in your employment histories good\nOr we can verify everything you have sufficient assets free downpayment closing costs we can you can get a mortgage with six twenty of F ha financing which typically we look at if your credit scores blow six eighty or below six sixty\nBecause the interest rates that that front F ha alone are better at that level\nOr they'll go down to a minimum of five eighty credit score so you have some definite derogatory credit some potential collection accounts um recent derogatory credit but it still makes you it somewhat eligible\nFor an F. A. J. mortgage that's available um our rent no more prone to we have no defined credit score ... minimum\nUh but typically you you need to be in that five eighty or higher range um so it you know you can get started I mean the better your interest rate or the better your\nCredit score is the better your interest rate isn't certainly the easier it is to get into the property okay but certainly you don't have to have a seven forty or higher Chris our average credit score on enough ha loan as\nIs six eighty aren't as I'm listening to you I'm thinking okay the credit score doesn't have to be great just decent yeah credit in five eighty or above and something can happen or the down payment we're going to talk about can be very very low a very very close not zero yes\nIt sounds to me though that ... may be most important is\nSo do you have a work history ... news shows that even working consistently for a period of what up to two years\nYet we live on long as we're looking for a two year employment history doesn't necessarily have to be with the same employer um it just can't be in radically different lines of work let's say you're in a salaried\nWorker at an an an an accounting firm and you turn around and became a car salesmen and a hundred percent commission we need to see a good long history of being a commission car salesperson 'cause we have no income to calculate or any history to calculate\nUm if you're a salary employer and you've been doing it for two years or an hourly employee you know we're gonna average income so we're looking for a two year history of employment and you're right the income is really the number one driver and qualify if we can't demonstrate inability to repay and we calculate that are using that income ratios\nThan it does matter what your credit scores um you get out you could have excellent credit and have bad debt to income ratio is\nAnd it's difficult to be approved for a long\nAnd the income that you have coming in to the home doesn't necessarily have to be work either\nNo absolutely not it can be it can be anytime it was if you're retired it can be retirement income it can be pension Social Security if you have Social Security now have Social Security disability something of that nature that's qualifying income we're looking for things that are going to last for at least three years or more\nSo regularly taking money out of your four one K. if you're at that point\nYeah absolutely um that would be the depletion of an asset like they were using money you're taking out so if you're using the formula for ... percent a year of your IRA retirement savings four oh one K. as your annual income as long as we can document that we can use that qualify and we often do\nUm can you use disability income absolutely yeah as long as it's I'm considered permanent disability if that's your sole income or the the income that we're using to qualify for the loan or part of the income\nIt can't be a temporary disability because it has the ability to end could\nParents use the disability income of a child that they are intending to get for at least three to five years as income to qualify them for a long\nYeah as long as it's a like a set a permanent disability and it it's kind of geared towards that household so it'd be a minor but yes yes and use that income\nNow what happens if you have mom who's on Social Security and she's living with you are you able to use her income to help qualify for that long um\nIn some cases you can there is one particular loan program the one I mentioned earlier home ready which allows that type of income to be an offsetting factor if your debt to income ratios are tightly can offset it without having her\nOn the mortgage or a homeowner she doesn't have to own a home or be on the mortgage and if we document that\nCorrectly you can use that income as an offsetting factor too that that didn't come Russia's that that you have because it is household is money coming into the home to help support it so um it's reasonable to look at that and that's only for that particular program where that's\nConsidered allowable you have to be you don't have to be a first time homebuyer but your total income cannot exceed\nOne hundred percent of the hub median income to qualify for that program and that would not include that grandmother or mother or whoever it might be um it would it would be the income or using to qualify you for the lone okay we don't consider that income to qualify it's an offsetting factor\nNow what about income as individuals that wouldn't necessarily be on the note is there a scenario for that too yeah\nYeah ... that we know we need them on the no they don't have to be on they don't have to take ownership of the proper OK okay but every bar or assigning the notes\nSo and they don't have to be an owner of the property they just promise to be a part of paying the note on the property\nYeah right in fact you know as a lender and the more on that note the merrier but um [laughter] you know there's more but um\nYeah so a good case would be if somebody buying their first home and the parents are coast signing they don't have to take ownership of the property but they would be would be using their income and their debt mhm and qualifying the primary who's going to be living in the property\nAnd even though you're going to have multiple people on the note and use those different incomes in order to uh come up with enough money to afford the loan you can't do that with multiple people on in order to get a better credit score that is going to order to qualify for that long\nWhoever regardless of the number of borrowers on Malone we're going to use the lowest credit score of so if you have to three people and the\nOne credit scores seven forty one seven Twenty one seven hundred and we're going to use the seven hundred and processing underwriting end price pricing alone\nSo we're always going to use the the the lower credit score now when we're on credit we actually get three credit scores for each bar where we're getting one from Experian Equifax transfer union\nAnd like I can tell you generally speaking all three of them are different maybe not by great margins but a lot of them they're different all the time and we use the middle score to determine what your credit scores\nHave you have any

supposed to do you ever see the aces issues as soon as it was sort of washes over the radio that\nIf ha allows us to pay up to six percent of the closing costs in prepaid\nI'm assuming they get up to six percent at the bar or has to have a minimum contribution to go back to the VA you can have zero percent down and the seller has really really technically no limitations on how much they can pay as far as they're closing costs they can actually this is interesting about the and we don't know that just don't see as often\nBut but it can occur where the seller can actually pay debt the veteran has that may help him qualify Sophie had a alone of some kind\nThe seller could actually pay that loan off to help them purchased a home\nThey could to it let's say they had two months left on their lease get actually pay that two month to month lease that this is VA loan and it's a little more complicated of a level here but it's technically that's how\nGood a VA mortgages for veterans in the benefit that they have is really very good and should be you know looked at a it's not utilized by all veterans and probably something they consider but um\nThose are the kinds of things to do at the VA mortgage off a third of the government backed loans is three and a half percent down and you have to have three and a half percent into the transaction or the seller can pay the rest of your cost 'em in the cellar does and you have five or six percent of the purchase price you would need\nUnder the purchase price you would need for closing costs pretty page and could be a size seven percent\nBut as a minimum of three and a half percent down that I can also be that three and a half percent\nCan be a gift from a relative blood relative you're allowed to get that so you don't necessarily have your own savings a first time homebuyer often gets a gift from their parents to help with the purchase of a home ah so that's totally acceptable so you don't have to have this great savings account minimum credit score on an F ha loaned us five eighty\nSo anything six eighty and under is one eight to ... percent higher interest rate than today's rates and actually F ha race or a little bit lower than conventional rates so it was a lot of benefits one eighth yeah that's the so for that they were four and five eight something conventional loan\nOf the ethic the F ha interest rate is four and a half percent\nIf your credit scores blow six eighty its foreign five eight percent so it's very little change in your on your credit\nSays over anyone who's thinking okay my credit scores and all that great it's going to be really expensive for me that's just not the case either no not\nAt all in fact this is quite the opposite now there isn't half ha mortgage insurance um which you have to pay and that's something you pay for the life of alone you can you can you cannot get rid of it\nIf you have an older F ha loans just in case there's a listener hasn't older F ... some of them you can still have it removed it just depends on how long ago you took it out but recently um you know the rules have changed for the last five years or so that you cannot have that removed\nUm and maybe even longer than five years but it's for a life of loans so that's a disadvantage compared to conventional but you have good interest rates low down payment higher ability for the cellar to assist you with dump with closing costs sellers cannot pay any of your down payment\nYour downpayment can't be borrowed it can be borrowed against the secure asset\nWhich you know it would be basically for most maybe of alone against their four O. one K. you can do that do recommend it but you can do it [laughter] um so that that's F ha and we have to first ... and there's first of all F ha you do not have to be a first time homebuyer and there is no income limitation only limitation is the amount you can borrow\nAnd that's in to I'd have to look it up I don't know the exact number off my head up slower than conforming limits where conventional loans\nThere's four fifty three\nIt's lower than out on a ...\nWe have a written a more program which is the first time homebuyer program which it has to features to it it's either zero percent down where it's three percent down\nIn the way we divide that is if you're a low income which means you're you're fifty percent of the hub median income which is going to be around thirty to thirty three thousand dollars a year and a household income\nWe have zero percent down program no mortgage insurance no private mortgage insurance the pie and my you hear about which is a monthly premium that you pay if you're putting less than twenty percent down there is no private mortgage insurance on this loan interest rates are same interest rates we've been talking about four and five eight percent today\nI'm great proud of you have to be the first time homebuyer mhm and from there you can the seller can pay up to five percent of the purchase price towards your clothes and cars so you can pretty much get in there for almost nothing nice um we have matching grant programs that are available for that type of loan or if you ... that we will match some of your savings\nUm you you work through our program will will match up to three dollars for every dollar you put in Sioux\nFor up to a thousand on your side in three thousand on our side which gives you four thousand dollars available um that's done to our community development group and it's a program you enroll in as a matched savings or said that there's a lot of pass to get in with nothing down shirts\nThen with nothing down a shirt that income level\nThe second version is three percent down and that's it at that as if you're at eighty percent of the hub median income household income basically the same loans just three percent down versus zero percent down so you have to have a large a down payment but still very low\nUm so we haven't even talked about five percent while conventional financing\nI can tell you the average bar or putting somewhere around ten percent down so when you hear the statements and there's still recent surveys that show many renters more than forty five percent believe you have to have twenty percent down in order to purchase a house I'm\nYou know to avoid things like ... or you won't get approved for it because of your your your debt to income or your credit and it's just simply not true the ... the average down payment we see on the purchases ten percent\nIn one of the reasons why it's not true\nIs because it is true in other markets is it the cost of a home is a on a\nTypical home is much lower here than it is in markets where they're creating these stories New York mhm Washington and write a guard or LA San Francisco Seattle where they get into a home you were in a jumbo loan just to get into just anything\nAnd some of these more yeah I mean if you're looking at you know Silicon Valley I mean our average purchased prices across the region is around two twelve that's the average purchase price the median is lower than that\nUm I Believe in well not Silicon Valley San Diego comes to mind because I looked at up recently it was six Seventy six so that's a jumbo financing right out of the gate for most people\nThat we do five percent down loans up to five hundred thousand and that's that exist in those markets so you have to have ten percent down to your about\nSix fifty you know once you get above that you really need to have twenty percent down if you get above a million and a half to click on the thirty to forty percent down but that's not uncommon in some of those areas run or in Manhattan I'm you know a million and a half dollar\nOp is maybe maybe a two bedroom maybe maybe you know I remember
