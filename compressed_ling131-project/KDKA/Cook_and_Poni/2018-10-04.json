I think Murray is is in good shape the goal tending situation is as deep as it's ever been a ... they look to be of course that's all on that's all on paper that's all pre season we'll see what the shakes out during the regular season but this game\nUh I don't know who will ... necessarily set the tone for the season but it sure is a great way to start this season now the penguins and the capitals which go way back in one of the great rivalries in hockey for sure\nOh yeah absolutely it's you know everybody get or be fired up certainly for this one and it's going to be interesting to see like I said ah especially watch that third line tonight and I think you're right about that Murray I think he's going to have a bounce back season and I think\nSeason and I think to their their backup situation they're in good hands with that I'm not been famous for the last couple of years while everybody's you know been talking about trust in jury\nCasey Smith has been a better gold tender for them in the organization you know down at Wilkes Barre and up here last year played really well he's just the better more mature\nOlder gold tender that can handle the backup situation so I think uh with the Smith is a backup all a jar gets healthy they'll go back down to the American hockey league and everything will be good at\nIt we know we're gonna have to wait and see how Jack johnson since ... fits into the plant here too and and this this kid this finished that they signed out of out of Finland or as a free agent ... coal\nAh [laughter] that's pretty easy to remember [laughter] he's been really he's been really good and training camp and\nIt looks like Brian doable is going to be able to go to night so if he's if he's healthy in the long run they'll send a recall of a you know down and get some time but this was a kid that's going to play a lot with this club is a season was officer keep an eye out for him as well\nRyan Miller is going to have a lot of fun saying recall ah [laughter]\nWe a he's probably working on that [laughter] no one would be I don't\nThink it'll be on the line up tonight so he's got some time\nWell ... you know and you you what you've been saying about this myth you've been saying for a long time long before anybody else did so I I take your judgment on that one thing that you know the capitals have have worked very hard to finally win the cup\nOne thing they've not been through now and the penguins have many times is the defense of\nThe cup in the in the outgoing the next season and here they are at the start of it now granted as you say\nThey got off to a great started yesterday in Boston\nBut now you've got all these games in front of 'em and everybody draws a circle around the capitals on the schedule and says let's go get 'em\n[noise] yeah they definitely have a bull's eye on their back to and\nThe thing to hurt the pain was tremendously last year the lot of people you know don't understand is the schedule maker wasn't very kind to them look back to back off but you know coming off the second straight very very long season all the games or that was the real killer now I haven't had an opportunity to really take a look\nAt the Capitol schedule maybe I'll do that at some point today but you know I Want to see how many back to ... they have I Want to see a you're you're right how how they defend a everybody's going to be shooting for the ... of course have been a good team over last several years don't take anything away from them but now\nYou know there is defending champ so and again tonight's gonna be a test because this is the first of however many back to back they're going to have and they're going to be facing the team that's a little bit upset loosen\nToo long [laughter] you know here\nIt's partly our season early but I think starting their offseason early um you know certainly going to help the penguins recover and like I said if you've got said\nYou know chomping at the bit you know you you know you know everybody\nElse is just going to fall in love with them yeah well hey and a what\nA season's going to be ten Douglas is with us from Ninety three seven the fan here on ... you got this game tonight and then of course the Canadians on Saturday we should just always fun and good hockey and then the Golden Knights are on the eleventh would slurry back in town so uh talk about getting the seasonal five to three\nImportant exciting hockey games it's it's a great time for the fans to\nDo yeah yeah and it's going to be good to see the flower jamming bought you know what he did for that team last year my and actually\nWhat he's done for the whole organization out there is just tremendous than ease that you know that kind of guy and it's you know I think it's been a also when you think about last year I think it was a little bit\nThat year I think it was a little bit tough on you know Matt Murray to kind of\nYou know he didn't have\nFor a round the cow to help them and you know he was yeah lost his father he had all that to deal with last year and you know now having gone through all that\nAnd having you know for a bit away for a whole year now you know Murray is probably a lot more comfortable not having to live in that shadow and you know we'll see you know how that all works out and know quite frankly you\nMarc Andre Fleury after what he did last\nYear you know he's he's got he's got to do that again\nYou know can you know obviously you know expansion team gold as far as the as they want nobody expected that but you know now they've got to repeat that performance you'll see how that plays out in Vegas so we're going to get an early look at that\nWho do you pick I Know it's too early but no one will remember in the part I find those negative is covering year ... who's going to be who do you think\nWow I'm you know I like I said uh you know about the gym parade you know I I think I think this team it's you know Stanley Cup champion or bust in
