affectionately refer to as tea to help kind of guide me through this process a lot of things I Want to talk about today and and one of the things that really struck me over the last couple of days is that we've seen a national spike\nIn phone calls to sex assault hotlines I'm as a result of\nThe Supreme Court hearings and I wanted to speak with a local experts\nTo talk about what we see happening here in our region and whether and what it is about hearing someone tell their story that makes other women want to say need to know if I can figure out everything I Need to do Alison and are you there\nI Am ... thanks so much for joining us a for those folks who don't know Allison hall\nIs the executive director of Pittsburgh action against rape and she's agreed to come on and help us put some things in perspective and Alison let me ask you a question because I mentioned that we saw a nationally is bike and phone calls to hotlines have we seen that here in Pittsburgh\n[noise] yes yes we have um par has increased I'm almost double the calls last week during the day\nRepresentation stop the IRS from targeting within twenty four hours called the hotline now at eight hundred to nine five ten forty six that's\nEight hundred to nine five ten forty six\nThere is help for those of you who oh ten thousand dollars or more but it's important that you take action before these programs change called a special tax representation hotline now at eight hundred to nine five ten forty six eight hundred to nine five ten forty six\nOn the radio I listen to us any time [noise]\nHow 'bout that out\nRate says that we're seeing locally here but it's the same thing is happening across the country and in his in laws for their\nHotlines as a result of sexual assault and\nThen they see a direct correlation between that increasing calls and what we saw happening last week at the Supreme Court hearings I Want to hear so many things I Want to talk about that I don't know how you keep yourself focused because I'm also wondering who watch it in a gubernatorial debate last night\nIt was a different kind of debate Alex trip back was the moderator and it was just I\nLike most debates I've ever seen or been involved in but before I get to the debate yep jumping around here I Want to talk a little bit about a press conference that happened yesterday a presidential press conference\nAnd for me it just tapped into a lot of things how our president talk to reporters and how he spoke to women reporters in particular said before we get into that conversation I watch it if you have inherited already\nI Want you to take a listen to the back and forth between the president and some of the reporters\nAt the press conference yesterday question yeah\nGo ahead sure\nShe's shocked that I picked her side of the state of shock [laughter] I'm not thinking of that so I Know you're not thinking you never did no go ahead go ahead\nThrough several questions on trade I'd like to tell you don't have it all you do have knew how to use me do you have a question of dread well you know one or two more questions when several questions if you don't do that does not identify somebody is before you excuse me don't do this\nAll right let's talk about a couple of things here ah first of all\nNot thinking you never do is that a president should address and member\nOf the national presidential press corps\nAnd then to go to another reporter and say that she can't ask the question that she wants\nLet's be real clear when anyone has a press conference whatever questions the media wants to ask are fair game that's the whole idea of a press conference that the whole concept of a press conference\nSo to be told basically well you're not you're not asking about what I Want to talk about so I'm not taking your question how then do we get information across\nAs the media and what'd you think about him saying you know you're not thinking you never do\nThat just sounded like such a personal attack a personal affront to me\nUm and when you start looking at you can almost well I think you can paint two pictures one you can take a look at how the president treats the media overall and yes I take that personally because I Am a member of the media\nUm and we're just trying to do our jobs a lot of times when I'm Out covering news stories\n... TV you get heckled by people and they say get outta here we don't want to ... year we didn't invite you\nAnd my standard response is always you know what I'm just here trying to do my job\nI don't come on your job and bother you why are you coming on my job and bothering me am I wrong for saying that one eight six six three nine one one o two oh is our number joining the\nConversation and let me know if you think I mean maybe because I Am a female reporter and I've been in situations where sometimes I was the only woman in the room maybe I'm thinking is all too personally I'm not\nConvinced to that but um I don't know just to hear the president said to another woman you're not thinking you never do and then and then the White House official response came out and\nWhen they released a transcript the transcript said banking not thinking they said the president said thanking so now I'm curious why would the President's Day you're not thinking you never do so what would that be thanking the president\nThinking that President for taking those comments I don't know it seems to me like thinking was actually what was said that's what I heard and I wonder what you think one eight six six three nine one one o two oh I think I Would have been\nTerribly offended in that moment um the the reporter was this area Vega she the network reporter and her initial response was to say excuse\nMe because I think she was done\nBy that come back from the president should she had been done what do you think I was offended by it but I'm Wondering if you were offended by it and if not tell me why tell me why you think that is acceptable behavior\nOne eight hundred I'm Sorry one eight six six three nine one one oh two oh this is the Inside Story did not with Marty Griffin Marty's let me sit in I Am ... and\nI Am so glad to be here I'm Glad to have you with me and uh we have a lot more to do we're here until noon so we have a lot more to cover right here on news radio ten twenty\nCollege I'm going to buy a house or the sovereign says he wants south on top of the hill from ... over thirty ninth street ...\nAvenue and we also have some of emergency room work over on ... avenue between ... and ... avenue in that area is currently blocked off this morning I'll found on route twenty eight traffic is moving\nThe age traffic is moving pretty well for you and your French Miller's not watch for that road construction their mind and south found silence much heavier is that what you make your way from the China hides heading down for Pittsburgh meals with ... cents ... cents right around ... pretty decent shape both and found out found\nOur next AAA traffic on the five to ten thirty five\nSenate Presbyterian senior cannot wear traffic center I'm Kathy ...\nJelly it's almost that time of the year and I know you're somebody who loves to beautify your home from the inside out that's why like Gina drapery and blind factories so imports\nAbsolutely Larry and you know what as a woman I'm not gonna lie I Will use any excuse to update my home and that goes for draperies and blinds and shutters because it's true you want your home to look inviting and beautiful and let Sheena drapery and blind factory is going to help everyone do that\nAnd that's what Lisa and the design team do they can give you an obligation shopping home appointment and consultation you just have to go for one to six six by forty nine hundred or simply book on line at Latina drapery dot com\nAnd what I Love is the majority of those lines are made right here in Pennsylvania and that means cost is lower to use that ...\nCustom window treatments with the personal touch draperies balances and Roman shades too from Latino drapery and blind factory for one to six six by forty nine hundred or a book on line at Latina drapery dot com\nDo you have type one or type two diabetes is your stomach full after just a few bites are overwhelmed by nausea vomiting and abdominal pain\nYou may be suffering from diabetic gastro ... doctors are looking for volunteers for an important research study evaluating and investigation will drug for these symptoms go to my stomach study dot com to see if you qualify\nYou must be at least Eighteen years old have type one or type two diabetes\nAnd have experienced some or all of these symptoms for at least three months study related drugs doctor visits and test will be provided to you at no cost compensation for time travel maybe available for qualified participants for more information and to see if you qualify call for one to four zero seven eight to five six\nOr visit my stomach study dot com that's for one to four zero seven eight to five six or visit my stomach study dot com called today for one to four zero seven eight to five six my stomach study dot com\n[noise] your source where everything is news source for brothers will to rub on but we feel that we want to go to a rally seven or ...

when we talk about how women are treated I Want to hear from some women so I Want to go to first let's see how they figure this out okay we're going to go to Ted in Mount Washington tat are you

see\nSharon are you there Sharon from Stanton Hi to you there I Am Lynn how are you\nI'm was welcomed it is yeah tell me what you're thinking about all this\nWell you know I'm not surprised by what the president ended because he is selling himself could be massage and his and someone that doesn't value or respect women a lot\nI think what people don't understand about the media right now is that you guys that thin line between us and you know a whole lot of craziness and the whole lot of the function that we don't want to see the truth as being told and coming out\nA lot of it as being uncovered by the media and so when we see the president do what he did which is to um Shane\nBasically of email reporter and then his people\nAnd then his people cover it up by misinformation and changing words people want to be very very afraid of things like that that's how you get dictators right that's how you get tyrants\nI think because we live in America we think oh that could never happen here\nBut I have and little by little abs and a lot of people saying the media is despicable the media is a powerful and we have a lot of if we don't like channel can lead to say\nWe can go to W. theory we can go to the BBC we want to be entertained but we can't fault you all for entertainment but we have a lot of options in terms of what we do for\nPeople who have and I can get our news and you know one of the things that makes me absolutely crazy is when people say fake news I mean even sometimes now we're riding down the street and ... a\nDVD Ikle and people were ride past\nDoesn't yeah say news fake news are you kidding me I work hard every day and show do my colleagues we work hard to get to the truth to get to the bottom of it and in that sense it when people just make those general blanket statements a\nLot it's awful scary because it tells you what the president has been doing and it's what parents have done if we repeat something not\nRight if I like about you if you say something about me when we see pictures of let Michael Jackson when he was alive right and you see at one time or two times on he's on the cover you might ignored by the time you are thinking oh well you know going on here\nThat we've had to have and that's what the president has managed to do so you know not\nThat people start to believe it without thinking through it\nAdded on many what they're saying\nHey here though when you go to bed of women\nUh-huh again people are watching when he Shane women reporter people are watching I'm listening to men call and say well just who you're basically just suck it up right but if they have a man that's all they'll let your daughter I'd like to know what they say even\nWell you know that's a whole another conversation too because a lot of

V. show the Inside Story with Mardi Gras and I hope he doesn't tax me and say get the name right the Inside Story with Mardi Gras and Marty's not here today\nBut uh he asked me to sit in feeling for him I'm Glad that I did joining me on the phone right now has run a ...\nShe's an associate professor at Duquesne University school of law and uh let me see Ronnie you're there correct\nI Am I got everything open up that I Need to open up and to Mars apply to me back there\nAnd ask you this because I Know that you spend you have a a big focus in on your career and women and women's issues in the employment around\nAnd I'm Wondering when we look at this whole process that we've seen play out in the last week or so has it been handled differently or would it be handled differently do you think if this were a female Supreme Court justice candidate\n[noise] interesting question um what I Do think that we're saying when it comes to differences and gender is what type of conduct and behavior we ... we accept from men verses women\nSo for example if we look at that particular situation and we look at\nUm Dr Ford Fiesta money and we look at that and at um judge Kavanaugh testimony Dr Ford was collected uh she was calm\nShe was very active all she was deferential she was constantly offering to help and how can she clarify and\nTerrified and is there a better way that she can explain her answers she was quite responsive right if she was asked a question she answered the question um she behaved essentially perfectly\nAnd for that reason really that she is such a credible a witness on the other hand judge Kavanaugh really I mean I I was I was shocked by how much anger a he showed during that\nHearing he came out you know like he really came out angry later he cried he kind of went back and forth between being really worked up and angry and I think everyone who watched the Saturday Night live skit with Matt Damon you know saw\nKind of an exaggerated version that looked like ...\nAnd um and many have commented that we can't possibly imagine a woman behaving that way publicly either giving testimony or trying to assert her right to a job\nAnd not being immediately I'm you know characterize as being hysterical overly emotional\nYou know not capable of having the proper demeanor or um you know controlling herself right and so in that respect I think we are very much saying the difference between what we expect of men are what we think is acceptable specifically\nPrivileged white men uh there are many men who could not\nI I don't think who could come out screaming and yelling the Kavanaugh did maybe that's an overstatement who couldn't come out appearing as angry as Kavanaugh did and that that would be in any way deemed acceptable behavior\nAnd let me ask you one final question before I let you go to this morning because we've also been talking a little bit about\nThe president's press conference yesterday and how some of the women reporters in particular were treated in that environment and some folks kind of said well that's how the president treats everyone for me personally as a woman I felt like it was an attack on female reporters trying to do their job\nSo I don't think that anyone would argue that President Trump has ever seem to show any respect for women so I don't think that his conduct yesterday was inconsistent with what we know about him does he treat women differently than any treatment of course he does\nIf this was the only\nThe only kind of um evidence that we had would we you know if if it was another sitting president who was may be rude or Kurt with a woman reporter would we automatically assume that that means that this president is disrespectful women I don't think so right there you know people can can be hostile to a reporter from time to time\nBut I mean we know that President Trump doesn't isn't respectful of women so that's not really any surprise at all\nNo surprise at all ... associate professor of law\nFirm Duquesne law school thanks so much for joining a bank you mind if I didn't her moves and indeed we are here on the Inside Story Mardi Gras isn't Mardi Gras is

really\nTaking this in ratcheting up the politics of it in the big time way and I don't understand what the end\nOf all this is he's talking about you know the the extreme left the Democrats this is you know what they always wanted to do this has been their play book that there's you know slinging mud and everything else and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah\nNow is you know I'm not a fan of that coming from anybody any party and I certainly am not\nIn a judicial setting which is a fact of like what we're talking about what I really don't get it now and here's why yes yes there was a

go what is wrong with Jeff Flake who is one of those six saying I'm going to sit back and see what the investigation shows that to me is how I'm handling the entire topic this week\n\nAnd\nI find that really somewhat\nBoring band radio to just go back into he said she said last week that's why we got the investigation once you invest\nInvestigation comes out and more pleases replace in front of us

space\n\nGuys telling women what they remember or don't remember is not a good look you know it's coming when you hear\nOh I think she was you know she made a good case she was vulnerable um and I think something happened but maybe not with him and on him and and definitely I feel bad something happen\nHey guys seriously that really looks bad that looks extremely condescending it looks extremely partisan but more importantly it looks as if you're telling a woman\nWho has stepped up to tell her story in a way that even the president considered credible that she's well your pet or on the head and that's not good that's a bad look I heard one too many times I decided to sound off on it\nNow\nAs I was reading this piece about the six ... or a senator says let's keep in mind here that the Dems like Joe Manchin they're vulnerable there in a red state then you've got these three moderate Republicans\n\nLeave St dams running for reelection in states that of course one by\nPresident Trump which are basically doing here two of the three up in the air Republicans you know stick with the party Kevin a window seat and then that allows the red state dams like Joe mansion to cross the aisle\n\nI don't know if you really consider all that courageous or based on\n\nAnything other than pure politics\nBut I'm not so sure that I Do\nMaybe we shouldn't be surprised maybe that has been practiced forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and there's nothing else to say about it\nBut as\nSenator Flake said the other day this investigation should not be about just giving cover\nTo senators to vote one way or the other we need the investigation to find out the best we can what happened or didn't happen so we can\nBe better equipped to make a vote it's not that
