definitely would have looked up to if I was a Native American and I look up to him to this day so I I think that's that's if that's if that's what you called poetic justice I think\nYeah and I'm barely they the the statue of the tribute to him will be\nSix times the size of the mount Rushmore statues um but but it's it's all being paid for by Lee Native American tribes on their own they rejected any federal money from it because of their treatment a and they want the land back I'll even where Mount Rushmore isn't it you know our government's probably not ever going to\nSee the way to do that correctly but ah this this project that they're doing with crazy horse\nIsn't anticipated to be finished for another thirty or forty years it's it's because they they're not using any kind of agree I mean this these are gay oh Americans veterans hanging off the edge of this cliff\nI guess I won't be at that river cutting us through bad but you know what I I I'm an old Native American thing I find it fascinating and can be quite honest with you give 'em that whatever they want Mount Rushmore I don't have an issue with that by listen let's talk about some other things\nThere's this South Korean golf tournament I was trying to you know keep up with all this stuff for the last couple of days and they actually you know because of the time schedule what have you\nYou know my son brought something up about Brooks kept going you know we hit the person in the eye\nAnd I've often thought to myself how to golfers after they do something like that was kind of like a professional prized spider now I'm going to go a long way for their so just bear with me because I just started to think about it now\nMax Berra who played jethro in Beverly Hills okay but his father was ... senior was a heavyweight prize fighter who actually killed a person in the ring\nAnd many people believe that after that he was basically not the same and he never had that instinct he wasn't able to finish as he did fighters so he never really reached his full potential\nAnd my son ship ... would be hard after I you know blinded someone that you get back out there and do it again without the fear factor well obviously he's gone out and he won this tournament\nHow do these athletes kind of like when Darrell esteem Li jak paid I made him on that Monday Night football game paralyzed him and I know Jack date him at a different mindset because he that he used that intensity to play football kind of like perfect if you will\nHow you ever thought about how they do that now they have to separate lives on the playing field and off the field\nI I think it's ... that these guys have a pretty good ability to compartmentalize those things in in to separate them to make sure that that uh you know they can focus a lot most of these golfers were a part of their somewhat entourage if you will is is a mind coach a trainer hypnotists day it's a sports psychologist someone in that\nBut of they're somewhat entourage if you will is is a mind coach a trainer I hypnotists day it's a sports psychologist someone in that kind of capacity\nTo make it so that they can get their their mind locked in on what they're they're trying to accomplish in there was a good movie I think it's with Will Smith a bag or advanced the legend tobacco and yeah yeah uh and if you noticed in that namely\nThere's one ... one scene where there's a whole crowd is all around them and he's ready to hit a shot any he can't focus and then all of a sudden they pan to like the crowd advantages and all that he sees as the golf hole\nAnd the ball in front of him and so I think these guys are really that good that they can envision that you know they talked about envision the shot you'll see most golfers before they get ready to hit their shot they'll stand behind the ball look behind the ball through the ball to the green\nAnd then kind of get that mindset of okay I Want to own vision the shot first\nThen they'll go up line up and hit the shot Nancy Lopez or talked about that when you know the great Nancy Lopez night a that was her thing and a lot of time she would back off from a shot until she could envision the ball going where she wanted it to go so I think it's more of a psychological thing that those guys they're able to do that\nWith all due respect to re night a great manager and players since and I read the New York Mets I forgot\nThat she was married to him and still is married to him so yeah ... Lopez was a phenomenal athlete oh she she toward that tore up when she was when she was she was the Tiger Woods of that time\nThat you know it's funny the LPGA and I I'm In fact I was just looking at something from the LPGA moments ago it frustrates me that they don't get the same swag\nAs the PGA gets it I thought Michele we was going to be the person to do that for them but it didn't work out but you think about ... addict is orange them and of course Nancy Lopez they\n... they dominated but they were they were they were really good then yeah it would be a way but there were some pretty good golfers that that they became you know I I guess fringe famous or\nA ... garner and one of those ones um muffin Spencer Devlin there there have been some some good lady go and they may nobody's holding benefits for these girls either Robin I mean they they they're making some do you know I'm Glad that makes me feel good hey\nI'm a Brooks kept up with this guy really is coming on strong in the ... and there's a connection there is a stick gross great nephew or something like that where that the way he is a boy I can see why [laughter] yeah yeah but uh and so\nYeah and he's he's kind of the guy right now he sees the the man in a in a nice one of those guys good looks and has it all a\nShow he he's not having a tough time getting a table in a restaurant right now let's talk about this World Series and you know I had the incredible Michael Kravitz my producer and Michael gar and a great family all the videos before the sun came up today\nAnd I gave Greg Finley the opportunity to talk about baseball 'cause he works with a pirate network obviously went to wanes Berg he works for ... he was at that time Richland center about the game the other night so we're talking about all sorts of stuff and he really does know as baseball\nIs going to be a good World Series I think yeah it is it's a way ... and yeah I mean you got ... Clinton or ... or ... coming\nBack from the big goofy curved validity throws out instead of throwing Seventy four mile an hour pitch please a little off center but I I like them LA's crazier than a bag full out war and it's I mean I got just nuts once he licked his bat and you say it can you can just hear my mother going he\nShouldn't do that it's going to get sick all those germs that man he's a player is he's very ... how about the strength that that that\nHas I mean he can just muscled through any they have not the greatest field or he had a ball over his head last night he probably should have gotten it would've been a really good catch but he probably should have caught it but\nI mean he can just muscled through any they have not the greatest field or he had a ball over his head last night he probably should have got it would have been a really good catch\nBut he probably should have caught it but but the tremendous arm that he has a man I ... and we talked about they were fed up with him about a year and a half he was one of the pitch for exactly yeah as a loon that'll never happen now but\nNow he's he's really but the Dodgers whole lineup is pretty good they weren't hitting very well I'm\nGlad you're still amazes me and he's still one of the sweet has a bit sweeter swings and all the major league baseball but\nThis is what really frustrates me I'm a huge Milwaukee Brewers fan obviously for a Miller light but more importantly because of you know the ownership and who they were in small market a guinea mock a manager for what Greg counsel as they're now part of Jim ... world championship team in Nineteen Ninety seven\nAnd and the fans said it perfectly and you know they haven't been there since eighty two and I was really rooting for them\n[noise] two hundred million dollar payroll to that show what they did and push it push it to a game seven is phenomenal but it just took the wind out of my sales\nThinking is this kind of spell the fate for the pirates and other teams like that when it comes to that last game just too much firepower because of the guy on the bench who's making ten million as opposed to your guy making a million\nYeah I don't necessarily think so I mean that was so close if if the ball the yellow jackets in the fifth inning gets over barns is head instead of boys making that miraculous catch that may have turned to the entire complex you know the game but ah so ... yeah we we could have been talking about the Craig the chicken council being the guy who's managing the team going into the\nUh the series would have been ... it would have really been good and and the run that they had I mean shoot they wrote one fourteen games at the end of the season ... it's not impossible to do All right listen stay\nWith us

with the youth that you have on this football team I think the best is yet to come so congratulations to you and your son on a nice when\nGreat thank thank you very much it was a good when\nA team effort I mean if you look at the stats we probably had a six or seven kids running the ball we had unfortunately we had to punt returns called back because of holding and they were away from the fall so it's the kind of thing that frustrates you but\nUh they had a real good game and then of course uh this is the first time that we've had this many wins in about seven or eight years and we can close out with a winning season with a good night friday night well which is also going to\nBe the first time in about seven or eight years so it's a it's like you know turning a ship you got it turned out so that is parallel now we've got to get it going in the in the right direction and I think that that's happening right now\nYeah you know the word is teddy that the special teams coaches getting some criticism because of those two penalties on the on those ... returns I'm not real sure he wouldn't return my calls me that's the case [laughter]\nBut you know what role downhill now these kids they I you know you go over the films\nAnd you go oh my gosh how could they call that but yeah that's that's high school football I Love it I think it's the purest form of football that they\nReally take place and now as we mentioned they stayed in Cleveland after playing there last week the chargers then took off and headed to London would jet lag and what have you I mean it's going to take at least four or five days for these guys you get back on their their a game show it logistically I I just can't see this happening on a regular basis weekend and we got in the NFL Gregg\nYeah what what the league has done is is usually they structure in the teams by week after they play the London games so are the charges that they have a by week next week so they have plenty of time to to recover but if they were to put a team\nIn London or that creates a lot more logistical problems particularly for the team that will be playing in London a you know how they would get their travel done but I I Would assume that they would get some sort of a luxury type of\nA facility the traveling as opposed to the south west jets were where I have to travel and sit in the middle seats and things of that nature\nI like southwest I wouldn't mind travel a little southwest somewhere where it's warm right now but what do you think about logistically put agave franchise in London the NFL\nI just see it happening I think the logistics would be a nightmare uh I think it it's good as it is and that it's kind of unique\nUh it it ah it shows a different perspective playing and and Europe and seeing the fans over there but I I don't think day in day out to a year and year out makes any sense\nBut I think one thing just as hard as that everybody thought that it would be the Jacksonville franchise that would move there if somebody was going to go there but now they've gotten too good and there are drawn to many people in Jacksonville it wouldn't make sense to leave their\nOrange home

person but not a fan and that was on the sidelines and ... it was nowhere near as good as the Sean Rodriguez beating up the gay parade bucket a few years ago right and I mean if it did he win [laughter]\nWell I don't know if it's meant especially when you're wide receiver using your hands to do that a little brown\nI'm going to say one more thing about the giants and you know I'm a big fan of the family and the brand and you know was rooting for them when they want to know seven I saw a story about Calexico bursts the other day and you guys may disagree with is\nHe got a real raw deal I'm Sorry I Know you should have taken the gun and give it a guy shot himself he went to jail for two years I mean there are people doing so much worse and it basically took what career he had left for weight from him\nAnd you know when he was kind of a soft spoken guy never cause any money a lot of problems but was a tremendous skilled wide receiver and it just kind of put a lump in my throat\nI felt really bad form watching the story of all those poor people and moon township they couldn't afford to feed their families because he wasn't paying is real estate taxes I mean that they have to go to jail oh my goodness that's why they need guys like you\nTo take care of that stuff by here we go I'm going to take the browns getting the coins\nI'm with you in the Bronx [noise] played their worst gave me they can't play any worse than they did last week so I I'm also going to take the Cleveland Browns bam has Tampa Bay chatty\nLike Brown's I I think ... just a on a downhill slide and I think Cleveland no matter what they're playing for something with every game every game as a notch in their gun I like I like the one and that's\nAll right I'm going to take Matthew Stafford giving free to the dolphins I think that should be actually more but I'll take the points are being given to the dolphins and I'll take the lions [noise]\nA dolphins for me lions for bam Ted\n[noise] uh I like uh I like the alliance just my second favorite team and I think they're good I think they're going to have a really good game today\nAlright eagles are now free and three and for everyone who was saying they should have let Nick falls keep playing because Carson once you don't know what you're going to get well I think now that he's had a couple of weeks under his belt we were we may be getting the league's MVP\nCam Newton pretty good player to Panthers though are getting five I think that's the respect factor for the eagles and cars and ... I'm taking the eagles given the points\nA rom I I think that it's back to win so vain yeah I think they did that he's really good but I also like Cam Newton and and the guys in Caroline I think this is going to be a shoot out I think he was going to win the game but I think five is too many I I like the uh the Panthers to cover that game Ted\nI like the the Panthers plus the points that I think it's gonna be a tough game it's going to come down to the end and I think those points are going to be critical\nJosh Allen I still think is the heir apparent the future I think\nGame it's going to come down to the end and I think those points are going to be critical\nJosh Allen I still think is the heir apparent to future I think he'll get them back to Kelly land as in the super bowl Arab Jim Kelly when they went for in a row\nUh went to the super bowl four times in a row he's out though so what do they do they bring in a guy by them and Derek Anderson who used to be a quarterback in Carolina still pretty good but I just can't even though they are getting seven go with them because I think Andrew Luck is starting to hit his tried again and that's a good story so I'm going to take the colds giving seven to buffalo\nI think the ... of the ground and pound was shade McCoy and Chris I read today so with their running back combination or in a low scoring game I think that the bills will at least covered the seven bam\nHas Indianapolis teddy\nI liked the bills too I like the bills\nAre Texans are really been playing good football they won three and a road to Sean Watson obviously over the injury from last year young men from Syracuse really proving to be a top notch player in the leg they're getting four and a half jaguars had been slipping this of the week they don't come back I'm going to take the Texans getting the points\nI Will pick the jaguars they come back in and get themselves back into the race ah bam has Houston alright cutting\nI'd take the jaguars because of the fence um I think that's going to be a tighter game than than people think but I like jags got to come around there too good of a team down to\nWhat you what do we got thirty five seconds left in London twenty to Thirteen now\nShe has ... no no no the titans just scored a touchdown they they're deciding whether to kick the extra point enforce overtime or to try to go for the win\nOkay um let's are now continue as we walk the line with Ted are no up next is the saints getting two and a half against the ravens I'm taking drew cool breeze and the two and a half over the ravens\nRub you hit me with one early said that Drew Brees ... but uh I like him to try and change that death history and to win this time around so I've got New Orleans bam has the ravens setting\nYou know you look on paper and it you would say it's got to be the ravens with that blitz eleventh attacks last week but there's one quarter back that basically\nKnows how to play that flip and its Drew Brees and he'll have such a quick release that I think it'll it'll pull those linebacker back I like I like uh the saints in this one\nAre I'd cowboys giving a point to the Redskins I'm going to take the Redskins getting the point\nGreg\nAnd this one goes against a my thought process because I really liked the Redskins at all going into this season that and still don't think that they're all that good but a Dallas just doesn't seem to be the Dallas Cowboys that I expected them to be\nI'm going to take the Redskins and this one this is a line shift or this this game has flip flopped it was uh actually uh the uh the red the red skins were favored earlier on now the cowboys are favored by a point but I'm taking the Redskins bam has the cowboys\nAre HR looks like ... they're going to go for two points right they did\nGo for two points they did not make it but there was a penalty against the chargers half the distance to the goal so now it's a they're going for an extra point from the one yard line and they did not make it so they are the chargers win the game twenty to Nineteen\nYard thank you very much now back to a pat on the field hey Ted you got about thirty seconds less than that actually so you got the cowboys giving onto the Redskins would you like\nI like math and the Redskins on this one cowboys haven't proven them chose ...\nAlright coming back we're going to walk the line next

solid football team I think ... just kind of such a tremendous relief how a and I I just uh I think Cincinnati can be up or down so I'm going to stick with a steady Kansas City chiefs\nWhy is it always been that nobody has facing the bangles when it comes and they're usually a reason for it because they usually end up losing ... ... why is it was the Cincinnati Bengals I mean you could maybe say that may be the coaching change there for a long time I don't know\nBut he just no matter how good they are even in that game against the Steelers you just believe there was going to be some way\nThey were going to screw that thing up and they did when Antonio Brown got into the secondary and scored that does that it was like\nYeah I just was waiting for it I knew it was going to happen sooner or later why do you think that is\n... ... and ... movie every thing relates back to the head coach but you know I thought it was interesting in ... in the end of that game did you think ... or did enter your mind that maybe this deal is allowed the bangles to score ... didn't get the ball back with enough time to to get back down the field in in school or that touchdown\nI accept you think about but I don't think they did but I mean ... you have to think about because\nLet's face it brown had had a rough game are going right up until the end I don't know that they had that kind of confidence but I'm a ... you know it could have turned up better obviously for the Steelers but\nTo me I don't know how you can't go back to coaching at some point when you have that many uh problems on the field that are not directly\nFootball related and cannot win the big games uh I I just think you have to go back go cheap\nYeah and I think part of it with the Bengals too is is he has such a a rogue elements ah with with a lot of the the players and maybe when it comes down to the\nThe time of of getting to the finish line that ah there's just not enough of that togetherness within the organization that the players aren't aren't all pulling in the same direction so you know maybe that's part of the aspect to\nIt and if there's any role that coaching is supposed to take place that's it yeah you know you can't give them the rah rah stuff at that level but you could get them the intensity and the focus\nAnd I think they get so distracted by the other stuff that they lose that last a part of the game their focus just falls apart a playwright that's I've thought that for I\nThink we've been talking about this for about five years\nIn the morning in their ...

professional\nHe's assistant vice president residential lending a dollar bank and Randy we are talking about reverse mortgages tonight yes I have me back absolutely thanks you very much for stopping by and being a part of this than I\nI Want to invite everyone if you ask any questions at all regarding reverse mortgages you are welcome to call here's the number eight six six three and I won ten twenty eight six six\nThree nine one ten twenty and real simple we there's a whole lot of information that you all summit lean meat and you can find out what kind of money\nYou can have available to you by calling in and giving what information Randy\nWell if you're over sixty two that's good if the price of your house what you think it would have praised for it if you have a mortgage on it or any leaves a home equity loan or just that information there we can start off and find out what you may be able to qualify for\nOkay and if you have any other questions regarding reverse mortgages\nWell the reverse mortgages not due to the last one lives in the house so in the last one passes away they don't live in the house anymore\nThat's the way they don't live in the house anymore we don't own a house that's the big misconceptions they stayed on the house so we're going to give the state up to a year to sell off the property pay off what they do it on the reverse mortgage and the interest and they keep the rest\nNow if they're upside down if they use all the money early and they live very long they could do more in a house in the house is worth because of the interest building up over the years\nIf that's the case then the states not responsible for the differences government and short it's called a non recourse loan mhm you can't fall deficiency judgment against anybody against the state so at that point we let the estate just they can walk away de loop foreclosure they just don't get any money\nSo I always have that conversation with people if you're not concerned about leaving your adult children or somebody else\nA your home a reverse mortgage may be a good idea if we worked out the numbers that sound like there was something you might want to do a but if you want to leave all the equity do your children are in a friend or loved one or you probably want to stay away from a reverse mortgage 'cause you could actually if you use the money it's a bet you're going to go over the over the value of the house over the years\n... initially reverse mortgages were from individuals who um came across a hardship and it would be difficult for them to stay in the home is that still being used in that way today\nThat's definitely still being used that way too but what what else has used it was it in the past was a standby line of credit\nFor emergency reasons or for financial planning a studies have shown and there was good articles in in a lot of a recent news ... news\nMagazines and articles about uh\nIf you can combined the line of credit with your retirement portfolio\nSo you have a recovery for probably two hundred thousand three hundred thousand you combine that with the two or three hundred thousand or a lot of credit of course your money's going to extend further out in your retirement I'm not a financial planner but I Know the whole key is not running out of money and and the line of credit helps a lot of people not run out of money\nThere's so much so that this is a good idea that there are many investment advisers now the you personally have taught this too yes that they have come to you to try to get a better understanding of this so they can help their clients retire\nBut I'm Glad you said that because it used to be I had to track them down but over the last couple of years they've been tracking me down and they see me out because they want to know about this uh\nIt's funny I have one running right in front of me on the computer from a financial planner with the house was worth three fifty and and this fellow needed some extra funds he was starting to run out of money at the Seventy five years old he had some money left but not a lot\nSo at his age it's a it's Seventy five he was getting a hundred and forty one thousand dollars and a lot of credit that he can dip into when he needs to he doesn't have to take any of it but\nIt's there for when he wants to take it\nAnd he could take it out monthly if he wanted to\nIf we wanted a monthly payment yeah that's a good that's a good question because if he wanted a payment we would pay him eight hundred and thirty one dollars every month they wouldn't have the line of credit though but he would have the eight thirty one and that eight thirty one would never run out as long as he paid his taxes on the house and lived in the house\nAnd there are there are limitations on how many times you can draw money out on the line of credit\nThey do limit you if you had a hundred and forty one thousand you would be limited eighty thousand the first year\nThey don't want you to have access to everything they're afraid he might take it all out not\nOut here's what I'm thinking if I have a hundred and forty thousand dollars available to me in a line of credit\nAnd what you mentioned earlier that my line of credit will grow was right for the amount that I Do not use that is correct then what if I wanted to pull out a thousand dollars a month ... out of my line of credit\nCan take money out anytime you want your limited eighty thousand the first year\nI wanted to pull out a thousand dollars a month\n... out of my line of credit\nYou can take money out anytime you want your limited eighty thousand the first year\nOkay so I could take it out every once a month I Want it to her once every couple of weeks they write a line of credit that not limited at all when it comes to that but I was thinking what's nice about that as I can take the money out once a month but then what remains what continue to grow on an annual basis courage\nRight let's look at the one here with a lot of credit was a hundred and forty one by the end of the first year it's almost a hundred and fifty that's quite a bit of growth and when you're absolutely a in three years or grew to one sixty almost one sixty nine\nSo that's a substantial growth rate insurance\nAnd a ... as a result of that continual growth of what is available to you\nIf you take out the um line of credit at an earlier younger age when you're generally healthier as it grows over time ten years down the road or whatever it might be and you don't have the help that you once did then you have this really big amount that would be available to you\nIs it possible that that amount will be greater than what you could have qualified for a few would have gone and got a reverse mortgage at that loaded let that later date\nActually you would be better off by applying now is if you if you work out the numbers ... what's been happening people that apply to a year ago and when applying now they're actually getting less money now because they lowered how much you can get\nA and there's talk they may do that again they may may right they may increase there might be they may change the principal limit factor ... mortgage insurance they might increase that they might do it all over again\nHow much you get out of these so people that way to the year or two a actually got less money when they applied now and if you do the numbers are and you have that line of credit it will actually grow more for you than if you waited a couple of years and applied\nOkay now this idea of having fewer dollars available as can now as compared to a a couple of years ago and what is the argument behind having fewer dollars available what do you mean what's the ... the argument from making from the government standpoint of telling you how much you can have available what why they're doing that is why are they doing that\nThey have to look at a Brian Montgomery a just had a look at it\nAnd you have to do a projection over the next Thirty years of Jeff ha stop doing business is there enough money in that pool there's billions of dollars in that mortgage insurance fund but is there enough money in that pool if a lot of these go belly up if they can answer is no and he thinks that answer\nMight not be no right now are\nYou may have to decrease what they get because you ... this is a negative advertising was what they're trying to prevent us from going upside down where the government has to come in and pay that insurance mhm so that's all they're trying to do is protected and that's why they loaded up back October a second last year okay they lowered it by about twenty percent but that's just to try to protect and keep the program going\nBecause you know it's an important program for people need to be financially self is does yes\nIt has to has to be competitive financially solvent that's what they're trying to do with that adjustment they made\nIt all to mentally the government's exposed for the amount\nThat you say that\nThere's two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in debt on a home that can only sell for two hundred twenty five thousand dollars sure they're only liable for that twenty five then\nYou're never responsible for more than what I Know from the government standpoint they're only on the hook for covering that twenty five thousand as far as maintaining a level of solvency\nYeah so so that's why they ... they reduce that and that's why they're watching the program they just want to make sure it solvent they want to make sure it's good and they wanted to be here for a long time for people\nAnd they also want to make sure that this is right for the person who's getting into that\nWhy safeguards they came out with financial assessment\nA long time for people and they also want to make sure that this is right for the person who's getting into that as his wife safeguards they\nCame out with financial assessment almost been three years now\nAnd a financial says but you have to sit down and make sure people have enough money left over for a couple or enough money left over for a single individual or if they don't then you have to ask wrote for taxes and insurance and that escrow a for this gentleman here uh one of the three hundred fifty thousand house\nHas asked gross he didn't qualify would have been somebody one grim so if if he didn't have enough money coming in the door we could say well you know and your credit wasn't good we can hold back so do you want to thousands still give him Seventy thousand in a lot of credit but now he doesn't have to worry about his future taxes assurance being paid 'cause we're going to take them out of the reverse mortgage\nAnd for people to do qualify that's a lifesaver for them because they're like wow okay I was having a hard time doing that that's why I got behind a little bit my taxes if you're going to ask them for me that's wonderful I don't have to worry about losing my house now\nRight now it's a fantastic position to be at the U.S what's really nice is that for anybody who's looking at a reverse mortgage a there are a number of different safeguards that are in place to ensure\nThat this is really the best thing for you at this time in one of the great things is that when you're dealing with dollar bank uh it's it's different than dealing with just about anybody else that's out there\nWere full service back so if I feel that a reverse mortgages right I'm going to be the first one to tell people oh hey maybe you need to look into a home equity loan and we have great comeback would erupts we have great mortgage ruptured ... uh and I'll be the first one of the tone that need to do that or sometimes I Need to tell them that you know maybe movies are best ideas on your situation\nReady Davis is with us here he is a sort of find a reverse mortgage professional assistant vice president residential lending a dollar bank more coming up in a moment\nOf pain pills easy to take it easy to lose control [noise] hard to quit\nMisusing pain medication can lead to addiction visit curb the crisis dot com to learn the warning signs and find a treatment center near you that's curbed the crisis dot com\nAnd now a page from the diary of law\nDo diary that goes to this house is protected their progressive but that doesn't mean the haunted house would you explain that radiator like clanking sound for the moon colored light in the hallway that's gone by morning maybe he never bundled home a NATO and he's doomed to suffer an eternity without this either\nSaving averages Seventy percent on car insurance when you went to home and auto through progressive that we owe right the wind casualty insurance company and affiliates discounts not available in all states are situation\nWhat is every time you went out you can cash in the capital in secret ... you are in four percent cash back on dining and entertainment like learning more about each other and you first date you painting over we're discovering can't hit the high notes that your favorite carry into by\nSome people have to tell them four or five times on the phone call there is no payment required you can make a payment mhm uh some people are concerned over the interest not many but sometimes you get someone that they could qualify for regular mores but they want to reverse mortgage for other reasons or they will make a payment so that interest charge doesn't build up over the years\nAnd you can do that there is to you know some people call it a a a reverse mortgage a long with a choice of a payment or no because you can make a payment you don't have to make it okay so if you want to make a payment concerned about keeping the equity that you can do that\nWell people who are asking questions about payments they're trying to figure out in their mind okay if I'm never making a payment then how do you get your money back and how do you make money\nAre we make money wants to loan this close we make no money upfront we make money when the loan closes then that's based on the interest to you used over the years and some people it's a little bit some people it's a lot I mean how they use\nSo theoretically there's this long term investment that dollar bank is making in this house and these individual that's correct so if you're sixty two and you're eligible for this\nAnd then you lived to be one hundred to\nWe have made any money on that loan young\nDollar bank isn't making a dime for forty years till the loans paid off is ultimately paid for us right now for that individual that has it\nDead or when that time comes they need to no longer being in the home they could come from somebody passing away once they have one right mhm it could also come from an individual who then goes to a nursing home right how long would they have to be in a nursing home me for the home would have to be sorry\nColor question a lot of people asked because some people go to nursing home for three months or five months 'cause they get hurt and they worry about what's going to happen if they ever reverse well here's the real ... a white shirt and their twelve months consecutively in a row\nNursery number three months or five months because they get hurt and they worry about what's going to happen if they ever reverse well here's the real ... ah once you're in there twelve months consecutively in a row then it becomes do and the reason they made that role is if you're in there for twelve months most likely you are not coming out\nBut a lot of people go in for a month or two or three months for rehab and things that's fine you go back into the house you reverse mortgage still continues you still get your monthly payment of your line of credit available to whatever you have set up it's the key is when you are in their over twelve months that are oh\nOkay and then we would work with with the whoever your contact person isn't talking about getting a house on the market or whatever you need to do to do that\nNow in a number of people also concerned about leaving a debt obligation to their children\nYeah the house was the only collateral for the loan your adult children can have a million dollars and assets a million dollars in a back\nAh we can't touch that houses the only collateral so only one or two things are going to happen when that last part is no longer lives in the home the state's going to own the house\nAnd then they're going to call me to find out what they do and the reverse or if they know they could put her on the market will give them a year to put it on the market sell the house pay off what they ought to keep the difference if its upside down they know there's no sense keeping an eye on the market paying for taxes paying for utilities they can just walk away do move for closure because they're not going to get any money\nOr they did its purpose of the there is there the other people use up all the fence\nI just for clarity purposes deed in lieu of foreclosure\nThat means in the rare case where you owe more than the house is worth\nWhen you passed away your state gets ... and they go well you know they are two hundred thousand this house is only worth a hundred and fifty so I Can't sell it for a hundred and fifty and pay off the two\nI'm just going to walk away and it'd be done with the not responsible that's due to foreclosure\nOkay I'll do they do need to clean it up a clean up the house if it's going to be a deed in lieu okay but that's good 'cause they take out everything they need the furniture and everything else whenever they want ... clean the house up in the ... the bank will do that and they sign a document yeah and the debate takes it over and I know when you're done good\nTimes you sign can't touch there also is now so no other assets so let's go back over this for a second you have a one hundred and fifty thousand dollar home right there is that now a loan of two hundred thousand dollars that is out on this home\nFor they took it out early they lived long they'd have more\nRight yes but at the same time they also have other assets let's say another half million dollars and other assets houses you only collateral period so that half million doesn't get considered whatsoever no sir\nNever the house was the only collateral for the loan that's government short a ... you probably heard me say this many times the first reverse mortgage done in Nineteen sixty one mhm but in February I think it was February fifth of Nineteen eighty eight President Reagan signed a bill that added to lay urban shorts to these protected them\nSo that's why they got a bad a\nLot of misconceptions about reverse mortgages is the first one was done in Nineteen sixty one it was a toy eighty eight Nineteen eighty eight to President Reagan signed a bill that protected people\nAre so then when the first one was done because of the housing and economic recovery act or back then they were in short and they've been and there is safe and viable options for people use ever since mhm uh there's only been a couple of things they had to fix like non barring spouse issues and they have fixed them\nOkay well we'll talk about that as well coming up for those that way to say I I Want to leave the equity in my home to my children then it sounds as though reverse mortgage may not be for them\nJust had that exact conversation today that's all that was their main goal there they're
