other news channels that were uh\nUh uh you know a covering the landing of a of hurricane or Michael and I think in most of the\nYou know the video that we saw in and I knew it when we when you know and I'm sure you do when we were watching it we weren't seeing the major damage that was being done in some of those areas because for example in Mexico beach and nobody was there filming\nRight because you you just couldn't be there I couldn't show that um you know the the the conditions as a Michael came ashore on uh with with a\n... a very strong at a very strong category for uh you look at a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds and and just incredible I mean just look at the time span from last weekend up until\nUh the storm arrived uh the unpredictable nature of these storms and ... and how Michael a gain strength and was still gaining strength I ... if\nIf the storm hadn't been moving as quickly as it as it was headed slowed down at all over water I there's no telling I mean this but I'm I'm confident this thing would have been a category five ... yeah I mean it it came close to it anyway\nA mile a mile per hour away Riley yeah\nFrom from getting to that to a point and\nI they did say later on you know the analysis of it they could you know a revisit it and say that it was a fiber why lower for right ah I said when they when they get all the you know a data from all

it where you have one Democrat come out and say stop this\nThan others ... is this is ridiculous enough and as we've said when you when you think about it I I understand why they're going there because where else was there to go either you were going to make the decision as a party\nTo do what they said after twenty sixteen was look we've got to go to the mid west we've got to go to fly over country we have to start talking to people we have to find out what they you know what their needs are either you're ... you're going to go in that direction\nAnd talk about the economy and talk about those things or you were going to say our bases radical left\nAnd we need to go radical left and so this is obvious at you know that they're doing this this is obvious that the mainstream of the Democratic party have realized we can't beat this so we are on that last week\nThere is no are you there is no road for them to turn around basically and come back\nReverse direction will you we'd said that two letters again ... well and and you know when we set it after the election\nUh you because there is that once they took that break and you know are considered going to the mid west for a moment [noise]\nThey came back from one from what wait what are we say before lunch or we're totally not do not at all on the ... during that we're not doing that um but when you when you go you know

to so what is next\nWhere do you go from here\nUh we've been asking that and every time they find a new place to go to because it's just now they're going to get in your face not going to shout well what is what is beyond that right now\nI Believe it's a terrible political strategy that's going to backfire it is I think it's already backed prime uh but you know this this is where they've decided to go which uh again I'm not surprised because once\nBecause once they're only as and we'll talk about this more coming up on the show\nWith a bit later on but there's really two places to go right

J. H. G. ah which did streaming coverage um\nUm basically when when we went off the air they started their streaming coverage and and continued until they lost more than just power they lost power at their transmitter sites\nAnd that was pretty much game over for them but they were only twenty feet above\nA sea level they were confident that their staff was going to be safe in that situation but they continue to keep an IT guy on board to make sure that they kept feeding that and so they set another sister station and our system through and this gentleman and that garage I\nAppreciate his honesty because wedding basically did\nWas documented where he was where he was standing yeah and and and and smartly I'm not going to go stand out there by the edge of the parking garage but what I found interesting was that that parking garage was also home for countless people in their cars yeah\nYeah I just the atrocity is his name\nAnd a lot of people were following him a Drudge Report actually even put up a lean a early Wednesday and\nUh and he had been during that time basically staging and showing\nYou know the well a calm literally calm before the storm and and so he was he was broadcasting essentially a through periscope ah for periods of time thirty to forty minutes or even shorter times but then as you mentioned\nAre going live later and this is something that again and it is too I think display the power of a storm for many of us that have never been through a storm and very few people relatively speaking\nHad been through a storm like this but when you're able to show people\nHow powerful this is what it does and he's just going to be there by the way he anticipated being there for up to a week or longer because he knows that's going to be next to impossible to get out of that parking garage because of the you know the damage left behind\nAnd that's what you hope to do you hope to show people that this damage and how powerful this storm is now hurricane Michael becomes tropical ... Michael or in the last hour or so but still when you look on the radar a Tom this thing right now a Michael\nEveryone in the state of Georgia right now is feeling some effect of Michael as it's centered over a Georgia and moving toward the Carolinas what do we expect them next and the next twenty four the forty eight hours and beyond\nWell initially what we're going to expect that his life you know there there still is a life threatening storm surge going on [noise] um to begin with a Panama City in along the coast there they still are\nOr anywhere from three to five feet a inundation going on right\nAnd so we haven't had a a little water to recede but we're also going to have tremendously heavy rainfall from Michael and that's going to be life threatening flash flooding and it's going to go across not just Georgia but the Carolinas and they don't need any more water\nThey're still saturated and there are places that are going to become impassable it would not necessarily be out of the question\nTo to find some of the major roads Ninety five can I say Ninety five enough uh ... we're going to need to be aware of this is ... if if if you're if if you're working and your job is to drive somewhere bottom line is you're going to need to be alert to this [noise]\nUh the wins a high profile vehicles we're twelve hours from now still going to be looking now we've got a a Seventy mile an hour wind and within the next half hour they are going to update that with a\nWith an advisory they were giving one hour advisories this was the last advisory at a twelve o'clock eastern time\nThere will be moving on to uh just regular a three hour advisories\nAnd um and so it's going to accelerate and speed as it becomes a little more entrenched in the mid level jet stream and so that'll Pickett's speed up the I'm guessing a probably not by the time or off the air but twenty three miles an hour\nA forward speed to the northeast and wins are still going to be forty miles an hour\nForty to forty five miles an hour [noise] and so I'm now above the surface where we don't have the friction of the earth five thousand feet when something already clocked I'm using Doppler radar\nAh at that level it eighty to eighty five miles an hour\nAnd so where there's a heavy cluster of thunderstorms in there is one currently caught crossing over highway six team which goes into making from savannah [noise] um there's heavy rain there and that thunderstorm translates those higher wins to the surface\nAnd so in those storms they could seeing us two eighty miles or maybe even eighty five mile an hour gusts even though we're looking at a a sustained speed of Seventy miles an hour so we're going to drop about in half\nAs we go over the next twenty four hours to around forty to forty five\nOf the speed of wins above the surface and and so right now as I said we're Seventy will be down to about forty five will still be in the tropical storm range and I believe that it will exit the United states\nOr as we get up to friday morning out into the Atlantic as a as a tropical\nStorm about we're\nNot it's not it's not going to become a remnant it's not going to be just a cluster of storms that are moving their way off in a in a general direction John trout and great meteorologist or admire him a lot\nIndicated Ninety five court or and that's exactly what it's going to be following the court or although it will be on the west side of that court door and we've already learned that the west side of that court or\nHas some some some roots that between Colombia and Ninety five\nAnd moving its way up toward Charlotte and Rockingham\nAnd so forth that are that have their own issues when it comes to a flooding and that includes going across Lumberton and Fayetteville and both of those areas um south of Raleigh\nOf Raleigh which I think it'll scoot right past Raleigh\nThose areas are are we're gonna have to be watching them as we go into today tonight and tomorrow or to see if we have more catastrophic flooding and damage we can probably we can probably saved for the next time we talk about turning around and don't drought\nRight right exactly at ... and you have to you have to proceed with with caution and don't think you can get through it as you mentioned yesterday you don't know if that road has been washed away under the surface of that water you it's impossible to tell that so and it's always best to turn around\nAnd certainly we're going to keep people posted throughout the morning as meteorologists Tom hale\nAnd later John ... will also join his uh and and keep us updated what to expect a in the coming days thank you Tom we'll talk to you here and just a bit\nSounds good All right thank you eight six six Ninety run I", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "11"}
