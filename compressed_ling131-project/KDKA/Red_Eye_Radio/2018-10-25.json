I wasn't talking about my opinion I was talking about right somebody else who told me\nWho is a supporter and we were talking about the possibilities of what could harm and move independence one way or another and the argument was it's not going to change me or anybody that I Know well I Know that's not the point that it's not you're not you're not part of that you're you're already\nIn the restaurant eating you need you need to build a business out this is this is exactly what the president can do and this is unique to this president by the way because the Republicans we'd been screaming for years can't get their message across and if they could get it across if they could go out there and promote that message a very simple message\nThen they could get that out and they could they could gain more seats\nInstead of losing seats and this was back then not necessarily now we're talking about getting a message across to people who have not been fully convinced yet if you've been fully convinced we've already made that point you're not the one that we're talking about you're not part of that group\nThe the Republicans but more importantly the president right now are capable together of getting real things done and they need to get our message out there but\nIs this and and we continue to to fight this all the time were where we get people to call well you guys think that you can convince everybody that we don't know\nAnd they need to get the message out there but there is this and and we continue to have to fight this all the time were where we get people to call well you guys think that you can convince everybody\nThat we don't know\nBut that's never been the goal to convince everybody but there are people that\nLook people [laughter] people a vow of every day it's not maybe not be the majority of the population but people learn every day and a teacher's politicians how many look look one of the great one of the greatest things some of the greatest callers we get are people that have called the show\nAnd I said you know I used to think this way and then I started a little you know listening to you guys and other people in this politician and this guy and\nYou know you you referenced some people and I gave them a listen to on economics and I realize I changed my mind completely ... people change their minds you're not trying to get everybody to change your mind you're trying to get that that person in the middle and we were talking about specifically yesterday\nUndecided it's about it's the political strategy of always growing your base and never being satisfied with what you have always trying to grow it and we believe if you promote free markets\nConservative economics conservative principles and you explain it in a simple way\nA nation that largely remains and we're not talking to you who are listening to the show you have taught us out you sought out shows like this you've sought out information like this so we're not referring to you you're already you're already aboard but when there are new people and we get them all the time\nAnd you are able to introduce them to different ideas there is a segment of the population that's willing to listen it might only be five percent but that five percent makes the difference\nIn almost probably ... I Would guess Ninety five percent of elections out there and that is the goal the goal is to win the goal is not to get an immediate satisfaction because\nOur candidate you use a little bit more heated rhetoric than the other candidate we understand that\nAnd that's what I Love when people runners you guys don't understand the frustration out there you're kidding me in turn you you'd liked but just what you like to sit in this chair for the last almost Thirty years Mm [laughter] oh no it's always it's\nAlways complete peace and quiet here yet but that's what it is a conservative radio talk show host for the last Thirty years yeah\nIt's really an calm [laughter] it's always a very high scenario it's like doing constant yoga all the time at a table going oh it's like sitting on a beach\nSo like that just sitting there and I'm ... I I got friends in St Thomas sending their version island saint Thomas beach oh what a nice day that's what it is\nDay after day here as pure as and and so the goal is is is the goal to get that satisfaction of getting that hangs out every day at the other side that you disagree with that you believe is unfair and in some cases evil\nNo that's not our goal look after them on the issues go after them with with uh you know with everything you've got on the issues and fell out where their plan is wrong or what they're doing is wrong and and be very clear about it that's part of it\nBut the rhetoric is doesn't need to be the ... the point is is that\nYou feel like there's this limited window and that the the the window is closing and it just might here within two weeks and so the point being is that because we've been doing good so long and we've seen the do nothing\nTwo weeks and so the point being is that because we've been doing it so long and we've seen the do nothing Republicans time after time where they've had I mean many doors just wide open for them\nBut you've got to get a consistent message out think about where we are right now in terms of social media and communications we have the ability to communicate twenty four seven any given person\nCan be communicating ... that you can set the messages are ahead of time to automatically go out while you're sleeping you can you can communicate right now around the clock\nGet the message out while you've got the economic wins or create some more of those economic wins and you're building again the base you're trying to get more people into the base that aren't on board already what frustrates\nMe is understanding that the left uses the heated heated rhetoric that they that they use\nThey do that out of desperation Mm they can't win on the issues they're angry it's the only thing that they have left because they're they're angry and I understand that on you know the other side on on the the side that I'm most closely relate to\nThat it gets frustrating because they're always just so angry and they're spewing out their hatred towards you and you want to attack back\nWe don't need to because the reason that they're doing it is because they don't have the substance of their ideas behind them and they're frustrated as hell and we don't need to act\nThe way that they do they need to that's the only way they've got nothing else they need to be that way we don't need to be that way some of us choose to be that way we don't need to be that way because we have the substance to back up our ideas that they work\nWell well you know here's here's the you know where where they've gone as a party there former leader was in Nevada and the other night and we've gone over the years from that speech at the DNC in two thousand six or two thousand for\nA to him becoming president and two thousand eight on hope and change to just the other night and Nevada bill ... who vote on well almost it was it because it became ... if you think about it it's not even a political tactic what would you\nWhat I Would have expected to hear from you know the great or greater Brock Obama this big speech built on principles and it was basically\nIf you guys don't get out and vote they're going to win the ... ... okay thanks kept an obvious we already know that don't boo vote okay can you can you can I add a\nLittle bit you know and as we said a total lack of substance on actually hitting the the the issues that's the difference look at you know we talked about how we don't like pit political ideology on either side and but I Do understand\nThat because of political ideology on on the left is based purely on personality in on the right it's not I still don't like political idea I I just don't like political I dollar free we worship a candidate and it's still always has bothered me but the fact is I Do understand if you have great admiration for somebody who is promoting certain principles and ideas\nRight that are that are specific and work and promote freedom and liberty yet then I get it\nBut as you said you saw and I think you you made a great thing Obama was almost begging the other\nWork and promote freedom and liberty yet then I get it\nBut as you ... you saw and I think you you made a great thing Obama was almost begging the other day for what you saw was the shell\nOf the Democrat Party which is the other night which is no ideas just imagery and symbolism yes well except for free stuff yeah yeah ... yeah yeah All right eight six six Ninety red eye", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "25"}
