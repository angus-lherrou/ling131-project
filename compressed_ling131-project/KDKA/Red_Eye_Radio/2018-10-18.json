the fact that you can I had a great time talking with you the last couple of days and I look forward to the next two days and Jerry ... is actually the Sunday night Monday morning\nI could easily get used to filling in for them especially because you've been so gracious to me and you're kind comments about my work\nAnd you can keep in touch with me and see where I Am on the air next on my Web page at Marcus le show dot com where you can email me following me on Facebook or Twitter or leave me a message with a question or comment that I can respond to\nAfter this week I'll next beyond October twenty ninth on another show but ... again check that out on my Web page there are a number of topics I said I Would get to tonight so I Want to keep my word for someone to talk to you about illegal immigration\nI've been talking about this for over ten years now and the air doesn't mean I didn't think about this Twenty years ago and so on but I've never wavered in my position the issue and you guys and bring it up less ...\nCollege last night said you know markets illegal aliens forget it\nSo you have the term document an undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss place them somewhere or loss them\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here legally and the argument might be quickly over if they are legal they're not allowed to be here and the story and another caller so that why you know why is this going on it's pretty simple\nSo it was an example if you own a home and someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in they wouldn't be able to say they wanted your home to go into your home but they just lack the proper documents\nSimilarly if someone walks into your say your bank and wants to take the money out of your account right\nThey were to be asked to prove that it's their account\nSo example how can you ever justify sanctuary cities were criminal illegals are given a safe harbor if you come up with only ...\nThree nine so example how can you ever justify sanctuary cities were criminal illegals or given safe harbor if you come up with phony arguments like illegals will not go you've heard that they won't cooperate with the authorities if they know they can be apprehended or sent home so that's why it's important that you know we have sanctuary for them\nBut how about they not be allowed to come or in the first place and we wouldn't need to care if they cooperated with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate watch this to the evil police officers at ice who have the audacity to arrest people commit crimes that they do these guys are really clever on the left\nSo the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals you're eating schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities so what's my solution\nYou take away the benefits like free health care and free schools you enforce strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you say in the first CEO to jail for hiring and illegal immigrant and they'll never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home\nRun he actually had a right to use the wrong language self deport there we go again with language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no bad if I take it back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nWe but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they be saying for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake enough of the government sending out the wrong message message with actions like a legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents\nA country is United by language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our shared values our ancestors kiss the ground when they landed here at Ellis Island they were so happy to have landed\nAt the land of freedom so let's build that wall and do everything to end the loop legal immigration and take our country

[noise]\n[noise]\nMark I'm back with you again take your calls at eight six six Ninety ... we're talking about illegal immigration and let's see with Fred in Washington DC has to say about it I for it\nAnd I were talking about illegal immigration and let's see what friend in Washington DC has to say about it I for it [noise]\nAh hey well go ahead I I'm a\nLanguage that you talk about one of the biggest glaring things is that you even do it yourself\nBut I Do I used to do it but I'll marry you say American what actually we are us citizens in America and uh the liberals are ... not a liberal that's called radical there\nThey actually taken that word in applied it to everyone on the side of this or so when they when they were talking American you know we think\nThat it's just citizens here no they're thinking the whole world this whole side of the world and immigration means nothing to them I mean this is just normal stuff and we have been brainwashed when we say Americans and they they say American they brainwashed us\nTo think that we're saying citizens and they and they think they're brainwashed us to think that\nEverybody uses American but when you look at your passport if you have one it's a U.S citizen that's what we are\nAnd that's a huge difference we have to be so deliberate with what we say are words have got to be delivered and that's that's got to be a main thing that we have to do even want to air because the the radicals or taken those words that choice\nThat's what I say about\nWell I appreciate your call but I'm not going to give up that word to name I just refuse to do it\nI eat when I hear that word America or Americans it it'd be you know all kinds of patriotism comes to my mind I'm not going to let them use or that and just because they think Americans you know north Americans whenever they want to use it for not going to let them get away with that\nOh and you know some of the songs right America the beautiful let that that's not there's I'm not conceding that to them there's not a chance I'm going to do that\nAnd and I don't want to concede the language at all that's why it's important in a legal immigrants illegal aliens I Know people kept me on that\nUm but I don't I don't see anything to them and and if you do that and then you're kind of giving up a little bit now where Americans we pass for United States citizens great I get it\nBut there's something special about this country called America when the United states of America America usa whenever you want to call it\nAnd so appreciate your call but that's my take on it and now you're national forecast for cobra electrons\nLake effect snow off Lake Ontario on portions of I Ninety will leave a light dusting of snow near Syracuse Rochester buffalo slick roads not expecting a lot of snow with a system\nStates ... states require [laughter] but they're stolen but don't get paid well mainly are quite truly ... states we don't give eight to\n... you don't mean in the United states you mean in the Senate\nArming of the world I mean in the world we don't we give a kid\nYeah well we don't give aid to the Soviet Union I mean you might say on now Russia there are certain countries you know you might say well you made like the China you might say we give them a because they take an unfair advantage of\nA surprise but there are a lot of countries where are we going to have those endeavors actually they were\nActually the Russians are helping us more with the satellites right now than we may be helping them financially but that's not your point your point is a good one which is we're on a charge of the countries I'm a former their illegals coming here I I I kinda liked that idea\nEven though the whole process but\nNo no it's it's an interesting idea\nFor them to monitor their own people at that point\nYou know and as you as you're kind of indicating this and they they love to send us their porn right a lot of especially Mexico writes I send them send us the poor and his ... not our problem right and there's your problem ...\nAnd then you can also add onto that health care bill and for the health care bill I'm Still ... villain for everything that eventually it will stop and dry country of origin will stop stop spending on letting them up\nAnd I know there's nothing like the right in the Senate and that's the point with right now it's been the wrong incentive you come here as I said I don't blame them and you get to go to school for free you get past free hospital care right and you get to a drive in our roads you you know we pay for the roads and\nIs terrific you you you know I I Would come here to that's why I said that\nRight and you get to a drive in our roads you you know we pay for the roads and this is true you you you know I I Would come here to that's why I said\nThe insurance interest and we can make money so you know what\nYeah you should have given us idea to President Trump because that's the way they could be paying for all\nYou can only better than I Do oh really [laughter] I don't think\nThat's a great call thing Steve appreciate it very much actually I I I I did apply um someone told me what to do I do know some people and I was thinking you know I'm a teacher too I Love to be a way up there in the department of education and bought a person I send to then I think eventually\nHe was didn't work with the president and I have a good friend who's a head of communications for I think the department of health\nUh and so yeah it does happen and you know some people but you know a lot\nOf it it's tough and and that's one of the news stories that the I think they were having someone else's leaving the administration it's tough to work there\nEspecially if you're a conservative you don't care about the party's you don't you just want to do a good job you certainly it's not the connections you want it's tough it's tough and a lot of your point that out yesterday that President Trump has given up a lot to become president and I'd say if you could say well it's an ego trip this power all that kind of stuff I don't think he needed that\nI think that was one of the enduring things who needed the abuse of his family right and and now you know if the Democrats getting power that's another thing I mentioned this last couple of days if they get in power not only hearings and subpoenas but you know they're going to go after taxes because they're they're sure they're going to find something there\nThat though oh probably with the Russians I guess right he made some kind of the old the Russians but even if they don't what business is it um there's what his tax returns are it's just not that their business I Know certain presidents have done not I don't think they should it's it's no one's business what you pay in taxes that that should be a private thing it's none of your business Democrats\nOr Republicans I don't I wouldn't want them to know what I don't I\nPay what I'm supposed to pay and do my share but if anybody else's business\nBy the way after the Kavanaugh hearings and all this other stuff as they go after taxes\nWhy to good people exactly why do people want to serve ... especially people that sense why and that leads me to another point I think we should consider\nDemocrats loves serving in government of course for them they believe in much more government so here they get a chance to do that they get a chance to maybe be a bureaucrat and tell you had to live your life\nYeah they're the party that loves to work in government we're the party that has to give something up I think it was Daniel Boone who served for a little while and Congress and you know he he was one of those that hey I Can't wait to get home\nIn the case of Republicans and conservatives I think they're much more likely to say I want to go back to my family and to my life because they don't believe in this the whole part and that's what illegals don't know what makes America special one of the big things he's limited government\nThat government stays out of your lives and don't you find it ironic to say the least\nThat a lot of illegals who come to our country are escaping corruption in government and big government\nAnd what they do when they get here they vote for exactly the same thing they left it's really bad\nSo the you because it it takes a while like a lot of people said yesterday people don't know what's going on right when they do the those man on the street interviews woman on the street interviews and you know they say who's the vice president United States they can't name that that's not so important\nWhat's important is that they know what makes this country special what makes this country except for all that\nIt's important is that they know what makes this country special what makes this country exceptional\nThat we leave the citizens alone we let them live their lives so I teach my students I get and I don't try to indoctrinate them I give them both sides I get why we need traffic lights if we don't have traffic lights you're going to have energy\nBut on every issue you bring before me I Want the government out of my life as much as possible that's why some people question is why I'm conservatives like a government when it comes to things they can't do themselves that would explain a strong military\nI Can't have a tank in my backyard or grenades or is let alone nuclear weapons so there are evil people in the world right that that's another thing that shows this debate in perspective with the illegal immigration they want to open borders on the other side because they think well mostly people are pretty good I I don't believe that\nI Believe people will have a real tendency to be bad and they do awful things like a lynching right like the Germans were out of the strongest tribe and the Eighteenth century and when asked why they did what they did this because we can I don't I don't trust humanity I I don't trust that\nAnd there was something special about this country where we didn't want to trust government and I didn't get into this so much last night's caller mentioned that we have a system of checks and balances the founders were brilliant\nSo there are laws the federal government does their laws right that the states are in charge of and the rest is left to the people they did that on purpose\nBut even there right how do you pass a law you guys know this the house has to pass the Senate has to concur and then the president has to agree if he doesn't agree he vetoes it and then the house and Senate could override it\nAnd then the Supreme Court could say you pass a law that's unconstitutional they really were afraid of big government\nSo that's another big issue with illegal immigrants they don't understand what makes this country so special\nBut most you guys do and even if you're on the left I Want you to explain to me why I'm wrong about illegal immigration give me a
