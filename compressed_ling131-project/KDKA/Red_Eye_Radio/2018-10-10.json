Gurley talking about every ... social issues and whether you're a ... for your job story you're doomed to lose your sous wrote a radio hello and\nWelcome Hughes Gary McNamara I'm Eric hardly as we move into a Wednesday Gary good morning good morning locks\nTo cover a including a hurricane Michael right now we are\nDirectly in the past we've been on the edge of several over the last few years this one we're right in the past so my advice to the people that are are now staying that uh you know once the of\nThe winds get over fifty miles and our our first responders or police fire they're not going to be able to get to you so hopefully you've got enough water and a and food and stuff to take care of yourself\nMayor Greg a bird Nikki of Panama City Florida or where it looks like a you know it's it's headed right right towards and the developments if\nYou want to know the developments over the last couple of hours the ten pm a National Hurricane center or update shows it now at a what a hundred and twenty five miles an hour the women's rights and expected to be right now over a hundred and thirty which would make it\nAt least a category for hurricane that with a hit the\nUm pan handle Gulf Coast right\nThey're they're talking about the storm surge being a a a a really strong strong surgeon and talking about how the the potential\nUh for life threatening conditions is really great with the storm a everyone in this area needs to heed the warnings and and listen to officials and and those directives given by officials are in the coming hours if you haven't already because\nAh you see the pictures and videos of the people in that area I I'm getting ready evacuating a boarding up windows and everything else this is a major storm already and\nHas the potential to be ah in in most believe that will be a historic storm\nOr in terms of the damage\nAnd the size of the storm or it will then move inland with a ton of rainfall we were talking during the pre show meeting as it moves through\nUh the uh the the panhandle of Florida and then goes into north north easterly direction toward the Carolinas that's going to be dumping a lot of rain the Carolinas ... they're saying it will move faster than Florence so it won't present the same problems\nBut the problem is with the areas affected by Florence that are already saturated the ground is already saturated then of course any rain at all is going to cause problems\nBecause they would always ask her and I love this question in rarely is asked to anybody who serves in a Democrat presidents or a cabinet and but\nWell when you disagree with the president how do you deal with it of course I'm going to disagree with the president because my job is not to promote what I Believe it's to promote what the president believes right so of course we're going to have differences but if we have differences we talk about it but it's his administration that I serve in\nIt's like you arrived with one of the reasons we would have trouble ever worked right in any administration\nIs because we have a we would have a problem promoting something that we didn't believe in ... and there are there are people that and and again I have nothing against people who do that that's your job\nYour job is to ... what the administration wants you repeat what the administration wants to the world when you are you in a you know UN ambassador the problem with you and I as we've been talk show hosts too long we just we could\nWe probably couldn't do that or we will get frustrated that are doing that even\nIf the president was even if we thought the president was Ninety percent right we want to get our ten percent in well you can't do that when you're a UN ambassador you have to\nBe the national security advisor to be effective in that position I mean not only that that he that he talks to the public but he's an advisor as opposed to someone who is mimicking or or ... a mess and and both inside the same thing you know because when when they asked him well you know a mile or a [laughter]\nHeads on John Hope [laughter] John Button was asked that he's ... he's always as he said well\nLook when when you were ... when when you were ah you know when you were whatever uh uh ... five years ago you said this and now you're saying this and he said well this is what the president which do I was a private citizen back then the president believes that everything has changed at this point did I Do it but look\nI give the president advice the president I disagree I give him an advice what he does a lot of it is I I'm the national security advisor advisor they find that in a row white I tell him what did I tell them this is what I think you should do right he doesn't necessarily have to follow it and then when he says let's go and do it well then I tell you what the the plan is\nThat the the president and I sit there and I'm just want to pull my hair out saying why are we going through this because everybody knows that already\nWell ... but do they in a nation where they can't name the three branches of government well know there were you know I think the reporters do it because they want to they they are trying to find\nTo show that there is discord within the administration\nScored within the administration [noise] yes yes it is ... and they attempted to do that with Nikki Haley as you mentioned earlier and I think to your point the earlier point you might as well on the list of a possible abilities and and the possible people who might take her\nHer spot I probably wouldn't have seen a Nikki Haley\nUh in that position as strong as she has been when she was governor I probably wouldn't have been able to say wow she's going to go to the un and she's really going to erect some noise you know I don't think ... point so anybody on those lists could be you know are just the strongest stronger as as she's been and\nI trust the president now or maybe not as first year so much but I trust the president now\n... and also trust the situation\nAnd we said this in his second year as he moved into a second year of a presidency we talked about how people who were going to work with him or either on staff or in the cabinet would know what they were in for [laughter]\nAfter that first year and so anybody who accepts that role knows what they're in for which means they're up for that job as well from their perspective we have a busy and great show ahead we do eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nBoy your goals eight six six months she read on the radio [noise]\nJoin

I made a fair point you made a great point ... but you really don't know what you're going to get until you see somebody sitting in front of the un it's almost like a presidential spokesperson for as making the analogy of you is almost like an NFL quarterback you are at an NFL quarterback\nYou have no idea how they're going to perform you'd have no idea right and all we've gotten to get on the field unions like oh they stink I really really good and we I'd mentioned Sarah Huckabee Sanders that that you know most presidential spokes people I don't like but if you would have told me when that and I probably made the comment I don't remember specifically making it\nBut when she came aboard I probably went\nOh I just don't think she has a right away was I wrong\nYou know and and and she has been very she doesn't even flinch anymore or ... if you look at the nature of the ridiculous questions thrown at her every single day now it's just it's more like a game\nAnd that's the way she plays it but at first it was not a game and and it it's not an easy job\nIt's not a job that anybody would want but she's been very good at it and you're right with few exceptions\nLike a John Bolton you know you pretty much know what you're going to get the John Bolton but otherwise ah there are a lot of people on that list and and and we'll see but clearly again going in I think they know what they're in for a not only internationally and what we're dealing with at the un but of course\nOr as this moves its way out of here it's wins will be affecting the Florida and south and North Carolina shoreline and in fact the last time there was a storm of that kind of situation that came through was Kate in Nineteen eighty five and Kate's case Kate at the same time\nIt's wins wrapping around the giant Winfield were causing storms and um and tornados along the Carolinas and the Carolinas have got a pretty good chance of of multiple tornadoes associated with this and and\nYou know anyone in this entire area of the Big Bend and the panhandle\nUh are are going to basically relate to a K which happened to be in Nineteen eighty five [noise]\nUm but this is going to blow Kate out all the water\nTom in terms of the the the danger coming ashore because I think a lot of people may be who are looking at you know the I coming ashore but I mean the where the danger and the potentially\nLife threatening situation start what is that timeline where is that window and and what should we expect during that time line\nOkay when it comes to the timeline or what you should expect 'em by tomorrow morning it's still should be off shore and it will be properly ... bill a category three but\nA category three but darn close to a category for it I wouldn't be shocked if in the next ... in in a in one hour from now I may be upgraded but by Wednesday evening it should be on shore\nAnd so that would be in line with Tallahassee it would be coming across Tallahassee bites Thursday evening it shouldn't be entering the Carolina and cutting right across the middle of the Carolinas\nAnd so the eastern side of it will be the onshore winds and the rain and the storms so Charlotte and end up the coast\nAnd then they don't need any more uh destruction or anything now wins are going to be around forty five miles an hour\nOr when it gets to the Carolinas and that's going to be Thursday morning\nBut on Wednesday today or we're gonna have wins in Tallahassee tonight of at least eighty miles an hour and a and a probably sustained winds up to forty or fifty miles an hour going through Tallahassee\nUm we're looking at wins that are going to be up to a hundred miles an hour [noise] or when we get to a coming onshore and the storm surges the other really bad situation [noise] ah from pretty much I don't want to include Panama City Panama City six to nine foot storm surge\nAnd that's in part because their shoreline faces a little more to the southwest and so\nUh when it comes in and if it comes in to the east the winds are going to be backing so it will reduce that effect but you get past that to saint Joe which is on the peninsula they're swinging around toward Appalachian coal ah ah we're looking at the storm surge that will run all the way around through the entire big band\nThat doesn't include cedar key um of nine to Thirteen feet while\nYeah nine to Thirteen feet um obviously once your past three feet cars float\nMm yeah and and then so we're talking about a ... again in terms of that immediate threat really the greatest threat right now in those areas along the shoreline we're talking storm surge correct\nI storm surges is clearly from the you know there's a storm surge warning in effect from Panama City past crystal river and and so as an example um we're looking in Panama City tonight they'll start seeing wins moving their way up to fifty miles an hour\nAnd all the way through an average for fifty miles an hour through Wednesday night they're going to have gosh Wednesday night or as this storm has come ashore of a hundred miles an hour and a storm surge of\nEight to twelve feet or excuse me rain I'm Sorry of eight to twelve inches a foot of rain so\nInland and even on the coast flash flooding is going to be a common event that range got to go somewhere and and once you start to inundate the water starts to rise under a storm surge um then from there then you start dealing with the rain on top of that\nAnd so we saw that in New Bern a newborn uh on friday night before the storm came in and the Carolinas the winds were coming out of the southeast and blowing up\nThe Neuse River New Bern is at the end of the Neuse River and they had a water rise of ten point two feet\nAnd and we had the um we had a a lieutenant I'm dropping his name but the lieutenant of the police department there the following day\nAnd day talking about the uh friday night rescues which were over three hundred and fifty boat rescues um that night\nAbout well I'm a ... again uh the you know I this this should go without saying but but certainly we want to repeat it as often as possible the people that are are in the path of this storm need to heat all of the directors and warnings given by local officials do not hesitate\nA that this is this is going to be a a life threatening storm it is already a life threatening storm and it is right now you have time to get out of the way of the storm a Tom ... in terms of uh the the rainfall you mentioned\nA that we're going to see in some places maybe eight to twelve inches of rain um the flooding potential though won't necessarily be like it was because of Florence because the storm is moving faster is that correct\nYeah to some degree that's correct but still I expect many areas to pick up anywhere from eight to twelve inches as we move inland through Tallahassee\nAnd then from there when we move across the border into Georgia [noise] we're still going to be looking at five inches of rain or more in many areas so I can pull up some maps and break that out\nUm next time we taught buttery the fact of the matter is that it only takes you know it doesn't take a lot of water if the ground saturated for run off to start flash flooding right and we all know the usual places where flash flooding takes place\nWell the difference here is that this storm like the Carolinas along the coast are going to cause flooding in the places that are not the usual places and\nYeah All right and and and when when you expected to onshore\nI expect onshore between three and four o'clock okay uh this afternoon fair\nAlright alright meteorologist Tom hale you're going to be with us throughout the morning thank you Tom tom and they don't standing coverage for us as he mentioned with Hurricane Florence a and also uh last year with a Hurricane Irma in in Florida so uh we are we just want to make\nSure that uh everyone knows we're going to be on this for you this morning and tomorrow morning thank you time we'd greatly appreciate it will talk to you in just a bit look forward to it\nThank you uh we will ah again also be checking in with our meteorologist than John trap a next hour I get an update from from him a and a as we go through the morning any updates also from officials are in Florida or the national\nWeather service will bring those and we do have a ... another Fifteen minutes we will have the national Hurricane Center ... latest report that basically the\nThe cone yeah and you look look at what Tom was saying and he's expecting a that this could be they could upgrade the storm to a category for hurricane ah with this next report that's coming out here and just a bit\nAnd we will go over that with Tom the next time we talk to them and we'll be doing that later in the in the program as well and again meteorologist John trout on board as well to give us a his latest a perspective an update or in the next hour we'll talk to him eight six six Ninety read
