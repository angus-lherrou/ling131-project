benefits of the lottery Mm about half of Americans play the lottery according to the most recent survey compared to almost Seventy percent of people in the Nineteen eighties\nYou know that doesn't make sense though because I I've often told the story in the Nineteen eighties I remember I was going to a party ...\nI stopped by this liquor store to pick up a bottle of us are Christmas Party and there was ... apparently some lottery going on but I didn't even know about it because right ... that's not\nTo to use the cliche the lotteries never even on my radar really is right I'll pass by it as I'm doing show prep for the show but it's something that's never been on my radar and all ...\nSo there I was in the liquor store and I just immediately I as I got it for about a second I stood in a real long line of about twenty five people\nBut as soon as I got on the line I didn't even look to see what if they were holding bottles or whatever I just saw the long line ... twenty five people there and I just did it in the ... no no no you you appear why am I going to cut goes no no no you're buying alcohol nobody in line for alcohol the liquor store everybody is in line\nI was I was a

you think it's a cat but it kind of [laughter] we didn't work but\nIt's more like as as somebody when they came over to my house one time and they'd seen pictures of my cat that came over and they said\nThat's not a cat I said it talking about the ... it's the panther fan [laughter] I'm pretty sure that when he was hanging out at the [laughter] yeah it was like okay this is sixteen pounds yeah

are complete and total election coverage and everything that's going on and and I think it's important because we talked about the polls but I think it's more important to talk about the issues\nThat may be affecting what's going on in the stock market yesterday and the volatility of the stock market\nYou know caterpillar not worried why because they're building their parts more expensive why the terrorists we look at issues that could possibly affect\nAnd hurt the Republicans one of the things that we didn't talk about yesterday was the farmers farmers aren't happy because of the tariffs you may you may have destroyed family farms that have existed for a long time\nA big because you've taken away because of the terrorists taking away their supply chain yeah and as we told you win even though the president came out and said okay we're going to free up money for them they said that's not going to save us right because that doesn't that doesn't make up for the last is that right ... and the fact that we're not we're going to be shut out of the supply chain\nThat for ... and we don't know for how long I mean are they could lose their livelihood with farmers I mean this is for them it's it is their livelihood so that that towers over Kavanaugh and the caravan and and and anything else that might influence vote and this is they could lose their lively\nAnd you've had a ton of small businesses out there that have been affected by the tariffs on steel and aluminum\nTariffs you think about that in front of them hit them in any industry in any region right and in our region its its oil and gas but a farming or an ... in the mid west there are every ... every other business is essentially related to that economy the farming O'Connor me\nSo it's not just the farmers but it's the other yep a business is in that area that are supported by the\nAnd that's an unknown quantity right I don't know how you figure I don't know how a lot of these things I don't know how you

everything that that has gone on I mean uh you get every single day I mean I saw you know that uh okay that looks like now that the Republicans are going to lose the house yesterday but then I saw other articles standing well no that's not the case and that's why\nBut if you see some of these districts in these in these blue states but even in in some even in Texas there are a ton of people that may be hit\nOh yeah because you because you have that cap on it ... you can give tax rates very um\nYou know from you you can go just a from where I live to just uh you know several miles north\nAnd the tax rate varies greatly yeah and then of course the value of the home yeah that influences the a lot of I bought my tax rate in my town is higher than a quite a bit higher than yours I Believe I'm a yeah my my tax rate is is very low which is why it's one of the most attractive areas in terms of\nPeople moving to it um but even aside from that if you've got a a home that's worth\nMore than ... where's your your taxes are higher and lower rate right so when when you see that and you see the number of of of people and and remember ... ... the the the\nPeople that will be

class\nRight and they're getting hit and they don't like it and what's their only recourse right now\nStill a supporter of Trump but what's their recourse to send the message my Republican congressman mhm and we've always we worried about that from the very beginning I don't know how it's\nFirst to send the message my Republican congressman mhm [noise] and we've always we worried about that from the very beginning\nI don't know how it's going to affect I'm simply bringing up the issues out there that when it comes to people's individual budget when it comes to them paying more money I don't care who you are nobody wishes to do that\nAnd even though won't change everybody's vote\nIt has the potential of changing\nFive percent of the vote yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election so that's that's a you know that's one thing we've talked about the Democrats\nAnd we've talked about what what they face the whole cabinet thing I'm just the insanity that has come a out of the uh the Democrats the ... the the the fact that they plan\nAnd this was the one thing that made by the person that\nIs they're coming out bluntly and saying we're going to raise taxes so many of them coming out now I'm going to raise taxes now we're going to raise taxes not we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise the corporate tax going and we need to raise taxes more we need to raise taxes\nThey're actually admitting where they're going to raise taxes which could hurt them we've also talked about the care of it rather than we're in the Republican Party that's one I'm\nYesterday auto auto dealers see slower sales sparking fears along expected declined is here now the economy overall may not be an end and the terrorists overall may not change a significant portion of people voting in this election\nBut it will change those small business people that are being affected and a caterpillar a ... where is it to the ... caterpillar story\nThen they're they're being blunt the terrorists are killing us write the steel and and autumn the the steel and aluminum tariffs\nBy the way and that this isn't a China thing right it's the United states and Europe and and and Mexico but they're still in effect mhm and it's killing them it's raising the price as we said\nWhen the president came out and said there I delivered for you I gave you the I gave you the the new NAFTA or whatever you wish to call it nobody's using the new name by the way [laughter] All right\nAnd and uh the his you know and the only success that that he claimed\nThe the biggest thing that he promoted was what he did to the automobile business and we said that's an unbelievable but he's promoting the fact that he has raised the cost of buying an automobile in the United states Mexico and Canada and that's viewed as a good thing was a story last week about foreign grumbling\nGoing to be losing a billion dollars and they believe the terrorists are going to ... that are hurting them remember every supplier and every small business that deals with Ford in the United states knows that that's coming\nOr or or or feeling it already and every dealership and every day I was a member of the steel tariffs really been affects that we're from China which has increased the cost from the beginning of the year that's actually that's actually nine months ten months old now because the steel prices were up ... percent by the time we got\nTo June of this year so you look at that you look at the fact that automobiles are going to go up in price because of steel costs and now because of terror of cost and because of the new NAFTA ah and then the farmers as we had mentioned in the last break\nThe farmers that are being hit and you're talking about\nUh your your talk or if you're talking about a manufacturing people would manufacturing jobs that have technical skills ton of those people are Trump supporters if you talk about\nA manufacturing people with manufacturing jobs at a technical skills ton of those people are Trump supporters if you talk about the farmers you're talking Trump country and you're talking about farmers that are stream Lee upset because it's not only their current profits\nBut it's the fact that they may be shut out of the supply chain that took them decades to get into and now it's disappeared you made the comment you said a in our personal meaning you said I Wonder if that's why he went to you know even though was wishy washy ethanol plan\nI Wonder if that's why he went to Iowa because by the internal polls were saying you're getting killed with the farmers right now\nAs a couple of weeks ago because I Will would be basically the center of the corn belt but the farm belt ... it's not that everything is about the the votes in Iowa or any election in Iowa\nIt's that you're trying to reach that region when you go to Iowa you're speaking to the industry the farming industry not just a ethanol and corn but it's the farming industry uh you you want to reach out with that saying we're going to help the farmers are and and you know in this region in this area in the state\nAnd I don't know what you do in terms of of ah of reconnecting the supply chain this is what they're worried about uh they need to have those farmers those companies\nNeed to have trade partners all around the globe and when those trade partners for instance when Mexico a set up a port trade with with Canada\nOr any nation that they're selling to those farmers if they're going a different direction as a result of a threat of a tariff or a chair of the that went into place or or any of that if they have to make arrangements a lot of time a lot of time you don't get that back right away\nYou're not you're not going to get that business back right away and that's the concern that this is why the farmers\nCame out a couple of weeks ago and said look ah thanks but no thanks on this you know a four point seven billion dollar a handout we need the business the business is worth a lot more\nRight it's still not making up for what our losses All right and we're ... we're we're ... or out of the loop and the supply chain now we don't know when we're going to get back in ... I took a deck I think one of the ... was it took us decades to get into the world's supply chain now are viewed as unreliable because they don't know what you will do\nRight uncertainty as a killer this is what we saw after the recession\nThe problem with bailing out all the banks are are putting money into all the banks the coffers of all the banks by the federal government or during the recession or in two thousand eight to ... end of two thousand eight and ... and into a two thousand nine they there were three apparently large banks that were on the brink that we're a\nPossible high risk but they didn't want to run on those banks so they put money in all of the coffers well then it made all the banks look risky and that's the problem you create you muddy the waters well when you talk about trade\nTrade deals between nations that are set up um you don't you don't reconnect that bridge it's\nLike blowing up a bridge and believing you can rebuild it repair it tomorrow\nYou can't\nThat's going to take a lot of planning that is going to take a lot of reassuring but if there's political uncertainty\nAnywhere in that\nThen your former customers are going to stick with someone else a another nation in this case and they're going to get their supply chain repaired\nOur discussion right now is not really so much on the the the substance of the economics of it it's more of the politics of what is going to be affecting this\nOh it's not really so much on the the the substance of the economics of it it's more the politics of\nWhat is going to be affecting this this ... election we talked a lot yesterday about\nHow the Republicans in so many ways were set up in a way that you don't see a political party ... in a midterm election with a ton of positives and de opposition political party that the Democrats are in a complete mess\nAnd that there are many things because the the economy right now but the majority of Americans looks really good mhm well we're talking about is the ... you know in the the impacts that starting to be felt now and making investors very where wary and a core\nConstituency of the of of Trump supporters which are the farmers that aren't happy\nAt all now so even though there's a lot of good for Republicans right now there is still bad lurking out there uh when it comes to economics that there are Trump supporters that are extremely wary about where he is you know where he may be taking", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "24"}
