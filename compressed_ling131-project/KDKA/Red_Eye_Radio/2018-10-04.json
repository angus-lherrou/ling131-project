the president of the ... did not put that in front of them did not send that to the committee so the chairman of that committee on friday wrote a letter to the Senate Judiciary committee and said um he doesn't speak for the committee\nSo and there's you don't use them in the store and there and Yahoo News is still using this isn't the story\nThey did choose day the correction letter from the

what happens\nI mean it's almost a a a a a a guaranteed right just like when somebody asked us back in twenty sixteen oh you're going to be surprised Trump's going to win I said well actually we won't

near twin falls will continue to see showers\nI Can't say for certain that it was\nThis kind of motivation across the board I think it was big but this is what this is different because of the culture that's being created by the left and the media on the left\nThis is this is different than an objection to high taxes and and things that are very real\nHere this is a\nA behavior a pattern of behavior by the left that's being very clearly demonstrated over and over again\nAnd I remember uh other you know intense times that were based on a particular issue and uh for example after the twenty sixteen election\nWhen when uh a W was talking about uh you know the bridge loan mhm uh\nAnd you had and and and even before that right or before the election or you had the the the passion when they talked about a bailout and or I Know in ... but that wasn't unification there were people there was an intensity there\nThat exist to McCain fined gold you and I were working together or ... McCain Feingold McCain Kennedy right right uh the immigration bill mhm that was a that was a that is when they you know blue the phones out of the ... of Capitol Hill you remember that when I read that\nOn a specific topic yeah I ... the same thing right that's yeah titles are short lived yeah sure sure like this this is different because it is about Kavanaugh ... but it isn't just about\nIt's about Kavanaugh right this this this isn't about this isn't really about Trump and and reading right here at because they're brighter than a Wall Street journal\nOr interesting that they write this the same day that you know do the same week that you know you and I are having the same thought going while it was the never conservatives the capping off fight isn't about Trump we're all deplorable now\nAh and it says you look at you know talks about the cabinet is part of you know a isn't part of the whole Trump ism thing right he's he's separate from that can believe that we've talked about how many never Trump or as we mentioned this last week how boom I said ooh wow all of a sudden they are absolutely\nIn in support of of of cabinet and furious and I even talked about the never Trump or is that I Know that had built alliances with Democrats because of their hatred towards Trump yes and now they're fighting with each other because when it comes down to it\nWell except maybe for Bill Kristol\n[laughter] the one the one old out except for except for Bill Christ that I haven't seen anything from Georgia and it's like yeah exactly so you know they're not part of the ... he he's not some and they write and he's done some Steve Bannon insurgent\nAnd the judge is the epitome of the G O P legal establishment a Supreme Court nominee from central casting\nAnd it and you know and it's a great point spent twenty six years in public service and the hope what what and that's why it's not about him what I think it would I think it is and I think it's bigger than just Cavanaugh\nI think it's the realization from ... from a I think you're the realization from a lot of people that don't like Trump yeah and\nDon't like where the Republican Party is going\nWhere they realized a we've got to come home for a while because those people are insane I Know a case you're Cortez yesterday said the writers insane or we'll go through whether she actually had any substance to that but when we talked about the many things out there when you see\nWhat what are the left is doing to Kavanaugh when you see the presumption of innocence is is gone when an allegation itself is enough to destroy someone's life\nThis goes beyond a political issue it goes to what one Trump the election it is the it is the culture war but it's also and and and I say a culture where because it's a war on\nIt it's it's it's about it's about fairness it's about the belief in the constitution look we don't we were never tremors we've criticized Trump we were you know we were never on that never ever got about ... we voted for\nYou and I don't practice political I dollar tree we don't worship anybody you're not going to see us in rallies going ra ra ra whatever my candidate does we will tell you who was the best ... well you know who has the best idea on what particular issue and why\nAnd we ended up voting for the person who most reflects what we believe not everything that we believe because that would be impossible as and as adults\nWill see that what do we know now you [laughter] [laughter] I mean we don't want to go for air as I read Rick Perry and\nOne of his ... one of his first interviews after dropping out of the election and two hundred sixty and you know well ah you know I guess he wasn't your first choice the interviewer will know my first choice was\n[laughter] and and so I I think when when you see that that ... it it's just been it's been brought back to many of these ... going on and many of them\nOh and many of them who started making alliances with people on the west yeah\nYou know trying to build these emotional as I saw on social media from some of the people but I Know that are never Trump hers but all of a sudden the brakes have been put ongoing whoa you'd really do this\nI mean you really do this is what you really we wow\nWhat will you know we thought you know this is almost like the McCain funeral what we thought that there are actually people out there in the Democratic side they don't want it to come together to find the common ground that we have and now the realization is no they don't and I think a lot of people this is a wakeup call\nLook the party isn't perfect [laughter] if you listen to the show you know when we talked about the Republican Party [laughter] ah\nOr listen to the pocket from yesterday showed [laughter] but the the the party isn't perfect but again everything's\nWhen you get to this point to the actual election it's a binary choice mhm it's a choice between this group in that group neither perfect so what do you do you look for the best one and I think that's what a lot of a member Trump ... looking at right now saying\nWhoa ... know who you know when when um oh ... who was it uh I'm trying to think of the the the the person oh oh yeah yeah it was ... was Glenn Beck who said he couldn't vote for Trump rather vote for Hillary\nRight yeah ah I thought this would because I I I saw that a a Shapiro interviewed him or he interviewed Shapiro or something like that and I saw it on social media and a lot of people furious excuse me he said don't vote for Trump vote for Hillary\nAnd and that kind of you know that kind of thought process doesn't exist right now well except for Bill Kristol\nA and and uh that uh Jonathon ... they're at a ...\nOn Fox News on the on the the the money block and I think Fox Business news as well he was one of those otherwise conservatives that when\nIt came out with the I'm with her remember that yes hash tag I'm with her right yeah by the way that was after the the the house report that house GOP report the eight hundred page report\nOn Ben guys\nYeah so I I think that's you know what's happening so again or you look at that and you say wow ... ... for Republicans then I see this Washington Examiner or which is a for anybody to know a very conservative outlet\nGOP gloom Republicans predict house majority will be swept away by democratic spending sue nominee\nFive weeks before the critical midterm elections House Republicans are outgunned and out man as a constellation of well sourced democratic groups dedicated to winning the majority overwhelm GOP defenses\nFrom financially flushed superPACs flooding the zone with advertising to grassroots organizations directing money and volunteers to targeted areas around a dozen

we're there to the point and these are the people the money people behind it saying we're going to be swept\nAnd we're going to be swept by the Democrats yeah so which one is true well ... and and there's what you have while you have the election right exact election\nDay in and remember um ah oh Casio Cortez her opponent spent a I think it was somewhere around three million and she spent right\nMonetarily not forget money doesn't always win you know it it is the message is also the motivating\nFactors that we've talked about and clearly Kavanaugh\nOne way or the other I mean it and
