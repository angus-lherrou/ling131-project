year [laughter] well known as the instantly it will be on the court it would be in the courts and and the the problem the problem is and we'll get to more specifics on it the problem is\nThat the courts even if they get a hold of it will not actually go to the core of the question a of the the the fourteenth amendment and how it's written it all in all likelihood the federal courts and maybe the federal courts make came out and just say and\nThis is because Congress reaffirmed the fourteenth amendment back in Nineteen fifty two and they said we agree with that law we agree with the way it's written ... in fifty to the ... Congress said that so the interpretation by many legal experts in probably by many judges\nIs that since birthright citizenship was going on at the time and Congress says yes we agree with this and it's in the immigration and naturalization law we agree with the way the fourteenth amendment is written and it's been interpreted\nThe wrong way still chose Congress approves of it and the courts may come out and say federal courts would probably come out and say because they would cherry pick them mhm and it would be you know a ... and they would come out and said nope sorry you can't get involved in it and in all likelihood\nBecause of that Nineteen fifty two congressional ruling there is a great chance but the Supreme Court would just say\n... as the Supreme Court has done before we're not going to get to the interpretation of it like it took\nOver a ... close to two hundred and ... was a right to two hundred and Thirty years before they ever said that the second amendment was an individual right and you look two hundred and Thirty years but the Supreme Court to finally get to that point\nIf you get don't get to the exact right case and write it in the exact same with the right way\nSo Congress has so many so the Supreme Court is forced to look at it\nThey may just come back and said nope you don't have jurisdiction their end of story and so you never actually get to whether the you know get to deciding what the original intent was like they did in the Heller mhm for the for the second amendment mhm and that's the problem\nSo in all likelihood we won't see it changed in my lifetime because of that great I Wish we would because the original intent had nothing to do with illegal immigrants and and that and and children of illegal immigrants in this country that I ever did right eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nFor six weeks rewrote our own radio [noise]\n\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accidents three miles then register to joined the million mile club on line that red eye radio show dad come red eye radio and our sponsors support your safety on the highway\nEveryone eventually sees when trucks carrying side grocery store shelves good to help a community\nProducts they keep the business running\nDo what they don't see is what the trucker carries inside you're driving your history your pride would we do\nWe see you know\nWe see you carry a career that help support families communities\nWe see you carry the title of friend and neighbor parenting provider we see you carry the sacrifice and the perseverance\nEach was a determination to get the job done\nWhat you carry inside\nEach was a determination to get the job done\nWhat you carry inside\nBecause it's what's inside\nAttention owner operators how are you tired of chasing empty promises RSVP it looking for you to join their team offering a dollar Seventy five per mile or sell a drivers or two dollars per mile per teams are asked me ... that had an back home or not in vocabulary they're no trailer rentals needed no hidden secret\nHow our I think keep today an eighty eight RSVP three six five that's a A R S P three the next five or apply online an RSP P.

United States versus ... ark but that case merely helping a child born on us all the parents who are lawful permanent legally dominance out residents\nWas a citizen even though they said in it they expanded it out that wasn't part of the law so they actually did not create legal precedent to that point right\nNow the only other problem that the the the president would have with that and and by the way I'm I'm from the\nAnd and I I Know you are to uh uh I'm from of course when you understood why they pass the fourteenth amendment to begin with you know after reconstruction and you know it had to civil rights act of Eighteen sixties over right right where you knew what that everybody knew it had to do with former slaves yes that that's what that's\nWhat it was all about because the parents are of of those children being born the children being born slaves\nThe the parents in that case were not subject to any foreign ... now that the problem is because uh I as I said I don't believe will see it in our in my lifetime I'd I'd be you know that's really a dump statement because who knows how long I'm going to live\nBut [laughter] but if I Lived Thirty years more All right let's throw out a figure\nFor Thirty years or you know I I I still don't think will will will see it because I think one of the road blocks is look the president's right I agree with the president on this uh but the problem is that Congress in Nineteen fifty two added to the immigration and naturalization act\nThey added a portion that basically agreed with the way that the fourteenth amendment was written they said we agree with this this is the what immigration should be this now they didn't they didn't specify\nAnd they didn't say a children of illegal immigrants become citizens all they said was we agree with that\nAnd so the courts probably will look at that saying well since at that time\nThey didn't say we disagree with how it's been interpreted and we disagree and the law should change and you know when it comes to illegal immigrants because they didn't make the change\nThat many judges in the federal system including the Supreme Court might just say well that's up to them too they they interpreted that way or we go back to Eighteen Ninety eight and even though the the courts it's not technically legal precedent wasn't opinion\nAre based there that the court might just refuse to hear it\nRight\nAnd send it back down and it may never get to the point of talk of defining what jurisdiction mean a venture early we will get a bench Lee someday we will get to it but it took two hundred and over two hundred and Thirty years to get to the ... was it to hell or two thousand eight\nWas it two thousand eight hundred thousand five two thousand I forgot about roughly two hundred and thirty\nIt was it to hell or two thousand eight it was a two thousand eight hundred thousand five two\nThousand I forgot about it's roughly two hundred and Thirty years it it ... it took ... to finally had the Supreme Court interpret the second amendment yeah that it was an individual right\nSo uh yeah two thousand at a time flies so\nThat that's the problem in that you you have you have to word it the exact same way\nI just don't don't see it but those\nAre the legal challenges that you face right now that the Eighteen Ninety eight opinion that's\nNow law which uh again this is where the fourteenth amendment was not written specifically to address it as a true construction as you would look at it and say doesn't say it applies to non citizens\nAnd in order to apply in order and and you would need to that's how I Would do it as a construction is doesn't say it if you want to stay differently than say it differently but it but it doesn't include it\nBut will it ever get to that point where they even the Supreme Court actually hears and the whole goal is to define what subject to the jurisdiction of the fourteenth amendment actually means will we ever get to that legal place\nIs my question Brian again I just I don't see it in the next Thirty years I'll\nThrow that out for example but it's a way to start the ball rolling\n... yeah I mean I I think ah it certainly brings up the the debate and we if if the president is you know going to take action near through executive order then you're going to see it in the courts the question is will the high court take a case like this\nAnd and so when you look at the question yesterday where I struggled when I heard it I said well it's really the wrong question because it's kind of president do this what the executive order of course he can if nobody challenges\nThat can do it effectively as the question and and right now he's not going to be able to do anything effectively ... the only thing is is that it was a political reaction to\nThe the caravan ... ah to well illegal immigration in general um and and the president's not wrong or whether he's doing it now or any other time\nAnd the approach maybe that's the point maybe the whole point is let's see if we can if if this thing because they know full well it's going to be challenged\nAnd so at that point you you decide when you know you're going to announce this\nNow we understand to the uh the political leverage that that is is created quite possibly or by just the announcement of between you know now and and uh well six days for about the mid term\nBut beyond that it is also something that I think in the current political climate that has to be discussed because ultimately what does it do\nNow it it\nUp the discussion but I think it gives us closer to and hopefully somebody on the right will\nPosition the Democrats to finally\nSay that they're for open borders mhm so that's you know that's part of the I guess that's the political side of it the effect of it the legal side of it will be interesting but it won't be quick ... this isn't going to happen\nOr it the the exam\nWon't be quick ... this isn't going to happen\nOr\nIt the the executive order will come out and it will be immediate an injunction immediately will be a new immediate block from the courts\nAnd then they will go into the courts and it will sit there for however long it takes to get ... and I don't go to see if it ever\nGet right and this is something that I I I again I doubt it would be fast tracked no because because it's it's not like the travel\nBan right that affected people immediately right\nSo it would just not the yelling was what like what what what you could make the the executive branch could make the case and the travel ban that there was a an immediate threat\nThat we had people traveling from certain parts of the world that had been trained and that were coming here and that\nYeah it was reasonable to review that process that travel process from those parts of the world\nAnd and that was something that they could make the case for in this case it's not that kind of wild many conservatives might say look at it is a it's an immediate threat or has been a threat for a long long time the problem is well get technically it has been for you know a hundred and fifty plus years but", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio",
