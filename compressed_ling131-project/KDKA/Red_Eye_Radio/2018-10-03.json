one\nThe one to the White House or I Know here in Texas Ted Cruz's office in the in Houston got a couple of letters that were suspicious but nothing ended up you know are being there so we'll have that for you the New York times story on Trump's family taxes\nYeah I was really a a an interesting read because through it I'm like what's the crime what's the crime All right so the IRS reviewed all this All right so what's the crime so you're choosing the Irish are being the lenient oh you know what's the what's the crime\nAs I was going through the you know the the ... an entire artist yeah\nWhere did he actually break the law Fred Trump not dying right Freda ah because you know Donald Trump or this this was not about his personal taxes it was about his father's\nAs you mentioned in his father's been dead since Nineteen Ninety nine Fred Trump passed in Nineteen Ninety nine but that's OK fair game go after a dead guy on how he set up\nThese so called shell corporations was it a legal corporation or not was what he did legal or not are you going to do the same with Warren Buffett by the way or any of the billionaires\nThat do the same thing set up tax shelters all the time\nYou'd you'd have to do this on how many people just in New York city New York times just in New York city forget about Warren Buffett he's out in Omaha the you know they don't travel to the mid ... middle\nPart [laughter] and and [laughter]\nThey return their their work boots and their coveralls\nTo Amazon or after thinking about it for a minute after the election uh last uh in twenty sixteen but the the entire ah the entire story shows where the law was broken\nSo we'll get to that coming up here and just a little bit students demand a professor be fired at three promotes due process under the law\nOr best headline of the day and like this one ... floods wildfires yet you candidates are running on climate change all of that one on Amazon to pay Fifteen bucks an hour that seem to be a big story yesterday will add to that what happened to the ... documents story and a Russian collusion\nBecause that story just has been buried since I don't remember that one what was that throughout well it's it's I mean that that have nobody has has covered it in and we did all I think about a week ago we we brought it up we said oh so Trump decided not to release it but\nHe didn't go to the he didn't go to his a director of intelligence\nAbout the uh the information whether she'll be declassified he went to the inspector general we don't go to the inspector general ... just classify something you go to the inspector general give something because you perceived there might be corruption and what you have ... for ... for electronic fears are forecast\nMay not sound like much that an area could get six inches of rainfall and be under flash flood watches and warnings but that's what we have over the next couple of days\nI'm fusion GPS who then gave the money to Christopher Steele who got the information uh from people he claims inside\nThe Kremlin the unverified dirt on Donald Trump and we know it was done with that on verified dirt so that's where the Christopher Steele you know whole thing comes comes in a to this ah\nAnd ... and one of the key players they're fusion GPS or was married to still is married but at the time her husband was a high ranking a department of Justice Marshall Bruce Bruce or and then\nWe know what they used you know the the Pfizer worn and all that ... well so we wanted well wait a minute says makes sense you you don't give it to the inspector general the inspector general only looks at corruption and\nAh\nAnd by the way that's almost a replay of what happened I think maybe it was a ... a week ago Monday arrives down we brought it up yeah because there were just other things and we just started going over it and we went we don't understand why would you give it to the inspector general of the inspector general ... you know you get this information at San redacted you're looking at it\nAnd and and ah all of a sudden oh the light bulb goes off it would be an internal matter which would be in a scenario like this if it is\nA fact that people\nAt the Justice Department are under in the Obama administration\nWere\nOr more working to get information and use that false information that dust yet\nA to get a warrant knowingly using it to get a ... a warrant then that would be corruption that would be abuse of power that would be a massive well\nIt it leads to the the the claim a from Rudy Giuliani mhm\nThat ah the he believes they committed perjury right yes that they that they they they signed documents stating that this information is intelligence mhm when in reality it was simply you know a opposition research and I was and they knew that it wasn't intelligence and they\nVowed for its authenticity ... often to city or credibility ... and and you know again that's what Giuliani said we don't know but it only goes to the inspector general\nIf they believe people there because we're would begin if that was what had happened right then than it would start inside the Justice Department with American people reaching out to in this case you know Christopher Steele or an impossible you know we don't know if there was anybody else involved we do know when he was involved but\nBut if if you if you do the unwritten action and and they're saying well it's too sensitive well that would be again\nThe director of national intelligence your ah your attorney general in the head of the FBI a foreign powers and so you wouldn't be going in that particular direction and probably\nYou will be discussing it especially with my ... secretary of state former CIA director and say okay you need to talk to the British are because we need to get this a release\nYou know what do they want to keep quiet and not that that may not be that that could be being done right now we don't know or could have been done already\nBut to say I'm giving it to the inspector general to look at it look at why\nInspector general only looks and corruption right they look at corruption in the department he's looking for corruption in the department of justice\nThat's what his job is his job is not to declassify is not just jobs not to look at a a document say wow I don't think you should declassify in and that was the impression that you got when the story first came out\nIt's like oh wait a minute he's inspector general under that right\nOh mhm\nSo after they on rejected it apparently someone in the administration looked at it and said this is corruption given to the inspector general\nBecause that's because that's what you would look at it the the inspector general's basically are there to investigate what happened in in the Justice Department I mean that's the whole purpose of that position to do that is essentially that internal\nAh investigation he the the inspector general's office really as internal affairs or you know to a large degree so when\nAnd and it when they saw that if I could see General Kelly looking at the president and saying Mr President\nIf you come out and point things out that's going to be purely political right so it only has you know there's we we have to build a political will to go after people\nIf the inspector general comes out with an official report that's different not that the president\nAnd the end and uh the ... sessions couldn't go after people for this it's that it would start in the political arena if you have this over to the inspector general who was appointed by Obama this is the process by the way\nThe process by the way if if you look at a you know the things that Trump has done\nNot talking about you know the things about uh the licensing for the NFL or or or licensing for the media the FCC licenses for the media or any of that not not the words not what he has said but what he has done he's been very respectful of the process and this would be the process you would want to go through\nTo see to have the inspector general\nLook at it and say please take a look at this and and do your due diligence here to see if this is exactly if if it's what we see\nAnd then you noticed the media you know you had some what websites covered I didn't even see Fox saying why the inspector general well they somebody may have done it I've not seen it and I haven't seen it on their website right but I haven't seen really anything maybe ... or maybe a\nA you know National Review covered it the federalist I don't uh you know I Andrew McCarthy did I but I didn't see it right but it just the media went completely quiet on it but the other thing that I noticed was\nStepping in as like a couple of days after said I don't know why they didn't release it I don't know understand why it went to the inspector general and all of a sudden everything's gone quiet on that front to yeah everything that\nYou haven't heard from Jim Jordan you haven't heard from uh Denver noon as a in over a week on it saying look we need to get this stopped released why\nBecause if it goes to the inspector general they're looking at corruption\nAnd what what would the corruption be if it's about the Pfizer warrant and the text messages that everything in the upper management of the FBI and the department of justice there's only one thing that it could be because that's what they were under adapting and that would be corruption inside of the department of justice\nAnd the FBI and maybe some of the intelligence agencies and and what they did but specifically for the inspector general it would be at the department of justice and the FBI corruption that's what he would be looking at yes\nAnd so yeah one so we put two and two together a little over a week ago it was like oh and there's been nothing on this story and other media the media\nIs gone quiet on the ... higher Russian collusion narrative\n\nThink about it I mean I Know right now the focus Kavanaugh but you're they're they're very capable of a walking and chewing gum at the same time when it comes or going out at a drop\nIn New York Times brought up is family tax yes exactly why not collusion oh where's that story but that's a great point you made us you know he's going through the process and ... if you look at it and they ... somebody said look if you release this\nThen they're just going to say you're cherry picking and you're interpreting I don't know what you're saying you're interpreting something here that really doesn't exist here you go to the inspector general\nNobody's going to debate the inspector general no not even not even the ... the Democrats he was appointed by Obama right Michael Horowitz was right so you go to him and he bent and he does it which is the proper process to do with it yes that way you take the\nPolitical aspect out of it right and especially right now if you look at okay all the claims that well this would be a disruptive of the of the more investigation\nAnd you know the president that actually you know acknowledge those claims but\nAll of that's taken off the table when it's when horror which takes the investigation himself\nAll of those claims go away because or which will you know even though you know the president won wanted this done a ... in an expedited manner or which\nWe'll do his due diligence that's his job to go through this and determine if there was any corruption you want to get in we do have a line open eight six six Ninety
