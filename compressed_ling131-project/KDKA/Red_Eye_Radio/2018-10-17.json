we're talking about the fact that uh that there's such a battle that are the ones who get Trump will you know Kavanaugh we mentioned Kevin a lot but the real goal was to impeach President Trump I'm going to talk about that too tonight\nOr for those that oh no me a filled in on red eye radio in September but I also\nAh filling in another major network a show of a new not over a decade I have my

poised to draft articles impeachment with the Washington Post ABC reporting that nearly fifty percent of Americans support immediate impeachment hearings of course we got to take these polls lightly we know her on the polls were last time I think there are only two that protected President Trump would win and become president\nSo they're trying to keep the somewhat under the radar because they know many moderate and conservative voters would vote against their candidate if they knew what they were up to if they knew\nAs I pointed out the next two years of going to be chaos if they win the house of representatives subpoena power a hearings impeachment hearings they'll start on a after Trump you know of course they're going to go for taxes will go to get Kevin on it's gonna be a disaster
