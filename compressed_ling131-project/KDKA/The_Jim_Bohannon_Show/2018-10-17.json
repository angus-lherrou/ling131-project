program being the phone line's always love hearing from you and some incredible guess last hour talking about the upcoming election but now we're going to get into another one of my things that I Love to discuss technology especially that AT and T. brand that I'd like to say ... ...\nAnd I like to say rethink possible and all of this stuff that you see me do on social media on Facebook Twitter YouTube done with that Samsung Galaxy nine phone but James defeat from the cranberry retail outlet in cranberry joined just now or [noise] dismal gadgets guy from Eighteen tea on the disc Institute of Pittsburgh is lined good evening sir how are you\nThey were all doing fantastic that have English the weather was a little bit warmer about October in Pittsburgh I Can't complain too much\nListen about your Pittsburgh Penguins you you know I had to ask you because you're just so always everything that is penguins inaction tonight Vancouver to in one in uh right now there night in the eastern conference enough force in the metropolitan division a whole lot of hockey to go\nSo just observations about the Pittsburgh Penguins early on for this season\nI mean I I think the biggest thing at a big talking point is definitely been the gold penny ... did not look stellar and its first two games a lot of loving goals for five or four or five safe presented\nA case of the teen agers look solid but I had a couple of bad balances that over time goal this evening I haven't came out of nowhere\nOut of ... that seem to be a decent backup and hopefully Murray gets back sooner rather than later\nAre the biggest thing I noticed is the third and fourth line the grinder as some positions to the penguins seem to have been locking in the past few years are definitely getting the ice time and I keep it in the zone\nThey're really once a month Crosby starts producing I think it's going to just be an open faucet and he's got to start off their shoes now dissolved in focus all\nA building eight points right now and then came ... seven it sets a capital haggling and log on the line they wanted to feed on its last last year has has been producing the way to the parents want them to\nSo uh that once once they just get a little bit more comfortable and short back home tending a I think everything is going to follow the law I I definitely don't think it's on your on your end at the\nOh\nYeah definitely be a much as the eye the access to excess Macs were the predecessor to the iPhone or I find in the ... are it's kind of that thing ... or ... that same fall off to the I found a me I've got an eight bought\nMuch like the the access any access Mac day went with the apple one with a full screen design on the ... but what that does it gives you the ability to have a larger screen face in a smaller size device\nNursing going if it's six owned one inch screen so it's actually a large almost or over a half inch larger screen that even the I've had an eight laws\nIn much smaller body a they'd gone where the I couldn't act as an excess Mac\nAre a a glass front in a glass back the ex or it's going to actually be a glass front with other looming on back\nAnd looked like apple did with the iPhone five the they've introduced the multiple color choices on so you really you can you personalize that device to be at the century that you want the whole and there's an awful looking Heller but it's shared waterproof nature of the I found that the U.S has Macs\nAre written in a way and you know when you're shooting for Cape Verde as if he ran for second those are larger files\nBut apple on this uh this year in line of devices and given the option sixty four gigabytes of storage two hundred and fifty six figure five or five hundred and ... by\nThat is the largest stored sizes that apple ever relief on their phones so I mean whatever content you're creating whatever music you're putting on these devices you have enough storage for it it it down to only amazing what they are going in there with what price points are going as well\nListen I Know a lot of people are saying you know what ... was one video compared to another video it's it's all the same look for someone who spent Twenty years in television someone that's been in this media of a radio and television since the early eighties\nI Can't imagine what's going to happen when they really get up and running AT and T and Time Warner and listen I'm so happy for that marriage but do you think the average audience understands what they're going to bring to the world or broadcast media\nNo okay even ... even if somebody who is in the industry and seeing it every day the the ability to create content and push out on the network a in one single entity is amazing I mean you think your Time Warner you think an HBO game of\nThrones I'm In my mind he says the CNN I mean look on CNN [noise]\nYeah it's I mean the end revolutionized lose there'll be thought you could put twenty four hour news on and if you have people watch it and it sparked an entire industry if there is especially with the advent of devices and people can\nSeem the interactivity they can be established in the cross platform nature it's actually it's five gee rolls around where you're going to happen\nAround where you're going to have these connected devices your account of even your cars and have that content available and all these spaces it's I mean it's not quite Blade Runner where we have people at ...\nBuildings but I'll tell you said the\nMore I mean there's industry the more the closer we get to it so it it it absolutely amazing to see that that pipeline just allowing accepted as the content that being tailor made for delivery on these devices\nThe reason why I Love the people that sell the product that is a TNT you get a wealth of information in a conversation while you are making the choice of what your next product will be and you know if you think about it James and we're going to kind of say the apple watch for the next segment the apple watch series foreign direct TV and again\nYou love the Steelers you up love the NFL Sunday ticket direct TV full h._d. best picture available and that's just another example of some of the things we've been talking about when it comes to the broadcast medium but you know with all of this talk and you know the late Paul Allen was looking towards space Ilan must looking towards space\nSo many other people thinking that you know NASA mass is going to be heading back some day to the moon and beyond\nThe technology that we're in bracing if you think of those Apollo missions yes computers were used then but they filled up store rooms and now it's all in our hand in these Eighteen T phones that to me makes you read things possible that anything\nCan happen and who knows maybe someday someone will be on the moon but the AT and T. um\nAccess and taking pictures and were laying it ... up on Facebook or across any social media outlet that's how amazing these phones have become [noise]\nOh yeah and it I mean I I ... you mentioned that space program and uh they say and I have heard the hands of NAFTA or\nFaith act or pencil if they get a ... for the uh people back into space is amazing but something I always remember is having a teacher compare\nOne of the ... calculator watch it and he looked at into this watch have more technology and and the lunar lander day and he was right I mean\nThe the amount of coffee I mean most of the copy a confrontation done during the Apollo mission was done with you know paper and pen and you know incredibly intelligent people but\nOur ability with the technology to come through and the process to profit data and formulated in such a quick span of time it absolutely astounding watching ...\nLand automated rockets on our time is floating platforms and faith\nWhen you think about you know the uh landing on from there was a polish is dropping into the middle of the ocean with a parachute and having planes track down now they're geosynchronous a positioning onto the platform it's ... it's the founding I get that the\nFascination with faith and the fact that we're getting closer to a really having the mission go back in the morning the universe\nIt on I mean I don't know if you can hear the excitement my voice but it it made me get inside because I think back to you know all the videos and all the votes I've read on that that rate for space\nAnd we're kind of getting back into it and reliving it and it's an unknown frontier like it it really makes me feel like a child and you\nListen there's a reason why marvel comics has been so successful there's a reason why Star Wars Star Trek Star Trek of course going back to the late sixties when it was a really their brains\nIn trust of Desi our nose and Lucille Ball and she's the one that said let's do it now it only ran for three years on the network but it's still running today and different versions and obviously the spin off of many other brand because of what they did\nSo space is always given people hope and I got to tell you when you look at these phones and when I held that acts as in my hand the other night\nAt a mutual friend's house I just was like ... I Can't believe this show anything really is possible do you believe that Steve Jobs the\nLate great Steve Jobs in talking about people like Paul Allen and Bill Gates who dropped out of Harvard or Mr Allen dropped out of Washington state they began what was to become Microsoft's in Nineteen Seventy five in Albuquerque New Mexico\nYou have to believe that they too looked at the stars and we're we're dreamers of light beyond this planet because there's stuff that they have created not to be corny corny but it really is out of this world isn't a James\nOh yeah and that's I mean that's the you know the the birth of creation and the further intervention alive and if\nYou know looking at looking at a situation of faith and thing eater we can we do it better or we can get there were no one else has and you know much like Neil Armstrong taking a step on to the moon\nThe these technology companies and he's founder of any mention\nLooking at a problem and coming up with this illusion anything you know we can do it faster than your quicker we can do it cheaper which whatever the the improvement is\nThey're developing technology or processes and hurting us where we've never been before and yeah I mean I\nI you know I haven't personally I interviewed them and I I Believe it would be hard pressed to find any one of these men or women\nWho are in the area of invention who haven't worked out for the stars and thought you someday I'm going to have a product or I'm going to have your code or program that's going to help us get there again and it you know it it it ...\nI I have said money was never the reason it was always the drive the money just made it possible for them to continue to dare to dream and I wouldn't be far fetched to say some day\nAnd apple watch may be warned by an astronaut on the surface of the moon and beyond and if you get a chance ladies and gentlemen as you can tell James and I both love space NASA everything that is the idea of going beyond the stars and this solar system in galaxy\nFirst man Ryan Gosling about Neil Armstrong truly one of the greatest American heroes the world has ever seen\nYour kids your grandkids who may not be familiar with the story take them because this is a man that you want to remember and you want to tell people about for generations to come because if you think about it everything that we're talking tonight\nA lot of the men and women behind these brands were there like the rest of us in Nineteen sixty nine when Neil Armstrong first stepped foot on the moon and as they say the rest is history will be back with James ... more of the product from ... in the next\nThat uh you know the networks strength is owned important but at the same thing that people that we see every day and it's making our community safer or which you know it it made the proud to say that I work for a company that is going so much to help ensure the safety\nAnd uh the economic prosperity in our communities 'cause it it it is very important to ah to the employees that how do serve the stores\nListen you know we we talk about the cutting edge we're always looking at the glitz and glamour the showbiz the entertainment value of this Eighteen ... brand but I look at it in that big picture get\nAs far as keeping community save giving elderly people some way to keep in touch with the outside world friends and family and I've said this\nAnd I've been a single now for some time living alone you're never really alone as long as you had that Eighteen people and because of all of the quality of the content from Netflix to YouTube staying in touch with family Facebook Twitter always being able to Google certain things news media outlets I have CNN and others\nIt really is a great tool to keep you in the game of life and it really touches young and old alike and it is a tool that when you healthy it can really create amazing things can it\nOh yeah I mean and it even though I was there was a little moments or you know a sample of gift from over the weekend or we might actually one of my co workers and I took part in the er the ... foundation six point six K\nUh down in er in uptown this weekend and uh it was his first run but I was able to capture in there\nFor cave video a a slow motion video of him crossing the finish line and shaking hands with Mariel new and even a little you have thirty second clip when I showed it to them the joy enemy ... we're talking about it\nThe thirty year old man here than joy that let his faith seeing himself number one accomplish this task you run into six points they say that he didn't think he was going to be able to accomplish but then you getting getting shake hands and I five you know one of the greatest hockey players of all time on your hometown hero\nThat little moment there was an amazing but then you see people who are creating new full you know thirty minute or hour long\nA television shows or movies\nOn these devices I mean if if not no longer a world vote where you need\nA six thousand dollar ten thousand dollar camera ring and you know all the ... uh only associated tracks and evil than that you have this creation studio via video photo audio or a tax base\nIt on your hand we I mean we you mentioned Star Trek or there we are living in a world of Star Trek that we have all of these all these devices and all this ability in our pockets every day and it's you know mind blowing when you take a step back and think about it it really is\nAll right well let me speaking to my apple watch series foreign said beam me up Scotty let's

percent\nOf the population is much controlling all of this they get to and whether George Soros is behind a well he's behind a lot of these hate groups you agree with that\nOh absolutely\nAnd he is finding a groups but what I wanted to talk about what is there is a Congress man\nI'm that well\nHis wife report it has a police report and I don't know his name right off the top of my head but as it happened I guess a year and a half to two years ago and\nHis wife found a police report on and on so she has documentation and that the Democratic do a committee cleared I'm saying there wasn't enough evidence\nMy what we wanted one was the believes reports supposed to say\nThat he has solitary he grabbed her by her legs track drop Tibet dragged her through in their own but what I wanted to say as if we get hit in the benefit of doubt which we have to because there was no evidence to collaborate her claims or something the other\nRidiculous claims that they tried to make and they tried to do this before but ... if he is innocent and he has a good person and a Christian and I and raise a good family would you not if it was you would you not be outraged\nIs outraged of course you wouldn't be outraged\nIt gave him a taste that they needed just like\nI'm In the\nUm the other Supreme Court or the the black American\nParents Tommy side you\nKnow and they try to have a twenty century let you\nClarence Thomas Cairo Thomas yes yes\nI Am yeah I I agree with you absolutely Marty I think you're a parallel is is is quite a accurately chosen and I thank you for sharing that to kneel and bread for Tennessee a good evening Neal welcome Hi Jim how fine thank you\nThat I was telling the lady is is your call screener I said I'm a Democrat ... but I did not agree with the way guys Kavanaugh's case was handled in fact that the turning to the equivalent of a clown show and I don't think he got a fair ride and I think a lot of these\nUh Democratic senators running for re election they're going to pay a heavy price of the polls are these I certainly hope they do\nMay ... let me let me offer the rationale here and and this is not an excuse I don't consider it an excuse at all but I Do think that this is the reason you're talking about a number of Democrats who would not in the general course if things go down this path\nIn the Democratic establishment is feeling the thundering hooves the bows on the far left\nIf they ever remember what happened to Joe Crowley the New York congressman beaten by uh uh Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nAnd and there have been other similar cases Dianne Feinstein of because of California's primary laws running against it even more liberal Democrats than she is in California they are running scared now is that an excuse to do what they did know but it is an explanation\nWell as I said Jim I think he was inexcusable I think that one problem I have with it at these women had a problem with judge Kavanaugh\nWhy didn't they bring up these uncorroborated stories back X number of years ago when he was up for consideration is in the United states court of appeals judge they just say ... and I can't forget how that Ford woman\nSent Dianne Feinstein a letter in effects that oh by the way girlfriend said aren't to give you the green light to make it public it just it stinks to high heaven\nWell he certainly it did I Would agree I agree with you absolutely stinks to high heaven told me that was a tactical device designed to be a last minute gotcha in case of the things didn't uh didn't work so that yeah you're right on Neal a William and West Village Florida and good evening welcome to the gym both have a joke\nAbout getting the job that you might call sure you were asking about the the judicial temperament I'm I was telling your\nCall screener that there is a world of difference a and judicial temperament sitting on on the bench when you're hearing an argument on both sides and facing a hostile I'm a group of political assassins for your fighting for your hair professional and political ally\nAnd personal life do\nThat first of all a lot of a correct um\nIt it's totally understandable the the motion the past and that he was showing their um any person would that was in that situation and you can you can sit when you're judging something you have a lot more uh\nUh uh they're the emotions are not as high and your ... uh it's easier to vacate level headed a\n... a decision based on what you're hearing whether or not having to fight for your life\nYeah I mean here we are we're sitting back talking about this calmly I've nobody is accusing us of no one was accusing those other people either on that committee but again as I said a moment ago when I made that that all men comment about the Justice John Paul Stevens which was obviously are meant to be nothing more than provocative\nBut I mean that's all it takes anymore if some off the wall ... charge and all of a sudden be guilty until proven innocent\nThat's correct in fact I was reading that night the ... those charges that the doctor for as a pretty much that she doesn't want to pursue that any further and she has no ill will toward a judge Kavanaugh um is is like at all just evaporates like a like a vapor\nWell yes I Do know that if I were were judge Kavanaugh if he were to accept that and quote a a forgive her he's a better man than I Am I'd have to tell you\nAre in any event I just find it remarkable that there will be efforts are put forward and we already know this because members of of the house of them said so I Believe jury ... the New York congressman has indicated he would pursue this impeaching\nKevin off because they couldn't get him in the\nConfirmation process\nHow far does this go one eight six six five oh jumbo and what repercussions will there be in the mid term elections very good questions will pursue some answers from all of you on the go ahead and show forthcoming in a moment\n\n[laughter] and

named general area that I thank you\n[laughter] well somebody has a question about are the repercussions involved with the Kavanaugh ... and\nI Would say that rebut charges for Democratic Party is going to be catastrophic the cat didn't care red states like Nevada like Arizona like Missouri that Democrats are waning at actually behind\nTheir Republican counterparts\nAnd I think they really are destroyed their chances are taking control of Congress and the I'm cutting met terms\nI Will see I Would like to think you're correct I don't think so and I I Would put it this way I Would not what anybody out there to base their decision on voting\nBased on the fact that it's in the bag I don't think it's anywhere near in the bag probably in the Senate Republicans will gain seats because it is simply a do many Democrats are are heavy seats to defend I I figure three or four seats myself in the house\nIt is entirely possible that we will see the return of Speaker Pelosi and then the the notion that everybody is motivated the way that you and I are I just don't think it's necessarily true Andrew and that scares the daylights out of me\nWell again I Would say to anyone listening please don't set a whole go out and vote because if you don't vote you get the government you dessert\nWell unfortunately that's true\nThat the I I absolutely agree with you yes be sure you vote don't be so sure\nThat the Republicans will win I Hope they do uh I think they will in the Senate the house I consider to be toss up time and remember the Democrats only need one house to block everything legislatively put forward by the president\nFred in Syracuse New York now hello Fred\n... you know I mean it's it's a very we're in an awkward situation that went down but I think it is important to remember one time\nHad the nuclear option not been instilled that we had the the vote and that it was kept as sixty votes to get a judge who um who would not have have this conversation [noise]\nYeah that's true\nSo you know what when when we go which holds all the rules essentially one who chose what was set in stone and how the U.S has to do with corn always be upset but all of a sudden we have chaos\nWell certainly ... the whole notion of of of sixty votes super majority is ah is Internet itself I think a travesty and that and then uh I I was glad to see a deceive that go in this case and I
