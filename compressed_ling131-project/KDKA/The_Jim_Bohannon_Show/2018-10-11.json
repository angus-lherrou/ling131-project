[laughter] I was hoping Bethany you said that term that that was the last I Can't let our we've got two bits of history now the first time in history and hopefully the last minute and everybody will say what rhymes with circle cork [laughter] on the great\nKatie Kay on the big fifty thousand what blow torch yes so you went to some Bethany hell and went to some young Democrats meeting yeah it was once a month young Democrats of Allegheny county when do they do what did they say do they just drink punch\nNo actually we ate pizza [laughter] there was no punch 'em but we get together and went ... it's a group\nOf obviously young people are thirty five and under is because I haven't got the weeks that young at heart people as well so at its meetings are open but I Would not I would\nNot be eligible to stay out of hand and I taught English\nOr are people get offended or you're bullying and all that so we we just ... it's laughable twist at times but when you can like this this new phenomenon a Democratic Party or or from the left left to the far left where you can find the\nPeople in restaurants and all this other stuff\nA little we grow up in Nineteen sixty eight year riots in this town\nAnd it was ugly and we have a lot of racial strife but never once morel protests that we thought we was going to go and bother people at a restaurant for one thing we're afraid to we go to jail and secondly we've strayed we'd get shot but this I don't agree with\nThis from the Democratic wherever where whoever wherever it may be to finding people in the elevators and in restaurants what I Would say that's just not a good look and it turns off a whole lot of folks even you may agree with you and a lot of things you're not comfortable with that\nYou have any Anthony if you can't get a hold of them any other way if you can't get\nThese people's attention any other way what do you do your calling they found their office found their cell phone no answer your writing letters you're leaving messages whether secretary with no response what else are you supposed to do just say okay they're ignoring me I guess I guess that's okay I'm Down now no that's Afghans on ...\n... ... you could do that at your own cost it may cost you and election so that that if that's the tactile a lot of young people want to want to say that at school I'm trying to I'm I'm giving you a perspective\nWell Anthony Kennedy joined in your question about that really are going to appreciate your perspective now you're saying there's stuff didn't happen before right this is all new this is this converting people in restaurant of white people\nAt a restaurant is if you were black and ... name isn't it\nWell but even to the beginning that hall additions while they're eating dinner I mean I'm telling you that we're talking yeah there's already a new to me that uh I think John would agree that that's a pretty new phenomenon why do you think you've got to that point ... why do you think that either all is lying to\nThe point I'm just telling you that it's turning awful lot of people even people who may agree with them if they use it's a turtle let me please let me try to get through this because time is short on I've not all\nLike no go ahead by ... you know you like listening to your buddies that\nLet me let me finish a ... I'm sitting there and we're watching a story today about a woman who decides that she wants to get on an airplane and she's going to bring a squirrel on because it's her comfort animal\nWell John and millennials\nWe don't believe in comfort animals when we come from we did that that's something else that's new comfort animal you are you kidding me and of all the stress the black folks going through the sixty you you you we had a comfort animal that we take to the restaurant with us\nTo eat you know a lot of to a lot of us when we go to a wrestler when you want an animal when you're with us\nWe know when we go to the art festival why everybody up to bring their dogs what is\nSo laughable also laugh at that left lactose intolerant John when I was growing up in the sixties my friends here in ... we couldn't afford whole milk at times where they can milk and he's got to take the canned milk with Syria\nNow it's not very good\nSo there was no we didn't hear this all lactose intolerant hope the nut allergies because they gave us peanut butter cookies at school so\nIt was if this is some of the stuff that we're we're we're looking at today specially with the cover the animals it's just a whole areas to us and we we left\nWe laugh at this stuff gets confused at least if they are back in the day we will call folks who always want to dictate whether she called them limousine liberals those you lived in Manhattan It's always told black would look for\nIn our report now days is when somebody tries to do that today too a lot to anybody I forgot my age we say excuse me it's not Nineteen eighty it's twenty eight days\nAnd my name's not cook the king day so you know anything about roots that's I'll put down and we will we get it would have had enough from somebody who say my name's not coup the kid they are my lady's name like kitty\nSo if you guys ever saw that you know exactly what I'm ... but it's normally black people do that when when we get we could call back in the day in the ... syndrome limousine liberals always going to liberate Blackfoot\nAnthony before I let you go what about the a white woman in Atlanta who called the cops on the black guy because he was babysitting too white kids he must have heard about that\nYeah but that's not a new phenomena you if you went through school hill in the seventies and you were black they got the police called on you\nAnd you wouldn't dare vote to Fox chapel or shady sad so that's nothing new it's just a new concept now it's just being published that that went on forever there were certain neighborhoods where you went into because the cops would ask you what are you doing here and actually in my life that\nAre in my lifetime also I had a only a few years ago a black friend comes to my parents' house and my parents were in Hammond one of my neighbors called the cops 'cause you know\nHe was a black man so he must be a criminal according to them and things like that happen all the time and it's ridiculous and I agree and that doesn't make it okay but things that were crazy back that are still crazy now but I think finally people are starting to realize that we have\nWe're able to take a stand in that we need to stand up for\nPeople who don't have a voice to stand up for themselves and I'm hoping that society as a whole is going to eventually get past this but I mean it's probably about ... ... not tax has been passed in ... yeah well\nLet me just say this to this is something else a lot of of a ... a we've got to prepare for John as we ... we talk and a lot a lot of these are folks by age children are are are finding jobs\nWhere the ... calling them back where\nTwo three years ago that wasn't happening a lot of people are feeling good about this economy and a lot of them are given Donald Trump a lot of credit and the African American community and if he takes away a certain amount of blind vote and then and the Republicans know that\nIt went again and John you know that also if you take away a certain amount of black votes 'cause that's what stabilizes the Democratic party\nIt is especially in black women yep\nWell and and yeah he says ugly things and then we talk about those things but when their when their children are getting jobs where ... years ago they were employers are actually calling them back or it may have a big difference of twenty twenty my friend\nAlright uh will be on the edge of our seats until then I I think the Anthony I'm Still optimistic that the blue waves coming big time and twenty Eighteen and there's enough people are disgusted by Donald Trump and particularly the independent to either just didn't like Hillary or just want to do things to be shaken up have now fully come to their senses\nThink that the political millennials yeah I think the uh the Kavanaugh situation may have hurt the Democrats a little bit\nI think that they give the Republicans a lot of red meat especially to the base you solve Lindsey Graham play into it you so much McConnell playing too I have Lindsey Graham ... to ... am I have a love hate relationship with the guys sometimes as far as the Republicans go nobody has ... President Trump better than Lindsey Graham over the past two years and nobody is\nYes and nobody is sucked up to the exactly these ... opposite he's ... right there waiting to do whatever and then he can to help this president out which I understand from that party but you saw the Capitol hearing is Lindsey Graham's ... waving his finger and getting ready to tomato\nUm that was all grandstanding and Mitch McConnell all the silver tore stuff that was grandstanding the president swearing him incident\nSwearing a man and a phony ceremony and then saying he was proven innocent\nYeah can we do not carry my daughter and fire and we just need to stop as a country again I I did this last week of appealing to my friends on the right can we stop as a country didn't have any friends in there I have friends in the right to see my Facebook page\nUm but can we as a country agree that can we stop coddling this man child with these fake\nCeremonies oh my God there's nothing we can do he for some of on it right but can we just stopped paying attention to them like you swearing in the Supreme Court justice that was already sworn in and then the guy after he's sworn in to the Supreme Court blatantly lies while standing right next to the president\nI just I I I'm beside myself makes me want to go home and play the devil's triangle drinking game until I just can't\nSee it made me want to go out and knocks them doors for some democratic candidates and get candidates I like that and I am hoping that again I always like to look at the right side that may be all this bad that's happening will result and people being so pissed off and so fired up that they get out and they've votes\nWill how you know you probably know the answer to this John do you know what the percentage of the Democratic primary turnout was this year high and increase twenty oh how high was that's how high did increase uh I Wonder if there was like twenty three percent Ninety four nationwide Ninety four percent increase\nIt and that sort of an inch of people that vote in the primaries low twenties which I have had it participation is but the but\nThe amount of Democrats participating went up by almost a hundred percent Republican participation increased by Fifteen Percent to Pennsylvania Democrats this year registered almost a hundred thousand more a new voters and the Republicans have and that they maintain a half a million voter\nEdge Taylor Swift got a hundred thousand people to rent as soon as I think sixty five and twenty four hours [laughter]\nYeah and everybody apparently thought she was a Republican and apparently not so or if she was you've changed your mind what apparently the Kanye thing we called him out for Trump she's like no I Can't lay out now that I've noticed that yeah that feud runs so deep that it got Taylor\nYeah you said yes\nAll right\nHow do I think you thanks for gun Joanne this portion of the back of tire show brought to you by the devil's triangle drink again the devil's triangle drinking game you'll ... you'll actually consider having relations with Brett Kavanaugh the bill triangle during ... wait did you see the tweet\nWhere it was some guy named Brett Kavanaugh on he was like oh what a horrible time it is the Wii named Brett Kavanaugh and somebody named Mike Pence was like I Know exactly how you feel you know [laughter]\nI'm All right so Taylor Swift for those ... yeah I didn't even\nI'm not a big Taylor Swift fan I obviously she's incredibly popular she sends a million ... people are not yeah I saw her do it too and I swear to God wants most I was dreaming is with Mick Jagger on some award show I don't know and she was horrible she has not an ounce of rock and roll stolen or\nShe shouldn't be an online I don't have that was Taylor ... ... I got a\nTaliban had it's not my style I mess like\nOh gee Taylor Swift from when she first came out and she had some hits back then I think now she's I think she catered more to the younger crowd you know like ... see I don't think she did because the people I still see like getting ready to go to a concert or like\nElementary school middle school kids with their moms but\nIt's so hard to choose demographic because when I look at Lady Gaga only thing I see you in a league are conscious and mostly single women and gay men yeah so it's just hard to like just say like what a demographic is\nAlso not a Lady Gaga fan until I saw the movie really I was never a Lady Gaga fan I thought she was a little strange but I was like whatever that sort of thing and her demographics into it\nAh but yeah that movie with\nBlew me away she was good in American horror story too\nI never saw that and that's the TV show yes yeah and I've never seen that ah Taylor Swift\nAnd Mick Jagger although I Can't get the audio of it here oh God apparently performed in Nashville on nine twenty six\nTwenty Fifteen\nAnd yet there's no audio over here I'm getting a lot of graphics on this what a great Youtube video nobody is there a little audio like going to the core that might be muted by default I Know what you're saying\nNo it was actually on\nA river mind I'll find another the audio would have been cut anyway it happened right yeah oh okay yeah\nSome people don't know what happened so Taylor Swift shared an Instagram post and\nWho the candidate was the who show Marsha Blackburn ... refunding the violence against women act and that was the reason for Taylor to come out and universities Republican into it as like\nA it it it was strictly because of the violence against women act and the reason Blackburn wouldn't sign on to it is because the revamp violence against women got which did pass she didn't she didn't vote for it but the reason she didn't is the revamped version also get protections to algae Beatty engine\nAlgae BT and gender non conforming couples so it wasn't just the violence against women act it became the violence against domestic partners act basically and she was against that she didn't want any more um anymore carve outs for\nParticular groups and Taylor said I there's no reason not to vote for this ... just because it was protecting more people it still was the violence against women act and it included crucial funding for women's centers and women's shelters\nAnd I think the key point and this was like as some background that Taylor Swift had never come out to endorse any sort of political view or candidate before and actually been criticized but a lot so sounds of people registered all the time even higher than thousand and two days\nHow were they able to pinpoint that on on Taylor Swift and\nThey ... you know what I mean they base it on age and they base it on the time as a\nWhole accent and their ... and nobody\nElse had any real ... to put it in perspective they said something like eight or ... eighty thousand people register signed up to register to vote in August a hundred and twenty thousand people signed up to register to vote in September and in two days in October a hundred thousand people have signed up after Taylor Swift made her comments in and like I was saying to Bethany she's been criticized quite harshly\nFor not coming out or is taking a political stance in that might sound weird to some people like why would anybody criticize a pop star\nFor having a political stance and the reason is a lot of neo Nazis and white supremacist in white nationalist groups really hold Taylor Swift in ... an idle ... she's basically an idol to them because she's a successful Erian woman uh she's American born and she's American blood and you know poor pure white and\n... that's been known for some time that the white supremacist white nationalist groups\nIdolized her and she never came out and said anything like hey if you're not see I don't want you as a fan so that's why this is such a big deal that she took a stand on this particular issue has\nPerhaps and never before in recorded history as a pop stars comments suddenly cause thousands of people to spontaneously instantaneously register to vote you would think more\n... idols are celebrities would use their celebrity for good such as this but I think we're just discussing that are fair\nWhy don't more people come out and say hey go vote you don't even need to save vote for a candidate um I Know I don't know if you guys ever heard of the scams that a scam as like a\nDaily email subscription and so they started this no excuses campaign and they have a lot of celebrities that have signed on to this campaign and I truly think that things like that catering to the young people the way that we get our news the way that we get\nInvolved I think that that's the way to do it because we we\nWe've seen the numbers we've seen that all these young people have registered to vote for the first time now we need to find a way to motivate them to get out and vote\nJust to give you a perspective is assorted article about the Taylor Swift thing\nUh back in ... was it two thousand and I would say eight there was the vote or die campaign with with MTV with that it was John ... I remember that had voted die and it was just like I like rappers trying to get out there and push the vote like the rock the vote did back in Ninety two\nThey registered Ninety thousand people the entire year and two thousand eight and that was the year Obama was running and that was with MTV what you're still relevant and is still relevant rapper and his entire record label promoting that that

things out there it's a major part of a of our lives even if I\nMay be investing or or playing or various ah market games or or not or shall we say your hobby but the fact is that we are all our economic beings to one extent or another and this is the kind of thing that can seriously affect your life\nLet's talk to or not only our guest Jordan Goodman America's money has was mad but to see the new calls in from medicine lodge Kansas good evening Stephen\nGood evening and a former member of the one night a night\nOf very for those who do knows even news in the same unit I was in in Vietnam but go ahead\nYeah that you are also for and\nI Know I I was I was actually enlisted also but anyway what do you have for a while you have for our for our guest\nAbout gold ah it's it's been for me I'm a Seventy year old\nAnd uh I uh\nIt's always been colder value for me uh it's it's really a\nState they're saying or get terrier aided in the last year and I was wanting to know if uh if if he feels that still place to hold value\nI think of it as an insurance policy okay it's it's against disaster [laughter] but that's been going down because when interest rates go up gold goes down as do many other commodities and interest rates have been going up and looks like they're going to go up higher and that's been hurting gold gold gotten over Thirteen hundred dollars announced\nNow it's roughly twelve hundred dollars announce even lower than that\nSo I I don't say it's going anywhere anytime soon I mean we've had all kinds of disasters in the world and do this not throwing up it's just not what it used to be if anything bitcoins become a new kind of safety valve and even that haven't been working lightly as well so have a little bit of an insurance policy but I don't see go going up dramatically anytime soon\nWhat about other a precious metals platinum ... silver\nUm all the same ... gone down dramatically a platinum is kind of a a place a play on a kind of like converters I guess I'm so car sales have been getting weaker rightly so none of the passion smells really been doing much they all get hurt by rising interest rates Jim\nOkay very good I thanks for your call Steve appreciate that very much and I might add thanks for your services well now a\nThis is one of the little economic lessons I learned I guess a classic example of a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing but that is that in uncertain times that gold another prejudice precious metals will go up a but I gather there are exceptions to that\nYeah well I mean these are uncertain times although I'm some ways they're good times I mean the economy is doing decently we've got all kinds of potential problems with China and so on\nBut I mean this is not a time like two thousand eight when you know it looks like the whole world is going to be falling apart [laughter] so ah no goal just isn't doing well it's it really is a direct correlation with\nA interest rates and I mean defenders arms raised rates a lot and long term interest rates have gone up dramatically and the ten year treasury is now over three point two percent\nIt started about two point one percent so it's not a big move up pretty short sharply and I think it's going to go maybe the three and a half percent by the end of the year that was all bad for gold silver platinum unwed him\nBut is it do you see an interest rates going much beyond that\nYes I Do I think we're in the beginning of a major long term bond there market we basically had a thirty five year\nYour bond bull market where bond interest rates peaked in about fourteen percent of the Nineteen eighty two\nAnd they went down the absolute though it was about one and three quarters in the middle of two thousand Seventeen and since then it's gone up to three point to\nAnd I think it's going higher ... let me just to have a brief explaining why interest rates are going up beyond what the Federal Reserve's doing right on the demand side there's less demand for treasuries because the two big buyers China and the Federal Reserve\nOr out of the market right now China actually has been the seller of treasury bonds not on a buyer for political reasons another way they can get back at us over the trade war\nAnd the Federal Reserve remember they were buying all these bombs sixty billion a month through the so called quantitative easing program\nThat's over that's been over for about a year and a half now and now they're doing quantitative tightening so when bombs come do they're not buying new ones they're not renewing them letting them mature\nSo two of the big buyers of bombs are out of the marketplace and meanwhile huge new supply Jim we've talked about this before but the evidence that we have are being financed with that\nIn the third quarter that just recently completed third quarter we added four hundred billion dollars in New that just that quarter alone\nToday there are options of the thirty about the ten year by they did not do well because we're having a huge supply because we're having a trillion dollar deficit so more supply less demand\nYields and you don't go up and prices go down\nAnd there you go the old supply and demand thing All right we're going to come back and talk more we will certainly return to the issue of China\nAnd uh terrorists and the like about that when we come back after this break going to take a a very close look at a gift that keeps on giving the student loan indebtedness one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six Americas\nMoney answer as mad as our guest Jordan good again money ...\nDot com a great website I challenge you to go there and not save money somehow okay back in a moment\nStick on that Jim this twenty seven percent of the people who graduate end up using something it remains their major twenty seven percent meaning Seventy five percent or you know three quarters do not end up working in their major field in one way or the other\nIn which case you essentially a ... from a financial point of you you've you've wasted your time you've acquired I mean it's one thing if you have a hobby I'd say that uh our gay and lesbian literature I always you know then well okay so I'm interested in that well that's fine\nBut but but you shouldn't be paying out this kind of enormous money to finance a hobby and as I've also noted before that's why we have so many bowling leagues in this country people like to bowl\nAnd there are just simply an awful lot more people who like to bowl than people who can make a living in the professional bowling to her that early on and so I I mean it just always it amazes me at all these people are what what I find myself or I Want to do this or that well why don't you do that in your spare time and in the meantime get a job\nYeah well I mean luckily we have a good employment situation right now and and there's a tremendous shortage of workers except the people coming out of college in many cases are not qualified or willing frankly to do the jobs that are available\nThere's something called the jokes report which is the job openings long term survey and the latest number was six point nine million jobs are unfilled employers cannot find the people\nTo do tool and dye making are plumbing or electricity or climbing electric utility poles there may be the people coming out of college don't either have the skills or the interest in doing the jobs that are actually available in the real world\nWhich raises another point is too easy to sit on your body in this society there ought to be economic pressures on people like\nIf you have a lot of student loans you are under economic pressure to do something and a lot of people take jobs that are like but I've got a service those you know that's over fifty percent of the people graduating today go back and live at home because they can't services student on that and have an apartment in the car and kind of get on with their lives I mean it's it's pretty pathetic\nI mean if you wind up doing doing a job you're not particularly fond of ah because it pays the bills this is I think called growing up with us we'll be back with more from Jordan Goodman America's ... man in just a moment\nYossi ... hot we earn more\nThan ... squeaking white board marker

me computers do not lie\nThank you\nThe back of a jumbo added show is that Jordan ... mad as our guest a dodge about credit cards if you would\nWell we ever a trillion dollars in credit card debt right now\nOn average interest rates about fifty percent skin going up is typically tied to the crime rate so people are charging more and more and higher and higher rates all the time when consumer confidence is good and the economy's good Americans spent that's the way they celebrate by spending themselves into oblivion\nUm you know the the three big ones are student loan debt we've talked about one point five trillion credit cards over trade and car loans that that's up to about one point three trillion and those are just rising all the time it's a real problem\nFor some credit cards a particularly good and others not I mean you would think again that market forces if in fact we shopped that market forces would would drive those rates to a ... a reasonably consisted level\nWhere there are some that are lower interest credit cards uh there's actually a free website to find the best deal anywhere which is guide to credit card dot com\nFor example in Arkansas they have users doings where they can't charge more than five points over the primary to primary today's five and a quarter so they basically they can't charge more than ten\nSo that's you know one way of getting them but there's a lot of other ways that people are going to get distracted when they get credit cards they weren't frequent flyer miles to take trips they weren't Disney points but go to Disneyland they want GM points when I got a by GM car wherever it may be\nAnd those when you get those awards I tend to have higher interest rate if you were evolved balances on them and a lot of people just
