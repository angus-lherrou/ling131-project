because it is\nTerrific talked about the gridiron oh man I bought some time and I'm sure millions people already familiar with with many millions more maybe not but yeah now that's ... yeah he was the

better than others\nOh yeah and every time you see social networking it's like it hasn't been good to Gabby Jane believes he died of rubble\nNo there have been many many good seasons but even during the good seasons there were many skits that flopped right and even during good seasons you might have\nFor good episodes into lousy episodes in these days I think Donald Trump or the imitation from I'm Alec Baldwin is still funny most of the time but sometimes that the highlight of the show\nAnd then it goes south and it's a long show aren't I I I but people don't seem to understand\nBut people don't seem to understand that it's the nature of sketch comedy you know no sketch comedy troupe and history of the world has produced you know Fifteen fantastic sketches every single week of their lives\nI guess back in the day the one thing I saw it used to be better weather musical guess first of all at once you never heard of so that he was a chance to see a diva oh you know that was never around 'em but any more I guess I'm not in the pop music and it's a lot of pop music now and so maybe that's why I just don't like it but back in the day I thought that music\nWas terrific and I I got a kick out of in the early days or the musical guest always were in part of some skits so they know people who had nothing no idea about acting I remember that yeah and in fact years later they stopped doing it in\nA narrow lead Lady Gaga um was a a hell let us gets when she was on with Timberlake right\n... and a lot of them say I'll do it but I Want to be and skits Aerosmith insisted on being an escape and of course they showed up in the basement with Wayne and guards in the world and they'll yeah\nI'm an ... ... what I thought made that one's hysterical so they're getting ready to perform on winning guards you know close circuit show or whatever it was an ... who's testing that makes a you know ... uh Oscar winning actor I'm I was gonna say Michael Keaton not Michael Keaton are good heavens\nI Can't think of his name now for heaven's sakes he was an Apollo Thirteen and he was in\nOh come on how next thank you Tom ... every every once and only Tom Hanks would do that you know not too many Oscar winners would play along on something like that\nWell he sort of a regular part of the George Michael stables George Michael ... Michael ... young adult [laughter] or like a fable of stars [laughter]\nBecause he is not a George Michael stable or not I might know God rest his soul yeah yes [laughter] um [laughter] I didn't know George Michael produce a\nNight out at Michael's rather is George and Lauren ...\nIt is amazing how long I Don ... was the original announcer until he died and twenty four and jade right he was there every week and Lauren Michaels at one point I guess was let go and then came back or ... and came back\nUh I think he was let go and came back but I'm I'm not but I Can't verify that after the Google and I'm too lazy\nBut yeah those were some weird years for a while I'm ... years of that lower Michaels they were not as funny most of the time\nIt and there's everything in life as a Seinfeld connection at one point Larry David was a writer right started on sale and got nothing until like one ... finally that he wrote got on its five minutes to one in the morning and then he got so mad he quit storm God's scream to everybody and then came back to the next week as if we'd never quit\nI think Julie Lee drive this was a cast member for one year\n... and and married Brad Hall who was right who was on it and there are still married yeah um but yeah that that that that was word that Seinfeld episode where George quit stormed out and came back to the next day and uh apparently Larry Michael ... Michael er Larry David that same thing but\nIt's such an honor original observation to say it used to be good and now ... and I just feel like\nLike I don't know people are trapped in that cycle that they have to say that right somebody's watching the ratings are not horrible they they have been slow\nBut it wouldn't still be on the air if they didn't get millions of people ... it's a and some of the you know Kate McKinnon is Jeff Sessions there have been some really moments at least in my opinion um in recent years on us and I don't\nKnow yeah there have been and they always had the original women were the best you know Jane Curtain Lorraine Newman um Gilda Radner but later on there is some terrific I women who are much better than them I think\nI don't know much much better but I think they held their own at least there was good yeah\nUm but yeah it's hard to stop guilt it but yeah there there are times when I turn it on and I'm like I Can't get through it [laughter] you know it just I think a lot of people like that and I don't like the musical gas that the the opening monologue was kinda\nAnd the stale well OK speaking of the musical guess as I understand it I didn't even see it but the last musical guess was none of them Kanye West now did you see of any of his love of his presentation is the White House today [laughter]\nI didn't see it but I read about it online I I won't even play any of it or you know don't you\nKnow what I mean it's not worth it and it helps to see it to drink into full level of and clear and see not just hear it but\nI don't know it's just so weird in oak so Taylor Swift who as I understand that everybody thought it was a Republican comes out endorsing Democrats in Tennessee and Kanye West to before he came out as a Republican you'd think would be a Democrat [laughter] now all about Trump right I'd forgotten this I saw a clip maybe I Can't even find it\nOr Obama was about to let somebody interviewing but they already had a camera on when he was still president and they were talking about when Kanye interrupted Taylor Swift accepted ceremony for\nThe word to say so and so had yeah somebody else should have won it in for talent on it was part of the ... Obama said he's a jackass [laughter] so you wonder if if the county which is one of these things getting people like Trump who like you insult the once lifelong grudge an idle champion whoever aid to you and I will hate you till I die\nYeah well ... was it Jack ... I really thought that that\nThat that Taylor Swift thing was unconscionable oh ... sweat too at the time was just a kid what was she like Eighteen\nSought some later said I saw that ... some part of a ... they were doing right he would run up and say that yeah he I guess he was the presenter right yeah yeah okay but um then takes the mind I think it would have been ... not that I we don't need to really to get us but I think it's fine if after it he held a news conference said you know what that was bogus\nBut you can interrupt her acceptance speech for crying out loud\nAnd somehow people are still buying his records\nOr CDs or die or or whatever I Am a\nFan of the album a which among other things the features they joking monologue by Chris Rock is part of one of the songs right\nBecause it used to be the favorite music to do a secret things by with one of my recent partners [laughter] uh I don't know how that sounds but whatever [laughter] so so that was a great album to do things like that too but um so I Am a fan at least have that album and I it he's mentally talented guy and the jackass you can be both [laughter]\nAny hanging out with Kim could ask you\nYeah nobody I think for the seems like nobody likes the Kurdish genes and yet millions must 'cause they're popular too yes I guess if they might be saying what what do they I guess they feel close right does that went there and there was a bit of reality show that while you're at the reality show that has been successful\nI guess man if you want to watch that stuff I just don't get it [laughter] I don't I mean crash in one of those things I was kidding with our producer saying like it it's one of those that she's offensive I Can't stand it but I Can't look away and I think most men would probably not look away from\nI could look away a you're a stronger man to me well that's a low blow bar [laughter] a nomination\nQuestions and canoeing in Calcutta it'll doing and the ... and ... and captain crunch available eight six six three to one ten twenty eight six six three and I wanted to and twenty a back with more of Doug on the other side new video ten twenty ...\nYeah I liked his mortgage right and he said let me go back to the controller and find out what's going on and then they show the ... the camera shows the control room and it's all white guys work in the control room and one of them you know he's coming back he's coming in and all the white guys get up and run out and black guy come in and sit down\nAnd just so you know that we're not totally obsessed with race auto Doug's Republican so he probably is but I Know what yeah uh also stuff they could not do today that that do you do with race with these glass bottom boat sketches were buck Henry was a child molester and say let's like glass bottom boat and they I don't know I sit on a glass\nJudo Gilda Radner Newman would sit on a table in their in their underwear and he would get underneath and take\nForever right and you couldn't make trauma jokes they know now I'm not advocating that you know too bad oh did I miss the old they're doing all that he was there's only one I I I it's fine with me that that has disappeared it's just an interesting way that comedy has of all\nYou know and I don't think African American politicians would nowadays even\nAgree the owners of the race here I was already talking about ... underwear you're back\nTo know what I'm saying they they couldn't do is get like that with buck Henry watching with candy bars in his pockets and then the two actors just trying to get the idea is they could never do that today and and like I said I don't think black politicians or or or civil rights activists Julian Bond just Reverend Jesse Jackson would agree to to do\nThere's only wouldn't write write it for me there probably I Would say no no definitely not a we're talking about other can particularly in everything under the sun eight six six thirty nine one ten twenty eight six six three and I won ten twenty it's open talk\nSo Doug I got in trouble early in the show because I was talking about them on you to them and the TV interview which would add on ABC tomorrow night at ten and she said in an interview some of the eclipse where at least she said I Am one of the most ... leads people to work\n[noise] [noise]\nSo first of all I was attacked for you know making fun of her accent but I'm Sorry I Can't help myself making fun of rats and it's pretty good I I Am I'm not I am trying to imitate it\nYou know if you know what I mean in ...

buy one eight six six five oh Jim both what eight six six five oh five or six to six thanks for being\nA part of the program I I just still going over the various conclusions reached by our previous guest Dr John Hubert the Austin, Texas based clinical forensic psychologist who chairs mainstream mental health dot org\nThis new generation that's worse than the helicopter parents worse they call them lawnmower parrots\nAnd are they\nLike a lot more just removed every obstacle from their child's pat\nEliminating the entire [noise] method by which kids grow up [noise]\nI mean it it sounds so ducked ugly compassionate to we don't want our kids to suffer [noise]\nWell I don't want them to ah to suffer from dreaded diseases or or a crippling auto accidents or anything like that or a sexual assault or a lot of things I don't want our kids to suffer from but the ordinarily bumps and bruises of life\nThe the day to day\nOf of learning by doing and by making mistakes that's a necessary part of growing up as in fact that's the goal if you really want your your child to grow up that's how you do it that's how you grew up is how I grew up making mistakes\nI a good look back on my mistakes in in various categories there are a few I suppose that I made that look back and I still cringe about many of them I laugh about was I dug\nA at a lot of them I can look back in a positive way and say that wasn't fun but I'm a better person because of it\nAnd it it sounds to me that there is a whole generation not ...\nThe whole generation not everybody in the generation but but I ... a major subset of this generation the parents engaged in such behavior as if they never thought about it\nAs I say it is difficult for me to even conceive of any parent who who thought about this for more than twenty seconds to not be able to figure out that this was a terrible thing you're doing you're setting up your children to fail\nWhy but apparently what to do that I mean\nI guess if if you're not very bright\nYou could convince yourself not me but maybe you could convince yourself that you're being compassionate my child will not ever stop there do they will learn nothing I Will see to it that they go through Eighteen years of of formative life and learn nothing\nBecause every chance they had to learn how to get away and make sure that they don't learn except maybe they learn that a mommy and daddy will always be there to make it all better\nNot the way it's supposed to be and again I Am sure that not every parent does this I Know a few parents in that age group not a lot but the ones I Know\nActually raise their kids with discipline and with standards of performance and with punishment when they they've followed by the side with correct the behavior all the things that are yes hassles ... and sometimes\nEven painful for the parents but that's what you signed up for when you when you reproduced I mean yeah you're having a kid [noise] this is what you're supposed to do\nIts it interesting that that we have a generation of young parents who apparently can't figure that out [noise] everybody\nI'm Talking to right now talking with that one eight six six five oh Jim boat we were all raised by parents who started out in life making mistakes you grew up who had children and they let us make mistakes\nSome more mistakes than others some lessons more painful than others but the general rule of thumb was I Want my child to grow up to be an adult so that they can cope I won't always be here\nPeople who are parents get older they die the kids was supposed to carry on that's the whole point\nI Want to produce kids who can make a go of it after I'm gone\nIt it just strikes me as I said I'm just wondering uh how you feel about that or am I to old fashioned them I stuck in the past ... lacking compassion for young people who should always be protected from every conceivable moment of pain embarrassment or heaven forbid\nChallenge to their self esteem\nWhat eight six six five oh jumbo is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six I I just just curious about it to me it is just astounding that this can happen all that there would be a few people like this year I mean in a nation of three hundred thirty million people you're going to have a few\nBrain dead do fire guy except that I'm not happy about it but I accept it but it sounds like\nMuch more than that it sounds like a trend not a universal trend to be sure but enough of a trend that you have to wonder are these people thinking\nAt all\nI don't think we're talking about parents who sit down at and\nDone it and and deliberately calculates this is how I sabotage my child's life they're not they're not saying that to themselves they're not that they may be doing it but that's not what they're trying to do\nJust uh just sad and bizarre as I say life comes with challenges\nAs they say no pain no gain some pain of course we don't want our kids to undergo other other types of pain I mean it's it's essential it's essential one eight six six five oh Jim bode too well Wanda in\nHopkins bill Kentucky a good evening welcoming\nYes good evening Dan is saying today that problem today is that the parents how become that channel day and then she didn't have the kind of the parents\nWill certainly the parents have become the children are in many cases I I started like nobody's become apparent [laughter]\nI've seen to speak today passed in a way that oh my God my mother or if they just yeah ... they just wouldn't it would be unbelievable\nI cannot believe that no they can't stop no respect today I'm I'm just about that is getting a race had no response you know that God allows this is just horrible\nIt is horrible and and it does it what's worse Wanda is that it's entirely foreseeable I mean kids must be taught to be rational reasonable people uh kids left to their own devices uh uh they will\nThey will produce some pretty frightening circumstances\nLists that society uh yeah I mean that the children to go out I mean I'm just looking at a certain things on it just sometimes I just wouldn't even tolerate things are just\nSo unbelievable and you're like well these people put planet that those people come from some well what do\n... it's a great question what planet and they do they come from I I tell you wonder are they all are to read the lord of the flies\nA very interesting book a work of fiction\nBut uh it's an allegory there is a lesson to be learned in the book the lord of the flies it is what can happen when kids essentially grow up on their own and don't learn these valuable lessons All right to a bill in Walla Walla Washington hello bill and the welcome\nYeah hey how're you doing\nFine thank you will start your call here might have to carry at best a break but go ahead\nOh okay we'll CBS child protective services [noise] has taken over\nFor the parents there's nothing you know parents can do can

ban and they're here it's just a big fan and he ...\nWell I tell you why shouldn't I gotta I gotta agree with you build it as a a situation that uh has gone way overboard uh we're talking here about
