going to improv is Arlen for the first several minutes [noise] uh\nYeah he uh Arlen did love baseball though yeah I Love sports I remember one time he called\nMe on how at home on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon and I I think he's watching the Sixers and it was funny listening to him like in the background complaining about something that the Sixers giving advice and then trying to discuss his trip to Pittsburgh the next day\nI don't get to oh because it's amendment ... ... people don't know that that's probably that's probably just another one of your racist or being in the minority in ... in Congress or the state house or Senate means you're in the party that doesn't have as\nHas less guys and the people actually know that an ... an earth thought that he was an African American and Native American making in Austin a kind of an Asian American edgy joke\n[laughter] 'cause I Know they were shock jocks here today and I'm thinking to do with race with you know that's me [laughter]\nI Wonder if there's anybody less racist than me I don't think so no I actually don't think you're close to even like most Trump supporters of germs now most racist and they might not obey me well maybe not most just a large chunk because there are no democratic gracious none there are plenty of democratic crisis absolutely\nIt's just very disappointed to 'em and they're probably the ones who voted for Trump across party lines because he there man was there\nSo that you mentioned the he did say it was a fiasco what happened to ... who was murdered as you know the Saudi Arabian right columnist for the Washington Post\nBut the reason I thought that was crap because after that he said well I talked to the king and I talked to the prince and they still strongly denied it that they had anything to do with a strongly denied it I thought\nMy God if Hitler came and strongly denied he had anything to do with the killing six million Jews you'd buy it wouldn't [laughter] I mean did and why would ... um the Saudi Arabians\nPresidents over the years we've had an jak can any one of them had Bill Clinton and morality Lyndon Johnson\nOr they cared a ... they may have a been a moral when it comes to sexuality or immoral but now when it comes to the murder of journalists I think they've found their morality and dad this\nPoint and this this is I think this topic will come up for years from now as to the impact it's having a moral dried on that note nobody should die nobody should be killed it's ridiculous it's office dreadful but it's\nAbout ... should die we're all going to but it but at one day but it's having an incredible impact\nWorldwide on this and and it's not unique journalists are killed frequently usually\nDoesn't happen to well but em but already Arabian Prince claimed he was a reformer and implying that he wouldn't do things like that anymore\nAnd there's really I don't know if it'll ever come out how he died I mean they they talked about you already did they they uh he got a fist fight I mean you could beat someone to death on a fist fight Fifteen to want to finish what\nIt's it's the crown prince absurd story of that it was an accident you gotten a fist fight it's the Turkish government's position that they meant to kill them and they\nKilled him right although the Turks aren't exactly known\nFor civil rights no we're not saying I Know that their rivals as well so they're enjoying rubbing salt in the ones with the Saudis right\nBut um it's one of those situations I\nAte somebody called me up or I'm Sorry I've got one of the situation that men are up\nNow and that in the ... these are important people to the United states in this country even though it's a dictatorship we'd prefer to be in a democracy but at the same time\nBut he was killed because as you know he criticized the Saudi Government exactly and so if we if we don't mind that kind of a thing then why don't we just go kill a CNN journalist which I'm sure that this cross Trump's now it'd be MSNBC get it right yeah so I don't know who he hates more [laughter] I seriously don't guy some sometimes I think he ate CNN more [laughter] but I could be rough\nUm but ... again ... ... it's a situation where this is the enemy of our enemies our friend and um\nI Know but it's a many companies have pointed out including my V. on just like with Russia we can sanction them and still deal with ... and we can punish Saudi Arabia without totally cutting off relations and or oil\nUm somebody called early today it was a big deal about this uh Christianity or whatever that he's not a citizen is not an American citizen I sat right 'cause that's what Trump said early on as if that was it important distinction to make right away which to me implies jobs they're saying\nOK it's not that big a deal don't get your parents in a while it's not that big a deal with that I can tell you\nI I should know this and I'm embarrassed I don't what's what nationality Izzie Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabian okay our buddies got two kids that are American American right so I guess what what when you come to the point\nOf\nEvery country in the world should be concerned than not ... agree the Americans you know absolutely because but in terms of America because we are\nWe're allegedly the beacon light and the leader of hope and the all the good things and sugar and spices and everything nice or at least the closest thing that you can get to it in this horrible war in this world the way to do but I don't even know if that's true but that's what we claim we are so we have tried to live up to\nIt occasionally I think well if I win a billion\nDollars yeah let's talk about that if it ended up I mean it's probably only like what half a billion after taxes but still\nI might be ... isn't it up of pushing two billion now or something\nI you know what I'm not even as you're actually come I thought that somebody said one billion and you get five or six hundred came out\nWith a billion dollars and it would uh I I'm not pulling it Ted Turner member he donated a billion dollars to UNICEF ... many years ago\nI think I Would do that while I wouldn't do that if I only got a poultry five hundred and fifty million I'm not going to lead to a billion\nI mean I might put a quarter billion into the Saltsman Family Foundation and fun\nFive hundred and fifty million I'm not going to pledge a billion I mean I might put a quarter billion into the Saltsman Family Foundation and find where we can dollar delicious Donald Trump [laughter]\nJust for for no fault for for um a phony foundation and pay off your debt so that it\nCan now I don't think I ... I think I could pay off the debts what the rest of the money I what I always get mad when you don't know\nI expect that when I get mad at all these people who end up killing themselves are being penny lists or whatever now I Know it's a big pain in the bud and I've never experienced it obviously neither of you and that it would be a great responsibility but come on hire somebody to you know guide you and your investments um\nEvery once in awhile to be an article um although I haven't seen when the ... that used to doing press would do them they\nAnalyze back then marine daughters there was a lot of money people who won a million dollars in the lottery and where they are now you know they put a three hundred and fifty thousand or addition on the hundred and ten thousand dollar home or they've gone through divorces bankruptcies alcohol or something yeah yeah it it's incredibly ... what happens to people when they get great\n... I I was going to say and so maybe I'm oversimplifying it and I'd be the biggest city with the money that we've never lucky enough to win the lottery but I feel like no I could manage that or I could hire somebody has\nYes yes take this money and just give me an allowance and that would give a big chunk to charity just to get out of my conscience wrecked because no one deserves this much money and all all you've done to accomplish it is go to a lottery\nMachine just I don't want to hear it when they say what have you done like I don't know what I gave this of millions of dollars in American society so bus off\nA so last I bought the ... I don't play I've never played a lot of your today mega millions ... um yeah what I bought it for the last ... summer I was you know\nWhich is the billion dollar one ah believe mega millions is that one Lutsen okay yeah that's nice I bought it for the last time when it didn't hit him holding it in my hand I spent twenty dollars you get fined like you did this time\nYes the Saudis looks yeah oh you bought so ten tickets yet yeah in fact they all come comes on one big ticket you get kinda what do you get five numbers each time sent fifty plus all those mega balls it's another ten I got one number right it's incredible one\nWait a minute I'm Sorry are you talking about today and the numbers are already out you've already\nNo no no this was last week a one from last what'd you get any from this week I I did buy or this week but yeah I did buy for this week to how many divide this week twenty dollars were no kidding 'cause I had a twenty dollar bill\nI only ... I bought four dollars that his ticket to the mega millions and four dollars a Powerball cause I understand that I forget the number of un Powerball also up\nThere though I yeah I Know you had a horrible thing just as you can still do that to me because I Want to be a billionaire like my hero\nDonald Trump I heard ... yeah right as well whatever you saw the New York times story he really has been living a live forever but anyway um\n[noise] uh I heard somebody say they would buy the Steelers and trade levy on bell [laughter] I don't think the ruined his would give them up\nWell probably not and I don't even know if you could afford them even if you had half a million and if I if even if half a billion or half a billion I Apologize yeah what are the ... I don't even I don't know what they're worth lots of money I'm certainly not doing okay [noise] so have you ever been to Las Vegas\nI Am not it just doesn't do anything for him and I go to the maintenance I'd probably take a tour it 'cause I've been to casinos and it's\nI hate casinos and do it if I went to Vegas once in a job interview and so I didn't really have a chance but I was looking for Franken dean and Sammy and all I saw was people with sandals and sucks [laughter] it was kinda disappointed was like it looked like Disney World to me in a ... but now I'm ... I was thinking of going somewhere warm sometime this winter and Vegas as pop\nAnd he was like it looked like Disney World to me in a ... but now I'm ... I was thinking of going somewhere warm sometime this winter and Vegas has popped up as a possible destinations chief what though they had to legalize marijuana there now and then out yeah\nI I Would probably like when I take a tour of Hoover Dam that's the type of thing\nYou know I I totally forgot that that's anywhere near Los Angeles and is there okay without a do that's already been out who understand yeah he's\nA friend of mine told me uh they went to Vegas and enjoy themselves and mentally but the only thing that in like is it everybody's high now the pot is legal everybody walking up and down the street is high and and everywhere you go smells like bought\nAnd it sets a nice smells sounds like there via couldn't they work on that leads to make it smell I don't know what this is only the testimony of one person\nI'm so there's is we'll see how we do tonight to join us less than an hour less than ... ... about half an hour does he might get more than one ticket I'm In a way to the moral if it did I Know what are the ones I'm not doing it again it's silly I don't want to be disappointed early\nYou know at the shark shark attacks and vending machines falling on June lightning strikes the odds are greater much much but not even close yeah\nI guess they said they're probably going to sell Seventy five percent which is hard to believe that if you think in certain places they're showing for hundreds of second certain states are so important to say I'm ... and they still only estimate do self Seventy five percent of the number combinations\nSo that's what they're they're predicting a fifty percent turnout of eligible voters\nAnd that's big and yet it's like are you carrying all why isn't right why isn't it Seventy five or eighty\nI mean here in Afghanistan they had parliamentary votes people are risking their lives\nTo vote and it occurred to me and we and we don't vote because there's a long line\nThere never is it my north ... mind it's always me and a goat and a dog I wait thirty seconds to maybe you\nDon't ... don't go at prime time it's if you don't want to write in line if there's a line sometimes there might be an issue of the voting machine or something like that but I I don't understand why people don't\nVote because they have no idea what's going on because it's too boring to follow and there are too many entertainment sort of the Stafford into occupy their minds that's what I'm starting to be I I I Know it's kind of get off my lawn ... but I was a boring people doing the eight o'clock hour and it was just me and I had to start talking about stuff to fill time\nThat when I was a one of my first jobs just to cover the Carbondale, Illinois city council first jobs in news right\nAnd they would always be like there's a public hearing on the ordinance about such and such and let's see one person has shown up and then they would complain about nobody shows up for the public hearings and I would think to myself as a cub reporter\nWill people have lives I mean they got families defeat they cannot how many people are are too busy to come to the public airing but now it's kind of come full circle not that I think people should go to public hearings that's certainly but you've got to educate yourself at least in some general way oh I Know is because CBS News\nOne of the newscasts earlier tonight was like\nPeople in Louisiana are calling the election offices and they're saying hotel on the ballot what's the important issues it seems to me there's a lot of ... [laughter] I don't want the election office to give them a quick briefing yeah and I even asked\nHis impeachment on the ballot [laughter] just kind of a of heard that word and and I'm like is it just hit Louisiana's little videos which is quite possible\nOr are we all that ignorance or or three people called in so they made a new star that that's an excellent point actually that could be that good at first the ... election department should not be giving out opinions as to what the issues are not\nWell not they I still think they were no they weren't like his impeachment on the ballot right because then I might cause then I might go vote but yeah the ...\n[noise] yeah but you can't vote those guys can't impeach Hillary at this point you know\n[laughter] that's right but that can lock her up that's for sure\nUm yeah and it I always wonder sometimes if there's there's strong discontent among I heard a report one day say something about the the Kavanaugh thing and they said but privately they're saying this I'm like how does that report or know what they're saying privately yeah I always wonder\nIf this but I bet Brock the producer he votes he better yes he said he was just I knew it I I don't say he doesn't even care and yet he's a good citizen\nYeah I don't think I missed all that many yeah I I I've missed a few votes over the years usually because I found that suddenly have to go at a time for work at a time to time and you know I I did know about it far enough in advance that I could have done I Am my\nGod you worked in politics and you know about the election far enough advantage\nOr no no no no I didn't know I had to travel on a like a name for nothing to me I mean look at it I could have requested a an absentee ballot um but yeah\nAnd I didn't know I had to travel on a like a name for number ... that I could have requested a an absentee ballot um but yeah I don't think I'd miss ... elections I mean there's just not that hard to vote it's pretty simple\nYou go in you hit a feud buttons and and if you don't know everybody on the ballot then don't vote for everybody you know and I my my daughter went in and said you know I don't know all this I said well then vote for what you think's important and you don't have if you're not familiar with the other ones then you don't have the votes and there's other ones you don't\nEight six six to nine one ten twenties number to call we're up against the world series and the penguins so I'm surprised we got one call here's Carly Newcastle Carl God Bless you hey John\nDoug how're you guys doing tonight\nAwesome well uh I don't know if\nYou heard but the six o'clock news a Trump or announced when they were question him about a Saudi Arabian business and a a caravan coming up have an ISIS people and all that baloney and whether you had any proof or not he said he had no proof but\nHe announced that he is going to give a ten percent tax cut to the middle class\nIt's a brand new Trump stir propaganda anyhow uh the Congress as a lot in session and he doesn't have any inside information from Congress to pass something like this but he's promising to deliver this and so now\nI did hear about that more fake news more Trump pulling stuff out of the stuff's terrier and making it up as he goes along and God Knows how many people believe that\nYeah ah it's disappointing how many people believe that and if if he was able to do it how's it going to get you know pay for it and who's going to pay for it for years to come I mean it gets uh it it gets disheartening they\nHear how many people actually believe that the stuff that comes out of his mouth\n[noise] uh I couldn't agree more anything else Carl\n[noise] no that's about it I'm going to go back and finish World Series or catch in a while I was listening to you guys\nAre amazing I listen to you I'm Amazed and God Bless you for even taking the time to listen as well the world series on tearing down the volume on the TV and listen to us Yammer I don't know yeah\nI mean uh you know something comes up now and then and I like to keep in touch with what's going on so\nUh you could well both you're actually going to vote I'm guessing two weeks from today right what's that you're you'll be voting two weeks from today\nOh yeah definitely um but I'm I'm concerned about the uh the number of people that will get out and vote in and be serious on the Democratic side in or whether there'll be that same kind of turn out on the Republican side ah I'm worried that the cabinet thing as instigated the Republican somewhat\nOr I don't blame you Carl thanks for your call let's talk about turnout a civil war on the other side You're welcome to call in and he took six three and I won ten twenty John ... is in ...

putting them in a man with a lot of innovative ideas let's talk to a dog who calls a delight to from Pittsburgh Katie ... evening Doug welcome to the program\nHi Jen thanks for taking my call I enjoy your show thank you what I what I wanted to ask the mayor about Pittsburgh gun with similar transformation from having industry steel and the biomedical\nAnd banking cetera um and it's doing well the region is doing well however\nThe city school the Pittsburgh city schools struggle year after year fewer and fewer families are sending\nTheir students to the Pittsburgh public school they'll go anywhere else private school a Catholic school charter schools et cetera\n... how is the Oklahoma City public schools are they doing through the transformation of the economy in your city\nWell it's it's a little inconsistent certainly we're we're a little different in that we have twenty four school districts that are inside the city limits of Oklahoma City and so you have all sorts of different success stories inside those twenty four but\nThe largest district as about forty percent of the population at the Oklahoma City school district and it's it's a you know performing poorly a similar to what you're describing in Pittsburgh\nSo I mean ... the urban public school setting it's still it's a very much a distress full situation across the country\nIn Oklahoma City there are a lot of good public schools um out all around you know that center part of the city\nAnd people have gravitated and that's part of the you know the ... issue that took place over the last few decades people were searching for a better education for their kids\nAnd so we're trying to get more options you know charter schools than at other options for kids that for for parents that want to come in and provide more density and the core of the city but I don't know the single mayor out there that satisfied with the level of education and their inner city district\nYou mentioned charter schools I wanted to ask you more about how successful they've been\nWell most of our biggest success stories are charter schools are ...\nSuccessful they've been well\nMost of our biggest success stories are charter schools are ... now I Can't tell you that they're all high performing but a lot of them are\nUm and um you know are like my one of my granddaughters attempts at a charter school downtown and you know it it's run by a board of our business leaders\nAre who you know kind of ensure its success and um you know there's nothing magical about the about the model it's not that they have a\nBigger budget they have a smaller budget it's not that they get the hand picked their kids they don't any kid can go there that lives in the district a but they've\nTaken out some of the inefficiencies I think that our public school system is played by and created a model that puts more dollars into the classroom so you know in in that one instance things could be working better I I liked the idea that parents have choices um and in in Oklahoma City there's a lot of choices\nYou know I I Know of course you're acquisition of the NBA thunder franchise and also the opening it part of the maps three project was the the opening of the new stadium where the Oklahoma City ran off your AAA a baseball team are sports franchises\nA good way to enhance the city because I Know some some urban areas have become disgusted with the exorbitant demands from most sports franchise owners\nWell it's been a big positive for us I I think one of the differences is\nIf you if you don't have a a major league sports franchise and you get one it is on a superficial level of a level of quality that you didn't have before and I'm not saying it should mean this much but it does and and the fact that\nThat suddenly your sports teams are playing teams in New York and Chicago and Los Angeles it\nAnd that matters because the image of your city to a certain extent is who your sports teams play and there's a level of quality that a major league sports team can provide to a city the size of Oklahoma City I think it helps our CEOs attract talent from around the country\nWhen you know you offer somewhat a job at a company in Oklahoma City that person no matter where they live in the United states they're going to think of themselves if I take this job I have to live in Oklahoma City or if I take this job I get to live in Oklahoma City\nAnd having a major league sports team is an asset that would get more people that would be more likely to take that job\nOn on a millennial basis my my input from young people is that they want to live in a city that's culturally relevant\nAnd that includes a pop culture and a major league sports team mates you culturally relevant to me when Russell Westbrook and Paul George to name a couple of our players\nYou know choose to live here and and choose to sign contracts here when they're offered contracts by every other team in the league seemingly um that sends a message that this is a good place to live\nUp in the I think that when sports starts to become tired in a city is when they have more than one franchise and people get tired of subsidizing one new facility after another new facility now and so I I get it you know if you have three sports teams like Seattle there\nUm\n[noise] no I Can't believe how easy it will save hundreds of dollars in my car

needed ... votes or impact or which is by the way based in in southeastern Missouri a down toward do roughly the Memphis metro area and along the Mississippi River I don't think that the New Madrid influence extends as far west as Oklahoma\n\nUh your thoughts are Mr Mayor\nWell I yeah I think I think he's just seen it on pause you there's a connection between the oil and gas exploration and uh-huh and the earthquake it does seem like there's a connection there so you know\nCentral Oklahoma was already on a fault it was probably more susceptible with these water injections took place um and like I said you know they pretty much diminished at this point is I think the scientists to work really hard and they know that\nYou know you you can't survive a politically um if you're the cause of these ... a nerve or being a earthquakes\nBut I think most people in Oklahoma had been very patient with oil and gas industry it's been a significant part of our economy for a long long time and\nMost Oklahomans are thrilled that United States is in more control of its energy future going forward that we bend light burn and oil and gas industry playing a major role in our economy\nUm but you know at some point their their technology has got to catch up and figure out a way to do that you bring out the oil and gas that they'd like to bring out a without causing harm on all the rest of us\nNow in the Oklahoma economy of course a a began a pretty much wants to uh uh the presence of a lot of oil was discovered in and of course the automobile really coming into its own just about the time that Oklahoma became a state back in in Nineteen oh seven\nOr ... the Oklahoma economy has been tied with energy for for many years is the the state's economy are still that directly tied to do energy or has it didn't affect diversified\nYeah uncle my city has supplied with the student has bought\nAnd sold Oklahoma has the state is overly reliant on the oil and gas industry and as a result it's it's a it's a kind of me and it's tax revenues cyclical um based on you know how the oil and gas industry is doing but in the oil and gas industry is going through such a transformation right now\nAll of the technology of the advancements that they've been making have made them more efficient industry or you know with the current price which is much lower than it was just a few years ago they're able to make a profit\nUm I I Would say we've already reached peak oil and gas industry it just simply takes fewer people to extract oil and gas on the ground it's more technology driven and they get more oil and gas that it was single well used to [noise] um and so the result of that as a more efficient business model\nOr one that ... ... fewer people are but that has really helped the United states deterrent\nThat is a whole if this is a one that ... ... fewer people are but that has really helped the United states determine its own energy future and we need to be less reliance on foreign oil\nAnd uh I the only gas industries you know there's been a wonderful job and creating a better resources for our country here the United states\nYou mentioned the progress that you've made from that one cent sales tax I'm Wondering the extent to which Oklahoma City depends on uh the sales tax versus let's say the property tax or is that one of those few urban areas which has an income

another thing they're\nMost of them are breaking the asylum rules they're supposed to seek asylum is the first country that comes to when they leave their home country\nOnly three hundred of them have thought that the last ... have sought asylum in Mexico they can't just skip over three or four countries and then come to school uncle sugar and knock on the front door and and\n... hours they have to stop and apply for asylum at the first one and another thing\nThey're they're addicts shows they're they're waving their their countries' flags from Honduras El Salvador I forgot the other one

through several countries you put it taken asylum it just we need to stop them before they enter our country\nOh absolutely ... before they enter or you could forget about it because uh they're they're they're gone they're the they've disappeared at that point so yes we do have to do that absolutely which will take a job and thank you for sharing Charlie in Manhattan, Kansas ... been Charlie\n... hard and most of them I denied early\nReal share my grandfather came to this country in Nineteen ah Italy mhm they came through Ellis Island and you know we were up there I got the documentation of his ... and uh\nYou do have money to get in the United states and if you didn't they sent you back on the boat and if you are sick they set you back no war what are we doing with these people come up through the early ... are they going to check your uh\nYour physical ... or are they going to be sick for work\nWell they certainly need to be vetted at a variety of ways\nI mean there are any any right to come up here I mean we got this Fisher\nAnd they need to be vetted and a variety of ways\nYeah I mean they don't have any any right to come up here I mean and we got this issue about him in to sign that says a you know\nIt's it's a great thing to do by laying command if you don't command you you can get X communicated from the Catholic Church when that's absolutely ridiculous with the Catholic Church has all these other problems they've got and he got shipped talking about this\nSo well yeah I Know that that vision of the point of view and fifty cents as far as I'm concerned will get you a cup of coffee I'm afraid would have to be my attitude you can do is take his views of what he was there is not right and to stick them so thanks Charlie DJ and southern Minnesota hello\nGood evening sir good weather and I talk to you guys are deep and what's on your mind to my\nMy my idea what that says okay first of all the people don't disgust me but\nThe other jobs when they had their attitudes disgust me yet but go ahead\nYes the other gentleman had a good a good point where people came into the country the right way through Ellis Island you know through the the right process I don't understand and I am a Marine Corps war veteran and I've been to some of these countries\nI don't understand why Mexico is not doing anything they're letting them come through that shrine we deal with it and they don't have\nTo that's right and uh they're they're doing it because it's to their advantage and that's why they have always until now suddenly had a very tough southern border with Guatemala their northern border they've always looked upon as essentially\nA toilet to flush their uh unemployment and other problems on to the United states Yes sir that letter absolutely\nAnd\nI I I'm forty nine years old I'm a I'm a war veteran and I voted for the first time for president this last election and I am a Trump supporter and I believe what he has planned on putting our military on the line to stop them is absolutely correct I I I don't see how there's an argument for that\n[noise] oh there there's no no rational argument you'll get all kinds of people who get hot and bothered about the fact that we're not being generous enough so it was interesting for me to hear all the people out there who were so generous with the your dollars in my dollars\nA dummy editor he'll morally superior so thank you for your service DJ and for your good thoughts David in Gainesville, Georgia lizard a WD un radio good evening David\nYes Hi Jim Hi there it's been a while since I talk to you I'm Glad you joined as a yeah I had\nA ... type questions I thought you meant you had to kind of get a handle on old man I Know get troops that are\nAll over the globe a cold beer for border to North Korea border you're different\nPlaces right when I was just wondering how do you think maybe the president\nOf the ones that pressure poet is for him to pass the government had to put it in ...\nFish will request for military assistance hold their southern border that while you could send\nTroops to their southern border with\nMexico southern border yeah well first of all I Mexico should be doing their job on their border that's number one and number two I don't know that that uh\nWell first of all I Mexico should be doing their job on their border that's number one and number two I don't know that that we need the opposite is where they're quite capable of garden that borders they've proven over the years suddenly decided\nTo their advantage to let people through but it's not as though they're capable of defending that border they have done so very effectively over the years and they have suddenly stopped which for whatever reason there's a new\nA new president in ... in Mexico city ah\nIf I thought that that would make a difference and there was no other way to do it I could go along with that idea David that honestly I don't I don't think that it's necessary to do that and I do believe that that's the the appropriate way to go\nAnyway uh by the way I almost was in the visiting your good friends Billy Joel on the Wu in this past mourning but\nAt the time was having a dental problems so it was unable to make the trip ... and above it\nThat that scares me the liberals [noise] um I\nYour listeners would know and understand that that scares me liberals\n[noise] um our country are encouraging these people to come forward um you know they had people who are encouraging it and it's all about getting more votes for the Democrats and you know that is\nThat the main thing that the liberals have to gain a out of it the other thing that jam\nIn a ... in in second Timothy it clearly states that a man that will not look after his own household is worse than an infidel we're not looking after our own and I think it is beyond disgraceful that we have millions of veterans and aid\nYes there's no doubt about the fact that we often do not on the do not do enough for our veterans point well taken Charlotte I I Would have to agree with you completely in that regard I joined in Pittsburgh I had a job good evening Joan\nOr put another way Joan in Pittsburgh hello Joan\nOr the gene I'm Sorry it's gene I sorry I uh go ahead Jean\nAll right um my question that I have not heard any news media or anybody address is that a caravan of this magnitude doesn't just spontaneously happen\nAll of a sudden you know he's ... people in these countries have been oppressed for decades mhm match Romney body has to be leading this that planned this somebody organized\nAhead is paying for it who I mean how how are these people eating how are they sleeping are they going to the bathroom I mean that's a lot of people\nYou know where is the expos they on the leadership of this group who's paying now it seems to me if somebody could figure that out which I Would think that our government's already looking into this\nThat that would disclose the true nature of what why this thing is happening by you know figuring out who's in charge and who's paying them your comment\nYes I think that there's absolutely a somewhat behind this ah if it is a a a a Americans that wouldn't surprise me at all of\nA judicial watch president Tom ... says that there is evidence that this the care about is comprised mostly of military age males and was in fact financed by people in the United states so uh that's his view or investigative reporter Sarah Carter\nWho has a up here to this program before and who was in Guatemala she sounded is mostly made the crossing the Guatemalan border and they are given a rehearsed answer this is not politics this is about poverty\nShe tweeted that uh there were women and children but they were at the front of a caravan smaller numbers none would say who the organizers are but several said that it was in fact organizers so yes I think ah\nThe short answer gene is that the you're absolutely correct and that is precisely what we're talking about here we'll talk some more about it in just a moment Yossi ...\nTop we earn more\nYou know if you've done costs um squeaking white
