delighted to have you on the program tonight as we are talking about the new deal that's been worked out with Mexico and Canada\nAnd do that deal has a ... is designed to replace NAFTA was something that is a little more American friendly we'll see just how that goes over with the Congress or whichever Congress it turns out to be of course with the mid term elections coming up and keep in mind of course\nThat although there are elections in November the new Congress will not actually a take power until January so you could have sixty days left with this Congress I'll be at a with a a a lame duck Congress\nAnd the doctor Michael ... is our guest is a public policy analyst in Britain lesser of finance at Stockton University and\nA lot of what we've been saying here I think goes to the very core of a problem but I have always seen with the sort of thing and I guess I could summarize it this way that the more that a free trade zone involves disparate economies\nThe less likely is it to succeed and again that's just right off the top of my head and I never got past econ one oh one but it just strikes me\nThat a disparate economies don't work things out so well so I think what I'd probably most surprised about is\nThat we worked out this deal with by far the weaker less developed of the three North American economies Mexico first\nAnd it's the Canadians who is the economy is much more similar to ours with whom we're having the biggest trouble so if you would address my theory a professor you may give me an a through an app and I'll take my lumps go ahead [laughter]\nWell let me let me say this um you're you're you're correct um unless that less than developed country has some real advantage and making something versus another country for instance\nTo pose the a and here's the example I use on my classrooms um suppose the the the U.S needs to wait and they need coffee\nSo we're very efficient at producing we we have the right climate for it we use a small amount of resources get a large amount of we were not so good at making coffee we don't have the right climate for it we can use a lot of resources and not get much coffee\nA country like Columbia let's say in South America is just the opposite they don't have the climate or to grow wheat nor the the know how do they have to use a lot of resources and get a little bit of weight on the other hand they have a great\nAnd they have a great climate\nFor growing coffee and they're good at it so they use a little bit of resources to get a lot of coffee what happens they say suppose the U. S. specializes in making just we were going to get huge amounts of weight\nColumbia says okay will specialize in just making coffee we get huge amounts of coffee then we'll trade our coffee for you and we\nBoth countries end up with more coffee and more wheat without adding any more resources\nSo free trade benefits everybody well why somebody complaining you would say and the answer is if we stop making coffee in my example that make just wheat anybody making coffee is out of a job you say well you can go make week\nBut the skills may not be transferable from the industries that leave to the industries that are built up and that's what happened in in Canada the U.S has an ... is very efficient at making dairy products\nTo to get free trade you should let us make the dairy products and sell them in Canada we'd end up both countries would end up with more a production of dairy products but the problem is what happens is the Canadian dairy farmers well they should go do something else but\nThey say we don't want to do something else do we want to continue to make dairy products for and that's what the rub is with with Canada\nAll right to a call from Sharon in ... Missouri a grieving Sharon\nGood evening can and about ... getting us to think I heard today only what on radio is that China has announced that they are going to be paying carrots\nOn unspecified

money and if you follow it influence\nThat is put on our politicians\nBy that lobbyist by different governments by our own government if you follow\nThat money you will find exactly why we have had bad trade agreements ratified\nWell we're coming up on a break your all lifted Dodger ... linked here I'm sure more learned opinion after the break this year and I will add a couple of things here uh to what you just said and please stay on the line\nOr one would be of course that are no matter how much lobbying occurs on behalf of foreign governments and goodness knows there's a ton of

steel and them we can try to steal from the Chinese are much lower cost\nThan it cost ... then for us to make ourselves then instead of these planes costing whenever they cost a few million dollars a piece you can reduce the cost to make the planes we don't need to give China our technology we don't need to let them make the finished product but if they can make components\nCheaper than we can

there and also a public policy analyst and we're looking at the new proposed a trade deal together it's not a done deal yet it has to get congressional approval\nBut uh it I suppose it does a lot of a stretch to us\nAnd soon leaving the badly divided Congress would be able to say yes to a fair amount of what is in this let's talk to David who calls in from San Francisco tonight David good evening\nYes I'd jump up and your guest I I'm Out here in San Francisco we've got two major a financial problems directly tied to this Chinese steel\nAnd uh one is the bay bridge which got opened a just probably sort of five years ago and it\nWas this is the new post earthquake Bay Bridge ... right yeah and in\nFact uh if you remember just the dollar value uh at at in the Nineteen eighty nine earthquake they said it would be a quarter of a billion dollars to fix the bridge\nWhen the new bridge opened a couple of years ago it was a what six billion dollars in costs and six billion in financing so it went well forty eight times to become a twelve billion dollar broken rich\nAnd I was defective when it when it opened\nTheir ... are you saying that that was built with with Chinese steel\nOh yeah and what was going well I didn't know that yeah and what was significant about it Arnold was the governor and this crosswords are right okay yeah\nThat was the Republican governor and little brown was the former mayor the two of them put it together and they created they actually created a foundry in China to manufacture the ... the bridge apart there\nWere very few repeating part so it was almost entirely customs and the they had something like twenty thousand inspectors per part or you know each part had to have an inspector\nMassive art ...\nAlmost to the to the mayor and they refused to accept delivery on the parts yet it was over written by a a project manager who had no right to override it\nWell that that sounded like a terrible deal I must say although I'm not sure quite how it fits into the er the context of this discussion regarding a trade matters other than the fact that I guess a professor bus or you should always look twice when dealing with the Chinese [noise]\nBut uh uh current in Rochester, Minnesota is a next step below courage\nI yeah I Do the same thing that bothers me about the ah the steel here from China is if you drive a car a lot and you have to have your brakes re done you may have found out over the last Twenty years but you can't turn a rotor\nAnymore because the Chinese steel that all the car owners are made out of it is so poor that it is not turn of all\nYou know years ago you used to be able to take a break rotors or your drums in and you could Milam down and get another life out of them but nowadays everybody has to throw away their owners because the ... the Chinese steel maybe cheaper\nBut the quality is also cheaper\nAll right I Want our guest to comment about that we've had two calls regarding the quality of of dealing with the Chinese\nIf it's that bad at least in regard to steal I mean you know when you when you buy a a broom and Walmart you really not looking for the the\nThe the nicest brew him out there you want something that will sweep the floor or something like this is well I mean a indicates will break drums a that's not such a good thing in the case of bridges that's a terrible thing maybe it will die\nAre is that the other problem in trading with the Chinese the question of quality if you do we had a question some time back\nSome time back about Africa there was food or pharmaceuticals but there was some serious question about Chinese quality\n[noise] yeah that's that's always an issue in a product like steel obviously quality is a essential there especially of going into products\nOr like a bridge or something that could cause some severe a injuries but how about some of the uh smaller consumer products look at the textile in industry\nSo if I'm the California used to have a huge textile industry and workers were making let's say twenty dollars an hour and as a result of that they made a real they shared that sold for fifty dollars\nWell they decided to outsource some make the ... the uh shirts in China where people are\nAt the time or paid about a dollar a day so now they can make the shirt a and sell it instead of for fifty dollars they can sell

advancing on a ... we've covered I talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two we\nAre\nUnder it and I finally ... for example in every state [noise]\n\nBack to the general have a show as we're talking tonight\nAbout the incredible turn of events that occurred in Mogadishu Somalia twenty five years ago I barely a nation except in name it had disintegrated into chaos it was a well meaning motivation as you heard from the beginning of that trailer about this new documentary\nUh but nonetheless\nAs they say about the the road to hell in his often paved with good intentions we're talking with a couple of a veterans of that particular conflict [noise]\nRetired brigadier general build David\nAnd a retired lieutenant colonel Michael L. or a beep and also another military veteran retired air force colonel\nRandy Larson the executive producer and director of this new documentary film a sister was brought up I I think it's it's a good time for you to inject this before we return to the other two guests Randy and that would be a\nThe a a bureaucracy ... through which you had to bludgeon your way uh how's how serious was that I mean did you receive a lack of cooperation or did you see an outright opposition to what you're telling\nNo there was no opposition but trying to put a documentary film together is is that a nine month it's a marathon to turn their heads at the at the base\nIn the spring and at one to get the facts right and we as a lot of different ... and movies in documentaries that are kind of missed ethical tickets to the mountains but one of the most important things in this story is you know all the military leaders the u._s. troops sent there by George Herbert Walker\nBush because people are starving to death and President Bush said it can be annoying intact next month so we had to send troops over there in what they're for humanitarian reasons and then it turned into an incredible fight\nBut all senior military leaders in the chain of command said we need some armored vehicles over there a case our troops get in trouble helium one case and Bradley fighting vehicle to protect them from the type of weapons the Somali a rebel had\nAnd secretary defiance laugh at him and said no we're not going to send them so when general day but it was colonel\nSimon and and and and colonel Allen but he was a major it's like when they had to go out there and rescue those rangers after helicopters got shot down they had to go get Malaysian armored personnel carriers\nTrump's outlook us troops in there the U.S troops couldn't speak Malaysia\nIt's night there's it's incredible fire going on I Can't even imagine what that must have been life and so as I've been doing this research I mean I Am so impressed with everybody from the AFC about corporal\nThe and CEOs who are incredible the senior in the ocean and and the leaders like a a bill ... and that's who you should really be talking to here because first of all we should never put American troops in that position where we tell them here's a mission to go do but what you're not going to give you the resource that you say you need\nAnd and but I I'm just so proud that we get to honor these veterans ... Mountain Division here on the twenty fifth anniversary\nWell I certainly would concur with you entirely I remember at the time although not realizing the extent to which was true but at the time uh when I was still I was doing this program as a matter of fact it's been that long but I remember\nA severely cast a gaining a defense secretary Les Aspen for worrying about cosmetics about whether or not and and then one tank would make us look less like a peacekeeping mission at the time I thought you know the images is baloney uh although I was using stronger language ... let's talk to a\nA General David ... about that that part of this or that in retrospect would you say that you that you were sent into combat\nA wood and which is what it was it what it turned out to be into combat with less than the resources that they should have been made available to you\nOr al ... I think a commander with a would always want more resources but I think the um\nUm\nOfficers who were in command positions senior to me made it very clear to the national command authority is that um\nOf armored vehicles were required for survivor ability and um and to basically protect our force so\nYes obviously um [noise] you know the more armor you're going to have around your daytime it's usually pretty good thing so um yeah we we certainly could have used it but we didn't have it you know uh the situation dictated that we use what we had and so that's what we do\nThat is true and you know Rachel yeah she's a gift please continue ran a yes\nNo I just want they build David my that would be went into the gunfight that night in a hungry an armored Humvees and light like that in the trailer it's like going in you know in a convertible Corvette and a parade everybody shooting at you and they were in a on armored on be more than a thousand people chew\nAnd we'll recall what happens do armored Humvees when they get hit with let's say ... and ... ... ... uh it it was I assume common knowledge to everyone back then\nThat among those forces active in Mogadishu at the time were those with RPGs rocket propelled grenades or certainly more than a match for ah for example for a Humvee or right\n[noise] well I think that's true but I think you also have to look at it in context at least from my perspective you know the basic mission was to go in and and the safely protects humanitarian assistance operations that were designed to be starving Somalis [laughter] I don't think anybody anticipated\nI'm going into into a firefight I think part of that was\nA lack of recognition and in in my own over the last twenty five years that a lot of time to think about it we we have this term called peacekeeping operations in from my perspective there's another peaceful about those kinds of operations\nThem in this case you had a set of ... you had to drive ... and have a good beer\nYou brought the un and the un became a third drive by the power booed was the uh the the thing that had the most value they're fighting for that and I'm In it escalated I mean there were things that occurred back in June and July with the obvious rave\nAnd I don't think they both at home recognize that there was a fire fight\nOr by until we got the three or I go and so\nI think a lot of the calls for armor that we're not consistent with the information that was coming out a theater with regard to what was going on\nWell maybe not to the general public and I would have to think the defense secretary Aspen had that information\nI think that's probably true ah but I'm not sure that you have the ability and I can't really speak for us has been I mean I I can only tell ya the perspective that the folks that uh I was around on the ground at at the time\nAnd that was that generally speaking\nOr there was a very little information that was flowing out of Somalia back to uh either D.C or back to to ah to centcom to indicate what was really going on in theater so I don't I'm not sure anybody really understood how many firefights we'd already been in prior to the third and

Michael ...\nI I think it's pretty much as colonel David pointed out I I Will use that as an example that um you know as we turned down a the the main route towards the object of say a it was almost the entire world open up and everybody started shooting at us\nAnd then uh once uh the two companies began to return fire\n'em you can you can almost feel that the change in the atmosphere that\nWe

be enough no he's a conservative and anything and everything is fair game\nThat regard and if it's not Cavanaugh a then whoever else comes up\nThen all of a sudden we'll discover all kinds of evil about these people no matter how many FBI investigators have undergone and let's not forget too that most of the people on the Donald Trump list of possible Supreme Court replacement for people who already at the\nCourt of appeals level which is to say they've undergone at least one FBI investigation already again I underwent one to get an army security clearance of above top secret\nI'm sure it's not nearly as there was the ones that the cabinet has already been subjected to and they went back into my life to grade school for Pete's sake the FBI does not mess around on these investigations but yet it's window dressing\nI agree Tim is window dressing and but at the end of the day uh it'll probably be a sufficient to say that we we've asked every question from every quarter\nAnd we'll see whether that is sufficient for the Susan Collins says the of Maine the Lisa Murkowski use\nOf Alaska a and a and it may even give coverage to the likes of a Joe Manchin of West

not believe that uh Mike Pence's tie breaker it will be needed I think that it will be a close but it'll be more than a fifty boat majority\nThe ironic thing ... to him too I just want to point out we've and Jeff Flake of all the people as it is when I look back as I got out\nI've got a long memory I'm I'm In that these are category like you are and I still remember a Nineteen Ninety One and hearing the words on the Senate floor that the man is innocent until proven guilty what we had was not a hearing about a trial\nAnd then the trial that was not enough evidence so I'm going forty to support that Clarence Thomas and that was none other than Democrat Dennis deacon the need of Arizona who Jeff Flake replaced\nA that's a that's true you do have a good memory or and so we'll forgive the fact that you are I gather one of those old white men who are evil and that never to be trusted All right one eight six six five oh Jim bar number one eight six six five oh five or six to six and yes it is true that this was not a court of law so technically\nUh the presumption of innocence does not apply but in practice it has and it should to Randy in Creston, Iowa good evening Randy\nJam I just wanted to call you I I'm a product of the eighties and I just am concerned with cabin on what he says he he never blacked out I don't I don't have a problem with a\n... that had they drank in the eighties everybody did\nBut what he says is adequate says that he did not ever blackout I don't I disagree I think that was a boy or a boy and that that's where I have a big problem with him holding the highest court you're like\nWell I used to I used to drink a lot of our blacked out either I I I I drank too much and there were times when I should have stopped and frankly these days I hardly ever drink at all\nI may be in this calendar year in October I maybe had maybe eight or nine drinks this entire year but uh I drank too much and I didn't uh the idea that if you drink at all regularly that you automatically blackout is simply not true\nWell I'm not saying if you drink as it is not true but I wasn't he says he\nThere's so many people that say the as I just to find that hard to believe and I\nMean again there are various levels of of drinking I mean he said that he's he drank more than he should have but of course is the real issue here is not whether or not he at one time ESPN blacked out a better than another itself is not what's at issue here the idea is that he would have done something horrendous like sexually assaulting somebody\nI mean for example I uh I I drank too much of an occasion but it's sort of didn't improve my my capacity for sexually assaulting anybody you know I just simply\nI lose interest in the world you know\nYeah he's ever been arrested in either they can take it so I I certainly understand that but when I sat on a college student in the eighties I find that hard to believe\nAs well I just know that the majority of college students in the eighties did not suffer blackouts as such\nA again or even if they they drank more than they should uh there are gradations of drinking and they do not in my mind constitute an issue of uh of confidence to hold disposition especially for someone who today apparently a drinks very responsibly so\nTo me that's that's not the issue here the issue is the credibility of the sexual assault charges more to come only six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six on the ... as the FBI is doing they're interviewing the Supreme Court term has begun an eighth justice term will see\nThis happening now our sharing is Katie\nThough if you change the statute of limitations on a crime let's say you make that change in just to make up the number here you make that change in the year uh uh\nTwenty twelve okay and you're talking about an action that occurred let's say in the year uh Nineteen Ninety eight\nWell that that changing the law doesn't affect that crime a yes all crime subsequent to twenty twelve and that law was passed now suddenly have no statute of limitations but if you did a certain bad thing before twenty twelve\nIt has no statute of
