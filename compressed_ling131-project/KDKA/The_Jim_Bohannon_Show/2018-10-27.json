woman who smashed codes story of a true American Hero and patriot and one who's got the credit that she deserved and uh we have a call for our guest Jason ... from Lawrence in the champagne Illinois Lawrence a good evening and do welcome to the program\n[noise] thank you and good evening in both I wanted to share a some information about who it was it may have made that original comment\nA ten or more years ago I was watching a historical presentation on either bbs or CSPAN\nAnd uh what was portrayed was that it was no less than Benjamin Franklin\nWho approached John Adams no less to uh make comment apology was in and debate for John could get onto apologizing or how they're he had spoken negatively about certain other members of the convention his wife\nA menu of and said that ah the famous line apparently that gentlemen don't read another man's letters to his wife\nWell who knows that may have been the the the origin nation to that it is a credit of describes living in in general but of course the the important thing is is the notion that somehow that its own sporting a I guess in in times of winning or potential war when in fact\nUh it's it it may not be quote sporting but this uh this is a is a serious business\nWell I just wanted ID\nYeah ... but again the address your agenda or perhaps so I had not heard that particular story Lawrence but thank you for sharing a I Would have to take a look at how you came across this story a Jason\n[noise] ... so are you talking about surveillance and wiretapping and sort of American attitudes about all of that I'm In twenty twenty Thirteen hours reading about the Snowden leaks ah you know the Snowden story and he revealed that the national Security Agency was gathering\nAnd in twenty twenty Thirteen I was reading about the Edward Snowden leaks ah you know the Snowden story and he revealed that the national Security Agency was gathering\nAh you know communications records of millions of sort of ordinary Americans in the sense I very surprising a lot of people surprising to me and I started to read about the essay\nAnd history of being a sec when you read about the history of the NSA all roads lead to this guy a William F treatment Elizabeth Friedman establishment guy he's considered to be the godfather you say if you go to NSA headquarters at Fort Meade there's a large board\nMeeting by the way it was in Maryland directly between Baltimore and Washington\nBut go ahead so if you if you go to any say headquarters there um you know there's a bronze bus William Freedman had\nOutside of the auditorium is named in his honor and so he's he's considered to be the man but in reading about William or who was a code breaker famous code breaker I saw that his wife Elizabeth was also could break you know that's interesting you write how ... how many husband\nAnd wife or cook breaking team can possibly be a and so I started looking for more information on most of that\nUm and there wasn't really that much out there but I did find a a a link to a library in Virginia private library that that happened to have twenty two boxes of letters and other materials that she had lost their before she died in Nineteen eighty one day I just decided to drive down I Lived in Philadelphia\nSo drove down to the library and I I went inside and I said hello and then I saw since that I was curious about the Elizabeth Smith Friedman collection and and they were very friendly and they they brought out box one\nOf the twenty two ah boxes that Elizabeth said last night I started reading her letters and I it was just one of these moments in in your career that you'll never forget because as soon as I started reading her her handwritten letters from a hundred years ago I was just\nA immediately taken with her I mean she's such a such a vivid kind of voice on the page or and and the materials that library had where\nA or were the kinds of materials that any journalist and author would would want to stumble across it was our original college diary was there it was you know love letters that she read to William early in their relationship some of the letters were actually written in\nCode what one of the amazing thing not written that letter I was going to see who else would do that right\n[laughter] right yeah no I mean it's it's actually it's actually kind of a I mean it's lovely 'cause we we tend to think of\nSecret right writing a in secret messages as a way to\nUm as a way to hide things but for them it was a way a flirt [laughter] I like to bring them closer together and ah it was just the the the tax or these materials was was just a very cool to me and I and I realized after spending some time with them that\nUh there was an untold story here they're really good needs to be told that it was a story of you know this amazing hidden woman who was behind the developments\nOf American intelligence and the twentieth century is kind of a genius who solved all kinds of problems and fix\nAll kinds of messages and you know the more I read the more I realized that she she was kind of like a jelly figure in American intelligence history she'd\nAnd then she would get written about in the paper because she was a story you know she was she was this American Housewife who had two kids and yet ah during the twenties and thirties she was taking on these gangsters and she wasn't just taking them on in an office you know solving their messages and getting them convicted and she was actually\nAttending their trials and testify and\nSo they knew who she was\nRight the newer face they could see her and um it's just not necessarily the safest thing to be doing right you can you can uh you can imagine and um\nAnd so yeah so there were there would be you know there'd be gangsters or on trial a lot of these a lot of these run running rings we're international crime syndicates it was essentially the mafia and so she didn't she would walk into court a unprotected with you know a pink\nDress in a in a in a a [laughter] ... with a flower pinned to the brand and she would stare down these guys the defense table you know five foot three and she would die explain exactly how she had broken their codes exactly how she had essentially stolen their thoughts and uh you know and she did it fairly fearless we all all through that time\nIt was necessary for her to actually get into the tradecraft in a court of law that that's remarkable in today of of\nFearless we all all through that time but it was necessary\nFor her to actually get into the tradecraft\nIn a court of law that's that's remarkable in today and of course\nThe minute anything like that came up a federal agent would would would walk in with some kind of a of a federal court order and would immediately shut down that testimony at least in part of a public trial I mean that the free market you know these are things that were these are things that that uh\nLet me put it this way when I left the army uh I took an oath not to talk about certain things which I have not that many many decades later I was even forbidden to visit\nI Am an iron curtain country for five years after I left the army and I was a a relatively small player albeit with a top secret plus clearance and the idea that she was soldering into court as well this was how he did it I mean that that's remarkable\n[laughter] I mean so you you are you in your career you you weren't able to you expose your sources and methods that would\nGet right to the last thing that you'd be able to be a good way to spend some time at Fort Leavenworth Kansas behind bars and that is correct exactly\nExactly and and I and that's that was true that and it's true today about the fact the fact was\nAt the time she had no choice she was she was asked asked to to do this testimony by a federal prosecutors because the prosecutors needed to make cases against some of these international crime rings\nUm that were killing people and that we are controlling the the ... and so they they they wanted to get these guys in prison they wanted to take down these steps in and the only way to do that\nWell it's actually try to make a case against them so in in which step Elizabeth and\nUltimately you know there would be a lot of publicity around these trials because it's kind of spectacular\nVisual to see the ... uh America you know an American woman American mother testify against these guys so she got all kinds of a newspaper coverage that were front page\nNewspaper stories about Elizabeth fell through the Nineteen thirties and uh and the tone of them were ... ... it's sort of was like a that there was a woman doing things that men could into I'm I'm looking right now at at at at one of my favorite clips which is a story a true story published about Elizabeth and in a magazine called true detection a detective fiction\nWeek weekly the true story about her though and the title was lady men out there and there was this just lining the story about um how small slender American Woman stepped in and smashed crime where men had to sell [laughter] uh so she was she was a state tax and she was she was a skeptical\nFor ... and obviously that made a lot of her superiors very happy I'm sure okay we're going to come back and talk more with Jason ... the book the woman who smashed codes again Elizabeth Smith Friedman just a
