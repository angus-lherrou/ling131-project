[laughter]\nNow like his future aspiration for a higher level office I think he he he's posturing for that and I also think that ah he generally believe the cabinet at this point would be\nIt would be a stain on the court um I think flake actually holds the party in order a high esteem and he does not like what it's become and he's given Murkowski and call ins that out like okay it's like a\nGame I I'm afraid that he just gave him cover to act like they really did investigate it thoroughly and they're all gonna vote\nFor him no well he keeps saying like a a full investigation needs to be a full investigation he's signaling that he doesn't believe that it's enough um but as Tony said tonight uh it's it at the speech tonight um\nVery unusual at all hits per speakers serious could plug um he ... the FBI can do a lot of work in a very short amount of time there are thousands\nOf FBI agents all over the country and they give you more water and a dean is right that that ... a Mr McGahn the White House counsel on behalf of Trump limited to only for people making their it as much as they want the FBI is going to investigate how they want and they're going to put in the report what they want\nIf that was hearing on cable news commentator saying they'll know in this case the their the client of the White House and they yes they are employed by the White House to look into that but they can refer anything they find\nI mean it's if if they find evidence of wrongdoing they find evidence of criminal acts\nThey're not required and just like sit on that\nSo if it's can be proven that he lied I mean the here's here's the big tell\nThere's a lot of people saying it's rated the investigation they interviewed mark judge for two days it doesn't sound like someone who sat there saying I don't recall for two days two days here that but yeah the two days in a row they interviewed ... proof already that he lied with the text messages we have proof Eli from two dozen foreign to them six from emails from the Bush administration\nAre you talking about the text messages when he said he hadn't heard that some of the allegations but the test mess yes it was ... that he did that he knew about it and yes yeah yeah there's a line right\nThat there's a logical explanation for that though because the New Yorker probably would have contacted him beforehand when they started working on this story or to get a comment on him so he may you may have known that was coming out it definitely does it look good when John Doe he didn't say that he said he found out when you read the New Yorker story\nHe said he found out about it I looked at the transcript doesn't specifically say that he stumbles around his words\nI I can he got caught her on if you want to look it up and then he's pretty much of a cover on the on that here's the thing is those text messages are from July ... some reports are well then that would mean he knew about this well before he would have nominated that's a different story\nThat's a much different story that means he would've known about this before his nomination would have even been put forward to Congress\n[noise]\nHere tonight because of a sham\nPolitical con job orchestrated by the Clinton and George Soros tap Kathy Griffin [laughter]\nAnd Mr Ronan Sinatra [laughter] I Love that\nI Love to keep me kittens Lindsey Graham performance see that's funny 'cause she's\nUsually such a debt on mimic I I wasn't no I just love how over the top well I mean that was good but it wasn't that close to the Lindsey Graham ...

I don't watch SNL maybe a couple of times cause I've seen Tina Fey on it how long ago is that um I Know there there are literally for decades\nOr it's been popular to say SNL used to be good and now it sucks yeah I feel like it's always sucked but it goes through periods where some of it's really good point if you're gonna always really good yeah and the rest of the only good I have no idea\nActually as I might have the rest of the rest of it was really good I wasn't that yeah it was it was one of the better what I mean it's always hit and miss it gets comedy on the fly there doing it every week in the house and then you had the ... thing which I'm sure you heard about over here\nAnd then I watched that\nOh I did I watched that valued watched you know I but I was wearing a ...\nRight now ... name was standing on the table at some art school was it an arts oh you're thinking of a different countries and he was a great I think I needed back today or yesterday he was at like a small art school and Detroit\nAnd he was standing on the table ranting about Iran mosque and how everybody needs a lot mind their own business and leave them alone and like all the kids are just waiting like he showed up at our middle of nowhere nothing school and in his ranting like who is this and it's called me I was just going off\nHe's in I think he's mentally unstable\nI always thought it was incredibly rude to Taylor Swift I Know they've got a lot of publicity back to the day but I thought that was shockingly rude\nI think that's just when we started maybe one his mental breakdown started because I never used to think I just thought he was talking before that and then after the sweat thing I think he went steady decline but you have to see this video he's just somebody named rapper steady decline\nYeah maybe that'll be his new members like calling us and then like Kanye and then yeah\nAll the things people say about Kanye and there's a lot what you're saying about the knee high reactor John ... looney and just yeah it was or if that's accurate as well but you know ... the ... a great musician\nPuts out some really good too has put out some ... and he he he really did a lot back in the thousands is I like the ... the only thing I'm familiar with is the one album or Chris Rock is on it for a while\nA that's a great out you know a lot of his workers good late but I was only exposed to that through a much younger friend of mine they got he makes seven thousand dollar tennis shoes now and yeah\nAnd what was the SNL thing you're talking about yeah I don't think so at a at the end of the heated street performances in at the end of the show you don't watch but you know at the end of the show they usually say thank you good night and they sit there and wave at the camera and greet the crowd right with the credits roll was said\nThey had another ... performance was wearing a ... hat\nAnd he went off on a rant about how him in Donald Trump or like\nOf kindred spirits actual Kanye not somebody for another round real Connie and like a whole and you could see the cast in the background like well he's renting going like oh my God\nI Can't believe that recently in an interview I remember reading about that within the past few weeks in the past month\nWhere he was praising Donald Trump and yeah he's been saying things about Trump for a while and people are like you have you've forgotten about\nNo he didn't forget about it and this is the guy that said slavery was a choice you know ... looney nurse assistant and self absorbed into he's the greatest thing since sliced bread so do you wonder why he really is attracting\nRelated to Donald Trump [laughter] I'm going to say something responsible now I saw on some tabloid in a grocery store today Kim has divorce in ... but that was a tabloid father and I think they need him asking\nWhat I'm asking you know if there's any truth to I Know nothing about it I haven't heard of timing of the U.S that's what I thought yeah they were ... I'll say this because I hate talking about\n... both of us as the guy is like the the greatest hater respond or in the world like everybody hated on this guy by saying like he's he's a terrible producers who became the number one producer and hip hop and they said he can't wrap she became the best selling rapper the last Twenty years then they said that he's a loser so he marries like one of the most beautiful women in the world\nAnd I don't understand that I Know I I don't I don't get it the guy's nuts is funny he can anyone\nBut I feel I'm I'm probably the minority in this but when I first became familiar with her I thought what's he doing he could have anyone\nOh ... I think it's his mental instability that makes people scared to be with him and\nLike I said that she had money what what is she doing\nShe made four hundred million dollar that young with iPhone game quiet daddy's talking [laughter] we'll take a break news radio ... in our house bedtime is complicated my wife is always freezing and when she layers up to bed I get way too hot Hi I'm Scott\nBecause I you know I haven't bought this current memory stuff I Am currently against that ... I just I don't believe that no one's ever going to change my mind but let me let me tell the millennials subs things from activity\nThat went on we were young John ... I went to a a high school here in Pittsburgh Peabody series ... you've got a million ... yes\n[noise] do you know in Nineteen Seventy one I got there they had a ... area outside where kids smoked it was\nThat that doesn't it shocked me up the the high school I went to had a designated area for kids to smoke and that was in two thousand four\nYeah when I was in high school I graduate in two thousand eight and a smoking room went away only probably five years before I got to high school yeah it's funny Anthony I agree with you I thought that was something that happened in the seventies that went away maybe that's just where I was no it was like a little circular courtyard in the middle of the cafeteria where we ... we actually at a hospital\nFor all of our if all of our teachers from the ... the first couple of classes signed that would that we were attentive and we're on time we could go out and have a cigarette because you're going anyway Anthony go ahead\nWithout now of course you weren't a team\nNo I was under Eighteen absolutely no I'm saying we weren't Eighteen but that it was ... by the school that you go\nSmoke ... let me give you know let me give you another activity what on the other day that will be shot and and people may be a rest were all kind of it or not but I mean they're going out to people for ... electric like retarded cigarettes I mean this is crazy\nLet me give you another activity to would probably have people arrested today are the boys we had Jim ... gym class and then when base you to go swimming we swam in the news and so the the gym teacher with us\nYeah that's where it and the news\nAnd that's I Can't I cannot share that baby boomer experience with us any of that never happened\nYeah that's just that other guy was Catholic school in the meantime you went to ...\nBody high school but there was forming out of the old every eyes for and Pittsburgh who had led a swimming pool the students ... in the news but the boys at Peabody high in the seventies though with all the early seventies we swam in the news\nDo you think that we did a good idea in the seventies\nWell I we didn't question it because they've been doing we're doing it before we even got there so it's a four time tradition now you could look it up on the Internet it's right there because when I told this story to some other people they didn't believe me\nWell known as the green with you I'm a bump suggesting that like even when I'm Alone in this time is now\nNow that activity today especially with the gym teacher joining us joining us all the new well the problem\nI think it was a problem back then the end\nOf the Anthony I point that you're trying to make I think the point they are trying to make what standards being different from when you were younger compared to like when we were growing up\nBut but I think a good points we made is that these things happened when we were in high school to like ... there were ... things that that happened when Brett Kavanaugh was growing up they happen when we were in high school too but it doesn't mean that they're okay they weren't okay now they weren't okay then\nYes they were fine then that's my point yes because they happen doesn't bind ever find one what the jail\nWith when I was a ... and I'll give you another activity I was ... I had a a neighbor who was the girl she was Eighteen well she's lived across from me and she decided that she liked me\nShe had sex with me at Thirteen I didn't go into the police I didn't tell the whole world I enjoyed it\nA Anthony thanks so much for your call that was really why is that you didn't tell anybody but again also something that definitely happened\nWith Thirteen year olds and ... and I was in high school too and yeah people don't go to police but again that doesn't mean that it was right it's just that we have this stigma and society and I I get that\nSociety has changed over the years but the stigma and still there that\nYou know you're you're not to report these things people aren't coming forward for every accusation these days just because we hear something doesn't mean it's happening all the time I think the whole point of the me too movement is they get people to realize like hey if you're Eighteen your neighbors trying to have sex with you and your Thirteen you probably should go to the place that's something that we're trying to change as a society but we're not there yet\nAnd to make a quick point when he was actually trying to say though I think before he got off on that was that were applying today's standards to to the past and Bill Maher did an excellent bit about that where a Molly Ringwald wrote about how the breakfast club was problematic in today's world and he and Bill Maher responded well why don't we go dig up John Hughes and ask him why he did this and why you did that\nUm you ... there's a lot of things there's things that mean Bethany are doing right now today the Twenty years from now we're both going to look at each other go can you believe me we had that position to me if they were just stop\nEach other in that position well absolutely I think you covered because nobody can see you you can I'm a little bit [laughter]\nYeah I think in a bag or how dark at all we're having a better than me too movement here no

another good one man I'm think you'd be ... with the signal processing speeds that we see now and the um and and the ubiquity\nOf connections around the globe I feel like the nation states are doing

to exploit all of the weaknesses and the Web and that\nThat that's as big a factor as any nation\n[noise] All right uh non government organizations for those who are not into the alphabet soup or a

world that we have to sort of a coordinate with trying to get that side of the committee to grand what to do about cybersecurity as it is an incredibly tall tale especially when a lot of them are criminal enterprises themselves so these NGOs that we call them\nGet a lot of them are just a they have a mask on evidence here and really they are there at the government that they get ... by the

need to train our children a lot more and ethical\nHacking so they can do great defense is that we have to have ethics and this is the\nProblem we we almost to the point where we would have to have a world cyber courts and you start getting into politics and and and bad actors that are acting like good actors and he's right on the money I mean I agree with him completely I'm just trying to add that they they might look like outsiders\nWhen really their insiders so we talked about Russia all day long I asked her\nWell let me ask you a bit about that than since you since you brought it up or is there any such international body there is of course a world courts and uh there are various or a body of the United nations most notably the Security Council of uh like I'm not\nOf uh like I'm not sure that I wouldn't necessarily in many cases be particularly prone to to depend on such international bodies which I find in many cases it but didn't end up at best and the and the hospital to U.S interests that red worst\nBut I I Am curious if such a pug bodies even exist usually law and regulation a trail far behind technology especially in this day and age\nNow you're exactly right and it always sounds wonderful and it's really dangerous because there's a really really really powerful weapon and I'm as pious planet suit that side of how we all get along come by uh I I don't want this weapon given to anyone that's not mature enough and the world is certainly not mature enough for this weapon and\nThey will take it over they will regulate speech they will suppress their people they will\nThey will use it for propaganda and group think I mean it's just way too dangerous which is why\nYou know I always thought the United states should a control most of this still\nAnd and we're seeing this because again it's a fundamental lack of accountability we're unwittingly put all our Schiff says one big cloud and so if you can punch sure that you can get a huge windfall you can find the fact that we have that\nAll sort of in one space it's almost like we should go back one eighty and do everything by paper because it was harder to scoop up altogether and then you take the fact that people aren't really held that ... the bad actors are in locations they are making a fortune outfits that\nAlone is acceptable normal something that's so it goes against the grain of sand people in this country you just can't be foolish and that would be really foolish and the United nations I'll forget it or maybe they have but it's just so far away it so yeah I I think the real solution is going to be technological\nYeah I Would have to think so as regards what you just said by the way this notion of vote will papers so twentieth century well you know what is there are certain certain things about twentieth century that that were better\nUh the mere fact that we have a technical capability does not mean that we should automatically embrace it and in point of for example ah it's been noted that there is no central computer in this country for election results\nAre in which someone could hacking and also the outcome well thank goodness for that I personally am not encouraged by this move away from paper ballots there is a perfect trail right there of how people voted\nIf somebody had something or something gets deleted you can have the validity of an election destroyed in an instant and the I personally am of the opinion that the paper ballots are the way to go and if anybody thinks that that makes me a retro or ... well boo hoo\nWell we we do have short attention span of we sure don't like the way for people that counts I don't want it to the baby out the bath water ON Technology there shouldn't be\nBut but ... there is got to be something there's gotta be safety measures put in place so that everything's not accessible there are fire welfare that bring things up their different technologies there's you know there is only a million different safety net so we can years\nAt George is going to this right now I have a perfectly fine\nSystem but but everyone tries to politicize this and again\nSorry we're we're we're going to break the doesn't move here we will pause and take a break and finish that thought in just a moment\nFor that information leader is his\nI to this day I I Would still like to know who it was we thought that was such a great idea like oh the Russians suddenly become paragon of ah a democracy and and openness and and the combination is such a nonsense point of view I mean even Neville Chamberlain would've ball did that [noise]\nYeah there's no shortage of these uh world leaders that have no experience in the real world or having these find the sky\nYou know opinions and then they just sort of disappearing the woodwork and were left cleaning up the mess and I don't care what you think about Russia or not\nAny every economy every time I mean the state or the United states has learned the hard way to putting all your eggs in one basket is never a smart idea and and especially after the big recessions and you know in Michigan that diverse itself ...
