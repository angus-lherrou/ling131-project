that are by possibly come before new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh including mainly gun issues in this particular instance the Mets and area of course where there have been many many resolving battle that has occurred at the Supreme Court Charles calls in from Springfield, Missouri this evening hello Charles\nHow are you doing Mr Bannon I'd fine thank you [noise]\nI was listening and I you know you hit on a topic that's always been a kind of a hot button for me and that is how the liberals always do get these ideologues that you know complete\n... you know completely side with them but the um\nYou know people get bored you know anytime than a conservative tries to get someone that really is on their side and not some halfway you know a ...\nA you know the Democrats are an absolute fit the we the the conservatives do nothing they they have constantly there the the party of appeasement and they need some on this got some site and then in just says no or we're going to fight for this\nAnd we just haven't seen it I mean I look at the Democrats and how they treat cabinet and that'd be despicable and neither party however why don't we ever fight [laughter] you know where you can fight they put up\nYeah ... that's a good point I Would I guess to to address and I certainly agree with the Charles uh absolutely uh Dave in regard to the notion of or the next time there's a a a Democratic president if we put up by a liberal justice so we start coming up with the stories about how they uh\nThey uh they litter or have overdue parking tickets or what have you I think that that is is ... disgusting practice\nBut uh I was wondering I have Republicans fought hard enough regarding some of the more liberal a recent pigs say for example a Brock Obama's pick some of which I I think failed a ride through I mean it seems to be Republicans tend to follow the the the victim\nIt's the president's choice in the nominee is qualified I can go with it whereas Democrats followed the victim uh I disagree with that person therefore anything and everything is fair game\nWell I I think if you look at it from the perspective of Republicans credit follow the constitution a little bit more than the Democrats do at least in this issue\nAnd and the the or a collegial bunch of people which I'm not too sure that pays off anymore collegiate being collegial doesn't work too well when you were in a bar fight\nAnd that's what we just witness frankly you know I I remember back when I was in high school and we talked about all this stuff in American government and\nAnd then I had some good teachers back then people who weren't really afraid to ah to speak out call a spade a spade and say look you know people do this but it's wrong it's not the government is supposed to work nowadays\nA ... it's almost like a a a\nPitch battle you know a food fight and what they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh the Democrats are with this eleventh hour Hail Mary thing bringing up a um uh the forward accusations and and and frankly I have a lot of sympathy\nFor I think she got thrown under the bus a fifth of the dogs the ... just in order to uh to try to derail Kavanaugh's nomination\nUh they were both used and it would probably be who've the the Republicans now especially if they retain control on Capitol Hill after November\nTo launch some investigations into just how did that become public or what we witnessed with a judge can now justice cab at all\nOr was it just deplorable if not despicable and ah you know I I wrote about this I've covered this thing for liberty park press and the gun Meg and I'm going to continue to cover it\nUh because I think what happened there was wrong and and certainly the polls seem to be indicating that to the public is just riled up this really has fired up the Republican base I think it's bringing people out to vote who probably wouldn't have voted at the midterms but\nIn a gym and they're angry and and they have some people that they were angry at they can identify the people that they're really mad at [laughter] then I kinda think the Democrats from the they might have blown this\nOne well we'll see certainly both basis seemed to be quite fired up we'll see who does the turnout trick the best to Sharon in ... Missouri yellow\n... um you know I Hope that justice Kavanaugh\nJust vote the constitution that but I Want to get that today I Want to make a I don't want them to be the best on the court I why then followed that kind of fish\nAnd sometimes I'm not going to be happy with that all may go against something that I think that parents dictation then I Will I Will abide by ... and support it I Need to hire\nThis\nCork a ... law and then they are not supposed to do that that is kind of a job that I Want everybody to do their job Congress to do their job presidents yeah there are guys and they did they show branch to do their\nCan for those in the judicial branch who do not do their job or I Would keep in mind one thing uh sharing and I'll just notice do today was well you look at the constitution that aforementioned constitution\nOr the house is spelled out in the constitution the Senate\nThe president's either the chief executive officers the cabinet heads and the like and then you come of course to the article three the or the judicial branch of that is is particularly interesting because it says the judicial power of the United states shall be vested in one Supreme Court\nAnd in such inferior records as we Congress may from time to time ordain and establish that is to say all of the appellate courts the disc records are creations of Congress Congress can simply repeal any of those courts anytime it so chooses Dave\n[noise] yeah and I think we also knew if you if you study the walls really will judges are on the lower federal courts\nIn and there's even been some mentioned I think ... New York they added that is the liberal democratic congressman going on\nYeah and it it he's apparently already talking about a train to I'm a recall or get rid of justice Kavanaugh you can only do that by impeaching him convict\nI Know and and didn't just you know impeachment is just ... that came right out of left field but I think that shows just how extremist some of these people really are on the D side of the aisle and the country is looking at this and they don't like it\n[noise] no I'm I'm sure they do that after this appeals to the base which increasingly has a as Democrats the rather nervous\nOr after what happened to Joe Crowley the New York other New York congressman but again keep in mind as in the case of the presidency\nIf the Democrats get so much as a bare majority in the house yes I'm sure the articles of impeachment against Donald Trump and possibly Kevin ... they'll never get sixty seven votes in the Senate to convict so it's not something that I've gone to lose any sleep over it will be back in just a moment\n[noise] most awesome source for news and information greedy [noise]\nWell yeah I'm Still a ... you know here here we are a back I guess a square one way how how did she get on the court will\nThe Republicans say they were collegial and didn't challenge some of these things are obviously they at least somebody had to know about this\nDid they ask the tough questions but I I frankly I think\nWe just witness with the cabin on the confirmation process the rules just got changed even even Senator Lindsey Graham who is\nTypically a laid back guy he ... his things were out the other day he was furious\nAt his Democratic colleagues are on the the Senate Judiciary committee and I don't think that's going to go away I I think they changed the rules and you know what they're going to have to live with that for a very long time and in ... when Republicans\nComeback or is there is a Democrat is president uh uh some time the next four to eight years on and we'll see how that works out [noise] uh if if if someone is nominated\nTo a a vacancy on the high court ah I think the gloves could easily come back off again and in ... what is what good does it do for the country I don't know I don't want some of these people are thinking\nSome of these people are thinking\nWell I I can tell you what some of them are thinking and then we'll take a quick break here but a lot of Democrats are really running very scared right now to do what will happen to them is the same as what happened to Joe Crowley the prominent or\nA Democratic House member many thought my maybe a successor to Nancy Pelosi has Democratic House leader beaten by this Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nWho doesn't know as much as they used to take to pass in eighth grade civics

there\nWhere everybody runs in one primary and the top two finishers\nAutomatically go on the ballot in November which means that the Republicans this year have nobody on the ballot for Senate you've
