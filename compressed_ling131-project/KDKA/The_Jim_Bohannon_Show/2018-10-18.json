evening and welcome to the gym I had a show from Westwood One radio were one of these six six five votes jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six on line five at a gym do have a show dot\nCom you can follow me on Twitter at Jim Botox and there's parts of the program we're going to be talking to a certain extent about the extent to which word everybody's says all the time\nWhy is it necessary for the national dialogue to be conducted at that volume\nIs it necessary it certainly is a\nConstructive it certainly is a logical\nAnd yet there must be some reasons why it is happening well we're joined by a physician and psycho analyst Dr Richard Creighton was trained in both Freud to an end to go and get out of malice we used to look at this through his book out of control [noise] apocalyptic psychology in the age of from and uh\nThat was used to look at this through his book out of control apocalyptic psychology in the age of Trump and uh we uh we thank you for being with is said to my doctor grade\nNo thank you for having me\nDo you have a ... just as an overall explanation before we get into some of the details behind it why we seem to be out of control at this time\nUh I think that's probably many reasons but the point of the book was really to try to frame the whole political issue in terms of the underlying psychology\nAnd I I think the psychological positions are probably best trade with respect to the concept of religious conflict\nBecause I think there were many aspects of what's taking place now that really ... uh what goes on between a sectarian groups are out of religious level\nWho are TV tree can help you in a lightning storm but the guy go insurance agency can help you get covered for personal property damage and go to guy go dog gone to see how affordable renters insurance can be\n[noise]\n\nLooking back to the gym ... one of these six six five oh jumbo what does that work in this seemingly intractable national discussion about policy and politics\nThings do seem to be as this book is titled out of control Dr Richard ... and our guest is positioned and psycho analyst and the subtitle apocalyptic psychology and the age of Trump or to a rod who calls in from a wire Hauser Wisconsin ... good evening rod and welcome\nRon are you There God can you hear me yes you're on the radio go right ahead\nAll my phone is like the old well okay for the\nCall sure how I don't consider myself a really delicate for that but you know what I heard on Wisconsin Public radio I listen to public radio a lot uh-huh it they were talking about George Washington when he became president he did not want a party system and I just think that might help\nWhat a shame they didn't take it out because\nYou know if it kills you got people that I don't care who's name it they're whatever letter or named up what they base it on\nThat and that way I see it we don't need any ... other white\nUp but that cap on hockey or whatever something happened at a port woman and I can't imagine a traumatic experience like that but uh that to me it's not if you're right here in the fact that Obama when he killed somebody for the ... the part they oh we gotta wait till after the election\nBut not out issue it's on the other four well they get ... or ...\nWell you've covered a number of the issues of the day but I'm not sure this directly relates to uh the topic at hand I Would just make one note before it deferring to Dr Creighton\nOr it was very naive of George Washington or anybody else to suggest that there would not be factions\nFactions are almost proof that we have a free government if you have a genuinely free society you will have differences of opinion\nAnd like minded people will get together and organize to try and convince others of their point of view it as an essential part of society now can faction lives will be carried too far well yes it certainly can and perhaps we're seeing a manifestation of that with the notion\nThat you can have a free society without different factions is an impossibility and by the effort to Dr Creighton\nHas to agree with you entirely about that I I think there's a psychological motivation alternately for or\nYou can unify groups to ultimately ... to smaller divisions so I I think there's no way of recording connections or what you do want to avoid as you mentioned is uh the extremes polarity between two\nFactions so that there's no workable solution to the system\nAnd we'll come back and explore some of that here in a moment but the riding a call from Steve in Chatham county North Carolina good evening Steve\n... always enjoy your show the crusades\nIn in the Chatham county North Carolina good evening Steve\n... name has always enjoy your show in a shake your says thank you well when it gets to a point when you go to a restaurant or or you go out\nAnd uh I I don't know if the person or the establishment is the last ... whatever the hell or I don't understand this wants those of\nThe line gets to a point where you can't go out and have reason debate without someone screaming at you spin on the you know and you send things can't\nI really don't care of your disposition just let's say let's have a reason\nTo bake I mean if we can talk without screaming at each other ... which I which I don't do\nAnd yet I'm the I call the courtroom machine the machine has has just you can use to give up the fact that two years ago two years ago ...\nYou know you lost the election okay I\nGuess what if you love this country if you if you're being honest ... and then you're going to try to build it up not tear down\nWell again I Know the extent although certainly I've had my differences over the years with the both Clintons a specially in regard to uh honesty and and corruption I don't know that we can say that they are personally responsible for the uh the outbreak that we've seen a across the country\nUh I Do a Dr Creighton find one thing that I find tragically ironic\nAnd that is that much of of what we're talking about here is conducted by groups that roughly called themselves and ... that is to say anti fascist\nAnd the tragic irony is of course if those tactics\nOf a silencing your opponents by intimidation and violence would have been understood by any of Hitler's brown shirts a reference that I'm sure would go right over the limited intellect of most of these people but that is that\nThat is is the sad a problem and that cannot be tolerated when you try to do that from whatever political perspective that you are so fewer\nAnd you are so virtuous that you don't have to listen to anybody else than the only adds in my book and you can certainly agree or disagree as you choose the only as in my book is do arrest\nProsecute and if convicted incarcerate such people that is out of bounds you cannot let society be reduced to ... to the level of ... who can put together more of violence in the street\nKnow well I I I think you're going to several important point a ... one of the points that I Try to make in the book has to do again with the underlying psychology of what's taking place at least a large portion of society and it's been said for some time now that there's an increasing degree\nOf of the offices within the society and then the judge to increasing decree of moral perfectionism and obsession all thinking is society\nAs a result when when when one encounters those types of psychological structuring individual uh those individuals are very prone to what we call projection and that is that they tend to\nUh take aspects of their their denied a self make up and to place them on people around them [noise] ah so you have a group like a anti FAA are claiming that the anti fascist\nShe plays them on people around them uh so you have a group like a anti FAA\nAre claiming that the anti fascist and you look at their behavior\nIt's very very obvious that the behaviors that you have your one would expect from the fascist group and so you see this constant accusation coming from the left projecting on the ride for everything that they're doing\nA an an denying that are claiming that it's the right to just doing it so that's I think the motivation for some of this behavior or in terms of how to deal with it I agree with you entirely I think one of the greatest problems that we're encountering in society today\nIs the lack of enforcement of the laws that are ...\nThat are currently on the books a for a place like Portland for for the mayor of port to sit by and have people rioting\nOn the streets and refusing to have the police intervened this is a breakdown of the necessary a legal sanctions and boundaries that are a free society must have and if that's gone then it's going to be just a free for all\nYeah ah again it it it is not something that uh\nThat that can can possibly be tolerated and and I see things like that and there have been other examples some time ago when there was a a police shooting that brought a rioting to Baltimore and the mayor of Baltimore told the authorities to let it burn\nA as if to say if people feel aggrieved enough that they get a free pass on behaving like civilized beings and that is\nAs as you say it I I think I'm not putting words in your mouth that is is pointing us in the direction of anarchy and that is not unacceptable outcome nobody is so aggrieved that they have a right to break the law with impunity nobody\nNow who's you know go ahead\nWell again absolutely but it it it's the role of the government uh both at the local level and the federal law ultra for laws of the country and if they fail to do that then you can expect a increasing outbursts or from these groups because they're essentially enabled to behave badly\nExactly are we are you telling them yes you're tactic and intimidation is working and ah people respond positively when are they are told that their tactic is uh is going to be tolerated stay with us more to come\nAs a doctor Richard Creighton takes a look at just what is at work here what is the psychology\nInvolved in the the way we are currently conducting a business in this country at the public policy level and it's a\nIt's disturbing but again it's a knowledge and the knowledge is power maybe we can learn something from all of this one eight six six five oh jumbo we'll be back in just a moment\nYeah uh I I again I I suppose that I'm hardly unique a in a thinking that uh that my viewpoints are correct or they are my viewpoints that either arrived at them by whatever thought processes involved I Would like to think that it as a rational analysis of of evidence and arguments that\nThat reflect the the circumstances in the world but for whatever reason yes I like everybody else would tend to agree with my viewpoint but it's almost a a a ... uh uh it it it naturally follows however\nI have never been so enamored of my viewpoint that I Would suggest that a I must be right and therefore everybody else who disagrees with we must be wrong\nOr nor beat that no matter how ride I may be that it's somehow gives me a pass on the rules of society that that is the level of arrogance that escapes me even on issues where I'm\nVery confident that my viewpoint is correct I just I it's it's the attitude that goes with the viewpoint that escapes me\nWell we we've done a very poor job over the last generation or two at raising our children are children had been raised with this concept of preserving self esteem or the concept of self esteem is based on never criticizing never correcting\nAn individual and this carries on into the educational system\nSo you've ... you've got generations now or at least one maybe what what generation that's really able to look at itself critically a and\nYou've got should relations now at least one maybe what what generation that's really able to look at it so critically a as a result they they have to preserve this concept of perfection and anything less than that it is not even within this fear of consideration\nAs as we go to a break and then we'll come back with some calls but I have to ask you\nIs this a terminal condition that has to say are these people beyond redemption is it impossible to ever inject them if you will with a note of rationality or have they been so ... into this notion that my self esteem is the violence\nThat they will for the balance of their lives which in some cases maybe fifty sixty Seventy years\nCease to be effective members of our society\nA well if if you want to know the students here I Am certainly do yes uh\nI notice a citizen of the political level is a very difficult to treat I think that's what we're talking about the ... the the prognosis for this generation is not good wellness prognosis for society is not good as a\nResult it certainly is well almost answers are exactly what we need right now will come back and talk some more with our guest Dr Richard
