to the border in Arizona Sheriff Joe and the like and we often forget about that and you guys have it as bad if not as worse is Texas and the places we normally think about\nYeah um it's manageable or at least the government was smart enough to uh inundate the border with agents are where we uh have controlled the better but now with these horns coming as it's getting back out of control\nWhat I can still have a good\nYeah well the here's what it is and I've been thinking about this um you know um he could the president you could send the military down there which is a smart rules however listen to these people are coming and it seems that that's inevitable so my thought was\nTo set up a massive refugee camp or we have the greatest military on if we can set it up in no time set up with cans and with mess halls in the shower facilities and everything that they could possibly need therefore a we would not be splitting up families and so on and so forth right\nThere for the Democrats can't go crazy over that kind of thing and then what we do oh by the way we set it up next to a place that has a big airport so you can either do it by the even the air stationery over in Sierra Vista a default would chew cuts and here's the thing is ... and we used to do this a long time ago what what you do is it\nSo these people are overly claim some refugee status or some asylum status and\nStuff and what they do is they they um\nTo set them up in front of an immigration judge who eventually make the determination on them okay so what they do what they should do is set up these um um um there's refugee camp and then have been going there and make sure everything's all co pathetic and everything's good there\nAnd sat him down immigration John ... judges okay and attorneys and everything they can all legal and stuff so that dentist can't complain\nAnd then literally go through each families claim or each person's claim like they're going to do anyway without releasing them into the United states and if they go through this then we could do what's called a jeep pat flight which is a repatriation flight to their country\nAnd hold on I'm In agreement but that he had a problem though my sense is that so far they're not going to settle for that they're saying they're just coming into the country and that's it because there's well by the numbers whoever's organizing this and it's going to be bigger\nI don't know how you're going to hurt them toward these refugee camps to be heard I don't think they're going to settle for that\nI'll be honest with you know what

Houston area they're traveling back that listed on the radio the buying and Joe eight six six fifty jumbo that was that the Trump rally cruise rally the tailgate\nThat the guesstimate is it could be eighty two hundred thousand people at some point today were on those grounds are around them this truly was epic just amazing even for taxes eight six six fifty jumbo\nAnd if you've been to a Trump rally what is the magic of it when you're inside the entertainment of that\nAnd if you've been to a Trump rally\nWhat is the magic of it when you're inside the entertainment of that the I mean these people in Montana last week we're\nWaiting hours out there in freezing temperatures not just you know I I don't know who I Would wait for for that number of hours or ever have waited for four or five hours or more eight six six fifty jumbo get you on board now\nI didn't have a chance I wasn't on the gym I did it on my own show in Philadelphia though the opposition to this is just enraged tonight on several levels Kevin McCarthy he's the house majority leader you see this guy prematurely grey nice looking guy California\nWell his office was vandalized a Boulder is the report ... a large Boulder these guys picked up a Boulder not just a breaking through it through the window and took off they have it up all of his Instagram account\nThrowing a Boulder holding a Boulder up between the two of them and throwing it through a window of Boulder attack\nAnd here's the thing who are the most divisive celebrities in America a focus group last week did this morning console it's called and they took celebrities entertainers people like me talk show host in alike\nAnd the criteria was that there was the most polarity between Democrats\nAnd Republicans with these two in other words Democrats favor Republicans were opposed or the opposite that it so Hannity was in second place Russia was in third\nWhat do you think was number one and I'm going to tell you who number four was and I think she's been out it Ellen DeGeneres was number for it and I'm a shock\nYou think of Alan nice enough woman that seems to me the dancing and all that well here's an example though you know she brings on Democrat politicians right before the midterms right before the presidential race just gives them an incredible for um everybody's so nice there is no challenge and it's like an infomercial for them that's what it's about\nWell the executive producer do you know the executive producer is that's the top producer out a multitude of producers of the Ellen DeGeneres show tonight showed his hand and I think this is what the degenerate show was about\nHe attacked millennia Trump I mean look you can attack president ... how do you attack in Milan and your Trump the executive producer Andy last nerve took to Twitter to insult Mrs Trump and to praise the caravan he said\nI'm way more afraid of another millennia getting\nInto this country than I Am of any of the caravan of human beings seeking asylum is what he wrote\nAnd I maintain this is exactly the mentality of the people around these shows even as something that seems to be as offensive\nAs the Alan ... number for the most divisive about Republicans and Democrats it who's the number one most divisive figure out there and it needs to Russia's three you get that polarity you know they're provocative chores\nBut this guy the executive producer of the Ellen DeGeneres show tipping their hand here millennia is a bigger threat than this human caravan coming our way can you imagine\nEight six six fifty Jim bow eight six

are\n... their own worst enemies\nHi doing good myself\nI'm just I just have one question for your are\nCommunist socialist their own worst enemies more often than not [noise]\nAh in some ways but here's the problem down right now we have whole generations of people that have been under educated or indoctrinated in colleges and the like and to them socialism is not human misery socialism seems like a new idea and kind of cool to them as strange as it is\nYeah [noise] but I think something like that myself\nNo but that's a big difference of course we couldn't we've seen this we've lived through various things uh these millennials and the like to them done that they just see that they're going to get something out of what is a tough time for them thank you and it is for some millennials student loan debt Everytime I see this Cory Booker is out there tonight you know the Spartacus guy the guy in South Jersey\nCory Booker is calling for fifty thousand dollars be given\nTo children in various families of under income that's his big ploy running for president\nJust give them fifty thousand dollars that's a way to ah make things more equitable fifty grand by that a hundred grand I don't know their fifties enough\nAnd I I've seen Democrat after Democrat\nGone after student loan debt well here's the thing who's charging all this the people that run colleges are progressive Democrats making a lot of money why are they charging well every time they raise the rates people start to scream how much it costs to go to college so what do they do\nThey have to get more student loans and more money from the government et cetera then what do they do they raise the cost who's responsible\nFor how costly it is to go to college it's the people running colleges making that decision these figures are not figures that are reasonable or keeping up with inflation or anything else they're made up figure they're charging but everything get away with and it's outrageous\nAnd I think you're starting to see a little bit of a pullback here\nBut it's progressive set a running All right so who is the most polarizing figure celebrity figure out their yellow and show and if you've ever been to a Trump rally and I'm really hoping to get somebody I think we might have a couple of coming up\nHere on the ... and John and want to give them full time if you went to this rally tonight or all day long\nThis was epic\nThis may further enthused people to know you're not alone out there as we head toward the midterms if you support that Trump's agenda or conservative causes there is not just going to be a blue wave here it's not going to happen in the Senate Republicans are going to pick up three or four Senate seats\nOn top of what they already have a house that's where the battle is that's going to be tough it's going to be very very close not a blue wave but\nAs a caravan bears down on us as we see people throwing boulders ... windows\nHarassing Mitch McConnell as he ate at what looked to be like an Applebee's and all that people are getting\nMore enthused and get out there and vote will take your calls here at the rally they said hey we want to hear from you my name is down to your ... sitting in for jumbo hanging on Westwood One [noise]\nAnd a man I got the man it's time to get it up and be active about something not non activist right the\nThey didn't do more Americans to do that they have the better off we are thank you thanks for the call and that's where President Trump ignite it is and here's my overall take on what we're going to see play out in the midterms when we see these caravans coming our way\nThe average American apolitical they may have been like Dave they're activated by this and they say what Trump here's a guy finally taking his hand on\nYou know they vaguely might be a Democrat or Republican but they're sick of the politics they see this is a different time in a different person what do they see on the other side they see people doing stuff every day that our mob like these are mobs\nI've had it here in Philadelphia I've experienced some of it we have a lot of anti ... here but it's not just ...\nIts people going crazy all over the place believing that's the first amendment right to harass people scream at them as a professor this week\nAnd the University of Mississippi did nothing about it he tweeted out don't just harassed these conservatives Republicans when you see them out there if they're in a restaurant stick your fingers all the way\nIt out don't just harassed these conservatives Republicans when you see them out there if they're in a restaurant\nStick your fingers all the way through their salad and or mess it up if they've ordered appetizers take them and distribute them to everyone's outlets and kept them bring boxes with you to steal their food and take it home type of stuff that's being condone that freedom of speech that's not that's democracy\nNo it's not it is a mop so you're seeing that mob domestically than you are saying this other mob headed toward the border invasion the caravan and which side do you think Americans are going to side with even like Dave or quite quite said if he doesn't like Donald Trump the way he presents at times and all that\nThat's protecting America even if law versus the other side just on the attack significant numbers are going to go with the Trump agenda side that's the way it's going to work\nAnd this caravan is exactly that coming up soon to take a moment to put something on your radar screen\nAnd I bet a lot of people listening have not heard this but when you do maybe you'll tell people about it and you'll start and I know the media's got a lot to cover now but\nThen they tell you the story of Katy Brand name Katie Brennan from New Jersey and they Murphy he's the governor there administration you know coming off cabin up we're supposed to believe women were supposed to take actions to validate that if they make a claim this woman made a big claim about rape sexual assault\nAgainst an official in the Murphy campaign and then it official in the government wait until you hear what happened with it or didn't happen the wall Street Journal just did a big piece center but that's the only national media the rest of the national media said we're not going to cover her could it be because Murphy is a far progressive\nAnd that's why they won't cover so we're not seeing national media it's worthy of it I Want to shoot it by hand and listeners to know about it promised people in Philadelphia I Would tell you so I'll give you the breakdown of that next and your calls at eight six six fifty jumbo you getting down to your data I'm\nJay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans

president ultimately even though he's barely been in office as governor probably in twenty twenty or the next cycle\nAnd she claims that during the campaign this guy named Alvarez about a hundred and forty thousand dollar jobs the housing czar in the Murphy administration after he won drove her home\nOr you know they were at a rally or something for Murphy asked use the bathroom comes in and then attacked her\nShe gets a rape kit done tells her best friend who joined her she's shaking tells her husband about it reports it to the authorities reports it to the Murphy people\nAnd then when nothing is done and Murphy's elected and this guy comes up for a job interview reports it all over again reports it even according to the wall Street Journal reports to Mrs Murphy Eddie Murphy's tower they'll get back to meet with her at least the governor did and then they never do\nHere's my point the national media is not telling you about this\nComing off cabin on all that we saw wouldn't this

complaints they still gave it to them without any investigation she alleges and that's where the wall Street Journal seems to say the point being that double standard rears its head her name is Katie

out the F bomb towards this stuff from fitzpatrick while in the holiest places I understand it inside the temple\nAnd then he sort of apologizes but not really and he says he's passionate and Democrats want people that are passionate\nAbout this what have you heard during this particularly in a circumstance like this other guy throwing out the F bomb\nNow if I had the sound the sound goes on to wow this is what ... was one of the place but a TV station may have gotten it but\nJust think about this and this is classic of what the Democrats are prosecuting which is a health care thing when or even the Washington Post as a Republican did not do that would not do that its ally wow I Can't take it\nRight there and they you know in the ... the secret spot this guy just blurted out I Can't imagine is you just never have run into something like this in a circumstance like this I let me go to the cars let's go to Katie in Redding Pennsylvania hey Katie welcome in\nJust sitting here listening as he ... he had that kind of late that guy in my opinion even lower than trailer trash you know\nWell it's it's ... and if I get to say on next time I Want to play it you got to stand a Katie this guy is worth of the family was worth three hundred million a silver spoon he just came in is trying to buy his way he lives in a luxury golf course really in South Africa this candidate who came to Bucks County and people here are in shock\nIt's one thing to drop the F bomb during a debate that's hard to believe\nBut it's another to do it on the home court where you want it to be in the sacred ground of the temple\nExactly I mean in my opinion is just a few things in the world that you just don't mess with\nGod yeah one of them yes yeah [laughter] yeah [laughter] exactly right\nIt's hard to believe thank you Katie thanks very much that's why I'm bringing it up as an example of when they get frustrated on the Democratic side where this is going it's a David in Greenwich New Jersey hello David\nI'm actually in my car on your work on a ... a real estate\nDavid in Greenwich New Jersey hello David\nI'm thanks for taking my call and you're willing to point a to a real estate friend of mine who does business who was there\nAnd not only I mean we're like getting to that too like the altar and the Catholic Church but yet I only did he drop it there but he's telling me you should've heard him outside when he was leaving their start off of shame thing\nThis ... coming up from Mexico I'm doing the math\nAnd if you have seven thousand people times twelve dollars a day to feed them let's say Mexico stand you're talking about eighty five thousand dollars a day I'm concerned it I'm bothered that depress you you see these folks walking ... who's got a backpack who's got nothing who's got nothing there's there's nothing\nThat right well what we've seen radio to ratchet point we've seen video of people are in doubt money given that supplies and listen to this I didn't play because it's in Spanish a Univision reporter the translation embed it to your point with the caravan\nSays he meant migrants from known terrorists hot spots like Bangladesh how do people from Bangladesh ended up in this sort of a right\n[noise] um because you can walk into any part probably of South America anymore but it'd be great if the press would cover these speeding and each feeding and fueling stations in the medical stations\nAnd then on the third point a non where I live down here is I can see across the Delaware Bay and maybe even twenty two miles but I can see the lights at Dover Air force base and it's it's constant the day and night at least the bombers and these these these monster transport troop trans brothers and equipment transport they fly or you don't hear\nA anytime something's getting ready to happen or go down as we would say it's they stop\nAnd we've had nothing now for two days okay nothing which pretty much tells you something is going to be going on and on the border pretty much\nSo well right and they're either areas it's going to take an unbelievable number of troops to do this peacefully though but thank you thanks for all the great point you made here's how you get in eight six six fifty Jim bow eight six six fifty Jim I Want to play you a quickly one more guy this is Steve Schmidt\nHe is the former McCain advisor used to be a moderate maybe now is full bore he's on MSNBC he's sticking by all this here's what he says when he hears we might use the military we might be doing this at the border here is ah Steve Schmidt\nAnd the idea that when a mother through suffering through a ... term risk and sometimes death all around them when they reach so border and they see a uniform with an American flag\nAnd they are no longer safe\nFor that baby is ripped away and put into an internment camp because there's just a moral outrage that harkens to the worst excesses in the history of the countries that separation of families\nAt the slave auction blocks yes to the separation of Native American families have a moral or I read the Japanese and do it again this is the failure of the Democratic party to address this is a small issue not as a profound staying on our national water\nAs a profoundly on American policy to frame the question for the country and the style age from Trump ism what is it that we are who are we as a people\nThat is a great question thank you for framing it now answer that we are people that are tired and you can tell me who we are do you look in the mirror and sanction is I Do\nWe're people that are tired of the American worker the American citizen in the American population being overrun in this manner by a bunch of people that have gained one way or another by it\nThe American citizen the American population being overrun in this manner by\nA bunch of people that have gained one way or another by it while inflicting\nDamage on countless communities countless people you know I Wonder what Steve Schmidt would say to the families like the young woman cakes timely killed in San Francisco by a maniac who have been deported six or seven times I Wonder what he would say to that just squander all damage just one person\nThis is a stain on our national honor is it or is it finally seeing someone that's going to step up on this problem that goes on day to day maybe not on moss like we're seeing\nNow but it's a similar problem that we all know was out there that's why he was elected that's what people want him to do that's what I Believe my name is Don ... sitting in for ... year on Westwood One [noise]\n[noise] where my voice some pretty funny treaty\nIf we could get them to go ahead or it's uh\nCame out of it [laughter]\nAnd we take it rocks for eight or ... and I felt like California and then let every immigrant that walks the illegally come into the country go in the California why\nWell that's right and let me be even more facetious we could take the Beverly Hills of the world and we make sure your solution to those places Hollywood or various parts of Manhattan we'd make sure you go right to these neighborhoods where you're going to be met with welcoming arms and you're going to be put up and you're going to be taken care of right\nKelly what would happen to California and are short a matter of fact I\nWell you would think some sanity might be restored but you know I'm not sure it by the way I see since you mentioned and I happen to see a show last night I like this headliner show or MSNBC doesn't on the weekend famous people their life how old do you think Jerry Brown the governor current governor will be when he leaves office\nOh let's see like the ... they are the [laughter] yeah yeah uh ... eighty two seven oh I was going to Seventy five\nYeah well you have any five sitting around but he he too that's how many times he's been back and forth thank you thanks very much and they elected him I don't know how many times he's been elected office ah Jerry Brown it was amazing and he wants to run for president now\nOh is that into the ring All right let me go to Wanda in Hopkins ... New York Hi Wanda\n...\nDid he tell you I'm Sorry yes Hi\nWell I've I've got to make a state now that ... that tax payers are upset about\nThem cutting a noted crossing the border why aren't the tax payers upset about the money that we're spending on a daily basis with those prisoners look at how much money we're spending everyday paper notes plus there's ... Abu singled out by taxpayers money\nBut people are upset about that I knew right I Know I hear you it's a there's a lot of things taxpayers are upset about but that's certainly you find one to your right\nSad I mean when you you just figure that out every day on that and especially the ones that they get eight nine ten Twenty years and May Day taxpayers' money is going to the president says that the prison system has turned into nothing but a bit less\nWell in some cases thank you wander you're right in some cases though it is protecting us from criminals and that I think people listening right now in a case by case basis would say that's money well spent so it depends\nAlready are in updates and Amy Schumer update for you and here in Philadelphia something remarkable happened yesterday I'll tell you about around the national anthem and the football game\nWhere did you hear this story about the New York versus a former New York I was having a brawl before the game they're on the field oh explain but your calls keep them coming eight six six fifty jumbo that get you to may ...\nFrom a ... with the er the\nWe've covered it talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two really\nAre some of them\nUnder it and I ...\nIf you suffer from the deep end you've seen your doctor about the little blue pill you know can be expensive and seeing the doctor and waiting at the pharmacy can be a hassle\nKind of animal in every state if you suffer from E.
