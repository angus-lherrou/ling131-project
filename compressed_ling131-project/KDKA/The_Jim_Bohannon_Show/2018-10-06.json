are the latest\nFrom the allegations that came out from the Pennsylvania grand jury that said I thought it was the Supreme Court that said three hundred and one members of the clergy abused more than a thousand children over several decades\n\nThis isn't going to go away they're Thirteen states that are doing investigations\nInvestigations the Cleveland diocese has issued a statement they are going to release the list of names\nCatholic diocese of Columbus in Steubenville said last week they would release a list of names Youngstown diocese committed weeks ago that's a good first step\nIs

crow\n\nLizard skins it's um they make ... for bikes to drift completely or what the third I'm Catholic ...\nCatholic Church this isn't the Catholic Church to this this is the Catholic League which if you'll remember the Catholic League um by and large is one guy but he represents a cap legs as the leader of the Catholic Lee\n... his name is bill Donahue bill Donahue\nWho you would think it's like a typical South Park view or Catholic League president and he wouldn't but apparently yeah the new episode of South Park is a brown the current Roman Catholic church breeze young boy story want\nThe head of the Catholic League\nAfter watching the episode I guess\nThat went out of his way again to say hey that's not no\nTo correct\nA cartoon quote the October third episode of South Park portrayed molesting priest as pedophiles this is actually an addict inaccurate almost all molesters had been homosexuals there for the cartoon victim character should have been depicted as adolescence not kids do what are you talking about\n\nI wouldn't for a thousand thousand dollars claimed to understand what the cat or a if you're a Catholic what you're going through right now with this wouldn't even try

urine Katie KIA high\nYeah oh hey yeah yeah it's I call it a little bit it got it was so high that it was like a minority of free there really isn't true at all it's rampant\nIn my own around now and the argument the argument that he was putting forth bill was it's a small percentage and ... and I'm not even going to argue with that my question is what percentage is okay\nAnd if it's if it's one priest but he gets sent that twenty different places well it might as well be twenty praise\nRight well the way I like it is if it's overwhelmingly all across the country it's not a small minority\nChurch do to make you believe that they want to fix it\nOr ... what I like the lake water church teaches it got to go through the classic ... or super important they teach in the United states have their you know on the air that greatly could trivia they the sexual\nImmorality the Bible doesn't take that the Bible say better to marry the bar with Ashton so they would let the priest marry it might make it ... it was it was like a big difference\nWell let me ask you a ... it's my understanding and again I wasn't raised in any way shape or form Catholic I don't know nothing about it but I've been told that there are certain orthodox sects where the priest are allowed to marry as a true\nThat I don't know but oh Eli lily in the United states for example a phrase is not allowed to uh get married right and and I would say and that can manifest itself and all kinds of of ours and that's not fair to go you\nKnow that's you know that's that's the evil of him and reality\nHere up in their star disciple ... the ... the church is built on here that's what they teach guess what Peter was Mayor Bill to their doctors don't make any sense at all and that's a classic example\nBill I appreciate your calling these conversations that [noise] I don't ever remember them being even brought up before but I keep asking that question to people than than call about\nWith what's going on with the Catholic Church it's going to continue to go on with the Catholic Church\nMore and more information is going to come out and\nAgain it ain't my place but I'm going to say it anyway if I Am a disciple of the Catholic Church and I believe and I want to believe in I think everything's gonna be okay if we start taking action now the first thing I Do is\nTalk to the guy that convinced that the biggest issue is cartoons and homosexuality\nNo way that's the second thing the first thing is whatever list of names exist everybody needs to see everything right now because of everybody don't see everything the assumption is going to be there are other bad things going on\nAnd it's extraordinarily difficult to argue against that assumption when you look at the report and you see how many dioceses how many breeze and how many years information was kept away from everybody including law enforcement\nWhen I was a little\nKid and then there would be a point where you try and deny whatever stupid crap you did but then everybody in the room with no and you know you did it and you just gonna\nBest up where well past time for church officials to fess up and open up the books and whatever there is there is and it's not going to go away\nMegan rights as Larry find the one with the brown curly hair yeah Larry pick two and\nCurly was bald mo was in charge Larry was the ... gun\nAnd he

having me yes ma'am and I'd like to talk about the church situation I'm In ... like yes ma'am and I believe that that these ... criminals and should be treated as such\nUm anyone who ate it and that it moving them around all federal criminal action there should be no retirement a retirement as a graceful way to say you're leaving the situation at no retirement treated as a criminal\nAnd the thing the ... the thinking with retiring people that you don't want to be around it out of sight outta mind\nWell fed marrying at when you think about it here you had Jerry Sandusky was married and and look at his situation you know they're\nYou know these are people that are sick and and it may need help but they're all criminals and you know covering them up and moving them around from one place to the other people knew about this because they should the orders to move them around\nYou said land that that your cap what yeah what can the church do to make you believe that they are taking steps to ... you can never\nRight a wrong but what what could the church to do in your eyes to make you believe that they are they're they're aware of the severity or at least the perception of the severity\nWe need to do a clean sweep ... just started at the top and and work our way through all that [noise] um [noise] you know anybody again that that ... you know this these are criminals\nYou know the these young children were were physically abused mentally physically you could just imagine the pain that these young children went through\nAnd to know about it and just move these priests from place to place that's criminal activity and thank goodness you know we have a law Fishell that that has opened a book on this that are there are pursuing this situation\nAs a Catholic did you hear the story I told you earlier the the head of the Catholic League his response and this is the second time that he's spoken out and literally done everything he can to say\nIt's the homosexuals they did this bill Donahue when you see that\nDo you feel like that there's any benefit to your church for that guy speaking out or is he part of the problem\n[noise] hey probably probably that part of the problem and like I said we need a clean sweep you know we need we need people that come in here and make some changes and definitely I'm at they should be prosecuted these criminals for the for what they did to children\nIf you did something illegal and I did something illegal we will be prosecuted enact by a priest did something illegal they should be prosecuted exactly I\nMean that's just that's nothing to do with religion that's got to do with trying to apply the law equaling Lynn I appreciate your calling\nA ...\nMinute still waiting for some people in the the Roman Catholic church is kind of get

enlist and again I have to say that I was left with\nThe conclusion that this needs a comprehensive investigation because I can kind of belief both of them I have doubts about both of them and I believe both of them and I don't consider myself to be to have enough access to information at a level of competency can vehicle to make a judgment that I could stand on comfortably\nRight you could see ballad ... at least ballad questions from both sides absolutely\n... challenges yellow side yes now I don't believe that the Senate has demonstrated that same rigor and that really upsets me when I say the Senate I should say the Republican Party is that\nWhat I saw was a demonstration of a lack of judicial temperament on Kavanaugh's part that really troubles me troubled me beyond my inability to be able to discern whether either one of them was telling the truth of both of them telling the truth which is ... and I'm sure you understand\nAnd yeah ... Steve here here's the deal and I said there's a I said does after the hearings your issue with it is similar to my issue with that I looked at that as a job interview and I can't ever\nAnd I've gone

an array of high profile issues gun control campaign spending limits same sex marriage abortion\nAnd that are in these cases that the court in each case had decided first to use its broad discretion to get involved in all the constitutional issues and second do ... what elected legislature majorities hadn't acted then you add by in interject themselves\nInto issues that the two elected branches of government were confronting and rendering those branches largely impotent the justices had been upping the ante for each future seat on the Supreme Court is that the part of what we've been

here\nBut what what's better than hearing people read the book back to you\nYeah but the the that was the very very cogent point I had not thought about the fact that the court itself had created part of the urgency about each seat that just never occurred to me exactly\nI think was it what is responsible for the confirmation circus we just witness obviously the specific a dispute between cabinet on Ford is part of it and how did we get Brett Kavanaugh will you have\nExcellent if cynical vetting on the part of a Republican president and you've got partisans on both sides in the Senate but I Would argue that the main blame\nLies at the seat of the of the Supreme Court ah because they get involved in so many key social and political issues\nFrom abortion to gun control to resolving a presidential election in two thousand which is the worst uh of the decisions in my book they raise the stakes of confirmation hearings the days are long gone\nWhen a when a justice could surprise the
