I think you know the two wars that stuck out to me was peaceful tranquility and as you mentioned as we had seen our nation America\nOr that were posted neat one nation by did as it hotter in an intensifying or the most recent issues whether it's the cabinet off or immigration or Republican or Democrat\nI was wondering what nation if as independent state just like when states will make a law of their own now we should look at her own United States and say OK\nCurrently I'm living in Florida because Republicans have a certain philosophy of the way they would like to see things done\nMaybe we should make Florida simply a Republican state Democrats have a certain way with which they like to see things done or whether they care about the environment or support abortion or what have you maybe we should make 'em Texas Democratic\nState and maybe if we had each individual state has this democratic philosophy for Republican philosophy people that handles philosophies belonging to Democrats or Republicans couldn't live in that state and there wouldn't be all this animosity and great\nWell then as soon as the course of people read freely mobile also assumes that we can still be dictated one of the state is now granted election returns may also indicate\nA which direction estate goes but uh the notion of a visually establishing some things are and how would you feel in Florida was determined to be the opposite of you what are you going to just pack up and leave\nSure I Would say that there would be more peace and tranquility in\nA state that whoever supported me they ... they whether it be both abortion or not for abortion people living in that state there wouldn't be much happier and it wouldn't be in life and much more productive state\nOf the most of most people have much closer ties to low calorie than bad I mean he grabs your quite willing to move wherever whenever but other people have\nFamilies they have the jobs they have the traditions and and the like and and they would not certainly it would not be all peaceful for suddenly all the Republicans are in a\nA Florida looks they removed the Georgia or something where you are what are you going to do to the point of a gun I mean I mean it did just a ... I was the lead strikes me is just a tad unrealistic really\nAs long as you have a free society now of course if you are if you didn't have a free society ... it'd be very simple but\nPeople are much more than they used\nA lot of these are some many or not you know I mean\nI mean don't you think that's a matter of choice and one's individual why it's kind of like if they don't like it up north because it's old don't they moved down south\nOh they can but you're talking about the forcibly moving them\nOh no I think for moving them it would be hard to move [laughter] well that they're going to be happy where they live well\nBut they're they're going to be more unhappy if they they feel like they've got to leave their their view I think would be fine somebody wants to leave the others leave\nAgain that would be an optional thing either they can choose to leave a well let's say that would support their values are just being or choose to be happy because they all died but\nOf course you know election returns will change what a given state happens to do and then that's kind of an American viewpoint or so you know again uh I'm not sure that I see that as as a solution do you draw the lessons from that to your um\n[noise] well I I I I think he'll win raises an important historical point the United states was\nAs you know originally Thirteen independent independent countries briefly and the ... the deal that brought the United states together under the constitution was a was a deal that was supposed to allow\nExactly the kind of very very significant differences in a state character\nThat healthy and is talking about so all all of us are look back and are appalled at the at the question of of slavery but we we tend to forget that for example Massachusetts in Connecticut at the time of the founding\nOr had established churches and we're we're very proud of their of their puritan tradition as being part of the public character and culture of the states and that didn't mean that anybody was forced to leave those states have just messed up if\nIf you wanted to live and that that kind of a place then then you would live in Massachusetts in Connecticut and if you wanted to live someplace else than you'd you'd probably moved to New York\nAnd um\nIt it is\nInteresting that over over the last two hundred years the United states you can say has moved more and more towards a enforced\n... trying to force all the states to be the same and as I say I think it's very understandable on the issue of of slavery [noise] um but but when you get to a\nWell I wasn't sure if you're going to finish that thought but the clocks gonna make you finish it after this break is only\nOne in Pittsburgh San for breaking news weather\nTo me that that that that's what independence means when you celebrate the fourth of July in the United states if if Americans still do celebrate what you're saying is our country can chart its own course and the ... you can't you're not going to have England or China or Russia or anybody else dictate what we do\nKnow the theory of a world like that is is that different nations will have different forms of government some of them were not going to like so you you you read a lot in in the American press these days about uh about a Hungary Poland Israel Italy criticizing these countries and saying well that that\nThey're not they're not being government the way we want them to be governed\nBut that's exactly the point the point is that\nIf if Americans going to be a nation state and national state\nAnd it doesn't want others to to interfere in its elections and to tell it what to do than hard partly it has to allow other countries the freedom to determine their own course and so there's a certain ah humility and that saying we don't necessarily have\nThe the answers that we can dictate to every other country in the world invading Iraq and uh helping determined that new constitution there didn't work out so well some may may be may be America doesn't have\nPat answers for every other country should be governed\nAre obviously quite quite frankly there are some countries out there that just really aren't aren't fit for self governance and be kind of a free status or culturally they are simply unprepared for that the I Wonder if some languages even have the the word compromise in them I I seriously doubt an Arabic includes the words you're ...\nOr because of the of the uh the the way that the many aspects of their culture a proceed so\nAh I think that there was a much greater recall probably for this kind of thing back when the United nations consisted of a a lot of Western European democracies and we were willing to look the other way for the the Soviet Union and then suddenly all they have the the big\nA breakout of a of a colonial is the uh areas of became nations after the Nineteen sixties and we suddenly saw the the likes of Libya leading me the United Nations Human rights council and we realized that the the total to ... uh\nOf of the notion quite frankly I think the the the widespread growth of independent nations is probably what do the United nations because you you have within the United nations today what may be out of a hundred and Ninety some countries you've got maybe what\nFifty or sixty there could be considered the genuinely a a fit for free self governance\nYou know most of those countries but the ones that you're saying are are fit our our country in which there is an overwhelming majority of assert a single national group within the country and uh the\nThe ones that are not fit our ... you're talking to a large large portions of a of a Africa and Asia\nWell look at look at the orders higher swaths of the predominantly Arabic countries from Morocco\nA nice word and then once you leave by the Arabic countries just going predominantly Islamic countries many of those are are very model is ugly of one the culture and uh the the the armpit of the planet I mean the whereas the United states and relatively pluralistic place I mean\nI'm pretty sure that that's a that that is Sunni Arab propaganda if you actually take most of those countries and take a look at what's in them or you'll see that they're in not at all monolithic I mean in in North Africa you have thirty million Berbers\nWho who have their own language and their own culture and our suppressed in in ... countries like a ... ...

on and on that there is no Sunni Arab majority\nOr other than in Egypt in in ... in almost any of these countries and the uh the the reason why they want to say the races that's certainly a a reason why they're completely on government ungovernable is because of his because of the fact that the the people living in these countries are so afraid of one another\nAbout the fact that they have no

news radio ten twenty ...\n[noise]\n\n\nWith more cells in the British based story is the author of forty some books\nAs late as being ghost writers published by the Koppel subtitled when us a German soldiers fought together to save the world's most beautiful horses in the last days of World War two and we haven't really gotten into this any great detail but uh\nWe should point out I suppose that would be important obese horses just from the standpoint of if you will breeding stock because I gather advantage is why the Germans had them in the first place right\nYes I've seen the limits on a breeder very very special breed of a white horse a found them the interests of Spanish riding school they have been carefully bred for hunting with severe hunger hundreds of years on the Oscar Hungarian empire\nOr they performed a very special kind of a display which is known as high schooling of horses um is very very stylized and of course if you go to Vienna today you can see this they hope the palace and the blood line was absolutely pure and the Germans grab these whole says\nWith the intention of feeding them into a program to create if you like an area and that kind of soup a horse for the debt on an army\nThat's absolutely unbelievable but but nonetheless that was the circumstances that occurred so these wars was ... at the at great importance of must standpoint of justice those who love horses but also from the German point of view of the of the mass graves even to and including\nHorses themselves so as as we were telling the story or the Americans have reached the location of these horses and uh that they're going to have to convert German trucks in order to transport them back to American lives and they in the meantime I guess\nYou fanatic German SS forces have not been inactive and they are suddenly aware of the presence of Americans behind German lines\nThat is correct so you have this little outpost of the U.S army twenty miles behind the German lines or the the other German troops in the area where of what's going on the most of them have stood down ... leaving them alone however there is an ss unit moving up which has been defeated elsewhere and that coming up and groups of several hundred\nOr and they say this has some kind of a red flag to a bowl or some kind of opportunity\nAnd they launch a couple of concerts it attacks\nOn the little town which has defended by only you know a a couple of hundred Americans with very light weapons in the small vehicles\nAnd uh they have to fight them off and they have a couple of\nA fairly serious battles if yes has had managed to break in of course it would have led to amass loyal to 'em and the other thing is it leads to the creation of something codes to its foreign legion which is the interesting part of the story\nOf bleeds eliminate learned more about stewards foreign legion\nWell the officer was asking you come out with a guy pulled a captain told us to it and uh you know he's any young officers right combat experience but he's left with a really difficult situation he's simply doesn't have enough men to defend the town in the ...\nSo he looks around and of course when they came in they all say liberated some allied POWs there was some Americans Brits polls sides French\nExcept for and they've been working with the whole says for some years and he is able to um some of those were captured Jon their weapons but it's still not enough men so he tends eventually into the German prisoners that they have taken and um he re arms field expedient\nA quite a number of German soldiers and then a man checkpoints alongside\nEx POWs and us soldiers and of course this is known as students foreign legion where you throw the costs accent as well into this twenty on ... and of course when they are as has actually attack it is Americans fighting shoulder to shoulder with German and British POWs and contacts and everybody else to defending the ...\nAh the townspeople and of course the er\nAt the women and children of the stuff so it's an after him ... story\nThis foreign legion that this is a collection of people who if you put them all together you know barring some place you would think very many drinks before some of these people were going at each other's throats\nIn the in in this period of a of a pressure or were they able to get them to do work together without killing each other\nI think the ... was that ten they ruin in this together\nThe whole is whether that ticket out if they were left behind they would fall into Soviet captivity the Germans can expect to a nice trip to Siberia and I do like\nA if not being shot on the spot\nOr for the others of course uh they just want to get out and get back to the American line so the whole is has become the saviors of the men and women and children that are also there as well so it's very complex\nOn top of that we have one more player we haven't mentioned which just each episode back a communist father's hands will also operating in the forest they would like to snatch these whole says as well because they see them as being checked prophecy because they are on ... land so we had another idea is dime mentioned to this as well\nDid they manage to to get in the way of the operation leaves the check Mart as\nThey try to as the Americans were taking them out they men some road blocks on the very edge of checked her a trail of the very end border and uh a couple of American officers had dish a real showdown with them down in this World Cup and loaded and pointed and it was you know in case of who are being fast\nWho are being fast fortunately for everybody they are texting fast tend to allow the Americans but that German or allies and everybody else did pass through the whole says into safety in that area\nWe have concentrated on the horses are a unique part of the story but of course as you noted the American forces discovered a lot of humans there as well refugees and the like did the everybody a person's ah horses you'll be all managed to get out safely\nWell tunnel read um initially didn't want to take out refugees because he thought it was a military operation but then when he ... he came up in the south a couple of days later and he saw the plight of these people and he decided that he would turn a blind eye\nTo what was going on and if they to join this great long straggling column of people which was code name operation cowboy\nOr to move these papal whole says and everybody else into the area that would be all well and good because\nYou know a lot of these people are was sedate and Germans and they had a either being born in the area or move there on the Nazi occupation the checks hated them and the checks were determined to get rid of these people out of Czechoslovakia and a wife enough of the war was quite a few unpleasant massacres and a lot of victimization so", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city":
