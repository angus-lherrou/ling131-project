this is the same with this tragedy that happened and shady side but I mean people have turned it into politics and it's a real tragedy\nAnd that's just like yeah because President Trump\nYou know came to Pittsburgh today\nI feel with a good thing to do that are turning into politics [noise] do\nMe I I agree that it's political and I agree that it was turned political in anticipation of it expected to be political\nThere were people that were preemptively outrage before he did anything showing up to justify outrage and you can talk about the past and the previous things said and all of those things were said but what happened today was him showing up to pay his respects\nYeah now I said that the easiest way to have made does a lot less ah emotionally catastrophic if the president comes in

when he said oh leave him alone they're just letting out their frustration\nYou honestly you know law right you honestly law you layaway you honestly believe a lack of respect in politics I started in twenty Thirteen\nI I think that's the I'm not a hundred percent on it it's about respect or ... there's no respect in this world whatsoever I mean look at your road you're on your own governor I Can't wait till Wagner gets in office they disrespect ... president of United States\nYou know I'm not a rate highly a strong bond fan if you will ... will get my little check him a little\nYeah and I say

good night\nI alright jak I'm In response to that I Will quote the kid in the movie drum line\nYou gotta give respect to get respect no ...\nAnd the notion of disrespect starting in in twenty Thirteen\nMen and is it is on both sides but I Would also\nTell you there were people\nThe exact opposite and their attitude was it would be disrespectful to meet with\nThe president we've never ever been\nIn this country politically where we are right now Stephen Duquesne thank you for calling your own Katie KIA high\n... wait a minute my ... and you'd think after Thirty years I Know how to press a button how are ya\nI'm fairly well thanks yes in\nA in thanks for taking my call him up to ... just briefly at another point in time that another like I'm going to challenge you on the equivalence of both sides to it be that as it may I'd like to announce first and foremost I don't watch cable news okay well over a decade ago I came to terms with the fact\nThat as great a possibility is it presents it it actually\nPropagated the kind of the kind of of polarity that's present in politics right now while I Know there are a journalist on cable news ... excellent journalists in sum total it's not worth my time to watch them\nAnd and be upset by the point of views that are expressed from the people who are good journalists\nNow I I don't necessarily disagree with that whole cable news causing at least in part because I don't know if you were listening earlier or not it the minute I if you want to blame somebody blamed Ted Turner because I'm not I'm learning a lesson I\nDefinitely I'd simply like to just lay so ground for right is that I have to say that is that is the point of contention\nThere when when these networks started needing twenty four hours of news when at the time there wasn't\nThat's when shows got put in there and they weren't news it was content it wasn't news it was people talking about what they thought\nAbout the news and it got much more much more blurry and it's much easier to react much lazier but much easier to react to something than it is to read something so those content reaction shows became more popular than the news shows\nWhat I Am a reader I Am an observer of CSPAN Mm I get my information first hand when I watch\nCongressional hearings and so forth what I watch Donald Trump on the stump making speeches ... a person who got elected as a demagogue can you I had a sincere hope with temper his behavior once he be when it's office\nWould be have with the author that the office deserves I I have yet to see that as championed expressed you earlier he has a ... the author\nOf bad deeds that set the scene for who he is and continues to be and I will say this and I I have followed built to do for decades I've had the opportunity to speak to him a couple of times ... lives within walking distance of the tree of books synagogue\nThere and give him and his chief of staff a practicing Jew\nHim a couple of times ... lives within walking distance of the tree of book synagogue\nDan Gilman his chief of staff a practicing Jew also very well connected obviously to the community ram protector for the community if there's any lack of respect the lack of respect is on the part\nOf the Trump and his his staff board not reaching out to the city leaders\nContemplated people who know the neighborhood you know the community\nAnd following their request to hold off for a couple of days or something that you various do we pointed out now if they're there would still be\nA there would still be demonstrations on Thursday or friday but it will be easier to identify them as being political even though there would still be some pain and I'll leave you with this I I could go on and on and on but I Know there was a time\nI was sick and\nTo watch him say that if there would have been an armed security guard in that synagogue that place of worship that open place a practice and religion that we might have avoided this I Can't even begin to tell you the rage that I felt for such an insensitive combat\nThe mayor what's your ...\nYou're suggesting here said wait a minute wait a minute you're suggesting after describing President Trump as a guy that won't take advice from anybody that he should have been able to read between the lines on something\nWell well hopefully a common sense would have told them to read between\nThe common sense what have you ask people were advised that had been in that position before\nRight but but the but the mayor of set up a clue to come at this time because the ... some insight on where the family is what you're looking at just the logistics ... you know we're in the middle of these funerals you know there was just three of the day are actually where you have three to ... and there's more to come\nBut because of his schedule everybody was supposed to bend and twist and these families or dealing with grief\nWhy should they have to make a decision on the fat or on the president coming at this time and and and and it happened to meet with the president instead of waiting for at least a week or two weeks but no\nNine nine Lee I disagree I disagree with that I said something earlier Lee thank you for calling appreciate what you're saying about waiting I think that would have made a whole lot of things a whole lot less\nCaustic but to say they show up in two weeks\nNow show up Thursday after the funerals that would've been respectful to the families and I'm Talking about perception an optics right now and I'm not talking about reality\nWould have been at least visually more respectful to the families to say I aged we're going to come in but we're going to come in after the services we don't want to pull any attention away from those services okay\nBut to say two weeks now and now here's the text\nIn line with what you were just talking about leaving\nThe EU right automotive text line in two days many people would have said it was too late and it was ... he was being disrespectful for being so late\nDamned if you do and damned if you don't Joan in mourning side you're on Katie KIA Hi\nYes I'm I'm I'm sort of following through with the last two callers mhm first one that said too late that pardon me ... all those arrests that that's nonsense\nThe president has Jewish people in his family he should've known but in the Jewish tradition or you know very aisles are are pretty much right away and and what would it take for him he could have said something to Pittsburgh everybody would have understood and\nLike you said come after the funerals right instead of forcing is way like everything in the eyes\nWhich is why I don't want him as a precedent for clean his way into um\nThe tragedy and that that's really the way I see it he should have known\nFirst of all the tragedy and then the tradition of the people\nAnd I and showing his or start that way and if I'm\nOf all the tragedy and I'm the tradition of the people\nAnd uh and showing his start that way and if I'm if I'm not mistaken they make a comment about\nYou know I understand why you made it that it was also cow is saying that a terrorist or slash a hate crime person would change the schedule\nHe was taco now yeah the ... very little of what you said correct they ask why he did not cancel the campaign stop\nWhich was Saturday Night after all this happened and I'm paraphrasing but the response was you can't lead evil dictate your schedule that's that's what he said\nAnd [noise] the election is in one week\nMan in cranberry rights and man I was in your neighborhood as up and cranberry yesterday lovely place he should visit there more man writes let's be straight up Eddie\nNo matter when or if the president visited he would have been criticized by some if he said the sun was shining today the haters would've called him a liar so tired of the left demonizing political differences\nAre the first part of what you said I absolutely agree with the second part of what you said I'm going to point out that it ain't one side or the other there's Jagger wounds on both sides\nBut yes there would be people that he can't when there's nothing he can do that would make them say okay that yes you did good that's absolutely right but\nTo close with so tired of the left demonizing political differences are that ain't left thing that's a human thing\nWhen you have the talking head on a conservative news network say out loud that the caravan coming through South America excuse me through Mexico when he says out loud that Jared ... bringing\nSmallpox and smallpox is not

on by themselves light of and computer rated it was it was absolutely insane and and so that was probably more frustrating but probably the scariest thing was the first coast that I I I took a picture of\nBecause it was the idea of it actually scared me and this is where the Hollywood comes into play where students that they hold her guy St and so I'm thinking to myself oh no have I open the portal\nAnd am I going to get sucked into it and you know start screaming out for Carolyn or something I I I really was petrified um I have I have seen um some some scary\nScary goes that look like they've been beat up\nA ghost I had no idea [laughter] I didn't I think there would beat up before they cross our lives you know yeah and\nSo there was one like I had a black guy and like a a fat lip um so yeah there's been some scary things for sure but I think that first one was more scary for me 'cause I don't know what the heck it happened\nIs Hollywood doing more of this now you had this return to the Halloween\nFor me 'cause I didn't know what the heck it happened\nIs Hollywood doing more of this now you had this return to the Halloween the movies with\nA a a\nCurtis jama Jamie Lee Curtis Curtis yet are we going to see a return to those good old days of a of a scary this and the Freddie Krueger and that sort of thing\nYou know how it looks that way doesn't it I think that guy like faith in blonde and have figured out how to make 'em really commercial um horror films\nAnd and you know and it was so interesting I think about the horror genre and Hollywood is it really is that movie that you want to see in a theater because you want to be next to someone even if they're a stranger you know it's a it's a really great reason to go and have a communal experience\nIn terms of of of how we view these things anymore ... are the days of the the movie theater limited are we going to be downloading in the future\nAs far as I was asked that question a on a panel for my day job and um my answer was I Hope not because the way that we respond to storytelling at home is muted it compared to the way that we respond to them in theaters\nSo for instance um if you're watching a comedy at home you might smirk you might have a smile cross your face but if you're in a theater and other people are laughing you laugh out loud and when you laugh out loud\nYour body chemistry changes it actually it releases endorphins and say you enjoy yourself more so I I Hope it I Hope everything's not just download and we sat and watched things by herself\nThe the whole future of of Hollywood I suppose is is predicated to a certain extent on the on the various a revenue streams uh theaters for example uh get an awful lot of their money off of the concessions do\nNot think so they do\nYeah does Hollywood kind of data but if you're showing a blockbuster movie in the theater bulls in the X number of dollars off of popcorn and a and the candy at twelve dollars a candy bar or just the the the the film producer get a cut of that that's where the money is\nI'm not that I'm aware of where you'd be where I Would I Would yeah I Would be so I'm pretty sure we don't\nKnow All right yeah uh in terms of of the uh\nThe the creativity the that goes into a Hollywood productions it seems to be the some of the highest concentrations of creativity these days go not into the TV shows or even necessarily feature movies you seem so to me that some of the highest levels of creativity at least per\nPer second of air time if you will go into music videos and commercials\nHuh you know what that's a really great question I you know I I can tell you and I think it depends upon the film you know when it comes to cost\nThat it it really depends upon the special effects you know the cost per second on an animated film is actually quite extensive\nCosts for a second on something like a star wars and have a very expensive Avengers very expensive so it's really more I think about the facts and then it as anything else\nDoes do those Hollywood depend too much on affects how we don't have much in the way of star power in the script sucks but boy we've got the great ... computer graphic or a a special effects here as long as you got to ask you a light and magic on your side can you sell the public anything\nIt now you can't you you can't sell it felt like I think I got to tell you\nConsumers are so smart\nI didn't you sell the public anything\nIt now you can't you you can't sell the public I think I got to tell you consumers are so smart they are so smart which is why you know I started digging into the the data side of things is to is to understand the Kuster was warm and there was a day when you could just making moving in but he said\nI'm ... this was probably more like twenty twenty ... Twenty years ago um but now people are smart if they can they can kind of smell a bad movie and it's not that I said listen\nI from what I've experienced and I and I had to put it you know the kind of start with that because I think it's fair either not experience everything in it for every movie in Hollywood but no movie\nNo script ever starts out to be a bad movie\nYou know and all gone with the wind or some some games of storage right I mean and sometimes\nYou might have a script they might have made to not totally confident but it turns out to be a phenomenal film [noise]\nUm so you know but I I think people are are really smart and and you know I don't know do we rely too much on special effects and some of our most successful movies and the ones that I've personally the most proud of our movies like hidden figures\nUm fault in our stars there wasn't a single ... a special effect in any of those films um you know Slumdog Millionaire was a an Academy Award winner for the studio and not a single effect I you know I I think there are a lot of effect certainly more than we've ever had um but I still think there's room\nYou know for those films that don't at least I Hope so because those are some of our our best stories\nIs an article of faith among the good people in this country that anything that comes out of Hollywood is automatic you'll you'll be left wing of politics preaching to the rest of his memory or disagree\n[noise] God is it preaching it doesn't feel like preaching to me um you know I I don't think that\nThat is fully\nAccurate I think that maybe some of the stories that come to us might might appear that way um you know it's funny I you know I sit in these rooms every day and you know I'm a girl from Oklahoma I grew up at his ... and a Republican household\nUm but I can still enjoy a story\nWhether you know no matter what my political beliefs are or or not and I think that you know what I Would I just what breaks my heart is how politicized stories had become because movies like hidden figures should never be considered politicized because there was nothing political about that movie\nOr the anyway a fascinating tale and do

they sound lady there will be no more Thanksgiving with our family there will be no more Christmases with her\nAnd she's been that's why for some time there if you don't see it her way then she has all kinds of [noise] I'll let you use that word tenants in cancers\n\nAnd and that if you vote that way than more than anything the answers you get what you deserve and anybody who doesn't see it her way\nAnd that and that's pretty much her story so I'm Glad that God gives us the opportunity to add to our family and our friends because well I like to go not so much\nWell we don't we don't get a chance to choose our our our biological family so you're talking about somebody who apparently is already throw down the gauntlet so your choices are either to a a separate yourself from your sister so that at least there's distance there and it doesn't have to be all out animosity\nOr getting together\nIn which case I guess there would be\nA a total blowout that would would wreck even ever talking with her again I mean it seems to me that as as sad as it sounds you picked the lesser of the two problems just avoiding this person at least a ... you know you're not you're not yelling at
