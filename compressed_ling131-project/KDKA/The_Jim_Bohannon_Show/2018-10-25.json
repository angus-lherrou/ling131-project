story it's a big deal and it's something to talk about and it's a reflection of society is also\nA visiting ... much more important but since we started on this and you guys are millennials into social networking\nI Do not want you to scold me on my Facebook page if you do not like me go away but a lot of people use Facebook for the purpose of you know what I mean I I mean I Can't disagree that's fine but don't tell me it's not time yet that's personal taste on friends right\nWant to\nShow with political millennials Bethany hell I'm and Brendan zilch\nDistrict of New York times when President Trump calls old friends\nOn one of his iPhones to gossip gripe or solicit their take on I was doing American intelligence reports indicate that Chinese spies are often listening and putting to use invaluable insights into how to best work the president in effect administrator policy current and former American\nOfficials said so it also before I don't want to read this whole thing 'cause I did last hour but Mr Trump aides have repeatedly warned him that his cell phone calls you're not secure and they had told him that Russian Spies routinely eavesdropping on the calls as well as the Chinese yeah\nSo this is total evidence that this guy is a big fat do stupid do you have to be all your top intelligence people say dude don't you you're gonna get eavesdropping on\nBetter than everyone our memory smartest man in the world\nAlready been a question like anybody out there listening wondering like if this is fake news you can do this with equipment from radio shack\nIt's shelters reddish I'd go out of business are they still exist in a high high does still exist and have them or sprint stores now so it's just kind of like that but their own lives don't you can still buy radio equipment including you could buy things the pull\nCellular signals or or just radio signals that's all they are now they may be encrypted but any government intelligence agency is going to have a way into that so that's why when the president call somebody from the oval office donate secure live that's why what's his face that got run out of it\nAnd I didn't care where the EPA Administrator oh yeah we're getting word at best a school\nApparently the Chinese among others find out who he talks to and then they somehow get other people to talk to them feed them what the Chinese wants Trump to believe and hope that his friends are mentioned it to Trump and that it's ... affects\nHim out of high school and like you know your friend I'm like a three way and then you tell them to say something to someone else and you start this whole chain reaction is that fair I think I think\nTrump three ways\nYes they are I don't want us to do what she's saying makes sense to me and the yeah that's kind of what's going on it's like that that that\nGame we played in high school before we all caller i._d. and text messaging\nUm but yeah they're they're basically manipulating people around him based on the conversations that he's having and they're able to glean from his conversations what works and then use that against him and it's not like they're not saying that they're actually listening in a recording his phone calls\nThat's not likely they're listening they're listening on one side of it like\nI don't know what you're talking about they're listening to some calls period that I'd just rather than the listening to any of his cellular phone calls but not nothing from the oval office you know that yet secured lined up but the but the cellular phone calls what they're saying is he actually talks about stuff on the cellular phones that even though they keep telling them not to the other presidents have never would have ... yeah he he can call his\nBuddy and ask him like hey what's going on how do you think I'm doing and they can use that however they want but then if he says something like here's the commerce report coming out next week than they can use that okay I thought what a\nDifference between men and his claim that Hillary was using like talking about sensitive information on an ... isn't that the same exact thing yes but it was such a big deal end of the world\nAre not even the same exotic and how is it not if it's just phone calls and emails both on secure lines of prove that she was talking about anything that was the land but yeah so what was his\nClaim while he actually it's been proven because all he does the project if you hear him say anything about anybody you can be damn straight he's doing it yeah period that is in that seems\nTo be the model of the administration uh if if they are accusing the Democrats are doing something it's\nOh the ... the Democrats won or destroy Social Security and they want to destroy Medicare mother and literally doing destroyed for existing conditions and it's like anybody paying attention like how can you listen to that and think yeah those darn Democrats want to get rid of pre existing condition\nThey fought so hard tooth and nail and sacrifice their entire political capital for a generation trying to get oh my God\nAll right let me ask you this yeah I was going to get the recording but never mind going to have to do it so are you guys at all familiar with a a musician singer songwriter named James Taylor\nYeah my parents are fan so I'm your friend yes\nI saw in the Carolinas [laughter] somebody they'll go yeah two thousand election he can't really afford it'd be I'd be W with Al Gore when you're down in trouble and then they need a helping hand sing along I think it was him in any different go in a couple of other people other other\nYeah wait a minute with with who would you say Al Al Gore yeah two thousand yeah giant rally with a million people knows the I'd be All right I wasn't there well I thought All right never mind that ... I was way in the back and some Al Gore thing somewhere in this outside and to\nMe that was it yeah I was there yeah I may have\nMissed I may have gotten there too late for James yeah James were there any way to a group for some people on Twitter criticizing his singing the national anthem before the first game of the world series because like uh oh yeah inspired younger baseball fans by putting father time as the guy for a\nIt was it a full throated performance in other words Twitter was just being mean to James Taylor\nThey're putting father time as the guy for a it was it a full throated performance in other words Twitter was just being mean to James\nTaylor isn't good I mean to everyone who think that any national anthem that because I feel like that's a recurring theme no\nBecause the party to everybody who to anything yeah law enough of it like it's going to be harder to get to know but at the hell they destroy her but like if ... ... ... ... like they would praise\nOr what I see the point why get someone like James had her when you can get some of my party BNB I say I would never want to see\nCar seats yes I think that's ridiculous point because he's James Taylor where'd you find somebody more like like I said like Beyonce I think older generation the younger generation why can't you have an older generation guy saying the damn song here's where we're going to happen to get out the vote rally to try to get people to come out and then I wouldn't want to hate him\nBut the Twitter is Twitter's younger there to sing the national anthem we're we're yeah we're probably very cheap yeah young\nGuy one guy in the ... the guitar yeah what we're talking about James Taylor I guarantee you most of the people watching the world series last night no who James Taylor is and most of the people on Twitter do\nWell because when one person a Twitter said oh sure attract young baseball fans with father time I thought do you think it'd be unsafe play somebody's going to go well I wasn't going to watch the game but freaking\nBeyond say yeah no I dont think fans would watch fiance performing national and hit and then they wouldn't watch the game unless they were already baseball fans\nThey I'm biased because you know how I Am with sports but well ... ... ... what do you what's your bus I'm biased because I Will watch sports strike they write anything you know but don't forget that everybody should be reminded that if\nAny player in the world series steal a base in a World Series game we all get free talk as from Taco Bell so to readers talk to read as ... and we didn't get paid to do that you really like to talk I'll stop\nAnd they also do it and um\nAt least the NBA championships if in a way team wins the game yeah on the road you get free talk as so I've taken advantage of this many times in last year's World Series there was a stolen base so we got free tacos but you only get at once and I think he will stop eating fast foods someday\nHurt oh okay I Do know how 'bout you\n[laughter] me yeah I can definitely see that but heard no okay well I really love food yeah she loves or do you love food you don't have the fast food is because he loved food\nBut I like food fast so when I'm In I'm not sure I have like done for things already today before I got him like running around all day after work and whether you're some democratic a meeting get out the vote yeah the wrestling democratic committee had to get out the vote rally out and I guess that's ... ...\nUh yeah kind of executive rich Fitzgerald was their Lindsey Williams who's running for state Senate and the thirty eight Senate district which is my state committee districts okay and I feel you know trying to help the committee person I Am yes now you have no desire to run for any committee\nNo ... sometimes ... you know better than you keep trying to get me to do this by too I'm too loud and Italian and it won't work just\nWhat kind of loud I Am I allowed to end up noxious and not even Italian for love you [laughter] you know how to\nTell him no yeah a guy and has his dark hair I mean he's loud and talk with my hands but the people can't he listeners can hear that it will also concede that Italian I should've bill producer\nIs built in a time you see that see what I'm saying I didn't know that I I Love and I'm a big fan of put it lightly or do you know I Am also like to I got to ... I I Love it I random in the city kind of building\nThem like did you trim that he's like yeah I'm like OK started he said with keeping until Christmas right yes he's got ... yeah I think that's fantastic\nYou know I Love him and so I I anything\nI had no idea here's a puzzle editor of Italian so he's yeah no idea either for the military are out there don't be don't hold\nIt against me ideas and you're not you don't have a chef boy already had you know and you know you don't I don't see it halfway id\nCultural appropriate [laughter] I think that there are a threat oh I'm Sorry\nJeff boy already had you know and you know you don't I don't see it halfway ID\nI don't know how to appropriate [laughter] I think that there are a threat oh I'm Sorry that's an agent you know I knew where he is he's a tally in\nIt's the ... a town called spaghetti and we I was just going to ask to spaghetti will still exist I ... I actually just had spaghetti or the other hand I ... made it like a little ... I Love spaghetti rich crackers and ...\nAnd sometime I put the ... the amount of carbs you just described to me how are you not far I'm just hungry like you're just carving over here\nYou should say this this lay out they had even at the rally oh that's nice it was a hostile like you ever\nBeen to the make your own omelet bars where you tell them the ingredients and they make an omelet in front of you yeah it was apple with pasta the pick like the veggies you pick the meat you pick the ... the type of pasta and you pick the sauce and he sat there with a skill\nIt made it you ever seen no meaning that sounds great it was fantastic\nAnd everybody was like oh I Can't believe you'd never seen this before it was if and this on the Democratic party money on did you help people with moderate if you really want to live rich crackers and spaghetti oh this is the way to go\nWell I've I'm sure I've told many people throughout my life okay yeah 'cause I get the right rich crackers because actually I was a dream that Jews cause I don't want to just get the juice on my side drain the Jews and then I just give the spaghetti as we come back ah\nNa\nOh\nCould you imagine if you were just throwing during the day now and my\nMarriage St Louis singing the national anthem like what did he deserved Twitter abusive to your humble opinion I mean it was basic yeah the guitar was actually a beauty evidence basic James Taylors basic you know like a ten piece band okay well there's this one Eighteen and we have like wild performers out there I get this was a budget thing I understand while\nPerformers I'm Chana mother I think I'm more into the performance and I have I have the what do you call it the gospel a thing like I I it's like\nIt's such a gimmick and it's so over done that was that I can see that can you know let's give credit to the people who can ... I don't I Can't do many things that annoy me but the ... the only thing it's not about\nThe singer it's about the country if we're led to believe from the people on the right at the national anthem as we are in the country anybody doing that and making it a big show about themselves wouldn't they potentially be disrespecting the national anthem I'm sure somebody can make a case there that Christine Aguilera making that for a minute long national anthem would be hey don't\nThrow shade on Christina oh I Will do you know be ... it would have been the\nMid to late nineties and somebody's like you've got to put this person on the night talk to a TV show was hosting 'cause you know where I'm like who's just you know you learn and they're like you know ... it's actually watch it so and that's the first people I met ... and I said All right we'll put her on she'll sing a song and she refused to sing a song and so I said\nWe're not putting her on [laughter] years later of course I felt like a more 'cause she was already a minor charge you become a major star ever my crummy little show it would've been good to have her on even if she didn't so being a free minutes up the street where bad yeah\nSo wait a second you had or on like before gene a bottle or after ... didn't have ... or you know what was it was this before or after ... what it was early Nineteen there was no no I didn't even start to until Ninety six it would have been no\nAnd I couldn't even be wrong about the timeline guys what gives you blow up at Ninety eight and then she really blew up so this might have been like Ninety seven you know what I mean yeah it's already like kind of and she was certainly famous here yeah I screwed up that yeah you definitely definitely [laughter]\nShe was famous here the ... come out already and that was like the biggest song of the late nineties\nI did interview captain kangaroo is I think I told you so that was big not as good as we know now I have no idea that it's I think they're mixed feelings because how about Carl I'm old and is that anything he came in I don't know you got nothing\nOkay yep I'm here's John from downtown how John Hi John\n[laughter] hey I'm I'm I'm\nNot a millennial but I Do and what I Me neither [laughter]\nWhat I'm learning a lot from millennials particularly around a social justice and by the way James Taylor is so like I grew up in Massachusetts and he's popular there he's like a like I said there so you got you got a full that\nYou know I I got that somebody wrote on Twitter James Taylor singing the national labs in Boston you can't get any wider than that I Can't get a break\nWhich which is a really good segue because what I call it in about ... is with the Pittsburgh free thought community\nAnd it's going to drink which which is a really good segue because what I call it in about a is a I Would the Pittsburgh free thought community I didn't know you have an existing in modern\nOf non non serious group of both together all of the different uh free thinking groups in Pittsburgh and made kind of a a coalition of them so it has a critical mass to be able to put on programs that would be really attractive and would really address some of the important questions\nAnd one of the things we've got going on this Sunday is a lecturer at the first Unitarian church or Pittsburgh we just got an ironic 'cause we're on the U.S grew\nUp and Dr Anthony pin who is a professor\nAt Rice University is speaking about his thinking about race for real that's the title of the of the talk\nIs a book which he wrote on this subject as well when colorblindness isn't the answer the\nThat's the real uh I think genius of Tony is that he's looking at race not from a third person perspective you know we kind of look at race relations and race differences from the scientific prepare for prospective\nBut he's looking at it from a first person perspective that we ... we actually encounter each other we haven't body cognition and we actually encouraging each other as as as bodies\nAnd every when we do encounter each other there is a real life sense in this for a vote or that brings in both the conscious and unconscious assessments and evaluations of other bodies\nAnd he really has a really good way of explaining how a these materials that these bodies on material Dearborn live and die but we also know them as social construct or a type of cultural things so what he's doing is he's trying to make us feel\nWhat it means what a racial differences are all about and I think it's a it would be really worthwhile\nOkay so leaders to measure the Unitarian church this Sunday first Unitarian church\nFor your insurance rich at one PM to two thirty it's in the six o five more would have a new Pittsburg Pennsylvania you\nKnow you can find more detail on that by going\nTo the uh Pittsburgh free thought community dot com website and it's got all the details\nThere and it's freedom of thought is that freedom of the to get in its freedom to get involved yeah awesome alright uh John thank you so much you know that was great to punish the ticket in ... I\nRead this article recently I think oh my God you're in an article I read the article I thought that was that was actually like read this article now than like that even now I read this article going off and he's saying it just made me think of it and it was about I don't know maybe you guys saw it and it's about how\nWhite women right have historically been that\nThe determining factor in why democratic candidates are losing right it's the black women who are electing a Democrat and it's theoretically the white women who are waiting for the Republicans\nAnd I went off you're into the black women aren't just electing Democrats they're rescuing the Democrats in areas where they should be should not be winning they're really\nAgree I agree and I I've been hearing yes I've I've seen that I mean for years now and I think it's it's really underplayed but the article was about how\nUh if if the white women could come together as women and if we can all come together that they were so scared of\nIn their saying even liberal women right that we we always want to get involved I mean I was going to help everybody by white women are so scared of getting attached to let's say the the black lives matter movement and different things that affect the African American community\nAnd how we could find a way as women to come together ... not dependent on race sexual orientation anything like that\nThat we could really take our government back in the ...\nWomen to come together ... not dependent on race sexual orientation or anything like that that we could really take our government back that that's that's honestly all it would take is for women who who were known to write women stick together right that's the way how serious yeah yeah yeah All right so uh I got to go right but

Wisconsin and of course it is there is a certain amount of irony obviously attached to the president calling for a a civil tone or would have been a lot I think\nA better for him had he not engaged in some of the tone that he is set in the past because that would have given a clear and moral superiority\nOr in contrast to a party which has stood by and a centrally in some cases are actually whipped up the mob and in other cases that just sat back and ignored the mob but again the president is often hard pressed to\nTo curb his tongue so as a result he finds himself a dipped into the mix with the with the others hear your thoughts on that a doctor Uber's bid go back to some calls here\nWell I think I think when we talk about President Trump we're talking about actually a businessman who at a political position not a politician he practiced and uh I think that's one of the reasons why he was and he he was not a career politician\nAnd a lot of um middle America just upset and having to deal with\nWith both parties seem to become kind of a ruling class and they were tired of that so they put some of the and there are different and\nI think they expect him to make mistakes and called paws

mean\nI remember the ... ... are you familiar with\nIt I Know and I doubt that most of the people in the audience source of water the Palmer Raids um how does that relate to what we're talking about\nWell that's how kids are Hoover got his start and it was in Woodrow Wilson's day and they had these pipe bombs that went off in Vanderbilt\nActually went off in this case pipe bombs could have gone up I trust your not not assuming the tracking down these people would not be a legitimate public expenditure this was a I mean it may be budgetary expense based on fear but it's a very reasonable fear\nWell after nine eleven they invented the Patriot act and they\nCame out I Am about where they didn't call just invent the Patriot act and point of fact we faced an actual attack and if we in fact sometimes spend money because of fear if it's safe founded fear I personally have no problem with it not can we go overboard I suppose I don't feel any particular instances we did Dr Huber\n[noise] I think anything that that is reactionary that causes us to give up our rights for quote unquote safety is a bad mistake or I think we have to be cautious as\nCitizens and pay a lot of it at all what are governments doing all it there's a new and we're the watchdog so\nI I see where he's coming from we need we need to remain low down some of this knee jerk reaction and make it more of a thoughtful\nProcess nuance and ... you know there are times and you know I Know it can do that we just have to react because we all have fine yeah anything out\nAlthough of course I Would note that that in some cases we're not talking about taking away our rights for example we don't have a right to get on an airplane quickly\nCorrect but All right to dawn in Albany, Oregon now the gentlemen hit\nEvening and I thought at least to me it's sounding like Sam wack job took President Trump's rhetoric for marching orders\nMaybe or maybe he decided that he would still be try to smear conservatives we don't know\nThe security district true yeah and then it was the gear or NATO though I don't know how much a quote unquote white dog could could a coordinated\nThe that's the thing that I think that you make a very telling point Dr Huber that that this would have required very well organized whack jobs plural and they don't come they don't tend to come in well organized groups exactly\nYeah that that that that I think that the doctor makes a very good point there that for this to have been delivered of the matter that it was would indicate that we're talking about more than just a whack job which is even more disturbing because I Will take it they have given that we will always have people of that nature we've got three hundred and twenty five million of us\nBut organized a that\nThat of course is a whole nother level of concern yes I'd want to six six five oh jumbo into more with Dr John Huber and your calls as well as the boy had a job in a moment\nAnd I don't know about it and I always just look at that because these things can happen and it and we have a look back before and seen that that has been pay a seemingly down made\nIt could be how do they get all the you know you\nKnow I ... thought I I again I look at it from the standpoint of if it was designed Dr Huber to take our attention off of something\nWhat would it possibly be because it clearly couldn't be the caravan which will be a story long after this bomb thing has gone away it can't be the mid term elections that's Thirteen Days away and we're going to be all elections all the time leading up to that point so\nMaybe Linda's right maybe there was an attempt to describe it is for something but it's not going to be uh that uh that we're going to forget about it and the next couple of days which is about how long it's going to take us to forget the bombs\nExactly well historically terrorists and terrorism was used to uh oftentimes terrorize a culture or\nWell historically terrorists and terrorism was used to uh oftentimes a ... a a culture or a specific population and what that off them did was you know sway that people's fear of a cultural annihilation and and usually\nRare while those individuals up and made them move into action so if we take the idea that maybe this was a political uh the\n... play that they're trying to get maybe more Democrats now to go to the polls that actually vote by say look they were all targeting Democrats we almost lost a whole generation of our leaders\nOr maybe I mean as I say you were at the age where we we just at this
