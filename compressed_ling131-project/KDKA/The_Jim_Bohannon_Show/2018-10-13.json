they were ... they were they were they were successful evil tray and only business for the political system in Chicago choose as powerful cover up for a a criminal aids cut your yes yeah quite as far as\nI dare say they can attack a Lowe's All right uh I was not aware of the free masons played any particular role in this at all but uh you tell me gentleman\nWell probably ... indirectly and that to the business community would have been a made up of many free masons and who\nWho joined together to buy as Brad mentioned to try to take a bone down ah the reason was not as altruistic as you might think because ... was a terrible public relations disaster for the city\nOr he he was a gangster who who love publicity who wanted to be liked\nWhile meanwhile the the people like a Frank ... who is actually named Frank NATO and others on on mob uh they went down in a more traditional business role and that that kind of fit in with what the gentleman earlier asked about the the business aspect of this the ah the the parallel and even the uh\nEvent the eventual and merging into legitimate legitimate business uh and I think to to touch on on the other question\nThe gym caught a mob for example all all of those people pretty much grew out of the old Capone mob you have people\nYou have people growing up they they start as drivers or their enforcers are there going around picking up money and collecting and a lot of these people are are thugs is young young man and then they grow into\nA you know they grow into positions of power ah it was pretty insulated even though Capone was well known for not being ethnically pure ... you know he had he had all kinds of\nEthnic backgrounds and the people that that he assembled but the people that he trusted him that he assembled with him uh they they tended to stay close\nAnd the successors as you in Canada and others uh\nUh we we talk the book basically hands I'm In Nineteen thirty three with with the end of prohibition um but even that\nWe get into the transfer of power between between compound to a Frank ... hours you know Frank hideous he's more commonly known 'em and then there's sort of an Epilogue A final chapter that looks more broadly at\nAh the fact that ah ... the battle between ness and compound both in reality and sort of the ... the impact that has had and continues to have a ...\nTo have a on the city of Chicago and its politics and the interplay between a crime and government tend and media and all sorts of those things\nWithout prohibition would component of even existed as a mobster\nHe would have been a low level criminal who never rose a much beyond where he started in life or in the in the slums of Brooklyn probably um you know he's he is out of the protege of a fellow named John ...\nWho was really the first corporate minded gangster someone who realized that this could be a business and when prohibition comes in and creates this whole new market\nUh that his patronize by legitimate people not people who consider themselves outside the realm of the law he capitalize on it and sort of paved the way for for ... to do so in one story I was out\nUm compound steps in 'em and it's this influx of money and and attention frankly again as Michael said coupon courted celebrity that makes him into the icon that he becomes and certainly we would never be talking about him or in the twenty first century if it hadn't been for prohibition\nIn terms of the the sheer power of the polling mob is there any comparison let's say with the power wielded today in northern Mexico by the drug cartels\nBut certainly the same the same kind of thing a particularly if you you look at the way a so called legitimate government can be be in league with these ah ... ... with these kinds of groups [noise] ah it was\nReally pretty much felt like a poll around the city for a long time and I I think that probably was an over simplification again he becomes such a public relations problem for the city that that the uh you know the people around him are privately\nCollaborating with with federal agents that get rid of him because the the idea was we have to it's early in the depression and he's a he's a bad or you know he's a bad black guy for\nThe federal government in general that's why why Hoover himself and I'm not talking about J Edgar Hoover I'm Talking about president Hoover\nTook a a major interest in and taking you know taking Capone down because at this time components feeding all of this popular culture\nThings like you know all of the Warner Brothers movies like little Caesar\nAnd

both\nHave a fathers who are are legitimate businessmen a barber and components case and in a nest his case of really quite successful Baker who had bakeries and in the Chicago area\nAnd I think it was the ... the ... influence of a brother or a brother in law Alexander Jamie who became a federal agent and the kind of a I think the melodrama and romance of that\nActual real life detective being in his life really uh really drew a next to it and there's also the element of of him being a very very smart young man who ... who for a while it looked like he was going to be a lawyer and uh\nAlso you know you have lawyers and doctors but he looks at law enforcement and sees that things are changing that\nForensics is coming in and out of a level of sophistication coming into law enforcement that and existed before\nAnd he sees as an opportunity to make law enforcement a real legitimate profession and so so that's his ambition that's his path fairly early\nBecause he's very on both of these men are quite young when when they're famous struggle happens or you know late twenties and the case of of ah of NASA and uh ... depending on where your data from\nYou know you have you have ... in his mid twenties basically up into a too is just as early thirties when he's at is\nAt its height and his downfall so so you have a you have these kind of parallel tracks between these two men because Capone is viewing is one of the first to really view\nCrime as a business as a as an industry as a veteran so you have these two professionals in law enforcement and crime on a a a on a collision course in history\nYou know I ended up they both died rather young actually a couple of them was the forty eight messed fifty for\nA ... ton was forty yes for forty eight um he had just

that ends up uh seriously manifesting itself when when he's in prison with NASA it's a it's a childhood heart condition um\nThat he got one from rheumatic fever when he was a kid so they're both in

J.\nOf are becoming more and more of an Islamic state and that's a very bad a circumstance both by virtue of the size of turkey which has a has a very large population a bigger than any nation I guess in a\nIn the western Europe\nAnd uh a country which is remains a key part of NATO which of course with the increase belligerence\nOf Vladimir putting and the Russians are NATO remains a very important alliance the Turks for a while or tried to obtain membership and that other Western European gathering the European Union but they at the time they were applying they simply\nWere moving in the direction away from a political freedom\nAnd uh they didn't pass muster\nAnd are these days ah turkey which was once a a pretty reasonable ally with the the Israelis has gone the other direction they haven't got all the way there's really not Iran or Sudan\nBut this latest the circumstances just the latest example of what can happen when a country that falls into the throes\nOf a religious fanatics and that's the direction the turkey seems to be heading so we're certainly glad to hear that a river and Andrew Brunson\nHas in fact\nBeen freed and I think we can safely say you will never return to turkey which would feel like a pretty smart move on his part\n[noise] uh\nCourt in the turkey had sentenced him to three years in the months in prison for his conviction\nA but since he had already spent two years in detention he will not serve any more time Brunson had rejected the espionage and terror related charges in strongly maintained or to the country that he had engaged in those such activity\nAnd it it seems again that it's highly unlikely that he did or that he would uh what it sounds like\nHe has another attempt at taking a shot if you will\nAt a at Christians in this world and I'm just curious you are your thoughts about all this is this a a case of hyper sensitivity on the part of grad students as if the case of a a exaggerating it would seem not by the statistics I gave a just a moment ago they're granted there aren't\nThey're granted there are an awful lot of Christians in the world are but there does seem to be a fair amount of persecution and what is particularly telling in many cases is the extent to which much of the world will look the other way [noise] ah like they're they're only Christians\nAnd that's a a an odd attitude\nUnless of course I suppose you you fall in with the identity politics kind of nonsense that well Christians tend to be a\nA rich wealthy white western countries or some such nonsense which of course by the way it is not even particularly true but if it were it still would be a beside the point\nWhere or at least it ought to be a beside the point\nIs that it is ironic indeed that some people in the west who\nMost express themselves with the the various freedoms that we have who make the greatest use of those freedoms are the least willing to defend them\nIt it's ironic certainly if the forces a fundamentalist Islam or would it take over this country the people they would go after first would be what they would consider to be the liberty teen residents of say places like Hollywood for example\nAnd yet those people in their mad quest do appear to be a freebie tolerant uh we'll try to show tolerance for the most intolerant people on the planet just kind of bizarre just kind of bizarre most of the central tenets of western civilization\nOr actually nourished\nBy the Christian Church and I certainly would not be one to say that the Christianity has an on blemish record in this world certainly the or the Spanish Inquisition just to be one particular example\nBut in terms of a of a civilized influence and in terms of of the push toward personal freedom\nOr despite any number of of instances you can point out on which ah\nChristianity was not always on the side of freedom the overall thrust of it throughout history has been in that direction and the countries which have become the most free had been nations in which Christianity has been the dominant religious force and conversely the countries in which\nAre the greatest persecution has taken place with the exception to view a totalitarian communist nightmares like North Korea or the area of the world that is most consistently um free\nUnstable on wealthy would be the swath of territory from roughly a Morocco across North Africa eastward through Egypt in the middle east and the further east until you get as far as Pakistan that swath of predominantly Islamic countries is ah\nThe armpit of this planet in terms of most uh\nStandards of uh of human conduct of behavior and the living conditions\nAnd ... Islam in that swath of territory is so dominant or if in fact it were a pasture or a pastoral paradise you'd have to give them credit and since\nIt's not then so the blame must go in that direction I'm not sure exactly what it is but uh it's just unfortunate and uh again yes of course there are many fine Muslims in the world but in many cases it would have to be said that they are fine in spite of their faith\nIt's not necessarily because of it [noise] so I find it odd that there are so many apologist\nFor some of the excesses\nOf Islam particularly in that portion of the world where it is the predominant faith and so many people are willing to persecute or at the very least look the other way at persecution of Christianity which certainly in recent centuries has become\nA force and one of the principal forces in support of the notion of free expression of individual rights and the host of other things that could be put under the general a title of the western civilization\nJust a sad circumstance\nOne would like to think that the the release of the river and Andrew Brunson\nIs a sign that this is changing in Turkey a my guess would be it's more of a sign of the pressure placed on the Turks by a President Trump and not necessarily a sign of any kind of significant change in their policies the Turkish government is moving\nPretty stride and Lee in the direction of an Islamic point of view not good for turkey not good for the region not good for NATO not good for Europe that of course the tiny chunk of the turkey remains on the European continent with the bulk of it of course in the in Asia Minor\nIt's an unfortunate circumstance\nAnd we're happy for Andrew Brunson happy for his release happy that in fact this story has had a happy ending but for so many others that has not been the case and I'm just curious\nHow you folks feel about that one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six\nThere are many things in this world which are get curious er and curious or as they used to say in the Alice in wonderland\nAnd it is it is odd indeed\nThat one of the central forces for personal freedom and the world that I think it's safe to say that that is generally crew of Christianity or can be so persecuted at times and the ... and for the civilized world to look the other way as it as a persecuted\nWhereas a of a force which with the exception of the ... versions of a of communism that still exist in places like North Korea there is no more despotic our own free portion of the planet\nThen that portion of the world which is predominantly Islamic that is not a condemnation of every Muslim but it is I think a fair condemnation of the portion of the world which is predominantly Islamic where are the home grown\nDemocracies of that area where are the home grown supporters of a personal rights and the like uh the home grown supporters in that part of the world for freedom of religion for example\nOr the answer is\nThey aren't anywhere they don't exist\nIt's a it's sad will come back we'll take some calls but it just struck me that while I'm happy for a Reverend Brunson that uh this is a\nA happy episode and while others are remaining as a very unfortunate dismal and depressing world condition and that is the the persecution of Christians who are considered I suppose handy by regimes such as the thugs who are currently run turkey\nOne eight six six five oh Jim bow our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six we'll be back with more in just a moment\nA a a a a say you're talking about the army

and real pretty close to the Russian border and interestingly you shake it and went to the ...\nYeah that's what we're observing but you know what I Want to talk about is\nThe Turkish government of today is not the ... when I was there no no absolutely not uh they they were completely different um in fact the way I understand the constitution is written in such a way\nThat a sort of most cursory a law cannot be instituted now that's the way or the written yes yeah everyone is trying to change it now\nAnd the as he tried to change it officially unofficially I guess it's largely changed\nThere yeah it's and that's a shame because when I was there I mean I got along with a Turkish papal fantastic and say to this\nDay I have several Turkish friends and what I get a kick out of most among restaurants when I walked in the first time a greater them in their neighborhood native language they looked at like I had two heads [noise] because\nBecause they never had an American do that to them [noise] but yeah it's a shame that a country with the history that it has and the inroads it is late into modern technology and how they have developed their cities\nIn the last ah forty years uh is going to the is they're trying to pull back into the dark ages and I think that's a darn shame and I did oh why the people of the country are standing around a little allowing that to happen\nBecause there are various factions just as as happened in Iran you have any number of people who who came to\nFollow the notion of a of the individual rights and and free will and choice but you also have any
