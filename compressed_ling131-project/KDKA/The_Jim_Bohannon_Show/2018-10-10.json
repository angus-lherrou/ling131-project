you're traveling on leisure early um track\nTo some of these escape areas that you may find yourself having to evacuate sue\nSo this way so if your if your area is let's say area that everyone knows you're going to be there and I and other people are gonna meet up with you\nAnd you should know at least several of the major roads to get to that location just in case you have to\nTake one of those rows so when you're doing it on a leisurely timeline it's not a problem you don't have to be concerned about it but if you let's say before let's say you're on a major artery and you're told that are being asked to take place you can easily tax the email from your phone that hey\nI'm taking this beach and we're going to go to through this direction\nTo that location so this way family members who you rely on\nThose even the people on the other side cannot get that sick no meaning that tax to the email message wants that to our turns on and the people on the other side\nGet that connection your text or email all show up once their their cell phone reaches that tower\nNo as a as a ... thank you Alan for your call the your thoughts here or how does the GPS here ah affect all of this\nOh and makes everything so wonderful that we know where each of those are like you can send an activate your GPS for your family members\nSo this way you can see where you know your family members are by checking where they are on the GPS system so but in times of\nWeather related problems such as Michael you know the storm skipped throwing down you know can take our technology\nAnd if the towers set of people that you're sending a signal to went down on the dance single\nYou won't get that you know the people on the other side won't get the message but if they hit another tower that's active they will instantly they received those messages so as long as you're sending a signal you can let people know which way you're going how you're going that way and on the other side\nIt's important to understand that they will receive it wants a power is connected to that cell phone they will receive that message and now they know what happened to you\nKnow I Would just throw in a quick little plug for a radio and the good old ubiquitous over the radio always their distribution such moments\nGot to Patrick in Rochester, Minnesota joined us tonight on the bull headed show with our guest disaster preparedness expert Anthony ... good evening Patrick\nAh good evening gamble for this coverage is very fascinating with hurricanes and so forth [noise]\nUm [noise] and uh otherwise set a than being a good script per movie um why not just bomb or a hurricane several hundred miles out into the Pacific\nSpecific uh can be a new killer it would rain\nRadioactive [laughter] a wave of but a maybe a hydrogen bomb or\nWell that's a nuclear bomb to the case you didn't know because it involves a a a a\nA trigger that consists of either uranium plutonium but beyond that if it it let's assume for the moment that we didn't care about the radiation we just wanted to really knock a hurricane out of kilter a I Am not sure about this but I Would dare say that if we were to drop our entire nuclear arsenal\nInto hurricanes I\nIt might have an impact but these things are so much bigger than a single nuclear weapon that aside from all of the other uh him practicalities of such an idea there isn't too big and very\nWell you know let's put it this way\nLet's say the United states was to let's say all of this you know in the state of Florida the state decides hey we're gonna take this action and do something with the store and the storm goes towards Alabama Texas\nNow ... is the state of Florida are liable for ... for this storm and damaging the states the other states or let's say another country let's say the United states there is a big storm coming towards us\nAnd then we diverted to Mexico and that goes straight through the city and cause a hundred billion dollars worth of damage\nOh we liable for that so that's another area of issues that arise if we went to try to control the weather because the weather's going to go some place and the people that it hit they're going to be upset yeah\nAnd I would note one instance in which this happened I'm not sure that anybody would ever found liable or even there was proof that in fact the action lead to one followed but ah this was this has been probably half a century ago or so somebody got the idea\nOf cloud seeding or part of the eye of a hurricane this was I think the hurricane was off Jacksonville, Florida\nAnd so they did it and the hurricane promptly took a sharp left during then headed inland\nAnd the ... I don't think anybody was ever able to tell if in fact the cloud seeding caused this but I I don't believe the ever again that was tried so ah the the fact is that that we just don't know enough about these things in the end of the Anthony notes quite correctly or\nA mother but just simply change of course and and damages somebody else them to the who is liable and uh I think it could be a painful lesson in the liability laws if in fact we ever did learn to do this we we'd better learn to do with the exact precision will take some more callers will get an Anthony ...\nAnd his book is the emergency\nPrepping simple disaster preparedness for the Modern Family has ... urgency prepping dot org where one eight six six five oh jumbo back in a moment\nOkay well what other than all of the things you said so far about your license you're damn baby or a thumb drive your record all of that\nKind of stuff I've already been done but you know what other um physical things kind of a guy\nReally prepare for you know besides food water that type of thing or is there a um your goal kid would probably not even work because you wouldn't be able to drive anywhere anyway\nAnd that's not bad but it's not necessarily true at all you may or may not you just simply have no way of knowing if you're talking about\nA a an earthquake good it's a you know Tony on the Richter scale of every structure and road is flat and well I guess you're screwed but I mean I don't think that's a that's too likely and go get is always an easy thing to have even under the most dire circumstances or your your advice for a a gym that you would please Anthony\nAbsolutely I mean I don't get is just that so let's say you are you have to abandon your vehicle and you have\nYour whole trunk full adult cats\nAbove you had your backpacking you carry ... central south a few days the food and medicine than other things that you can now walk and I get to the next town or wherever it is that you can have safe lodging or maybe even just they just sent nearby and just\nYou know wait it out and so you know authorities start putting together what's happening now\nThink about it and when the last one McCain that came so far and most of the face now are starting to take seriously you know emergency management of these type of situation like in the state of Florida because we've had so many hurricanes back to back\nIt taking it seriously the money and management of each count\nAnd um each county each district each region the state itself I mean we moved I think it was seven billion people during the hurricane to one that it uh\nIt was it ... I Can't remember from so many names now but think about how many people were relocated not only in the state of Florida but to Alabama Georgia\nIt was just and then ... you know we location of the masses and the whatever number no one was\nKilled during this whole process\nThe right one eight six six by boat jumbo one eight six six by both five four six to six and as we go to the break an important lesson to keep in mind\nDo the best you can a again a the idea of throwing up your hands on the air and say well look forward to a go getter near the preparation we're all gonna die is a a

North Carolina joined it's below Dave\nI in fact I might call sure in the last storm that came through her arms and your call screener asked perhaps ... was a stray outside of cherry point Lori Koerner station\nOn the Carolina coast or just in between ... and more head where the flooding was real bad and you know the thing about this last storm is that there's the flooding was way outside the norm [noise]\nTwenty inches of rain in twenty four hours there's just\nTwenty four hours is just not something that normally yeah I've I've had this house here for for Thirty years and been through every storm that they've had ... the idea that strongly about right down\nThrough the air station there so you know I've you know we've had this spinoff tornadoes and all that stuff that happens it's never been anything like this and I've never had\nA huge damages and when I listen to some of your callers say us taxpayers bailed them out and everything you know I've never gotten a penny from anybody for anything and never even made an insurance claim and uh\nWell he was telling you what you do you had to rebuild right\nWhy is that the repairs on my own and and here's the thing is when people do rebuild it's like I this is the first time I had extensive damage\nAnd uh I'm I'm gonna do it all out of pocket and I'm fortunate that I can do that because you I was talking to our local\nWell but I mean it's if people do this stuff themselves rather than higher in the first guy that comes along with a pickup truck\nAnd says I'll do that for X amount you know and then they normally have to get that read that but you know I I was at the local Wal Mart earlier picking up so I you know\nRunning and grab some stuff get out and I was talking to one of the workers and I said\nYou know you guys are still open six in the morning till ten at night and I if I got to go in and get away on an oil filter I like to go in at three in the morning when there's nobody there ... get out right and ... and ... you know we're still still under staffed because so many of the people that work at Walmart\nCompletely lost their homes and I um I didn't know it was that bad right here I knew it was you know I can see it's moving if you drive through this area right now right you will be on every\nThe sides of every street is still piled with debris ... if you're a\nWhere the houses are being good at it you know where the trees are bank a cut a pilot on roads and all that stuff but you know and it is responsible to evacuate when you were told to is a threat is there this is the first time I've ever evacuated for a storm\nAnd felt bad doing it couldn't wait to get back almost almost\nTurned around at the Georgia State line and came back but my granddaughter wanted me to go stay with her you know in that area issued or read about me or I left came back and\nDo the only good thing about it is when I came back I was able to bring things that people asked for because everything was shut down ... right\nYou know I've been through super typhoons in the Philippines spoken alec places like that where you don't to evacuate because the government who's who you're therefore says we're not going anywhere in fact we're going to go out and take care of the people who need our help during the storm ... so it's you know it's not an irresponsible act to not always leave now I\nLive on that not ... it up into this with other countries of course that's a different circumstance ... and the like in this country as a general rule they won't ask you to evacuate unless it's a pretty good reason to do so I'm I'm certainly\nA happy for you David you have the both the personal financial wherewithal and the knowledge to do your own rebuilding\nBut I don't think that's an option available for a lot of people unfortunately one eight six six by boat jumbo is our number on the ... and the more of a viewer tales of the moment\n\nUm north Myrtle Beach and um\nWe boarded up the house and we stay in because she didn't have to work that day but she had to stay close mhm sure and we went through ...\nAnd it was it it was neat because being a just her getting
