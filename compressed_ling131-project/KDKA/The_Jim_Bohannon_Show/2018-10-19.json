notoriety\nShe made me it was always hard to imagine that ... that it'll help the rappers career\nThat's kind of what I'm going into but er I ... I Can't help but wonder you know I you know all the comments that Donald made after he said that about how great he was a very smart man and they all he could eat welcome there anytime\nA what would what would you know that being said don't really think that what would the instead of calling you got up there and told him what our or about holy was all this other stuff but he's still be a great man and you know well\nI think we we I think we know our president well enough to know now that no the the president will lay on the heavy\nHeavy uh compliments if he liked what you say and heavy uh complaints if you don't so no I I think this you've used fairly of Andrew drone question there David no obviously a a ... west said had everything to do with what the president had to say in response ah Charlie in Manhattan, Kansas and the good evening Charlie welcome\nA surge jumbo how're you doing I'm well sir thank you\nWell you know a lot of people in this country I ran into him all the time I'm back here\nAre you doing I'm well sir thank you\nWell you know a lot of people in this country I ran into him all the time going back to your age maybe a little over ...\nPeople don't know how to critically think I mean let somebody else to sink in for him in a ... one day I heard the U.S or on the Internet today Eric sold it for ex President Carter\nWas a great thing because he said that Kavanaugh was not\nA fifth because of the layout burst and they wait conducted themselves his performance in ah the hearings boy you know a he or I don't know it was ... a court room with a capital than in all the\nDecisions he made out of the you know using one thing you see what I mean\nHe is using one thing and and again I'm I'm curious how Jimmy Carter would react if such charges have been thrown at him I've interviewed Carter's though I don't even have to to ask that rhetorical question I Know how we would react\nHe would react very intensely would probably out Kevin Cavanaugh in that regard not to mention a although we we should in this context\nThe cabinet wrote an apology that appeared in the op ed pages of the wall Street Journal saying that if he went overboard that he apologized for that so yeah I I can I must say I I put Jimmy Carter and the category of ah\nWho cares quite frankly I don't I consider him a has been to some extent never was and he was a better ex president than the president so yeah I see what you're saying and I I appreciate the your thoughts are Charlie thank you very much for that Pam in Sioux City Iowa good evening them\nHey I just want to tell you listen to your show all the time on my way home from work and like car I'm actually calling you from my car\nOn that I\nI think what the kind of a west and the cello slashed scale and\nI'm an independent I'm not ... I'm not a Republican and I am an independent game and I think I don't think it's that they want to they're trying to tell people what to do I think their point is they have millions of followers\nAnd they just want to let their followers and know how they feel I don't think they're trying to tell them how the how about I just think that um they just again they just have millions of followers\nOh they do that and I and I'm sure that you're correct I mean the problem I have is merely the fact that there are a lot of people who may very well formed an opinion based on what some celebrity says and then that's the part with which I differ\nOr that they both have the right to speak out of without question without question are great\nGreat great but I it again and like I said I like I I really respect you I listen to your show a lot and again I think that I think they're just trying to reach all their followers and just trying to get them bowed out there now\nThat that ... in which case ...
