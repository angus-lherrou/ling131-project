interested in Russia and the fact that uh they have such an incredible ability to punch above their weight in creating this trip around the world you know you think about people think about Russia I think still some of the Soviet terrorists but while Russia has the largest country in the world that only has\nAn economy around the size of Texas says and they don't really have much ability to project power economically because of that reason I mean they do a lot of need that for resources that are having navy they can protect protect power particularly but they have an incredible way\nOf I'm just looking around to other people's business it's it's it's in a way it's almost that in mission by Russia that they\nCan't do better so they're going to see if they can make everybody else do worse and it's a very difficult opponent to deal with because they're not really looking to win anything they're just looking to make you lose\nAnd of course with all of this is a the relative

mean nobody's going to push back against him in Russia\nYou know and and something else about the the real Russian President Vladimir ... he has an incredible nostalgia for the evil empire somebody said is is a quote for attribution from Vladimir ... boot and\nThat could be that the most tragic thing that happened in the twentieth century and I think about that the most tragic thing that happened in the twentieth century which was Laden with super tragic items was the fall of the Soviet Union\nMost civilized people would put the fall of the Soviet Union at least in the top three of
