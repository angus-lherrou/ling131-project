they'll well they'll treat yourself you know treat others I treat yourself\nThat would be great if in fact we get people to do that but that doesn't alter the fact that there are many people who will simply laugh at that and go ahead and attack people anyway [noise] and uh I don't think that that I'll be the need for hardening of targets I'd I'd love to live in such an ideal make believe world David but I don't think we do Bruce\nI Know Jim I agree as well listen if that were an option or if that were a particular approach or if that had worked in the past we wouldn't be talking about this today\nAnd I'm happy to say yes indeed let's do all we can in that direction just don't consider it a panacea\n... ... I Would do too I I Would to David's point also say this is that um\nI have spoken to some congregations are her from congregations that say\nEven if they the option of an armed guard were were viable for them which in many cases it is some of them have very been very clear and expressing to me the fact that they don't want to do that they don't want to worship with\n'em an armed guard it almost gives them the feeling that they've ... related to terrorism or terrorism or the threat is driving in clearly that's an option you know clearly that is an option that's what they've chosen I also want to be clear is I'm not suggesting by any sense of the the the imagination and into your first point Jim\nHardening every target is neither possible nor practical there's a men's cost there are I Am saying that within the confines of the or the options that you have it is certainly preferred to do that then it is to station the armed guards if if if David so concerned about\nThe image of the ... you know philosophy that it gives of of having a a an an armed guard there are a hardened target you know put the overlay of a hardened target in an armed guard there I'm suggesting of\nAll of them heartening that target before you put a guard there at least seeks to dissuade or deter or to protect from those that are inside there so\nUh you know one of the spectrum of things I'm not I'm not suggesting we go to this I think to the degree that David saying the other thing is is is we we we have heart in targets every everywhere it's just the terminology we'd go to the courthouse ... you know you're the courthouses oftentimes protected that's a form of art and target\n... when you fly from point a to point B you go through TSA checkpoint there's a lot of scene and unseen things that

right\nUh suffice it to say that uh\nThere are there are things that you can do out there and there's not a case of somebody throwing up your hands and uh and say do nothing nor is is the notion of trying to instill good will and people a bad idea but it is certainly no panacea of people who engage in such activities are pretty much beyond that level of persuasion although\nObviously trying to reach people in their formative years was obviously something else to pursue\nAll of them of things do consider and stay\nOn the line Bruce we will speak briefly off air Bruce Alexander is the president of security one solutions we'll be back in the moment there's only\nBut the part I Would think I guess for the left would would come in to criticize him would be the uh the ad he gay views that he expresses does the laptop and have any principles left at all\nWell there are some on the left who don't have any principles there many of course you do have principles and there are some on the extreme right or don't have parents who goes what when Vince like Pittsburgh occur but first instinct\nFor parties and politicians is to try to get some partisan advantage from it people jump on it immediately and blame their political opponents and you know I think we have to\nFocus on the fact that we've had these kinds of shootings 'em all over the world from many many years now and your earlier guest made some very important points about our targets and all that\nYou know in Israel when new synagogues or a new public buildings are built they built by security experts\nAnd they're built with security in mind it's harder to do that to old buildings\nBut today in Europe you can't go to a synagogue um without going through multiple ... metal detectors I went to a synagogue in Madrid a couple of years ago you couldn't go unless you a made an appointment in advance went to the synagogue the day before showed your passport had it checked\nAnd you had an appointment as to when you could come I wanted nine thirty in the morning and my wife and I were allowed in and we when we tried to leave a little early this and I you know I don't usually stay for the whole service um they wouldn't let us\nThey said number no once you're in the building you have to stay and then when we laugh they made us leave two at a time and walk into different directions so you know synagogues or
