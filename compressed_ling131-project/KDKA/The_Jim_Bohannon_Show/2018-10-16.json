defense intelligence agency and the national Intelligence Council\nHis previous book is defeating jihad the winnable war and a one eight six six five oh jumbo is our number\nDr ... you take note of the idea that there are two spectrums of any allergy objective truth and subjective truth I Would contend that wild that indeed maybe put forward out there in this world of ours that subject the truth is an oxymoron your thoughts\nYes absolutely totally I I think it was incredibly telling a though if you're caught this and the Kavanaugh hearing the Democrats said at the starting with Cory Booker a used the phrase a truth\nWhen talking about the test Monday from Dr fold buddies so telling her truth\nThere's no such thing as her truth either the truth or there isn't true so yes this is\nThis is all you get this is posed modernism this is the the the construction of the left and the twentieth century whereby there is a denial of objective truth so yes the\nPolitics to be divided into two groups those who believe there is one truth and those that believe everything is relative ... those that believe that everything is relative um they they create the atrocities of the twentieth and twenty first century\nBut what if I put forward a subjective truth that says that ah every single member of the Democratic party is actually a communist and they are out to destroy the United states I mean I don't have to subscribe to that view although I Would concede that in many cases they are\nCertainly pushing policies in that direction but what I just said I wouldn't subscribe do but how would a believer in subjective truth telling me that my subjective truth was wrong but there's there's right\nWell you know the best they they'd have to fall into their own trap there'd be no way if they if you believe in the concept of subjective truthful multiple truth there'd be no way for them categorically to deny your accusations so this is this\nAny allergy or in Islam is there really a distinction\nWell it depends I mean there's there's the theories\nAs the theology and then there's the practice so the question is what what is the practice if if it's a Muslim who's living in America\nA I'm On the behaving in accordance with the U.S constitution then there's no problem if it's a country as such as Bangladesh show or elsewhere\n... becomes the legal system where shall real

these things fall by the wayside so\nYou know blanket statements or a dangerous in this case because we have Muslim allies Jordan is one of our closest as allies that he's a Muslim state but we have to be specific about the context in which country an who we are actually talking about and\nUh one thing that has bothered me a great deal about where this country finds itself today\nWith the people on the left are pushing harder and harder or to outright a call for socialism I suppose in a way it's an improvement\nThat uh you have people on the left who uh or at least are saying openly what I always suspected they were thinking over the years and that is the socialism is the path to go I Do think that they overstretched overreached I should say in that regard or is that the term socialism no longer a four letter word in this country\n[noise] yeah it's a very good question I I Am disturbed that in the upcoming midterms\nFor the of the Democrat Party candidates have\nOpenly labeled themselves the socialists\nOr in a recent poll by the victims of communism foundation more than forty two percent of American millennials said that they would like to live in a socialist or communist America\nThis is incredibly disturbing if you look at the fact that in the last hundred years more than a hundred million people were killed in the name of socialism communism so\nYeah I think the Democratic party all the radicals who have taken over the Democrat Party\nHave managed to socialize this word and make it more acceptable than it ever was before\nAnd as we go to a call here I just have to add this it it it seems to me that what we are getting is\nNothing more than we should have expected we have for about two generations\nAdvocated control of the education of our young people to people especially if the collegiate faculty level in many cases have\nAn absolute axe to grind and very anti American ideology who are less and less likely to try to even hide that fact now\nAt a private school it's probably difficult to do a lot about that but in many cases we're talking about faculty\nWho are paid out of state tax dollars and why the chancellor and presidents of these universities have not been called before the education committees of every state legislature in America and demanded to know why such and such and such and such is inspired if they want to see another penny of state tax dollars is beyond me\n... I I couldn't agree more are we abdicated the schools the high schools and colleges\nStarting in the Nineteen seventies and that's where we are today so if you want to understand how somebody as a as as as dangerous as Bernie Saunders becomes popular in America it's because we allow the educational system to be taken over by the ...\nThat's my parents' trust blink blinked video cameras are motion activated so placing them around your home is like having ice everywhere\nBlink cameras or wire free set up in minutes and run onto devil batteries last up to two years Bree in technology\nPut a blink camera on your front porch to spy package sleeves and wonder alerts you if a stranger is working round your yard\nAnd parents love blinks live feed auction electric checking from anywhere using your blink smartphone app\nSo you'll know when your kids get home from school\nBlink cameras systems are back in stock and right now they're Fifteen Percent off that's right Fifteen Percent off all security cameras visit blink protected dot com slash radio for offer details that's blink protected dot com slash radio like as an Amazon company limited time offered terms and conditions applied\nThough ha ha ha from science news I'm Katie AA radio\nThe news on the hour sponsored by progressive insurance\nMind Pam cold turkey complications in non Hodgkin's lymphoma had claimed a license cats\nGiant and philanthropist Paul Allen\nIt was Alan along with Bill gates who came up with the idea that led to the creation of Microsoft gates may be the name we most associate with the company but in its formation Ellen played an equally vital role in twenty fourteen and he talked about the impact as he received an honorary doctorate degree\nWho's co founding Microsoft with Bill gates in Nineteen Seventy five I feel fortunate to have seen the code rewrote and software recreated fundamentally changed the way people work play and communicate\nAlbum Microsoft in Nineteen eighty three ...

here but he's looking at solutions to health\nCare problem that has not gone away Obamacare is still on the ropes of the Republican Congress has passed session could do nothing it seems about health care and yet the problem persists and it's a very real problem for many many people Lawrence calls from champagne Illinois hello Lawrence\nGentleman I I could use it more orientation\nIt more orientation here is GTC is that sort of like a political song for candidates except you're selling ideas about health care\nWell first of all his GDP and this is a bit of time as any to have been some explain exactly what GDP advisors is\nLawrence thanks for the question always like doubting our company or we are a consulting firm we traditionally help advocate on behalf of employers\nAs well as patients and members of the healthcare system to try to navigate what is often times very confusing system to do so so our clients normally are corporations that are trying to help their employees find more cost effective ways to help navigate the system\nOr I was there anything else that you are you wanted to ask Lawrence\nThat's good I think I can make my contribution now um [noise] I basically I'm a physician by the way I basically agree health care prices are crazy high\nUh I also just bash allies in psychiatry now back in the days when I could charge thirty and thirty five and forty dollars for the ... minute our I actually made more money that way then over the years as it went higher and higher\nA I Want to\nExpress my consternation and and and lack of understanding of what on earth happen there\nAre those are days when I was very busy and I didn't pay any attention to accept doing my therapy keeping up mentally\nA medically competent and and my ordinary life but everything went off the screen and maybe you have some insights but um I Want to make a point here that once upon a time I think the medical world was more\nUh\nLike I was able to do it in the early days of my practice that people were coming in the hiring me it was their our it was their time they could talk about whatever they wanted it was my job to try to keep the ball rolling in a constructive way that was going to help them\nResolve the problems that they originally came to me for but still they were in charge in that respect I think that's different than what your gentleman we're talking about\nA yet I'm quite knowledgeable about the PBA ca and I understand the need to help corporations figure out how to uh buy health care for their employees and I'll be quiet now and listen I have another idea or two but\n... okay well let's let's get to that in the second one so stay on the line but uh your response or ...\n[noise] well there's a couple of things in when we're when a wry we've started to see that go I'll go back in the first part of your question or comment Lawrence which was you know back in the day it it seems different than it does today and let's get back in the day it was different\nUm as as we continued to monetize the healthcare system from a business perspective I'm now\n... we can actually draw very clear and close parallels to what we saw in the banking system right two thousand eight we had the banking system a consolidated into a level of what we consider to be too big to fail\nWe're seeing that same thing a ... in the healthcare system now health care systems are run by doctors any longer run by Wall Street run by businessmen\nAnd and and the challenge that we have here is that we continue to see consolidation\nUsed to use it you would have an insurance company in conflict with a hospital system or a doctor system trying to negotiate contracts and reduce the cost of health care they're no longer doing that are actually working together and working together because of the health ... as a result of the Affordable CARE Act\nThe Affordable CARE Act insurance companies are are limited on the margin of profit for the AC a at Fifteen Percent now if I'm a CFO and the c._e._o.\nOr Wall Street based organization I'm limited to a Fifteen Percent margin I Want Fifteen Percent of a million dollars or Fifteen Percent of a billion dollars\nBecause my fiduciary responsibility is to my shareholder not to the patience to buy my product and this is part of the challenge we have in the healthcare system where the finance companies ... responsibility is to the shareholder not to the consumer\nAnd so we started to see this move when I got into this business over Twenty years ago there were over twenty health insurance companies in Texas where I live today there's four\nSo as the consolidation of the market has occurred and fewer insurance companies are in the market\nAnd they've gobbled up the market share and now they're going to a hospital systems and working in a line that used to you have a doctor and network with one maybe to insurance companies now every doctors in network with almost every insurance company so this idea that insurance companies have the ability to utilize leverage to bring down the cost of health care\nIs it true at all discounts don't matter anymore prices do\nAll right uh the say the least that covers quite a bit to the thing that you would like to add to that a large\nOil or I can add and bring up the the second point or some days I think um there's something strange about a a doctor's turning over the running of hospitals to people called hospital administrators\nAre most hospital administrators have a bachelor's degree\nOr they couldn't ever get into medical school yet or doctors who are no more interest martyr actually let these people run the entire ball of wax\nNow related to that I think is the need to get these costs down hospitals are even worse than a doctor prices are they and and the\nCorals are coming up on a break here that doesn't move I Do want to hear what you have to say but we're going to have to pause to do it after these messages\nAnd when you focus on the percentage without a dollar amount tied to it again all we're going to see is a massive inflation to ensure that profits\nContinue to rise\nOne eight six six by Beau jumbo when eight six six by both five four six to six K calls in slum from a color into Iowa and a good evening Kay welcome good to have you really high\nIn care um my biggest problem like ... ... I was ... then I'm disabled I met my last after my prayer is that\nMy mom has worked for the government they are\nShe passed away and they said they ever met\nIn Washington they said do you have enough money for all their bills so they take money out of ... ... in their mother call\nWell now I well I I'm not sure exactly what what you're you're saying are using the the government take the money out of what to do watch\nSo sick Kerry\nAnd Social Security is that what you're saying Social Security\nYeah and disability and all of them that I call the\nGovernment said dad in March yeah and I are counts and therefore they Rob Peter to pay ... are\nYou are you still be talking about the practice of taking money out of the Social Security trust fund which of course has been done for a wide variety of things and in fact a lot of people think that there is a in fact an account someplace with all of that uh\nThat's like your withholding when in fact there's nothing there but in Iowa you so I'll I'll address that question with our guest the ... [noise]\nWell listen I mean yeah this is [laughter] it definitely has been the practice of the federal government for the last goodness multiple decades um to to look to move the money around and and effectively just rack up the debt let's look at the national debt right now\nA Social Security and and\nAnd even Medicare for that matter is is really insolvent if you actually look at the way it's structured now and the money that's going out while it may have cash in the coffers from a standpoint of we we the government reports that there's money to cover these things it is very true that they move money around in different ways they're borrowing against the defense\nAgainst the defense fund and a number of other things to make sure that there's enough money to pay for one thing that they've committed to and this is again going back to the always talked about in the first segment why Medicare for all a would be effectively just a massive uh the only way to do it would be to massively collect taxes and continue to borrow\nI'm with the baby boomer generation where they are with life expectancy doing what it is doing and that's the thing Medicare and Social Security we're not originally set up to be this ongoing thing Social Security was originally created\nTo ensure that the American citizen didn't outlive their retirement savings [laughter]\nRight and so but we distorted that in a way that now because of the advancements of modern medicine what you're good we're outliving the system or at least the system the way it was set up and unfortunately this is just the way that government has unfortunately operated for decades not just recently\nMore to come back in a moment\nFrom a massive cactus falling on a home here advancing on a ... we've covered it talked

I have lunch together or ride the hard together that sort of thing\nWithout is why the president yeah so that's where I live\nThat exactly I say a great deal of wisdom in that on on cue very distinct from one of the second well let me start with the second one if you will is that just to avoid that possibility of an\nUnfounded accusations if it's just me and her and the car she could say was ever a few aunts and I'm just guilty by by default in the same as as a Kavanaugh found out so painfully hadn't ... a week but the number one reason I think is that\nJust to avoid the possibility avoid that temptation of a situation I\nI you know you hear stories of guys that have gotten in trouble with a girl in the hotel room and it just always while I don't know how we got there we didn't intend for that we were just on a business trip and we just had dinner and but just for a walk to a room separately and we just ended up together\nI Would advise that kind of situation just avoid the very first step\nDown the slippery slope and don't have the dinner together don't have the business trip together or the odd situation outright\nIn but of course if you do that you have affected Lee eliminated women from a a let's say positions such as the executive assisted you can't be an executive assistant to a a corporate president without doing just that I mean you wouldn't even be effective in the role you've got to work closely with them\nAnd so right off of that you're taking a category of work which is an entry level do upper management for many people and they're essentially saying no women there I mean that that's what we're talking about\nThis and in that sense it is a an unfortunate unintended I'm sure side effect of the me too movement is that guy is just have to be extra cautious\nTo avoid this type of situation arising\n[noise] it it does so seem I must I must confess thank you for your thoughts cliff to John and Susan bill California the banana Joe hello\n[laughter] I Can't believe I'm On I ...

and we'll check back in the moment\nCould the me too movement lead eventually to not her hashtags not her I'm not opposed to women in the workplace but I Can't hire one as I say now that certainly is not what any of this was intended to become\nAnd it is and what I Would call a constructive policy on the other hand uh since I don't hire and fire people uh I can see where they will be coming from\nIt or it would nobody even somebody chose to go ahead and hire a woman in in one of these circumstances nobody could say that they weren't at least filled with a certain amount of trepidation\nYes I've hired this woman she's very good a perfect as an executive assistant it will require of course that we will occasionally have dinner together we will occasionally traveled together\nAnd and you could not in all honesty say and that doesn't bother me in the least inland leisure just rather naive I mean it it would have to at least occurred to you\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six often I pose questions here in which I have what I consider to be an answer\nAnd ah I don't in this particular case I don't think that certainly

on the exact specific suffice it to say going forward would lay you open to any number of possible charges\nAre the best rule of thumb is always no means no that's certainly true and I'm not sure that uh that everybody in this country grew up with that with that viewpoint but that obviously is the lesson for today\nYes and I agree with you on that but I'm just talking the reality that when you got young kids out there in poverty situations that sort of buying a certain things\nHappen like that that goes so far and if the person uh does not wall that goes so far as I say I don't ... it and if the other person keeps pursuant to hand they crossed the line\nExactly and I I think that everybody pretty much agrees that that's that's the case yeah\nBut you can't come back years and years later and say it put his hand on my you know my thought\nWell you you can say it but I mean it ... either he uh he did a ... and and I think he the king of course you see the key the key is at what point do you said she said no I mean if you say you know if you were moving forward in an already put your hand on her by\nJihad and said no yet then or\nThe Mets that's not a a sexual assault as far as I'm concerned until she says no it is consensual I Would say by definition women have got to speak up and if they don't then they can make your case now once they do the Mets the line but I mean\nI've got you know is it better when I was trying to come up with you getting those heavy pet the I'll use a old\nFamily work that I Am yes we all know the wire is okay\nAnd and things happen but if if the girl
