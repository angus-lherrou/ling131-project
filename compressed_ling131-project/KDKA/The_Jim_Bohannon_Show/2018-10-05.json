screwed is\nThat's right because it was held for the Republican\nNo was otherwise it would be one of the most brilliant wrong was helpful\nBecause this bad got in and also the the whole notion that if

where the uh the prime minister couldn't can suddenly said well let's have an election\nRight but it's still whoever gets the most votes so when my falling good right now let's throw in all I agree

Madonna\nThe godfather of a political now says I'm his most recent polling it it's been pretty consistent with moon bird\nOr an ... an other polls ... up by Seventeen a and a ... by Eighteen and I guess and less I in fact I like it would take the scandal both scandals with iron clad proof of a scandal or for those numbers\nDo ... to switch enough in one month which is hard to believe it's only a month wait this point I'm\nFor that to occur and these numbers come from Terry Madonna of Franklin and Marshall College [noise]\nAnd they are consistent with other\nEven\n[noise] [noise] I'm\nVery sleazy played this song and not like a McDonald's [laughter] oh that would have been really shift a method that Hussein was like a virgin or something yeah [noise]\nNow that's a ... left the Brett Kavanaugh son that's my point when we talk about very Kevin is because you know he was a virgin until he was forty six or something [noise] that's why it's that's proof that he's not a sexual predator\nThat he's not a sexual predator because he was a version\n\nOf a [noise]\nBut anyway I guess might be on this [noise] how the hell can this commonwealth why Donald Trump won the state of Pennsylvania because he got the most votes [laughter] ... [laughter] so\nHow is KC and move this far ahead in the state narrowly mind you but right one by the president ...\n... ... when Wolff one of the election it was an incredible election year four years ago that wolf one reading incompetent never happened before in Pennsylvania\nAh that's right because it was always Democrat two terms or two terms that was a pattern forever right\nWhat back to I mean before the constitutional convention sixty eight you could only serve one Charles okay okay but it's happened since they made a few terms yes the two things were amazing it is is that the lieutenant governor last this time that's never happened before an incumbent lieutenant governor losing a a primary\nThat they're losing ... the guy that he was abusing his staff and there was a scandal right\nUm although it's funny when a kid that scandal compared to others ... wasn't that big a deal OK mean Arlen\nSpecter subtle lost re election for how many west towards outfit that were the case you know lots of senators are pretty mean to their staff Ted Kennedy God rest his soul and John McCain and\nBarbara Barbara Boxer I've heard and others but who gets um but in that election werewolf won the three state row offices or attorney general auditor general treasure all one but the legislature went more conservative in more Republican than it had in a hundred years is that it was incredible\nIs that also gerrymandering I Know we're talking about state district ... congressional\nDistrict not quite as bad I'm going but ... and the Democrats you know or ... yeah with a dead end as well I mean they had to vote for those uh but\nNow and yeah so that the Democrats had been in power they would have had district where I wrote the Democrats are now but yeah it wasn't as absurdly gerrymandered district congressional districts were\nUm put one okay so there's another fairy tale dichotomy which is a nonsensical phrase meant to just say how the hell do you explain it\nRight or what I always called active voting clearly people weren't just pulling one lover or they weren't going in there and write because of that where the case and\nBob I'm Bob I'm good heavens Tom corporate rather would have won reelection yeah if people pulled one letter 'cause they clearly voted for Republicans\nAnd a lot of areas that didn't don't normally vote Republican uh as Fayette County for instance has all Republican legislators except for a little twist in one corner Pam Snyder who is actually from green county um but it was it was a very strange election year\nWe must break we'll be back with Mr salsa and momentarily say with as long as you're\nThe you're the junior senator and the senior center is an icon you're going to write it's going to have an email now a\nMassachusetts was different Ted Kennedy obviously ruled the roost up there but John I'm Kerry\nGuts that is true and those national headlines with the Vietnam vet right when he when I can tell anything back in the day so yeah\nWhich is hard to really how long ago that was an Kennedy was in the Senate at that time [laughter] when you\nHave you seen John Kerry out on the on the book tour now he's got a book he's talking\nYeah I I I read ... and some where I was able to pull up some of it on line I think it I guess it was legit um what do you mean like I don't I I I guess it was officially released it didn't seem to be his website\nI it's it's out while he was on a Brian Williams right oh I Know what I'm saying I I remember reading part of it\nIt was good for me to see him again I always liked him outside and and even temperament was a smart guy I always felt sorry for him that he was swift voted out of the election that they made a war hero into a coward or with a bunch\nOf ... ... ... ... ... when you say something like and if you're not that bright you can go to Iran and member of Iraq memory made that comment about it people if you don't\nKnow that was a gaffe but I have yet to be the politician who doesn't make a gap and I don't think that's what put him over the edge I think you know what it how about his character based on a\nWing hit a campaign which is very effective that's what they do\nAnd that's what the Democrats different [laughter] the bride when he's better at it Democrats are better at it I think it attack I'm not attack ads 'cause everybody's got good attack ad radical but like at spreading innuendo endlessly well like the birther thing millions at any it's actually believe that it was obviously nonsense in the beginning but that's how good they are\nAt any rate um [noise] that blew away so what do you think of the aisle getting blew away so I actually thought I understand it's all about winning for both parties right now and the system is broken and blah blah blah and we're all in our part is in little areas blah blah blah I get all that\nI really do think Kevin uh this is just a personal opinion exhibited a lack of judicial temperament in his crazy testimony and also I think he clearly did lie as as insignificant as these lies are like what's the devil's triangle it's a drinking game no it's not it's when two men had sex with a woman\nWhat's boosting its flatulence no it's not it meant a anal sex back in time at least for everything I've read on the inner too hot so they know does it matter you know no I mean he could still be a good judging lie about that stuff but [noise]\nAbout that stuff but I don't know lying under oath doesn't even matter anymore at least Clinton actually got busted for lying under oath and has a beach because I lost his legal is a lot of law and that right it was a spend it I don't know if you've ever got it back but yeah\nI did we did so what I mean is lying under oath mattered back then and I and I didn't like it 'cause I thought who's going to tell the truth about having an affair with when you're Hillary's your wife not me lying under oath\nBut not that I think he he caught hell whether he lied under oath or not right I understand mental or not yet\nBut you know what I mean I Can't really defend it but I enjoy it like\nHe was asked if he had been calm and measured in his testimony that day he'd been criticized for being so uncaring you couldn't even be an emotional\nHas your own argument whenever somebody attack somebody for what they did you're like well if they'd been the opposite it would have been banned Jay Leno wouldn't have been though just because you say that that's not true which my opinion it's not true I don't know if it's simply not true because why would you attack anybody for having and even temperament\n'cause they've attacked the president for not being emotional enough about things maybe maybe that was the craze for a while that he didn't he wasn't caring and somehow they were reading his mind has no empathy empathy there yes none he doesn't get 'em out they couldn't get anybody brain and wonder if it is obvious\nYou up to watch the guy operate like obvious we're going to have this discussion are at a buddy name but don't you think he lied under oath\nI don't know if he lied under oath when it comes to those those silly ... terms which I've never heard of\nNo I had never even heard of them either I I also had to maybe there are more than wind up drinking game there's no drinking game called the devil's triangle [laughter] I don't know it doesn't say it maybe wasn't the day I have no idea oh and now his roommate says he came home drunk all the time but he was doing and don't get me wrong\nI I'm sure I was I don't think I was quite the drinker that Brett Kavanaugh was in college but I'm sure I did more than my fair share ... and uh I didn't really drink that much in high school but I did evil drugs so if I'm not casting is present on them for doing it but he lied under oath about that\nUp according to that one guy\nAnd and the others but why why resume because he was his roommate [laughter]\nOkay well maybe the roommates line I mean yes I mean he's telling the truth and and who didn't go to college and have ruined him home drunk caught the guy is a drunken frat boy from central casting and his name is Brett Kavanaugh how easy is that to believe that he was a big let\nAlone and he said he got in the hard way he was a legacy his dad was a yelling although I don't think that matters if he lied about that interest in really lie about that he just exaggerated his pull themselves up by the bootstraps ... his name is Brett Kavanaugh it's\nA shame he looks guilty that what this does now for women who who may have been attacked in may and and the way forward may have been attacked by someone it's entirely possible and Kavanaugh said that himself but the first time have if you're going to come forward\nYou you just you got to have your ducks in a row and ... and frankly I the fact that her letter was leaked to the media and of course nobody knows it has\nTo relevant it's bad politics or mean politics evil politics dirty double dealing but it's either happened to her it didn't bother sexual assault and ...\nAnd Feinstein hasn't help yourself through it um when it was it was very interesting it was the last hour the actual final hearing when Ted Cruz of Texas said did you leak this memo Senator Feinstein and she said no I said what about your staff she goes I don't know I didn't ask them\nAnd then she did ask them and they said when she turned around and said oh yeah I just ask\nThem well I Hope that if she had a staff like we had they wouldn't have fit in that conference or not hearing but she's taking her chief of staff word for it that she I I just ask you I said the chief of staff did interrogated there how I interpreted it but it was amazing that what that was\nIt was amazing that would that was a response so I didn't know she just told me I did ask them I thought I totally honest so it just she wasn't handled well I was shocked when she had that in that was her answer to it and then her comments\nToday that it that this was a a a sham of a of a report that was a limited by the White House I don't know it\nWas limited by Don McGahn the White House counsel he directed the effect of oil you interview these signs\nI admit said that and then ... late backpedaling said I don't know\nWhy she said that all the news reports indicate McGahn was

in the\n... the first six times the FBI miss that he was a drug and sexual assault there's a lot of the ... [noise]\nI don't think being a bit drinking in college should keep you out of out of the you\nKnow by lying about drinking in college under oath maybe a combined with the other allies\nWell he did meant he did not lie he said he drank\nWe say like beer but he said he didn't ever get blackout drunk and his roommate claims otherwise but what if I made the ... yeah All right well more sudden with

Indiana good evening RG\nFind you know I I yeah but after I ended up but a mild heart and the newspaper business and not try to get in on a pool on the election results up air\nFigured that maybe a couple of bucks out of the election at it turns out nobody is giving any uh whatsoever on Mr ...\nMinutes Joe Donnelly for those who don't know he is the Democratic senator from Indiana and uh again that of course the state you carried by heavily by by President Trump uh that's that's interesting that that you couldn't even or even get a any takers on that I I find that remarkable\nUsually usually somebody will take it at least as a joke President Trump was out here about two weeks ago mhm and lab was deporting of course and Republican candidate so uh it looks like he's right on the very edge and if he was no I'd say he's gone\nWell it'll be very interesting to see how are the votes of these senators from uh from questionable states in fact a a a will affect their their election outcome as I say I I think Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota\nHas filled in a way almost liberated because she's trailing so badly that I think that all she wants to the cabinet position in a democratic administration I knew I Would suspect that uh that she probably cannot rescue that seat in North Dakota\nDown now thirty for an down thirty points since the six o'clock news tonight I understand\n[noise] ah ... vice it to say that ah that does not look good the Donnelly again not out of the question or a McCaskill in Missouri not out of the question remains to be seen more to come and one eight six six by boat jumbo in a moment\n[noise]\nWhich would be broken by vice president Pence is tie breaker that's in the constitution of the event of a tie vote in the Senate the tire bought outlook for ... the vice president of the United states\nHowever they lose two then it becomes fifty one to forty nine against Kavanaugh there is no tie breaker and cabinet loses so I I have heard that that also said no they cannot lose two you're you're absolutely correct or their their stupidity year but it's not yours Steve\nThere that was owned a nice break a at two and a half hour\nWell again the we don't provide the news on the half hour those come ... no no I'm\nNot saying that but but a lot to say that that we're losing the wall and because of a wedding\nUh so that makes it\nYou know a lot more closer [laughter] [noise] uh we didn't need to lose won you know for for any reason but uh I mean I can I guess I can understand the flamboyant or\nOr something of is important I think I Would say that my daughter I Hope you under ...\nMy daughter I Hope you understand is the daughter of a senator the importance of this the boat has come up this way we can move the wedding to Sunday but if we lose this vote it will affect the entire country I've heard people say just what you just said and in my eyes would we do\nKnow that that's more important I mean it is not like your your daughter is not going to get married let her get married tomorrow or are they in this case if you're talking about senator able to get married Sunday\nUh\nHe does say that he will attend the his daughter's wedding in Montana\nAnd uh uh\nThis is an interesting thing right here though there's been an unusual late night phone call in which a senator Danes of Montana Heidi Heitkamp colleague call Kavanaugh and personally assured him that he has made arrangements to be there to get him across the finish line as needed\nSo uh for for whatever that's worth a I I guess he's found a way around this so that that's the short answer on that one that he has a he has promised cabinet if he needed he will be there so\nAgain a law that makes me feel better it left me feel better too I got to tell you Steve a I had been the bothered about that and I just reached checked the wires here and ah\nThe GOP could hold the session opened by the overnight and allow Danes to vote on Sunday if needed to be\nA a whether or not the cabinet or a\nA\nA whether or not decades promised to cabinet means he would appear for hypothetical Sunday's vote is not clear but the GOP could hold the session open overnight\nThat could happen so technically uh in the in the Senate parlance that would mean that a Saturday would be a Sunday will be redefined the Saturday or they could do that and and I'll guarantee you if it came down to the point where let's say it is a\nIt is fifty to forty nine against Kavanaugh okay\nAh I'll guarantee you that is what the Republicans will do and then the Danes will fly and quickly make it a fifty fifty tie and then Pence would gas to tie breaker so that clarifies that for me I I had been the most curious as to how how bad could happen and apparently that's that's the circumstance that day ... of\nOf Montana will be there for Kavanaugh if needed we'll be back in just a moment technology truth to money like fruit\nYou have fourteen logging passwords and
