what struck what you're struggling with\nIt's a little different than a talk show where we're going to call in and just kind of talk about the world we're\nActually trying to get you whatever kind of support that you need is one of the beautiful things that Katie K offers when we sat down together when I sat down with Katie Katie and said look let's put together a show the really genuinely helps\nThe listening audience to anybody that's struggling to call in because we're all going through so much there's so many people who are going through so much a lotta times takes courage\nCourage to look at our lives and own up to the issues that we're struggling with a lot of times\nTo be able to say look yes the world is messed up the world is struggling okay but what about you how are you struggling what are you doing that you think well wait a minute I think I could use some insight around us\nSo my PHD is encounter education and supervision supervision here's what supervision as it's being able to step outside and see what's going on so in the field of counseling supervisors would watch counselors\nHave their sessions and then we would give the counselors feedback on how they could be a little more effective in whatever they're doing so we constantly would learn\nNow not only was their supervision for cancers but there was even supervision for supervisors in other words we can all grow we can all look at our lives and say there's more to learn there's more\nFor me to see how can I Do this differently in every speech I've ever given every class at ever taught I'm always walked away saying\nWhat did I Do effectively what did I Do that was in effect of\nAnd what can I Do a little bit more effectively next time\nLooking every relationship ... wherever it is right now with your children with their grandchildren with your husband with your wife\nWith your relatives with your friends with your connections whoever it is there's always a role that you play oftentimes we think it's all them if there's something going wrong in our family our first instinct is to say it's them it's other people\nBut if we stop and we look we realized look I Can't change other people I can only ever change myself\nAgain when we think about the world when we think about this is a world that we live in together so what can we do to contribute to this world together\nSo I'm going to go to the dollar bank instant access and read an email from Sam and Simon Says hello I have an anger problem and I don't know how to manage it\nAnd I would like advice in life I was abused as a child and I can't let certain things go and I feel like I'm living in the shadow of my own demons that's a very powerful line Simon the shadow of my own demons or look\nI'm really genuinely and I I Wish I could convey it through the airwaves\nLike how much I feel for you for what you've gone through to be able to express I was abused as a child I get so it's so difficult to watch\nChildren be abuses so difficult to hear about even to hear about years later children being abused anyone out there who's a parent\nWho's ever looked at church child you know that when we see our children we see that pure innocence and for them to have to go through abuse it's just not okay it's not OK\nAnd Simon ... whatever you went through you went through and here's something that I've found to be true\nLook I I think about this in terms of my navigation systems either navigation system we all do if you have a smartphone users stocks theory if you got the apple or I don't know if a series on a bunch of other stuff but you ask her hey your phone can you give me directions to such and such place now this is interesting because if I make a wrong turn\nMy navigation system doesn't kick on and say hey you're an idiot I Can't believe you did that [laughter] my navigation system says okay from where you are right now now how do we get to where you want to go\nMy navigation system doesn't say five minutes in the minute drive I hey I still want to talk about that a wrong turn you made back there my navigation system completely takes me from this moment forward\nIn life we can't get to pass\nWe can't get the past back we cannot and we've all gone through things we have all gone through things different things and I don't believe any of us\nCan never truly genuinely understand each other\nAs I might have mentioned this on the air last week I might have mentioned on one of my pod cast but I was doing a group with a young adult offenders in prison and there's a girl I was a a under Eighteen and she said to me she said\nI don't understand how you can identify with us or know what we're going through and I said you know what I Can't I have never been in your shoes\nBut I honestly believe after Twenty years and working with thousands of people all over the world that I don't understand anyone the only thing I can do is I can be here to listen I can be here with you and you can teach me about you\nBecause I'm not sure any of us truly ever understands each other we just can't see into each other's world there's always a part of us that's unique\nSo Simon there are things that you went through that none of us will ever be able to see none of us will ever be able to identify with exactly ... exactly what you went through\nBut there's something else it's the past tens of the word went so you see other word go going it's when you already went through it now the question is will you continue to carry it into your future\nWill you recalculate\nHolding on to that passed or were you recalculate from this moment forward letting that past go\nAnd sometimes people say well it's hard it's hard to let go of this anger how am I supposed to let go of this anger I watched because a lot of times we identify with that anger this is what this is your for lack of a better word your crutch to get you through the day this is what I Know I Know to be angry I Know to be upset I Know to say I had a a a difficult time\nBut the reason why I'm so passionate about not having you dwell in what happened in the past\nIs because I Believe so much in the human spirit I Believe in empowering people to make it through look you have survived Simon every single thing you've ever gone through you have so no matter how bad that was you made it through\nAnd look whoever out there all the listeners out there you might be going through something that you need to make it through and you want to talk it out and it's this and that's it takes courage to talk things out\nBut if you're struggling with something and you want to talk it out you want to figure out how do I do this the number to call his eight six six three nine one ten twenty or dollar bank instant access the KKK radio

bank instant access to Katie KIA radio dot com or you can text and eight six six three nine one ten twenty on the right automotive tech sign up for best deal in Pittsburgh so I really appreciated Janice having the courage to say\nLet me stick with us at first she said let me just learn about what is this adult ADHD and let me just hear about that or how can we get my boyfriend help\nBut ultimately she came around and I think this is really truly amazing I so I really I Can't say enough about that just came back to saying what can I Do definitely and that's ultimately what all of us can do look one of the things that is a a a symptom that occurs with\nAdult attention deficit disorder attention deficit hyperactivity disorder neither one we find that there is a low frustration tolerance so that's a really fancy term but here's what that means that means\nSomebody can get really angry really quickly and anger can seem this proportion it to what's actually occurring\nYou can see mood swings you can see a difficulty organizing things you can see chronic boredom you can see anxiety and depression when you're struggling with adult\nADHD it looks a lot like\nSame things that happens with children we also would add lower self esteem there are things when we put all the words to it but ultimately comes down to a struggle with being able to stay focused there isn't it\nYeah because your case is unique no matter what you're struggling with your case is unique or who you know that is unique what they're going through and that's why they're professionals era that's why there are mental health clinics that's why you go to your primary care physician and say this is what I'm struggling with I Need some help around this\nBut let's come back to low frustration tolerance because\nWhen I look at\nSocial media today when I look at the media today I see low frustration tolerance all over the place\nI see people getting really upset really heated really quickly and it seems really disproportionate\nTo what's actually going on and that's why I said again I Believe there is an anger target\nI think we have an anger target we want to find something to be angry and we just allow ourselves to go out and that's why oftentimes family is who you take out your anger on because you take out your anger on who is closest to you so you can suppress at all day when you're dealing with others you could put on a face but then when\nWhen you really let go and you say it's OK I'm giving myself permission\nTo be impulsive and be angry and lash out\nAnd once you give yourself permission then you go ahead and do it because you've created it's almost like you draw a line in the sand except you just keep extending it you draw that line around your family and you say okay well I'm here with them I feel safe I don't feel like I'm going to push them away too much so I'm going to go ahead and let them have it\nBut what if we stepped it up for our family for our closest loved ones what if we step that up for the people around us as much as we step it up for strangers in other words what if we put effort into whatever we're doing\nSo we encounter people who are struggling with\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD or attention deficit disorder or bipolar disorder or depression or anxiety we encounter people and instead of saying look at them they're struggling with this how do I deal with this it's not so much the disorder that you're dealing with a human being\nAs a human being with obstacles it's a human being who struggling\nWith impulse control with attention or whatever it is and it comes back to you what are you doing what energy or are you bringing\nThere is a beautiful principal a precept this idea of the eternal recurrence Frederick meet she talked about it a lot what if you live the same moment over every day again and again and again and again now let's say you live the same moment over for\nEternity after about a thousand time doing something you think you might do it a little differently\nYou think if that person cut you off in traffic after about a ten thousand time that happened you might just do it a little ... you might just say you know what maybe is really not as bad as I think maybe I really don't need to be as disproportionately ... active\nTo this as I'm being\nMaybe I can handle this a little differently\nIf we can think bigger at the at the time at the very beginning of the show I said what if we were to think about this not just being your family or your car your thing but your world this is your world and if this is your world and you think about the content that you're adding to this world but if you were to step back and continue to see the bigger picture\nSo yes you might be struggling with something that makes it more difficult for you to pay attention yeah she might be struggling with something that makes you more difficult for you to\nFeel happy but just because something's difficult doesn't mean it's impossible there are things that you can do there are always things that you can do\nTo go to the dollar bank instant access and read this um I have this email that says right now I've completely read your interesting book advance techniques for counseling\nSing and psychotherapy which I've suggested to my friends to read it to thank you so much although my friends and I have some limits to use the stories the chapter three I Believe is one of the best techniques book I've seen 'til now that's very nice by the way I've had some trouble understanding the Arab language and hope you can help explain a little more for me okay I Will so I Do have a textbook\nCalled advanced techniques for counseling it's like a therapy and thank you so much for your email\nThe Arab language this ties into everything that we're talking about right now so the era of language is the mistake we make when we trigger someone's fight or flight response and we we sure their defensiveness\nSo want to pull back in the cold call we have with Janice in her boyfriend her boyfriend might do something and then she gets reactive and then when she triggers his defense of death and now goes back and forth back and forth so there are again it comes back to who can you control so there are ways to speak\nTo get around that fight or flight response to circumvent the fight or flight response there are ways to make yourself a much more peaceful space so that people feel safe enough\nTo not have to be reactive or as reactive around you you cannot control what other people do but you can control your own energy and your energy is more impactful than what you might realize I see this a lot in the prisons I Walk through the prisons and I see a lot of angry people\nAnd I don't react to that anger I don't I I'm not a reactive person I'm not going to be impulsive [noise]\nI'm just going to call my own energy down when I'm working with someone who is struggling with anxiety I don't tell them hey hurry up and call them down instead I call my own and as you down and the more I call my own energy down the more that person gets to respond in ... and\nYou can control your self not anyone else that doesn't mean that if you're struggling with a certain thing like for instance attention deficit hyperactivity disorder you you struggle something like that yes it's going to be more difficult to concentrate yes it's going to be more difficult to stay on task\nBut there's a flipside to that\nAdult ADHD also translates into highly creative people people who can\nHave a lot of energy and come up with a lot of different ideas and that's a beautiful thing so really it comes down to how we view whatever someone struggling with are we looking at it as a deficit are we looking at it as a different way to experience life\nIt's up to you hey this is the show to call in and talk about whatever you're struggling with eight six six three nine one ten twenty dollar bank Katie K radio dot com or Texas in eight six six three nine one ten twenty on the right automotive text line\nThat you have food intention of changing I Believe that you believe\nThe U.S fool intention of changing the behavioral patterns are tough to break it took a long time to\nHave a behavioral patterns could take a long time to break it\nAnd knowing that\nKnowing that I understood that when guys said hey I'm ... I'm never doing this again I'm never lashing out at somewhat I'm never going to do this or that I'm never going to lose my temper I Would say I do believe that you really do mean that you want very badly to say I'm never going to be impulsive again the problem is\nYou're not being aware that you're not able to speak for your future self you don't know what's going to come up\nSo I Do think Mary and the people make promises that they cannot deliver\nBecause they want to be a part of the group [noise] look I think that the more you understand human nature\nThe less angry you are at others for being human beings not going to be angry at someone who wants to cut me off in traffic because they're really in a big hurry and they're not thinking about others because I expect human beings to do that\nI'm not going to be angry with others when I Know that they're going to turn around and say something mean a second later because I understand that that's human beings\nAnd that might sound jaded if you only listen superficially but if you listen deeper I'm not saying human beings are all bad are always going to let you down but I Am saying to align your expectations with reality of human beings do wonderful beautiful things but they also do things\nThat are hurtful and the more you can be prepared to understand that people do that and it's not personal it's not personal just the way you have hurt people in your life\nAnd it's not personal there are so many people that you'd like to look back and say my goodness now that I see how I treated you I really kind of wish I could take that back I Wish I could do it differently I Wish I could go back and tell you it's not you it's me\nThinking about how many people that we don't even think about a lot of ways you could look at your life you could I don't know kind of visualize growing up in the sky looking down on your life and your whole life\nThinking about the times where you were walking through the store and you ignored someone or you were grouchy toward somewhat I mean toward somebody said well it's no big deal I ... I was just this I was just that but maybe that impacted that person again we minimize the pain because others we maximize the paint others cause\nAs us but what if we look back and we realized that the reason why we did the things we did ... there were reasons maybe there were reasons maybe her grouchy that particular day because you were in pain maybe we're grouchy that particular day because you were anxious and tired of being anxious and depressed and tired of being depressed\nSo there are reasons why you did what you did and just as there were reasons why you have always done the things you've done there are reasons why others do the things that they do and very rarely if ever or those reasons ever you those reasons are because of whatever people are dealing with\nSo think about if you if you were to a burn your hand on the stove and yell out in pain and wake somebody up ouch and you wake somebody up and say well\nI I didn't mean to wake you up I live in China wake you up out of my hand was just by and well the same is true and we're struggling with something you might not mean to be negative towards others maybe you're struggling with something but now let's flip that the same is true for them as well others do things like that\nBecause they're struggling Mary and people promise things they can't deliver 'cause they want so badly to deliver those things that doesn't make them wrong or bad it just means\nThat they want to be a part of that group great question we have another question from the uh\nRight automotive tax lined and says is media making people more ADD from Dan that's a great question is media making people more ADD um I really like this ah question because I think we see the media\nAnd we think we're watching well first of all let's understand what happens\nWhen we are a with a brain with when it comes to the attention and what we're looking at what we're focused on if we're bombarded with tons of stimuli all the time then are a mix a lot of the center that fight or flight response is constantly on alert looking for things to think about it with our young children if\nIf infants if if toddlers are constantly watching television and that's just going screen fast fast fast that picture\nThan their brains are constantly becoming alert to what's going on around them yes absolutely are neurological struggles\nLargely genetic but there are factors that can play a role so in other words if you take someone who's predisposed to struggling with attention\nAnd you put them in front of a television for the time they're very young and you let them watch television a ton then yeah you're probably not helping that out and just as there are things that we can do that will exacerbate\nWhat is dormant or what is there or what is ready to be built upon we can also create an environment that helps\nSupport people get through what they're dealing with so in other words we take a young child who might be predisposed to ADHD and instead of showing them tons of media tons of uh yeah tons of media tons of television set of that\nWe don't show them television we don't need to show toddlers television we instead we read to them\nWe we put peaceful music in the background we create a peaceful environment for them but I Can't do that well then we can't just have peace\nIt's just like saying to Arnold Schwarzenegger and well I Can't do your workout routine so but I still want those muscles no you have to do the workout routine\n[noise] if you want peace and your family if you want peace in your life you have to set up the environment to create that and that means if you're predisposed is struggling with certain disorders first of all definitely get the medical help get that attention for sure\nBut aside from that then the question is what can I Do from here what can I Do what you can do is fill your mind\nIt's still your mind with this much peace is possible you could put it in your mind what you want in your

show coming up after seven o'clock tonight is elder care attorney Ben hur so with the firm's Zacharias brown\nAnd Ben I Know this is not news to you you've been discussing this kind of thing but when you see these numbers are right in front of us we look at the the cost increasing sixty seven percent in recent years yeah I mean it really is frightening\nBut it's it's it's terrifying especially if you've never been in a situation and most people that come and see us have never been in the situation and most times it's it's a husband or wife where they\nUm having unforeseen medical event that happened such as a stroke or something else and the husband or wife find themselves in a nursing home and they're and they're facing a monthly bills of ten twelve thousand dollars a month\nThe average cost right now for nursing home for one month in Pennsylvania it's over ten thousand dollars it's actually ten thousand I'm forty three dollars so paying anything like that for an extended period of time\nYou're ... you're going to run out of money really quickly so how do you how do you talk to loved ones about really coming to grips with this and and and planning for it right yeah and I know what you said is exactly what needs to be done planning so and that's the proper thing to do if you are able to do it\nUm it's to do the proper estate planning you come and see us early enough um you possibly set of of course you need wells powers of attorney but one of the big things we do is set up an era vocal trust and that's one of the big things that you can replace your assets in there you complete your house in a trust 'em and essentially after the five year look back to your runs\nAnything you have a not trust has protected in any event that you are a lot more need long term care meaning\nAnd those assets are are shielded from the nursing home they're shielded from the state so that's one of the big things we do is planning\nWhat ... what about the kinds of insurance policies that are available for this kind of care yeah engine when and where should they be ... you know it can you buy them too late I I I don't know how to out out of work\nYes absolutely yeah as you were just saying your your office referencing an article from January ... worth as one of the biggest provider of long term care insurance policies in the country it's one of the ones we see most often um I always said you can afford it long term care insurance is a great thing to have\nA more and more it's becoming a extremely costly or just because people are living so much longer I I Believe I read an article recently there's more ... centenarians more people turning one hundred now than there ever happen at any other any other time in history\nWith that said that raises the costs of long term care insurance makes premiums even higher and it just makes it harder to afford for the average person\nThe other thing is that most people are having a hard enough time just saving for retirement yes let alone in thinking about if you're disabled the kinds of costs the you may end up putting on somebody else just to to care for your ... and then you'd living\nExactly yeah people are or word enough about like I said having a steady stream of income just to pay for their ... utilities or mortgage their property taxes that kind of thing when they get older in life let alone having to foot the bill of every ten thousand dollars a month\nWhich turns into over a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year that's just as we're talking about they're just something that's ... I'm impossible to afford most times for most individuals so\n... or so is worth a an old he's an elder care attorney with Jack Ryan brown and we're talking about um the skyrocketing costs of this kind of long term care in a new survey there was just released today Ben ... why does it cost\nWhy are they so huh yeah no I have people asked that all the time especially if they talked about hospital yeah I mean we see the same kind of ... when you talk about this in patient hospital knows why are they so high\nAnd that and that does have a lot to do with it and a lot of times people wonder exactly what you said why are they so hot and nursing home um it's also ... called a skilled nursing facility that essentially as a glorified hospital it it's a long term possible for people that need that level of care and that really is why why it is so expensive nursing homes are required to have attending physicians\nAre required to have nurses on staff twenty four seven and because of that that just raises the raises the price of that I basically every month because of because of the things that they have to meet its it that's really what it is is it's it's really kind of a long term hospital\nBecause of that do you find people sometimes asking\nYou about well what what if I Try to arrange for care in the home field nursing care yeah in the home that ... that and that's not cheap either I imagine so no no it's\nIt's not cheaper and cheaper than being in a nursing home and and everybody prefers to be at home I mean who doesn't want to be at home and be able to receive care in their own home which is another big thing we do as well we helped to arrange that we have an elder care coordinator that's employed by our from\nThat her very job is just to do exactly that it basically to seek out home health care agencies to come into the home and to help take care of these individuals so they can stay at home\nSo I imagine you find a lot of children are dealing ... you know trying to care for elderly parents who perhaps have not made the choice for themselves so then it falls on family members to try to make some of these decisions are apps perhaps they haven't talked about it ahead of time\nAnd a lot of times they don't and and that is a scary thing where it is most often the people we are meeting with are the are the children out for their mother or father yeah who\nSometimes they're not able to come and be with us sometimes are already in a nursing home or a personal care home and now basically as you said that the children are left I I guess to find out a way to help their parents uh afford the care that they need 'em and one of the things that is vital\nOne of the things that is vital for most individuals as not most everybody has to make sure you have the power of attorney in place an event that you find yourself in a nursing home or personal care home\nUm have power of attorney set up so that you have somebody that is able to act on your behalf if you find yourself in that situation so so you'll be talking more about this on the elder care show that comes up after the news of the topic of the hour we'll be talking all about disaster protection acid preservation what you can do how you can\nBasically protect as many assets as possible and help your family or loved ones that get the care that they need so Ben thanks for thanks for

research about a number of things but this thing jumped out at me earlier today first off welcome to Zacharias brown we've got attorneys better show in somebody knew was ... brown from Jefferson hills south hills of Pittsburgh a Pittsburgh native practicing law for many years\nAlthough she is still very young and is definitely looking forward to her career and older law she is none other than Jennifer Biddle she'll be joining Ben and just a couple of moments but you heard Ben if you were around over the last hour on the ... radio afternoon news with Joe to steal talking about long term health care average price ten thousand dollars a month\nBut I saw something earlier today actually a few days ago at their Facebook posed a Zacharias round into department of Veterans Affairs the VA as finalize new rules that make it more difficult to qualify for a long term care benefits so\nThis is a very hot topic right now so what I'm highly just suggesting\nThat if you want to call in and get a question answered tonight the phones are going to get extremely busy John Slavin my producer so please started calling now eight six six three nine one ten twenty eight six six three and I won ten twenty dollar bank instant access ... dot com and you can text us on the right automotive lined\nThe best deal in town now if you want to reach the law firm that is ... brown with offices in McKee's port McMurray Westford brains in Pompano Beach Florida seven to for nine four to sixty two hundred and Pittsburgh elder law dot com\nBen before we jump into this evening topic I think we should welcome Jennifer ... radio and ... brown good evening\n'em and in your case if it's not then what what Christine was saying to you is the right thing and that is something it if you did ever have a need\nUm you know if you ever did need Medicaid or to do that kind of planning that is something that you would apply for right at that time so if you went to nursing home or if you need caregivers are coming to your home to help take care of you um that is something that you apply for rights and that is not something that you could apply for now\nIs that makes sense okay and yeah and she could help protect our assets and everything at that time\nYeah I mean as much as possible yeah like I said ideally you would come and see us now and you can protect as many as ... as possible now but like I said if that is you know not feasible yeah there are things we can do a depending on your circumstances to protect as many of your assets as possible so\nEven if we can't afford any kind of attract or anything like that they're still I think\nThere are still things you can do that is correct mhm\nYup are good and they didn't make another point in my car\nYeah yeah I I I honestly think it would be a good idea just to maybe get a refresher have Christian look over your things um you know have more time to make sure that you guys are doing all the right things right now\nSo okay good thank you okay\nAll right out of the great call you know ... and ... and here's the thing I think we can take from that call ...\nIn a perfect world we'd all like to have that money but she's more like me and the rest of the audience probably if you take eight out of ten people who really don't have the wherewithal the finances so let's kind of hone in on those people\nAnd exactly what Christine said in your time of need but what are some of the ... early on just to give you an idea of what you will need when that time arrives\nThe basic things that I'm sure John can attest to this is a well a a power of attorney which is most important or a living will\nUm and along with that power of attorney like I said as a financial POV returning and separate document as a health care power of attorney um those are the critical estate planning documents that you need even if you have nothing else if it even if you can't afford a trust or anything else\nUm you need a will most certainly you need a financial power of attorney in health care power of attorney um without those things in it if you do need help in the future and for some reason I'm you're not able to make your own decisions if you could not sign documents for yourself and then even at that time if you have a diagnosis such as like a for dementia or Alzheimer's\nUm if you don't have the power of attorney in place you're only altered alternative is the guardianship and like I said that is far more costly than a power of attorney so I'm sure Jack in the test of that\nI think I'm a a power of attorney is a very very powerful legal document basically um it it provides the you know it provides an agent with with the power to do\nEssentially a lot of the financial transactions that a person would be able to do on their own um and for example I had a had a case a few years ago where a couple was very young in their thirties and has been owned the house only in his name um\nUm and he had a mortgage and his name only um he was maybe thirty three and had um was and it was in a car accident and so he was he was basically comatose for a while um but the the wife was basically trying to make\nThe mortgage payments on house her name wasn't on the mortgage her name wasn't on the house and the husband had received all of the\nStatements for the mortgage electronically and she didn't have the password to get into his email to get into his computer so that they would have had a power if she would have had a power of attorney she could have taken care of all of that um now I Know everybody is probably thinking oh can't you can just you can just make payments to him to a mortgage company and notes do except payments from anybody\nUm but but you need to have the basic information about the account and and everything in order to do that so you know you think\nThat a power of attorney is a document that you may need um you know in your sixties or seventies um but it's a very important document for everybody to have and in that case you know a thirty five year old um couple\nNeeded it and they didn't have it and so they ended up getting delinquent on their mortgage everything turned out okay in the end they were able to to work it out but uh they wouldn't have had that period of delinquency if she would have had a power of attorney\nYou know she brings up so many good points and let me take it one step further so you recently married to a wonderful young woman doing rush dreamy well enough she of course are the brains will be outfit you're always going to argue with our all listen I'll just lose on her you'll go far enough you'll be on the Supreme Court published a higher level listen\nOne about a young couple who's getting and judges maybe I mean obviously I I've been married the few times in my life when there's no way I Would have everything in my name and every password that I have would be in that person's hands just in case\nAnd legally all of the right things including life insurance shows you know the dependents can get taken care of an open enrollment for us in healthcare right now here at this wonderful company in Medicare people are doing across this country\nSo tell me about planning before you decide to say I do is that ... may be a bad idea you know we think older law but maybe you're young couple comes in and meet with ... or you or any of the attorney said look we're getting married we just want to make sure all of our ducks in a row\nYeah I mean that's one of the I mean ... everything we're talking about are things that you could do before you get married as well whether you're in a relationship or not I mean if\nYou're going to be single you know thirty five forty years old you you you need a power of attorney just as much as somebody else that's married probably even more so\nI'm just like I said as John mentioned there are bank accounts that are just ... you have a house such as an your arm and a mortgage and ... and if something happens you and you're not able to have access to those bank accounts um if you need to pay your mortgage nobody can do it for you or your spouse believe it or not they'll have a legal right to just do those things for you to have access to your bank accounts\nUm if they're not in her name as well and a lot of people think that they think well if something happens to my husband if something happens happens my wife\nAnd they have a bank account just in our name or if they've CDs or in Iran or the embargo wall just go cash it out that all the money to pay for it\nWell if you're not a power of attorney and you're not I named owner on that account you can't do it and a lot of people that surprises a lot of people on the husbands and wives or don't believe that kind of thing and it happens all the time all the time [noise]\nI think I think it's maybe a generational thing but I think um you know with couples basically getting married a little bit later in life than they used to both couples come into the marriage with their own separate accounts and so if they want to keep things separate which a lot of people do suffer will combine things and people keep them separate\nIf you keep things separate as Ben was saying if you don't have the power of attorney and you have an account that's just in in one person's name um you're going to have a hard time dealing with that\nUm and to your point earlier ... another thing that I see very frequently are young couples who are\nOfficials who are expecting their first child or have just had their first child a huge thing for them to include in their will is um guardianship permission so what happens what will happen in the event that\nSomething would happen actually to to both parents at the same time who would take care of their children that the choice that you can make 'em you can make and including your will so that\nYou know and of course you recognize it's kind of planning for something that's very morbid but you have to plan for everything ... though if there was a situation where something happens to a husband and wife at the same time and they have minor children they can both indicate in their wells who they would want to be the legal guardians of their children\nThat's a hard decision to make but it's a really important one\nYeah I mean that that's exactly what I was saying and just what John side as if you are younger and you were a couple of nothing else you need a will to name and your well who you would want to be the guardian of your child or your children in the event that both of you pass away in a common accident because if you don't have that\nI'm either way a judge's aren't going to pick for you who's going to be the guarding your child going forward until they turn or at least they deem are\nAlright listen you know just a a great Side Story I'm Christine husband happens to be from New Britain thriving and and the story that always makes me think of such of well details and how quickly time can change\nHappened many years ago to a mutual friend ... ... was his both parents were killed simultaneously in a car wreck they had multiple children but luckily\nThe uncle obviously took all of them in and blended his family and their family together\nAnd there were about ten of them at all and they grew up in a wonderful home but that doesn't happen all the time ... because of that does happen and it can happen and you're going to find yourself in a very difficult situation\nEven though if you're not here you're you're ... you're surviving family members and obviously parents and grandparents are going to find themselves\nIn a very tough situation so this is something that you've got to get done and maybe you should be thinking about it you know as you're getting ready to have this baby right\nYeah you have to like I said it's um\n... guarding your and your will is critical in those cases because usually you have ... hopefully I should say you have like an uncle or brother or sister or even the parents step up and we'll take those children and um it for some reason you don't or if you have for some reason you know people that are in conflict with each other than that definitely when you're going to have a judge pick for you who's going to be a guardian\nBar give us a call folks talking about a number of things that I was ... brown Jenna

I'm not going to say every time you talked to a doctor and like I said if you're speaking on behalf of your spouse and vice versa that\nThey may not listen to you I'm not going to say that's not going to happen but legally there is no legal right for that to happen unless like I said um you have a health care power of attorney a place um had yeah just like I said jeeze by example like I said you could be\nAlert but they aren't able to communicate your decisions and for some reason there's maybe an emergency surgery that you need well who's able to give that go ahead if you're not able to communicate that to a doctor I'm legally a spouse cannot just do that for you without a health care power of attorney being in place so\nAnd another another thing on on the on the financial power of attorney actually that we just saw yesterday is that\nToday is that sometimes a financial depending on what powers are included um a power can be included to change beneficiary designations of retirement accounts um even if you have joint bank accounts including checking saving money market you of the joint 'em join the to your home\nOn retirement accounts are just going to be in one person's name with another person listed as a beneficiary so if you\nIf you for some reason would need to let's say your husband has a retirement account and you would need to change the beneficiary I'm of that retirement account a power of attorney a financial power of attorney could provide for that\nOkay well All right I mean we have each other on his beneficiary so I don't see\nYeh is basically what she's saying is a lot of times like I said you know God Forbid your husband would enter a nursing home and I'm a ... and he's the beneficiary or or vice versa on his insurance policy or you are and you want to change it for some reason or say to the state and say he doesn't even have a beneficiary\nOf you would not be able to do that without a financial power of attorney so there's a lot of these little things that you know a lot of times you don't think of um even just signing documents even sounding any form that would need sign off on behalf of your husband\nUm if you were admitted to a hospital or discharge you could not do that without a financial POV return if he's not able to find himself\nI'm One of the other big thing especially with the health care power of attorney is their HIPAA compliant if you've ever heard of hip all\nOh absolutely it gets thrown in our face every around\nI'm sure it does I'm sure it does yeah like I said that's and it's a big one like I said our our health care power of attorney is HIPAA compliant meaning um us power health care power of attorney for your husband's you would have access to his medical records you'd be able to call the doctor and find out how was doctor's appointment winds if you could be there and vice versa if you don't have the unemployed\nThat already I signed a form of health system is for that\nRight and there are limited forms are a lot of times limited health care power of attorney there are limited just to your doctor or maybe just to a certain healthcare system but they're not universal with all the health care power of attorney in place so\nOkay thank you very much\nYeah thank you very listen ... and ... if you'd like to follow up with a law from seven to for nine four to sixty two hundred this is why you need an elder attorney\nYeah and that's exactly why and like I said a lot of people just don't realize like is that it has been or why if you don't have the legal right to make a legal or health care decisions on behalf of your spouse if you don't have a financial health care power of attorney in place you and you want to add anything to us\nI think I think then covered everything um they're just you know they're very important documents and and I think the I think the thing to really hit home about them is you don't know you you think that you don't need them because you assume that everybody's healthy and everything's fine but like that situation I was talking about earlier\nWith someone in their thirties and unforeseen health circumstances you really never know when you're going to need it but in that situation you know because he was because he was in a coma and it was too late\nSo you know you don't want to be stuck in a situation where you wish you ... you would have done this earlier\nOr we have a lot of calls coming in right now so we're going to take a break kinda regroup and come back and take these phone calls but again if you were just like to call the law firm and make an appointment leave your information they will get back to seven to for nine four to sixty\nTwo hundred and you can find out everything about them at Pittsburgh

ask you following the lady that was on the your last caller with a financial medical power of attorney\nYes uh if for some reason or another\nThe gentleman let's say in a coma doesn't have either one of those ... or the spouse who said she has the authority to do whatever who makes all the decisions for the guy needs to and they they send the coma\nYeah well basically like I said there was a doctor and they're not going to listen to the spouse war assuming there is no spouse or the spouse passed away your only alternative is the guardianship meaning you'd have to petition the court um you'd have to hire attorneys petition to court or a judge would then appointed guardian for that person to make their financial and health care decisions um you're looking\nAt what what am I in a time\nOr it's usually takes at least a month or two in order to get an even a guardianship hearing they'd do allow emergency guardianship split their very berries\nVery very seldom do what what a judge approval and so it's got to be really life or death so\nSo in his case of Dr Michael decisions or as a spouse him or her thinking that they had the authority to do whatever he does have the authority to do nothing and they've got to be here to the doctor says\nThat's right yeah and like I said well the doctor is not going to find like I said it ... it for its to use our example there's a surgery that that needs done obviously a you know that that person has gone to okay the surgery for some reason they're not able to obey the surgery for for whatever reason if they're\nUnconscious or for some reason they cannot speak or communicate their decisions um\nIf a doctor is not willing or able to listen to a spouse or somebody else you're you're only ... alternative as it goes according to the guardianship so yeah", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Paul Zeise", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "16"}
