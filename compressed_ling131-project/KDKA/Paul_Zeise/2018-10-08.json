last person about the article came out on trial I Believe when he came out last week at his rally and he was mocking her about her sexual assault\nI don't like this will only do so yeah\nYeah and I

Democratic party well what has the Republican Party done for the black community\nWhere they were drawn by him employment is that is no what I'm writing my years you know as we're\nGetting ready to say but at the same time that had to do with the Republican Party or is that just because\nObama has put something then with the economy that fan and we started to pay off and he's benefitting off of

so I'm like a lot of people I was turned onto this painting through the work of a Henry are on right now and um he was famous book that\nI think if the return of the prodigal talks about his journey with the painting and so like so many people um I look at that painting and if you've seen it you can probably pull it up pretty quickly on the Internet but it's\nYou know in the center of the painting Rembrandt uses of course the light so well and the focal point is is right there with the father's hands arresting upon the shoulders of his prodigal and\nFor most of us that's kind of where we we see ourselves as others that returning prodigal and hopefully you eventually come to see yourself as the father who welcomes in prodigal into the unforgiving um until the forgiving relentless love of God\nUm but once I got a high quality print of the photo I actually noticed an additional figure up in the very top left of it you can't see it unless you have a really high quality print and it's this woman up there in the shadows who is\nLooking at the reunion but her face is just obscured enough from the shadows that you can't really tell what she's thinking she see this beautiful redemption happening but she's not participating in it she sees it all from a distance and so at a certain\nPoint in my life I sat looking at that painting and realize that the center of action for me was no longer there and the ... but had really moved up to that woman in the shadows and I realized I felt like her you know I I knew\nSomething was going on and I saw other people\nAnd then I saw other people's faith and I saw redemption happening but I just didn't feel like I was there and the action anymore feeling the hands with a father on my shoulders\nAnd you saw yourself standing with her in the shadows didn't you\nAbsolutely I I realized that I Know what it feels like to see other people believing in God to see other people experiencing God but to be in a place where you don't any longer feel like you're hearing God and you don't feel like you're any longer experiencing God and after a while\nYou begin to wonder if you were making it up that whole time when you thought\nYou were feeling the father's hands on your shoulders when it's been a while you\nDidn't grow up wanting to be a pastor and you're still living the mystery and I'm One with you I didn't grow up to be a priest is still on a whole lot of mystery in my life it\nIt's a Seventy eight years of age ... or you point not that many people struggle with skepticism and down many leave the church for that reason\nThat the church has always been a place for skeptics and saying since skeptical seems also and you you quote Matthew twenty eight Seventeen when they saw him they worshipped him but they were not sure\nIt's one of my favorite stories and all of scripture and I think what's really shocking about it is that it's so little known you know because it\nIt occurs right in the middle of one of the most famous stories and all the scripture which is Jesus is great commission they eleven apostles go up to this mountain on ... and we're told that yes they they experience they see they encountered the resurrected cry and yet we're still tell that when they saw him they worshipped him\nAnd then the translations differ there but they saw him and they worshipped him but they still doubt it or they were on shore and a lot of us look at that and we think wow if I could just encountered the resurrected cries to you know I Would never need another thing\nFor the rest of my life I don't need a burning Bush I don't need an answer for I don't need anything that's all I Would ever need and yet these eleven apostles encountered the resurrected Christ\nAnd somehow they still doubt it and of course the best part of the story\nIs that Jesus uses these eleven worshipping doubters to literally built the church and he doesn't say well you know or you you guys got to get it all together before I send you out he sends them out still worshipping ... downing at the same time so far as we know\nRight I'm ...\nSo many beautiful stories in in your book scattered throughout tell us we've talked about the woman who's in the shadows in the house in the corner of the return to the prodigal son tell us the story of the woman with bright red lipstick\nSo I was twenty probably about Twenty years old and was involved in this ministry in my hometown where once a week we would go to the nursing home and this lady named miss Boyd I Believe it was [noise]\nWould always put on a lot of makeup and lipstick and at the time it struck me as sad in vain that 'cause I knew from talking to her that no one ever came to visit her anymore and so I just thought how sad is this that\nShe's still you know feels the need to get dressed up in one day she was applying for lipstick when I walked in and I think she just\nCaught a glance of ... kind of confused amusement and she said something to the effect of well I Know it appears little vain but\nAh to heck with it it reminds me that this isn't the ad and then she continued applying our lipstick and I still remember when I went to her funeral and saw her they're coughing pale and gone\nBut with a fresh coat of bright red lipstick it so what I you know liking it too in the book as it is this act of graffiti right and that's what the first chapter is called graffiti which is this\nRebellion this Easter rebellion against the cold concrete canvas of doubt and darkness um and so in her own little way you know this was her little bitty active rebellion Easter rebellion reminding herself that even the grave was at the end\nAnd I'm touched you so much you point out that when you walk with people through the valley the shadow of death you know tell them the story of her bright red ... CD\nSarah Binder that you don't have to be you know Rembrandt anything can be a canvas if you've got the imagination and the indoor and so now\nThe uh second chapters in on a rollercoaster losing a certainty seeking phase you raise the question what do you plan on first of all the times are changing faster and faster\nThe technology is\nCreated a new world now we know the universe is a whole lot bigger and we're a whole lot smaller than we could have imagined\nUm how do you worship God when there's so much disagreement about who got really use in what God is really like\n[noise] so in my experience um people leave faith or on mostly faith for all sorts of reasons and sometimes it's a specific reason but\nMore than a specific reason I think this day and age what begins to make people question their faith or move away from it is this an overwhelming feeling of feeling overwhelmed the sense that um you know our great great great great great great great great grandparents they probably interact with a small\nHandful of people each day you know their family and maybe the family that lived in a cave down the street or whatever it was but\nWe interact with hundreds if not thousands of people on a daily basis and through this delusion of information I think we are uniquely\nBurden with the infinite complexity of the world of the universe of so many different religions and so much information and I I just think that in a unique way\nWe understand how small we are in a way that no generation before has and so\nWhen we feel that just immense sense of uncertainty\nAnd we've been led to believe that our faith has to be certain in order to really be faith then we start to question whether or not we can really have faith because we realize that there's just too much out there that we can never know for us to actually be certain and so it it does come to this point where [noise]\nEither you've got to make your peace with your faith including some element of uncertainty some reminder of uncertainty that will always be there or else you're probably going to give up on faith\nYou um you're right that that we're paying suddenly cyanide creatures who know far less reality than we could ever comprehend\nWhen we don't know we'll always greatly outweigh what we do know uh why do you believe that admitting are down and uncertainty makes are safe and more credible\n[noise] I think most of us come to Jesus looking for the truth I really do we come looking for other things but I Do think we [noise]\nDeep down come looking for the truth and so any path that would cause us to deny the truth I think is a path that we would want to wear a jacket and of course of Jesus is the truth than it is a path that you would want us to reject and so if the truth is that the world is more complex than we previously imagine that we live in a you know\nThe only way you get a oh with the radio I listen to it any time anywhere\nNow here's the half of them at an actor you on a forecast partly cloudy warm\nAnd humid tonight or sixty six and ... are warm and humid clouds son a high up to eighty for the record eighty seven seven eleven years ago warm and sticking about ILO sixty seven and Tuesday weren't able to ... to ... but there are many urologist John fear can Israel ten twenty\nKatie KIA\nAnd um I guess this evening is pastor Austin Fisher is written a book titled faith in the shadows on you know that I don't have a guest on that uh I don't really like\n'em but typically there's enough books out there that I get a chance to choose for this\nA couple of hours a week and this is certainly I'm One of my favorite books are recently maybe because it speaks to me so\nI'm personally and ah he writes in the book faith in the shadows face has little to do with certainty in more to do with the willingness to act they fully despite\nUncertainty and we're talking about down there\nUm you believe that there's enough to ... you know the word I've studied had nothing to do some illogical crisis what would you such a crisis\n[noise] so\nAnd and pissed them a logical it is a tricky where it ... all the time of\nYou know that's a crisis where it's not just what you believe that is the problem um but how you even think or process what you believe that is the problem so\nLet's say a normal crisis of faith might be that you don't know if a certain belief is correct you know you pick it whatever it is can be on sources of authority or the creation of the world or whatever it is um [noise] but in the pissed them a logical crisis is when you go well\nMaybe the way I Would even go about answering a question like that is wrong and so specifically for for me um where this all kinds of manifests itself was um as a good kind of I was brought up in a\nVery conservative ... Cole I'm kind of environment which has many virtues I'm that I'm grateful for one of the\nThe weaknesses I think as we build up so much on\nScripture that we sometimes don't take the time to work through the sources of authority that\nWere needed a first scripture to become an authority and that scripture itself can't hold and bear the full weight I'm of the truth of Christian faith um that we need other things to help the scripture otherwise it becomes a very circular argument when you just say well I\nBelieve a B and C because the Bible tells me so well but but why should I Believe what the Bible says and if you haven't kind of broaden your view for what it looks like to hear got speak\nThen you get yourself in trouble pretty quick there and that is a kind of blind alley that a lot of conservative Avondale goes into backed into in\nChapter three\nTitles how to survive a hurricane Dolly would job and you introduced by writing the God is not always in the sanctuary it sometimes God is in the storm tell us a little bit about in the book of job is you understand what we can learn from it because you believe that it saved your face\n[noise] I Do I'm so job properly well typically I think when we we hear that George the story of a job or used to chapters wanting to where we learn that job was this\nPerfect righteous man who was doing everything right when he lost everything literally everything as rich as his family his health [noise]\nUm but in in the face of this just infinite seemingly suffering job responds with remarkable piety a lot of people will remember this line from job one Twenty one which says um job it's kind of responding to his is offering us as the lord gave\nAnd now the lord has taken away but either way bless would be the name of the lord\nAnd that is just this first marketable response to the suffering but a lot of people stop reading they're in chapter two and so they think that's kind of all there is to the store job lost everything he responded with faith we should respond site even when we lose everything that's them all joke\nBut it ignores that the next thirty six or so chapters are basically job just losing it I mean a chapter if they were told that job opens his mouth and he curses the day of his birth he\nGoes on you know again for the next thirty or so chapters I'm\nCalling God you know kind of in the DACA cs Lewis would say I'm almost verbally assaulting got all these accusations of God's\nI'm obviously not being kind of injustice demanding to have a trial with God and Joe has these friends of course quote unquote friends who tell him that he should just you know praise God\nYeah I don't doubt move on with his life and everything will be fine but job refuses to of course didn't end chapter thirty eight God finally does show up and job gets his confrontation with the almighty\nGod shows up in a whirlwind and he does put job and his place there's no doubt about however in chapter forty two were told that God says Joe ... Joe who's just you know hurled these verbal assault and accusations that God for thirty something chapters\nThat job is spoken rightly of God\nWhereas jokes friends jumps friends who said that job needed to just praise God don't out and get on with his life\nHas spoken wrongly of God and that God's wrath is actually Kendall against job spreads and job better go off for a sacrifice for his friends so they don't get what they deserve\nAnd so scholars of you know wanted for years how his job spoken rightly when he said all these terrible things and\nWhen he has in some sense been divinely reprimanded and the best answer seems to be that job stuck rightly\nAnd the sense that job I had the courage to speak honestly even when he didn't have anything nice to say job refused to give up on guard he refused to give up on his side\nAnd at the end of the day he gets reprimanded yes but he also encounters the living God\nIn a hurricane and so I think when it comes to our doubts job is this beautiful illustration of what it looks like to take God and take our faith too seriously to just walk away one of the doubt sets and now we hang in there and we ask Scott our questions we may end up reprimanded\nBut by God at least we will encounter the living God in the midst of our struggle\nAnd you point a to a job is not losing you say he's expressing his face disease wandering but he's not lost he's a rebel Buddhist safe full rebel and then some of the points you make is the\nSafe evils or dies saves the evolution is really just to return to its roots\nUse you recommend that we speak to even when we don't have something nice Hussein you yourself ... ... I think some the the bomb gone that we will also said to God\nI'm tell us a little bit about one but how one becomes the saint of darkness\nSo I Love the juxtaposition of of job and and his friends and if anyone is you know got the time this week it's it's a really good read and so job's friends you know they come with these kind of stock answer is which you know very but the basic tone of demolished that look\nGod is righteous job and I'm you know so if something bad happened it's because you had it coming because the only other option would be God was on righteous and so they just have this you know very black and white way of thinking about the white guy interacts with the world and so\nThey kind of comment job with these ideas and justifications for God telling jokes are just on that he's messed up and job refuses to but you notice in the back and forth at job's\nThinking evolves throughout the book rod job started is moving somewhere where as and this is made by um I think it was Gustavo ... makes his observation his commentary on a job that job's friends arguments that just seems stop\nThey just say the same thing again and again and again and again whereas jobs thinking clearly has this elevation I'm In this evolution where Joe realizes that the answer is he had been given and that he'd believed and they don't work for him anymore\nAnd so on the answers we've been given don't work for us anymore what do we do do we stick our head down in the sand and try to pretend like they work do we walk away from our faith or do we hang in there with our questions don't pretend like they're not there and instead bring them to God hold them there and the faith of forgot until God help us find\nGod help us find a way forward and I think that's what job does he\nIs resilient um he's innovated he has imagination and through that just kind of again imaginative resilience job shows us what it's like to doubt faithfully and that is to doubt in the presence of God not to leave church not to leave God when we have our doubts\nWhy hasn't even been a real problem for you as it has been for so many people\n[noise] who I think I have lived pretty [noise] privileged life and a lot of ways um and so\n[noise] you know for the first good bit of my life I I understood the theoretical theological rational problem of evil which isn't hard to understand you know God is all good and got his all powerful and yet evil exist in the world so that would seem to imply that either God's not a good or not all powerful um [noise]\nBut I really don't think evil is just the problem\nPartake of the body and blood of Christ that was pulled apart it just seems to gather us all together we surrender\nAnd we rebel we shed tears but they are buoyant tears filled with hope surrender and defiance tears it inside the resurrected rebellion for the sake of creation in the name of Christ and\nThen you say this you write this Easter doesn't make us push

literally as possible um and that of course is is not something that churches historically done it it was really a phenomenon that came along and probably the nineteenth\nCentury when Christians saw these remarkable discoveries being made by applying the scientific method and the sciences\nAnd said well hey you know maybe we can apply the same sort of scientific method to our source of authority so instead of the natural world\nWe applied to the Bible and the belief that we can get um a faith that his objective insurance certain just like all these discoveries that people have had in the sciences\nAnd so a Christian a lot of Christians um especially conservative fundamentalist Christians started reading the Bible as literally as possible thinking they were honoring the authority of the Bible\nBut as our best interpreters throughout history of told us how we don't best honor the authority of the Bible by reading it as literally as possible we best honor the authority of the Bible by reading as the writer intended which was off and not literally and so\nThat's why I called this misguided I'm kind of attempt at faithfulness because we think we're honoring the authority of scripture by reading it as literally as possible\nBut I Would suggest and again I think the best Christian biblical interpretation throughout the years with suggest that we actually on her scriptures authority and when we read is the writer intended which is quite often not literally\nLine and do you believe that um we have to read the mind I guess in terms of\nUm that perhaps there will be greater regulation in the future God's inspiration of men and and that the truth of the Bible we just we didn't understand fully enough\nIn a week long to them we\nThought going deeper so that we may you understand better as you just said not only with the writer intended but we'd gone intended\nAbsolutely you know there are a number of places where [noise]\nAugust and for example he he wrote a commentary on genesis called or something to the effect of on a literal reading of genesis but what's so interesting is when you read it it's it's very far removed from what we would call literal [noise] um and then there are August and makes it really clear that we need to be careful about\nI'm forcing ourselves in corners by claiming that the Bible has to be read literally and us let's say the science in this particular instance\nHas to mean a certain thing has to come to a certain conclusion rather um you know when we go to those places in scripture where it looks like it may not have to be literal we should hold up with an open hand and we should be open to the claims of the sciences or philosophy or whatever it is [noise]\nUm because again we never do justice to what God wants to tell us by hiding from the truth and so if the ...\nThe truth is that the world is actually you know very very old and very very anxious\nAnd that's a trip that God would want us to be open to in August and would suggest that we might want to go back to those parts of scripture that we thought contradicted what let's say modern science was telling us because perhaps there's a better way to read those tax donated to always stay open to that and not force ourselves into a position where the entire faith could collapse\nBecause we're at a text literally that was meant to be metaphorical\nSome of the points that you make in a chapter eight and feel free to expand on them if you do I\nReally try to cover a good part of the books that people can understand what it is you're writing about in part to me really touched them deeply and therefore wants to read the book and a and benefit sharing your wisdom\nYou write that in the United states atheists are more likely than Christians to feel a sense of wonder about the universe that science take things apart to see how they work religion put them together\nTo see what they mean and you you\nIndicate that God is beyond that exists students into existence itself God is not a bean because God is both be on the scene rather is dean itself that God does not live and moving have is being in the universe\nBut the universe lives and moves and he has its be and has dudes being in the universe as it's being in God and you also be a good point what shoot a staunch us is that we exist existence itself\nIs the miracle amplify a little bit on that last point exist\nItself as the miracle\nYeah I I think um and to be fair you know we\nUm and this was kind of mentioned earlier in the interview referencing chapter to we have had to deal with more information than any other generation and the history of the world and so it's it's very understandable that we're all trying to get her feet under us in this incredibly complex while that just keeps getting more complex [noise]\nIn the midst of that um [noise] I think a lot of us Christians have fallen into I'm kind of a category era where we have thought of God is this\nSuper creature who is is is like a ... but just you know bigger and stronger and and and wiser and more powerful and so we have\nGone out and the physical world looking proof looking for proof of this God's existence [noise] um and so we ended up getting kind of locked in this battle with [noise] a ... a scientifically minded atheist who would claim that you know now we don't need God to explaining these\nPhenomenon that ancient people used to a tribute to the gods I'm so there is no God and then we have Christians are getting no no no I hear all these proof for God's existence that we can objectively CBS through [noise]\nYou know younger as creationism or intelligent design and\nWhile there could be some truth than those pursuits I think the larger point that has missed is that\nYou know the proof of God's existence is not um you know the complexity of the I. R. gaps that God's Children and scientific explanations or the proof of God's existence is this absolute infinite gap that exists between existence and non existence and so\nPoint being there and that last I'm kind of illustration you mentioned is that when we walk around\nIn the world every day and we see a tree or pine cone up apple\nAll of it should strike us as a miracle because that there should be a world at all as an absolutely remarkable thing in the physical world is completely contingent and there's just no reason why\nAnd there's just no reason why should exist and so we don't need a super complex either prove us that God exist all we need is everything in the absolute nonsense reality of every single thing and yet here it is all stained by God's Grace generosity moment by moment and so that's why I say\nThe question is not really you know what's a miracle it's what's not American everything as a miracle existence is it a miracle\nAnd you write perhaps it would be better to think that instead of occasionally intervening in creation from the outside God constantly participates in creation\nFrom the inside in whom we lose ... ... we live and moving have are being taken from from max and so um you\nAlso point out that humans do things that are wrong but are not soon school because they lack the maturity to be held to account and you\nSee just the God does not allow us a detailed explanation regarding the origins and mechanics of the universe and the the essence of safe use then we're constantly forced to live with mysteries that are not of our own choosing a little bit more about that\n[noise] ah one of the I think um [noise]\nBig tensions between faith and scientists specifically of course been on the issue of evolution you know going back a couple of hundred years now and so [noise]\nOr I Try to spell out there in chapter ... is a way to maybe harmonize um the findings of modern science on evolution which of course tell us that the world is very very old a few billion years old I'm modern science would also suggest that there was probably not just\nA prime appear Adam any but rather the human or\nYou know ... of all the human hominid population was probably never under about fifty thousand I think that's the number on that the scientists give us now and so\nHow could that all be true which is what the scientists is telling us right now and yet this genesis account genesis one thirty three also be true in some sense of so that's what I'm trying to sketch out there is that\nWhen we look at the genesis account in more detail um\n[noise] I don't know that what we find is the state of sin less perfection in the garden of Eden right that the circuits in the garden the surf it's not perfect so clearly it's not send us protection\nOr rather I think we have this metaphor for creation is good and maybe not perfect but it's good ... creation eventually falls in so I think there is a way to conceive of what a fall would look like given what scientists telling us couching it in terms of something that is not\nInstant I'm an individualistic with a single couple but rather something that is\nGradual income you know where the human race\nIncreasingly against this religious awareness and we see that documented you know kind of throughout the world in archaeology cave paintings you name it that there's this increasing religious capacity in humans as we go smarter and more aware and at a certain point that awareness reaches a place where we are capable of what we might call kind of his covenant\nRelationship with God now up until that point humans certainly would have done things wrong and we know that there was even suffering in the world long before humans were around\nBut it was a sin proper um because we weren't really in a place\nAnd so I think that scripture very clearly teaches universal reconciliation meaning that in Christ got his reconciled all things to himself\nAnd yet I think scripture also teaches hell and so that becomes kind of the question for all of us to sort out is how can you have universal reconciliation and hell and so that's what I Try to\nKind of plays a path for at least towards in that chapter chapter ten and the metaphor I give as if someone like Hitler actually got five minutes and having what do we think that would be like you know and so he he\nShows up and he has agreed at the ... by St Peter St Peter that you write hey look happy happy about that and so he gets in to have an any\nTries to start telling people what to do to you know build a new army in of course none of the angels listen to him and they pat him on the hat and time to go see Jesus the slaughtered\nJewish Messiah who all creation as worshipping and so the big idea is that if Hitler got five minutes and have and it would probably feel like an eternity\nAnd how um because I don't know that death magically transforms who we are and so if we've spent our entire lives\nI'm becoming people whose hearts or cold and callous than\nThe blazing fire of God's love might just be experienced as that raft fire that we read about in revelation and so the idea that God will love all people forever I have no doubt about that but it could be that some people will hate him for it and I think that's what how will be it will be the love of God\nExperienced as the wrath of God by coal frost bitten souls who spent their entire lives rejecting the love of God\nI'm\nNice quote from cs Lewis the doors of how we're locked on the inside of them and that heaven and hell will be filled with surprises chapter living his face down to love and\nYou write that you suspect many of us can shake our doubts because we're striving for safe rather than for love\nAnd the safe can produce love love can also produce facing you write the greatest person in the eyes of God is\nNot the one with the most safe but the one with the most love and when all is said and done and we stand before the great white thrown I reckon the question will be asked\nNot did you doubt but do you love safe is not the absence of doubt faith is the presidents of love isn't it\n[noise] I Do think that faith is one of those things that we find home or not aiming at it kind of like happiness you know if you\nIf you try to be happy that's one of the best way to end up unhappy uh we we live happy lives\nWhen we aim at living beautiful meaningful charitable lives we end up happy indirectly when we do that and I think faith works the same way when we aim at faith and we aim at convincing ourselves that we believe things which is a strange kind of psychological game in of itself\nI think we often end up not being able to find face whereas when we aim at la and to be more specific loving way Jesus has asked us to love which would mean loving the person in front of you as much as you love yourself and also even loving your enemies [noise]\nThen I think when we spend ourselves in that kind of love we often typically end up with face indirectly because we love\nCreates faith and stuff you want to face don't ... don't aim at convincing yourself you're never going to be able to convince yourself rather pour yourself out all your days loving whoever got puts in front of you\nAnd I think you'll find that at the end of that you had a lot more ... than you did before and Paul of course is the one who told us that there are these three great things we're supposed to abiding\nFaith hope and love but the greatest of the says Paul is love because faith at the end of the day is just a means to love it's not an end in itself it will be done away with one day only level or by\nJeffrey twelve Christ or the truth a case for safe in the worst case you ... you write to believe in God use and will probably always be essentially contested\nAnd speaking for yourself you say I Would be a fool for not believing in crisis why\n[noise] some people might struggle with this idea that faith Christian faith will always remain in essentially contested believe and I understand that but I\nHave certainly experience that to be the case in my own life and I think history kind of bears that out that the arguments about you know which God Israel which religion is correct or whether or not there even is a God they have always been there and they will always be there and I don't know how we get satellite definitively and so\nThat's kind of the predicament we find ourselves and then unfortunately we we have to make a decision about whether or not we're going to believe there's a gotten a lot riding on it um and so given that we can't ever be sure what are we gonna do now I got to this place where I realized that\n[noise] I Would rather be wrong about Jesus and I would be right about anything else and so what I'm offering there on the one hand it's kind of a reverse\nThis past cows wages so Pascal with this philosopher who said hey I'm if Christianity proved not to be true and you live your whole life as a Christian and you know you didn't miss out on much maybe would have had more money and spend your time more selfishly or whatever but you know it was really no big loss\nBut if you get to the end of your life in Christianity was true and you weren't a Christian and there could be pretty severe consequences for that now what I'm offering is currently in version of that is saying even\nIf Christianity proved to be false uh I Would still choose to follow Jesus with us very briefly I've I've been given because I think a lot spent following Jesus is the most beautiful\nMeaningful way I could spend this brief flicker of alive that got\nLike the way you write in the book without Christ I tend to have more money in my bank accounts more time for leisure more nonchalant towards the beggar rummaging through a dumpsters I wait in line at Starbucks\nI mean the imitation of Christ create send me a moral imagination I Am not people who otherwise\nI mean the worship of Christ creates in the ... fire I Do not have otherwise I mean the prayer creates the prophetic rage toward the world's record injustices I cannot maintain otherwise\nI have no clue whether or not I'm kinder were\nMore generous than the average person but I Do know than I Am kinder\nMore generous with Christ than I Am with Saudi and then you know that just from living don't you\nI Do um you know there have been debates for a long time about whether or not religion\nMakes us better more moral people and and most of the studies do seem to indicate that religious people are by certain measures are more charitable give more of their time and money but [noise]\nYou know I I just kinda table all that and say I I Know who I was before Christ and I know I Am without Christ\nAnd I'm a very different person I don't know if I'm Better than other people I Would make no kind of that one I Know\nIs that Jesus has done something to me and made me a kinder\nGentler more selfless person than I Am capable of being on my own um and that's not a definitive bulletproof argument um it's me speaking from the only position I really have in this universe and that is within the context of my own life saying that my life is better and more beautiful with Jesus than it was without it and\nI think most of us who knows you would say that's probably the case\nFinal chapter walking them water the proof is in the living and you begin with the story of Peter as a he sings a into the sea Matthew fourteen I'm In you indicate that\nPeter ... when he tries to explain a mystery instead of live\nAnd what does that mean [noise]\nDo love that story you know and I imagine Peter you know out there and that little tiny wouldn't vote on Dark Knight and the middle of the store and Jesus calls for him to come out on the sea and in Peter does and he and he starts walking on the water now we don't know if it felt like a you know a sidewalk or water bed who knows um but\nAt some point Peter has this flash of self awareness and he realizes that he's doing something that he cannot do the walking on water and so\nWhatever happens in that flash of self awareness brags whatever ... kind of happening as he's out there on the waves and he begins to sink a because instead of just living this mystery of walk on the water he starts to try to explain it in rationalize it and I think something very similar\nSimilar [noise] can happen to us with our faith where we can sometimes I get a little to rationalize stick a where we think we have to be able to quantify\nOur belief and put it in a beaker and measure it and ah you know put it in a math equation to make sure factors out with no reminder and\nI think that at the end of the day life is something that is fundamentally not explainable or in those methods and so\nWe get to this place where if we get so fixated on trying to explain it that we never get to the place where we actually live it and I think all the best kind of Christian thinkers throughout history have said that\nFaith makes the most sense when you get out there and you live in the proof is in the living\nNot talking about it ... makes sense when you get on the inside of it and experience it but when you try to rationalize it from the outside it's not irrational\nSo ... well who needs to know where the headlights our we have wipers at just

what's going on when they bring up for subject is really important all is that they're looking at every more slow news that's coming in in the morning and coloring you down to what you really need to know and\nGiving it to you in a concise manner one of the most important things is being consistent being here every day\nReliable weekdays five denied the candy cane a morning news\n... news from over the weekend many Pittsburgh city employees meeting to pay a ... and they keep smoking ... fifty dollars more for their health insurance in\nAnd ... we're going to talk about this coming up with a doctor Jerry\nI remember when I gave up even the occasional cigar I was never a smoker of cigarettes\nBut I Would add the occasional cigar and it was when my employer when I was working in Youngstown said that um if you're a smoker\nYou have to pay more [noise]\nAnd I would smoke a cigar maybe once a month\nAnd thinking I'm not paying twenty dollars more a month\nOn top of that four dollar cigar five dollars are\nIf they continue to use tobacco products now they're also going to offer smoking cessation programs they've been offering that for years they will continue to offered\nAnd uh now it's going to be about whether or not they're going to take them up on the station program and if not they're going to pay an extra fifty dollars a month\nI'm not sure how it's going to work for them but ah one of the great concerns I had about giving up that occasional cigar and was talking about what is that if I had health insurance plan and I listen to myself as a non smoker and I was a smoker\nThen you are committing insurance fraud\nAnd the insurance company was not bound to Ben cover those claims if they were smoking\nRelated I mean there were a lot of things to consider here in this with us right now is Dr Jerry Pifer a the idea of charging people more for certain behaviors because of the increased cost of\nProviding care to those people\nIs that something that makes sense\nI I think it makes a lot of sense and it makes common sense I I think that we're spoiled we talked a little bit about this hour or so ago it off the air but I I think we're spoiled we think that our insurance should cover the first dollar coverage or every prescription we should have no ...\nAnd we have to be more invested in our own health care you know and smoking is one of them\nAnd you know what kind of surprises me they should do one third of the three thousand employees would it would affect ... you know the Dutch thirty three and a thirty percent the national average for smoking is about twenty percent\nSo harsh our city workers are\nA number of studies that when it comes to health care dollars a north of Seventy percent some reports I've read it as high as eighty percent of all health care dollars are spent on behavior related that if we were able to get rid of smoking\nCurb alcohol consumption and deal with obesity that we'd be able to greatly reduce the cost of health care and that ultimately the cost to each and every one of us\nI I Will just throw it a number that I Would think that that would reduce our health care costs but at least fifty percent if not more\nAbsolutely then then it becomes the argument as they say that they're not going to do this that there are no intentions of doing this um the city has no intention of imposing similar charges on such things as substance abuse\nAnd obesity\nBut offers free programs to help employees overcome those problems\nThere is an argument to be made that if you're going to bring it for tobacco why not bring it for those who are obese and could you do that through a BMI number of some kind and could you do it for those that consume alcohol too 'cause we know that alcohol was contributor to illness and disease\nOr do you do it with that too\nThat you know I don't know maybe what the city is thinking if we were going to do this for one disease process uh let's see how that goes and then maybe we can add those later ... I Would agree that they should be added we would like I said we need to be more invested in our own individual health care\nAnd ever engaged in certain risky behaviors that are outside the norm of just\nLiving then we should be paying more\nYeah I I think we should I think we should and and and you know dollars\nReally matter you were telling me ask you to lead a blood test because cost you foreign highway well here's\nThe thing I went to the doctor back in the spring and the doctor said well we should probably get some blood work done on you I said well I feel fine yeah but we should probably get some work on it because I'm I I Want to see and I and then I called the ... the ah blood work people and it's going to cost several hundred dollars to get the blood work done so then I'm thinking\nNo I'm not paying three four hundred dollars because of doctors curious if you're curious you pay the three of [laughter] but we do it why is that money is out of pocket for ourselves we think differently about our behaviors and what we ought to be\nDoing absolutely and if it costs more co pay to go to emergency department what most people do they call her valley position is that\nYou know so yes or were you know the copay maybe it's Seventy five or a hundred dollars the emergency department maybe it's sixty or Seventy or or or maybe no co pay of of just to your primary care physician so this is the doors to make a difference\nDoes it it's really does have a friend of mine that uh insulin dependent diabetic\nAnd as long as the insulin was to him at relatively low cost if no cost at all he didn't care he would just eating what he wanted to inject himself that then the insurance plan changed your go he changed his diet to reduce his insulin dependency by fifty percent\nAnd he's probably doing a lot better probably feeling better and and you know on paper or at least he's been\nBetter health right so whenever we can then do that to encourage people to be better to themselves because it's completely irrational isn't it Dr I Want to go out and live the life I wanted to go live regardless of the risk factors and oh by the way when it finally get sick from that make me well\nAbsolutely and I want everything done and I want to be helped\nAnd I want to be helped and I want to be able to be cured at least no longer than twenty four\nHours yes spare no

Katie okay\nYou're a physical therapist okay and uh here at the wonderful Institute a pediatric orthopedic Institute\nAnd what is so special about a physical therapy for children and I know that you take care of infants through Twenty one at the Institute but a wind that segment of the population is that different than say somebody who is Seventy five years old or fifty years old\nWe tried to make therapy a little more fine okay interesting for the children um and sometimes there's a lot of education with the families we got a close relationship especially younger\nAnd things that we see that we're educating the family is a little more um and then with the children in general we deal more of a one on one treatments and they have more individualized treatments and they were in a bigger thing okay and\nAnd and so often we hear no pain no gain [laughter] how do you convince a child's age six years old who who maybe they were in a cast for yeah maybe a couple of months and now they're nice little ... you know where they come out of the cast how do we convinced that\nThat child that they need to really work at this even though there's going to be some discomfort or how do you do that\nAnd that's where a lot of our therapy involves ... activities so we put them in different positions of play and a lot of times they're able to do those movements without even realizing it okay\nSo ... and you you enjoy it and enjoy taking care of patients her in that big\nGymnasiums there uh with our in selling all the windows and the wonderful colors for kids and all all sorts of things for them to play with it and they don't even realize they're getting physical therapy with some of those activities that you do with the kids marriage right which is really great that means you're doing a good job if they don't realize helping themselves right\nOkay and our second guest in Studio ... this evening is a\nIs Cheryl Hi Bach\nAnd ensure it was a very interesting individual

officers were very very close together or consultation rooms that the federal north facility and it\nHad to be shortly after he was hired by the hospital and then the the future with Eli guinea health network\nThat he told me that he had this dream and I said well upset and and he's in great for using magic markers pens and writing on the wall and whatever and and he showed me the sort of a sketch or an outline of what he thought\nWould be a very very appropriate facility for pediatric patients who had ... problems\nAnd it took him ten years ten years to see that facility\nBuilt staffed and operate but he stayed with it he said was that he was told by many people you can do that it's going to be too expensive you can't really carve out that segment of the population ... special et cetera et cetera but he kept plugging away and plugging away\nAnd he told me when I had my first tour of the pediatric orthopedic Institute\nHe said you know this is very very very close to what I originally sketch out in my kitchen [laughter]\nWhen I was thinking about this facility but a great shot out and ... and it it really is a a pleasure of mind to work with him on Wednesday afternoons with the residents and so on\nAnd and my granddaughter did an internship there this summer she's a pre med student and she said it was such a happy place and like I said to you before it's a wonderful facility

you know in Pittsburgh you don't always get sunshine but at least it it it makes that that dream daisy um type ... seemed like a three times bigger and that has to it and even when there's quite a few people in there it doesn't seem crowded right\n... and a lot of mistakes to move around you know\nOkay and one of ...

therapy which one do you want to you and\nI'll be happy if you have any comments takes up so\nYou know and at the pediatric parts of it against the ... the one thing we do have we have someone who

different things to the table sensory me on as well as orthopedic and that facility I'm\nI'm specialized equipment eating um so there's a huge dynamics of what happens there\nOkay and what about a ...

right automotive lawn for texting [noise]\nUm [noise] where do you see no I'll pose this question to you a burst a kitty ... you've been a physical therapist for a while now and where do you see physical therapy in the next ten Fifteen Years what do you think will be different up there\nAre ten to Fifteen Years in your practice of physical therapy [noise] I think\nWhat we've seen even most recently is it that the change in health care in general and limitations\nOn therapy from insurance is being essentially more efficient on our services and really educating the family that this is stuff that they need to do at home that will help them and their rehabilitative process\nOkay and and also a Cheryl how 'bout you do with the\nBroader picture and was five to ... and so on that you're responsible for what ... what do you see out there as far as political therapy occupational therapy in the community\nI think um you know I think we're fortunate in our profession and that I that there is a need to be the children being born earlier we the you know adults aging that continues to happen on but as Katie looted the healthcare environment really makes it difficult we have to look at the parameters that we have for that the patients\nOn you might see as we talked earlier a little bit more and at the ... type ... type of practices where um\nUnfortunately something maybe who can pay for those continued service if might have access to those services more off and on and we don't really want to see it go in that direction but I think there is um some thought about how healthcare drives what we are doing\nYes rather than the other way around them you know when you're just looking at cost you know the ... sometimes it's hard to make those types of decisions you up to you have to always keep in mind what is best for the patient and sometimes I Know that it has to be frustrating for you it is frustrating for\nPhysicians where the insurance companies says well you will give you three weeks mhm or we'll give you for weeks or or or as far as therapy is concerned or you get up somebody sessions per year or whatever and so when you're working with those parameters sometimes\nThose are real negative parameters because you have to try to squeeze in as much you can with the times that you have but I think that the insurance companies are getting more and more cost them about if they can extend the therapy a little bit it may present prevent\nProblems in the future which are going to be more ... or\nYeah I Do think we also are educating our families for our patients so much better too and there's an opportunity to really discuss those things I mean if everything with speech therapy going the Internet or\nA Youtube video that you don't really we really want to see the patient at our hands on the patient but having an opportunity to discuss the concerns that patients have and being more festival in different times\nOkay All right we need to take our
