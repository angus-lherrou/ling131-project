the moderator for this a band I was not drunk\nDidn't give it a second thought\nWhat on earth was I think the\nLine Josh\nObviously I'm not as bright as some of your people in the audience I\nThis is not a game show tonight\nThis is serious stuff\nAnd I can't begin to tell you how much\nAgony and stress I have experienced over these many months because I accepted that invitation\nThe evening was not about me\nBut I've spent four decades hosting TV\nWith impartiality\nAnd what I was\nVery afraid of was that some of you would leave here tonight\nAnd say well our guy didn't do too well but it was only because Trump back was sober clients against him [noise]\nI didn't want that to happen\nVery nervous\nAnd I accept it on the condition that I Would get to do\nNow that doesn't mean we're going to have\nA jeopardy type\nQuiz up here\nI'm not here to embarrass the candidates\nPerfectly capable of doing that all\nBy themselves [noise] but I wanted to do it\nIn a different way\nI'm not a big fan of the traditional\nDebate format where the candidates stand at the lectern the moderator\nAsked the question and the candidate has Ninety seconds to respond and then the opponent has thirty seconds in rent bought all\nAnd I'll tell you why\nIn the audience right now how many of you\nKnow pretty well where are these two candidates stand on all of the issues\nPretty much made up your mind as to how you're going to vote next month\nThat's what I thought\nAnd that's why\nI didn't want to do the traditional debate format because we really wouldn't learn that much but was new so I decided we're going to have a conversation\nAsk questions\n... can challenge\nThe candidates and who knows maybe we will discover something new about their personality their character that we\nBoats gentleman agreed there's only one rule\nThat applies to what's about to take place\nAnd it as a rule that I Will strictly enforce\nI Will not tolerate\nAny bowling or hissing\nNot even if you directed at the candidates [noise]\nSo let's get it done ladies and gentlemen please welcome the Republican candidate for Governor Scott Wagner\nAnd the Democratic\nGovernor Tom oh [noise]\nMr Wagner you won the talk\nSo you get to make the first opening statement place there's a\nPrice for and a half million dollars possibly know Brad Rutter and and Brad Will be coming back\nAs this year to compete for even more money in the jeopardy all stars but go ahead thank you\nGood evening everyone it's great to be here tonight listen\nI never thought five and a half years ago I'd ever be doing a standing on the stage in front of all of you but you know life has its twists and turns in Tracey my lovely wife is with me then I never thought we'd be doing this you know what as a business person\nGrowing up on a farm working hard building my businesses discovering how difficult it was to operate a business create jobs in Pennsylvania I made a decision to run for the state Senate two thousand fourteen\nAnd I served in the state Senate for four years and left this past January\nTo pursue this past\nWhen I went to Harrisburg my expectation in Harrisburg was that it needed help and it needed guidance needed leadership\nAnd it was very apparent quickly on\nLeadership in place so I made a decision to run\nFor this office to be the next governor of Pennsylvania\nI grew up on a farm I'm a blue collar guy\nThe governor had a very different upbringing in a very different lifestyle than I so we'll talk about the issues tonight but I'm honored to be here\nBe here being in front of all of you talk about\nWhat's really going on in Pennsylvania tonight is about the people of Pennsylvania\nThose are the people\nThat we believe you have to believe in we serve\nAnd we need the help help make their lives better thank you [noise]\nGovernor [noise]\nThank you I'm Alex thank you for moderating mission I Want to thank the chamber of gene in the chamber for hosting this and Scott thank you for for running\nUm that's what happens in a democracy and appreciate that you're doing this this is really a referendum on\nWhere we were and where we want to be and where we want to go and when I got to Harrisburg is governor I've been in politics now for three years in eight months about three and a half years and\nI have when I got to Harrisburg we we were not investing in education\nSince I've been governor we've invested historic amounts and education\nWe've invested a in health care or we had almost three quarters of a million people who now have health insurance who didn't have it just three years ago and we're doing something to address the terrible opioid epidemic the base in Pennsylvania\nBut I've done this sort of financially responsible way and balance the budget I put made a deposit in the rainy day funds for the first time in over a decade back in July\nAnd I'm doing it with ethics and integrity I don't take my salary I actually pay my own way on state business we have a gift fan in the executive branch I Am doing these things because I think public service is something different than anything else we do\nAnd so this election is about that do we want to continue on this path do we want to continue doing the same thing we've been doing it for the last three and a half years I'm hoping that I get the privilege of serving for another four years so that I can keep Lou in Pennsylvania forward thank you very much\n[noise]\nSounds like you two are in competition for the civility award next year\nTopped governor almost [noise]\nYou've got the job so I'm going to direct the first question to\nAsk you I sense there is a certain amount of tension\nIn this hall right now so let's see if we can break at\nA early this year shortly after the super bowl or you've got a pretty positive reaction from the audience when you after the words fly eagles fly\nThat started me thinking so please tell me the name of the starting defensive lineman\nFor the eagles who has won two consecutive Super Bowls each one with a different team [noise]\nI guess\nYou're going to want me to put them in the form of a question right now right now there are people in this room who are sitting there saying what on earth is going on here you and Mr\nWagner have come here tonight to talk about politics and policies and here comes for ... straight out of left field with a question\nAbout football that was unfair and I understand that I don't like alright ambush journalism but I did it\nFor a reason and the reason\nIs that a very famous Californian filmmaker won\nPut together some very nasty films about a politician running for office in the California gubernatorial election\nWhen he was taken to task for that\nHe says back off\nNothing is unfair\nSo I'd like to hear your thoughts on that statement\nAnd and I think of the issue I think that set as is not that that people aren't listening I think this is a a a wave this five and a half months people are listening to both sides they're drawing conclusions that their understanding a contrast I think people are listening\nThey don't like what they're hearing from here but they are listening\nTo what our weight around the second point for you Mr Wagner that I wanted to bring up\nYou and the governor disagree\nOn a capital punishment\nHe imposed a moratorium on the\nOn executions in Pennsylvania and executions haven't taken taken place here I Believe in\nYou are in favor of the death penalty and in fact you went even further this year did you not\nI did and I know the first person I'll signed a death warrant\nThis man killed his brother and killed three innocent women want in your county\nHe doesn't deserve the ladies me sitting on death row for Twenty years there was a there was a an assassin his name is Eric fine\nAnd he's a ... state trooper in pike county and in September of two thousand fourteen\nHe will sit on death row for many many years he assassinated a trooper\nJust like he would shoot a ground the hall and he talked about the satisfaction that he got out of taking that triggers ... life and then he wanted another trooper\nThis man is going to allow that\nPerson to stay on death row in\nOf slain trooper and the two sons will never see justice so\nWhen I say you went further you are calling for a mandatory death penalty\nFor people who kill\nStudents for\nUh adults on Capitol or operating absolutely\nI'm going to stand up for innocent people to think that the teachers and students can be in a school and be executed\nAnd killed census Les no you need somebody who's going to stand okay well\nI have two problems with that\nI I'm sure influenced by the Parkland\nShooting in Florida\nFourteen students and three teachers were killed am I correct is that what\nHas been going on for less than we've seen we've seen many incidents\nThat six months before Parkland less than two hundred miles away\nA man walked into a gay nightclub in Orlando and killed forty nine people six months after Parkland another lunatic in Las Vegas shot up an outdoor concerts\nKilled fifty eight feet they should get they should get damaged you didn't call for that at the time you said you're restricted it to school shootings now\nJustice has to be\nApplied equally so that's one of my concerns the other concern\nAh I'm not an attorney\nBut I Know that in Nineteen Seventy six in the Supreme Court Woodson versus North Carolina the Supreme Court declared\nMandatory death sentences to be\nIllegal they left a little loophole in there for murders that are committed by inmates in prisons but they closed that\nIn Nineteen eighty seven so that's\nSet law isn't it you had mentioned that you're going to\nPut forward legislation\nTo change all of that it's not going to go anywhere is is\nAlex life is life\nAnd someone needs to stand up for someone\nWho has lost a loved one and the victim\nAnd that's what I intend to do and I you or you're very right about the nightclub you're very right about Las Vegas\nBut you know what we're going to get tough in the state our law enforcement\nPeople that are on the front lines every single day or not being backed up by this governor\nThey they can leave the house\nAnd to think that somebody can be sitting in a patrol car drinking coffee\nAnd be executed in their car\nAnd they're gone but I mean while there's nobody standing up for them and that person who does that commits a crime and takes satellites should pay all them\nAnd let me just point out that the I think the people who created who committed this crime should write in prison [noise] uh and be punished severely there is a a there was a Senate bipartisan commission looking at what we should do with the death penalty\nAnd their recommendation was a Pennsylvania should continue with the the moratorium so I'm continuing to do with the bipartisan commission said we ought to do a\nPunishment or is absolutely essential and called for for the crimes that were committed there and I think these people should write in prison\nNow Mr Wagner mentioned a few moments ago\nA line that has been used a it was first\nUh it was first used to my recollection the morning after he won the primary one of your packs came out and accused him of being the worst of\nOr your spokespeople have used that phrase many times last night my wife and I were watching TV in the room\nAnd there was an ad that again called him the worst of Harrisburg\nNow and you yourself in a conversation with the can distinguish political writer for the Philadelphia Inquirer John ...\nThe validity of that statement so in three and a half years in the Senate Senate how did this man\nBecome the worst of Harrisburg mode of need to\nLie and I think maybe in some cases we we agree with that said that we need to have a Harrisburg a government in Harrisburg that actually the people of Pennsylvania trust\nWe serve the people of Pennsylvania\nAnd this democracy is best served by people who can be trusted\nSo I think and and I've tried to to live this that in public service we we cannot do things that we might do in\nThe private sector we have to do things in a more transparent and open way for example sharing tax returns we have to do things that actually uh make people feel yes this is a democracy that has legitimacy in my mind and we cannot have folks who\nI think routinely trash that and I think Scott was\nI Do not think a democracy really should have been at its heart\nA driving up from Philadelphia yesterday I noticed a billboard\nFor you Scott Wagner for governor the man greedy politicians fear\nThe most now you have said in the past that you are willing to\nGo into the legislature with a baseball bat and get these people to shape up when you talk about greedy politicians are rich you are you\nThe system the system Alex listen I came to Harrisburg and two thousand fourteen\nI finished our governor Corbett term\nGovernor wolf came in and two thousand Fifteen I was appointed to serve on the Appropriations Committee other committees\nI sat through the first year of of an incredible budget year I ask a lot of questions\nI didn't get answers\nSo I went to our leadership and I said we need to start drilling down we need to start asking due diligence questions like we're buying a business come up with a list of questions\nBut we had a budget impasse for for nine months and the two thousand Fifteen sixteen years\nAt that impair should've never happen\nGovernor ... chose to veto the budget\nHardships were imposed on nonprofits school districts counties\nVirtually every nonprofit organization lost her tc credits in December of two thousand Fifteen I started asking questions I started drilling down because I ask questions\nI'm a bad guy but I Want to know the answer\nI can tell you right now if you do business with a bank and you have some issues going on in your business you better get a master's although I didn't you\nAnd I think about that is that's disingenuous I mean if you look at where we have come from that point to where we are now in June of this past year we pass a budget on time\nWas re election is almost it\nIt all in all\nFairness that applies to the members of the legislature also not just to the governor there up for reelection to yeah they they took a\nIn August off last year they sat for Seventy six days this year the legislature is going to set for fifty one\nThey got no and I understand Scott's frustration the if you look at where we were back when we both to actually you can a little earlier than I just to Harrisburg\nOr things are in a much different place right now we did get a bunch of passed on time we do have a surplus we do have a deposit that has been made for the first time in over a decade into the rainy day fund we do have ethical behavior at least in the executive branch\nThings are different now than they were and it has been a long haul and I think that the the key things are different now than they they were when you and I started and and I think Pennsylvania's a much better place the trajectory is is right and I want to continue that path\nAll right let's pick on somebody else\nA a few years ago I did some work down in Lansdale\nWe wrap early in the day\nAnd I thought I'd take advantage of the time that I had\nTo spare to drive down to Wilmington and visit some acquaintances there and because I have this weird sense of humor it occurred to me that if I were to drive in pretty much of a straight south westerly direction\nIdeologies governor\nYeah actually in the nineteenth century in places legislatures like the U.S house\nWhich is like the U.S house of representatives we had higher turnover rates and and one of the reasons for the higher turnover is who is I think more competitive elections\nAre and I think the gerrymandering has been a the problem is that is what causes the lack of competitiveness and in our elections if we had more competitiveness in our state Senate and house elections I think we'd have higher turnover\nLet's move on to business and taxes because that's one of the high points of your campaign Mr Wagner I'm\nFrom all I've been able to gather\nEven though Pittsburgh and Philadelphia were among the twenty\nA city's contending for the new headquarters for Amazon\nAnd doesn't look like either one\nIs going to be a winner\nOr even though from what I hear Philadelphia put forth a very solemn presentation or\nHow do you view all of that happens where if it works out that way where did they go wrong\n... here's here's our situation Pennsylvania we have\nBetween two hundred and four hundred thousand skilled labor positions open in Pennsylvania\nWe have nine hundred and Seventy five thousand businesses\nIf each business if we just cut that in half to five hundred thousand businesses\nAnd each business hire one person I have no idea where they find a business where they find the employees\nI appreciate you know the the attraction to bring Amazon\nWe chased the Foxconn deal and that would have gotten very rich as a matter of fact it costs Wisconsin I Believe you know several billion dollars\nTo to a local to locate them there\nHow about if we try something new how about if we start treating the businesses that are here like customers\nAnd start being more business friendly roll back some regulations\nAre there [noise] there are\nAgain two hundred four hundred thousand skilled labor positions open\nWe can't find the people for those positions right now\nSo you know Governor Walker\nHas actually been he's been part of the cause of that\nWell as you mentioned that there are a hundred and fifty five thousand pages of regulations\nThat are preventing businesses from succeeding\nHis he responsible for those hundred and fifty five thousand pages if he is he's he was a busy governor\nThree years and eight months ...\nWhere we are has been the creation of Thirty years\nTheir house and Senate members to go to Harrisburg and they they are proud the fact they introduced\nFifteen twenty thirty bills\nWe have to start rolling I didn't go to Harrisburg introduced bills I went to ... to roll back regulations\nThere are two hundred and have regulation on the design an operation and safety and use of ladders\nThe ladder we are going up there's two hundred a regulations probably on the books there that the fact that\nThe wire those wire those regulations in place governor why are they\nGeneral well no you don't want someone dumping the stuff that you're going to have to drink in your drinking water upstream from where you take your water out of the the river so regulation in response for regulation makes makes sense that's that's one of the things that government a responsible government is supposed to do\nOne of the other things is to make sure that we are creating a enough\nTraining opportunities for people to take the jobs the Scott just talked about one of the things that the chamber has been a an amazing partner in June bar was co chair of our middle class task force\nThey made recommendations on what we can do about this\nUh and through the state in the past with less budget is appropriate in the tens of millions of dollars to actually create career and technical education more stem education and we're doing a lot of things to to actually create the training and the skills that the twenty first century economy really means\nThese are the things that government should be doing and I appreciate the the partnership for the chamber of actually getting that done\nAll right you've let us into\nAnother important subject education I'm sure you both agree that the education we provide today\nIs the economy of tomorrow and an educated society as a more prosperous society you have less crime\nLess poverty better health care [noise]\nAh so let's talk about that the largest share of state spending is for education\nNow Mr Wagner I'm going to put you on the defensive for a few moments\nIn two thousand Fifteen you said the state spends enough on public schools you can lay off ten percent of the teachers and they won't be missed\nThen you took a reporter on a helicopter flight over York\nCounty to show how well some of the schools were doing they had pools and tennis courts modern buildings\nThen you criticize governor wolf\nSaying he wanted to raise taxes so he could put\nA billion dollars more into public education\nYou said we don't need it\nThe problem is mismanagement of schools funded by the world government\nThen you said the problem was that most of the funding was being used for pensions and not making its way into the classroom\nThen who revealed your education plan and that called for an injection of a billion dollars into education without raising taxes now it seems to me\nThat you have done a full one eighty you started by saying\nDon't need any extra money and now I'm going to put a billion dollars into education\nThe governor did not put any money in education in the first three years of administer is that it was administration because he didn't sign a budget\nThe legislature did that\nOnly this year to the governor put money in education\nIf you don't sign of budget the money's not going there but here's a fact\nApproximately two billion dollars went into the education system\nIn the last four years the Philadelphia Inquirer that is a story\nProbably in the last month that one point three billion dollars of that to went to ...\nWe have a pension crisis we could've solved that pension crisis first year in office\nThe house and Senate set up a comprehensive pension bill to the governor and he's each other\nHis his the government employee unions didn't want the chain\nBut hasn't he made some pension reforms which you have voted against\nLess than at the end of the day and I don't want to send my colleagues it doesn't do anything it's just what are we talking like twenty million or whatever ask ask ask people in the financial world it didn't do any heavy lifting\nWe need to go into a four O. one K. program for new hires after a specific date we have\nSeventy billion dollar country fight but you did\nYour cattle you can't\nGet rid of that unfunded pension\nOvernight it's going to take time\nAll this is a massive problem and listen it at the end of the day but meanwhile in two thousand six team\nIn one of our pension funds we accepted a return of one point to nine percent\nWhen the benchmark goal was seven and a half percent\nAnd a half percent and we overpaid money managers according to the treasure\nFive and a half billion over the last ten years he nobody wants to do any heavy lifting\nAnd that's what we need to start doing\nThis well this is a lot of discovered not willing to a lot of\nLot of protesting here actually there is a bipartisan effort to do something about management she's not sure you've been very supportive of that we actually had a pension reform bill that both the wall Street Journal editorial page in the Washington Post editorial page thought was really good we do have an unfunded pension liability issue and we've\nGot to do something about that but but we are here in\nPennsylvania doing something that most states are not and that is addressing the pension issue in a bipartisan way well\nAh it's been my experience that almost every state in\nAmerica has an unfunded pension liability problem but let's talk about education we just keep\nPlaying the violin for the next ten

connected than anybody I Know when it comes to Pennsylvania\nLet me just a share a little bit as far as what you heard on Katty Kay radio but both of us agree that alec sure Beck did a great job and obviously did his homework a lot of fire and brim stone from Scott Wagner the man that is challenging the governor and one of the things that he got a little excited about was the death penalty take a listen which you know what\nWe're going to get tough in the state\nPeople that are on the frontlines every single day or not being bought by this\nAnd to think that somebody can be sitting in a patrol car drinking coffee\nBe executed in our car [noise]\nMe while there's nobody standing up for them and that person who does that commits a crime and takes that life should pay\nSo much they discussed tonight and really we only have until ten o'clock to try to dissect it also I'm just going to get to Mr green our political analyst here kitty K radio and one of the things again as I just said moments ago el extra back I think did a a five star performers obviously he did his homework\nYes he did and I think I shared with you um that that he started he called several friends of mine ... reporters calling us\nFrom Pittsburgh and Philadelphia about six months ago so he started is a half a year ago when he committed to doing this event and um and\nI thought he really got into the weeds when he got into reapportionment that's some real inside stuff\nAnd you have to do you're not it's it's it's fine to boys just you have to really go and find it and he did it down to the names um so I was impressed with that although I'm I just had a friend of mine called me from the ballroom um the question was why was that it\nIt's over ... there was nothing anybody could do or say it's been done it wasn't a topic\nI'm so that was kind of a and there was also ... might have been a little bit too much out extra back in ... voice time airtime and um and not enough of the candidates but that's that's quite subjective but that was the feeling in the room\nAll right Doug gerrymandering I came up tonight and one expected it would here is the governor of the commonwealth a Tom Wolfe responding to a question from El extra back\nThe gerrymandering has been a the problem is is this is what causes the lack of competitiveness and in our elections if we had more competitiveness in our state Senate and house elections I think we'd have higher turnover\nYour thoughts on that [noise] um\nI ... the reinforcement process as we just went through his most political I've seen it all my years of watching this\nThis is supposed to be done after the census it's supposed to be done um in ... and coming up and twenty twenty two to reflect the census that you're going to have an twenty twenty and then you divide to state it was done quite appropriately in ... in twenty eleven um\nUntil the Republican control of the Supreme Court was who usually goes along with this\nAh was eliminated and the Democratic controlled Supreme Court didn't think it was fair and they took it upon themselves to rewrite it um and they gave it the state a fraternity to redo it was the house in the Senate did the governor vetoed it so I went back to the Supreme Court and that's why we have Conor Lamb\nOr listen here's what we're going to do when we come back in the next segment you're going to hear some more of the a debate that actually was hurt in its entirety from the Hershey ballroom tonight on kitty K radio but we're gonna talk about what they discussed everything from gas tax to\nEducation and the service tax ah there wasn't much they didn't get to tonight and there was a ... a lot of heavy hitting on both parts when it came to the opioid crisis so\nBill green is here until ten o'clock up until they started the jumbo hadn't show after CBS Radio news\nAt ten o'clock speaking of CBS Radio news we are going to get an update from them now and just a couple of minutes it's Rob ... Monday Night along with our political analyst kitty K radio looking back at tonight's gubernatorial debate he is build green and this is Katie Katie a radio good evening\nAnd and practically every state if we think we have a problem look at California so a pension reform is something that has to be dealt with and that's one of those Tom Murphy the the former mayor here I'm used to say it's the can we keep pushing and and it is just a can of keeps getting pushed down the hill\nYou are a student as you are when it comes to what makes this a commonwealth tick you told me that tourism was the number one is agriculture and second the second and you also talked about how um manufacturing is fourth so\nHow do we get manufacturing to number one which I Believe if you would create more jobs\nNo one would be complaining about the amount of people in the legislature 'cause they didn't when we had two hundred and twenty five thousand steel jobs that were connected with US Steel and I think this opioid crisis would not be such a crisis because people would be working as opposed to walking zombies and lost and looking for something\nWent in ... and really this is affecting people from all walks of life not just in the inner city not just whites not just blacks\nAnd this gas tax in ... and this is where I agree with Scott Wagner\nThey may not think that they're taxing these people enough but this is the only hope and I see it every day but the shell petrochemical plant there should the only hope that we have and they continue in the commonwealth I see it all the time with their banging on people\nTime with their banging on people like first energy the coal industry so we've already lost tens of thousands of jobs how are you going to replace these jobs when you have at least forty thousand in this region in the coal industry\nI Love tourism I Love agriculture I Love all of this stuff but I still think manufacturing has to be number one if you want to survive you got to build things in society not just to survive but to thrive\nI wouldn't disagree except I Would ask you where are you finding employees we we're we're three point nine percent unemployment\nHere let me let me share this with you I'm Scott Wagner talking about skilled labor listen this was earlier tonight at the gubernatorial debate in Hershey question asked by Alex ... moderator we have\nBetween two hundred four hundred thousand skilled labor positions over Pennsylvania\nWe have nine hundred and Seventy five thousand businesses\nIf each business if we just cut in half to five hundred thousand businesses\nAnd each business hire one person I have no idea where they find with those who are they finding a voice\nThat I that that to my point uh we're almost at full employment President Kennedy said if you have five percent unemployment here at full employment in America and right now we're below four percent nationwide three point nine in Pennsylvania\nWe have a lot of people have a lot of work a Robin you know ... what do what I Would suggest people measure is drawn by I a lot of mobility ownership tomorrow\nSo many customers you see in these auto dealerships auto dealership in doing quite well people are buying new cars because of the tax cuts\nFrom from from Washington and and because of ... employees hiring people because of deregulation so I think the economy's going well I Do not disagree with you on unskilled labor but I Would suggest you also that skilled labor is pretty full right now I mean I've talked to ... give us people\n[noise] what did you make of this whole thing tonight did you find anything we're just a glimmer of hope to where maybe the challenger can actually get up off the campus in may push this thing to a decision that we will all be waiting the outcome as opposed to already knowing the outcome\nIt depends on how many people are marching are listening a because it would be a great boost for Scott Wagner or is it a shot while you're in the former state senator from York um\nIs a very dominating personality and he was dominating tonight\nUm but there's a very narrow group that does the Seventeen hundred that were in the room that's a lot of people\nUm is not you know we we have races here were ... million three million votes so some people are not going to be impacted\nWhen it was carried on PC and how many people watch that is a question mark how many people listen I thank goodness for PC and one of the best things yeah it is our governor in ... and then congratulations the cable companies to subsidize I I think that that they do a great job\nAh with no money I mean they have nothing\nBut they they keep it going I'm so so I I think that they are that's not the room for debate I agree with Scott we should have at least three debates free we have three for the president we ought to have at least two or three for for for Pennsylvania you know Pennsylvania is a very unique state\nUm it is to stay with two large urban areas it has stayed with the largest rural population in in the in America\nOkay so we have the we have the the the extremes I'm a big cities agriculture\nAnd manufacturing and all that stuff it's a very hard sick to govern I've been there I was in the governor's office or eight years and I know how hard it is um and that because they are all these constituencies out there wanting their particular share of a pie so it's hard to govern and I think that um I I think that whoever has his job\nAsked his job it's difficult to carry off because the demands that are on the state or are enormous\nGarages show which is on Saturdays two to three that actually sit in the studio this weekend raid that later on who's the man from ... check and that's a great success story in this region ... is there any hope to have more Web tech stories\nAs opposed to those stories of\nCompanies leaving this region I Know meds and eds and and technology everybody thinks of the future but I still think people need to work with their hands and I keep going back to this because it's always been one of the things that I Believe in show in about a minute or so before the break\nWhat do you see you you're saying that the carpenters need people but that's building things I Want to know about\nPeople life sustaining jobs if they're going to work in a place like that shell petrochemical plant and we'll put Thirty years and and be able to retire with a pension unhealthy four one K. I still think that's what we should be focusing on as a commonwealth and I don't see enough of it\nFrom the Democrats or the Republicans especially in this governor's race\nWhen there's only so much you can do you're going lower and lower business taxes or your personal taxes you can make an business environment friendly enough to to just start businesses entrepreneurs to start businesses but frankly at this point Rob our problem is labor we don't have any labor\nSo you can keep asking for jobs and I'm going to tell you there are plenty of junk yard Wisconsin how many jobs are out there and you need more iron workers theme feathers plumbers electricians carpenters yeah okay there are jobs if you have those skills you can get a\nJob when you say to this and I'm I totally am against people that say all Republicans dislike unions\nI don't believe that's the case when it comes to union labor because even our president who worked with great union labor in New York to build skyscrapers they understand if you want to have one you have to have the other and when they get together it's a good marriage yes\nBut why is it that people think Republicans just flat out don't like\nYou because Republicans have a terrible image and Republicans do not know how to improve their image\nA and um you have Democrats who come off as soft in general and then you watch the Senate Judiciary committee and you realize no Democrats not soft and they're tough unarmed is the is the Republicans are that are the wimps 'em and they need to do a better job in marketing and who they are\nAnd something else that Republican and I'm a Democrat the Republicans do care about them or got left and the way things are going back and change you know I'm just kidding but I Know people I said it was like I have the plague or something I'm like what would what just because I support\nThem and you'd be a Republican and the sound for forty years trust us me okay I Am the ... you know you're not\nBut but the thing I Want people who create jobs I don't care if they're a D or an R. I. one J obese that that's what I Want and that's what I see what this president but we come back another thing that people think Republicans are against is education and I think you could hear\nScott Wagner talking about why he is for it and yeah now he's talking about putting a billion and Alex Trebek took him to the woodshed saying it was doing nothing they also said Tom Wolfe meaning Scott Wagner he never did anything for education that was the legislator the legislative of ... the legislator legislature\nThat passed the budget to get that done and now all of a sudden because this election is looming it appears that Mr wolf was willing to a pony up a little bit so we'll come back one more segment with Bill green we're discussing tonight's gubernatorial debate that you heard live on kitty K radio good evening\n... remains you know ... have you noticed in cycles before the shorter time on the scale all the news and then trying some light\nAfter the new\nPoliticians attack each other constantly\nAnd Medicare Social security and other key issues are on the line\nBut this election we can make our voices heard [noise]\nAmericans fifty an over the nation's most powerful\nAnd only we can make to politicians would finding and start six [noise]\nLearn more at a are being done excellent [noise]\nSupport for Katie Katie comes from the Pittsburgh speakers theories presented by Robert Morris university an UPN seen now entering it's sold out twenty Eighteen Nineteen season it Heinz hall Robert Morris university wishes to extend to special thank you to Pittsburgh community as well as the U.

I was going to ... percent hospital for the follow up tests that I had to do\nThan\nLast year my doctor told me that if I Want to keep using them I had to switch to Highmark and which I did you know obviously I don't want to drive the all over the place or keep doing if I don't have to [noise]\nBut so now I'm trying to understand I got a letter but it is you're telling me that I got to go to a cat if I come down with the cats are again of it I Can't go to same doctor anymore basically I feel like I'm just getting screwed and who makes the decisions\nIt's so frustrating I I don't get it\nWhile Bob so first of all congratulations on on your recovery and having to cancer being remission that's great to hear but\nMen what you're saying\nIs the exact reason why we're so passionate about what we do because it doesn't make sense you're absolutely right\nIf you want to go to U. P. M. C. you should be able to go to U. P. M. C. to get your cancer treated but you shouldn't have to drive into the city when it you know I I Know that area I live in bill Vernon I drive past there all the time what are your ten Fifteen minutes away from Jefferson hospital why should you have to drive so far to get treated and and the problem is now\nThere's so many things you said they got me all fired up that I'm going to try to keep it short hair but you're telling me your doctor told you you should switch to Highmark insurance that you can continue to go there that drives me absolutely\nInsane Brian yes because why should a doctor be given you advice on your health insurance I\nI'll tell you the truth Bob I grew up in a family of butchers my\nGrandpa who I Believe probably listen to the show high pap [laughter]\nBut we put your dear he had a deer butchering business for forty years Bob so I learned to use a knife and I'm pretty sure that Brian and that he don't want to be cutting them open to perform surgery on either of them right now no sir\nNow have you heard the jerky that gets made it [laughter] yeah don't come back who even know pointed safer now than\nSo why why would a physician be in a position to advise you won't want health insurance that you should have because he doesn't know all the behind the scenes he doesn't know all your situation he doesn't understand that they may not make sense for you to drive all the way into shady side\nFor routine blood work when you could have done the Jefferson and now because of these contracts and and because of doctors affiliations with one network versus another you're supposed to make a decision and be stock why can't you just have both worlds Brian why does it have to be one or the other\nI have to be one or the other Steve you're talking about negotiated contracts\nAnd that's the issue here right that's the real issue so Bob yes there are options for you there are providers out there there are insurance plans that actually have both networks\nAnd I it's important that we get that out there both networks or recommend calling into the office speaking to one of our representative as well as independent networks trying not to interrupt you but not only both networks but also those independent doctors and hospitals I\nHospitals and independent right but you know where do they fit into this mix right they're negotiating contracts so it's not uncommon and we're hearing it all the time Steve you\nKnow where people are calling the doctor saying my doctor told me I Need to go to Highmark or you know the receptionist at the office that he's right and again you need to pick you PM see nurse practitioners you know these folks are not insurance specialist yet\nThey are giving advice why Steve because they're negotiated contracts money with its money in small about money and I said all along always follow the money it'll lead you to\nThe truth and that's what's occurring here in the marketplace right now and unfortunately Eddie everyone's being bamboozled as a result of it I mean that's just the honest to God truth of all of this most folks aren't realizing the true ultimate impact we're talking about a reduction of providers\nOf specialist PC piece all the way down to the family doctor receive including facilities on top of it\nWell that's the one thing that will give people paying attention and upset quicker than anything the only thing I found in life that will get people more upset than if you mess with their money is if you mess with their ability to take care of themselves Bob listen thank you for calling and get a hold of\nBrian and get a hold is Steve and you can do that by calling eight eight eight eight one eight maybe ... maybe I or medic connect insurance dot com if you'd like do it\nVia the um the international worldwide Web you can call right now that's the mind blowing part to me it's a simple thing I Want to have a bailout bill to me as many options available to me as I can have and\nThat's what you guys are putting together and packaging and it's wonderful and it's a scary time right now too because of the deadline you said coming up\nWhy don't you have that option Nettie\nMaybe we should all have that option Jenny you should have that option Hi Jenny\nHi well I'm Glad you are taking my call yes ma'am on as I said to the gentleman that answered the phone I had you can see for life on the theme is that isn't Seventy five years old and so is my husband and I lost a lot lot you can see for life I've never had an issue\nI'd had had back surgery and other issues and\nI honestly can't even find one complaint that doctors are phenomenal I'm I'm very satisfied and I have a simple question is that going to be jeopardized\nNo you're UPN see doctors and hospitals will not be jeopardized with your UPN the insurance the thing that is jeopardized for you is should something happen\nWhere you're told hey the best doctor or the best hospital for you to go to just happens to be an Allegheny health network doctor or hospital\nYou won't be able to go to that and and look you're going to have great care with UPN say where we're not saying that you're not all I'm saying I hear you as why should you limit yourself to one or the other because\nYou P. M. C. for life is not the only health insurance that U. P. M. C. health plan except\nYou know there are other options that and their options available that will give you the ability to go\nIf you're the ability to go to any doctor or hospital no matter what their affiliation is and if I can stop them real quick Steve Jenny I think what you're referring to is is correct you're talking about the doctors and hospitals have U. P. M. C. and that is the provider network\n... completely different than UP AMC health plan they're two separate entity for one another right so you can still have access to all of the U. P. M. C. doctors and specialist in hospitals and that's fine but\nWhat we're saying is is because certain folks are choosing to and that and that's what we're being told out there is you have a choice it's either has to be UPN the her Highmark it's not necessarily the case now I'm short term problem long term solution and the fact that many other carriers have now come into the region have both networks in plant\nAnd that's the independent networks that that you were talking about\nThe international carriers to Eddie so what is it\nNot be the two big ones that everyone here knows about\nRight I mean you're talking to the United healthcare is the nose to sing those I mean that there's a lot of them out there that have both network so you can still see your doctors you can still see go to the hospitals you want to go to but still have the option because none of us can predict what our health is going to be tomorrow or next year and that's the point we're trying to make you\nTake that even a step further Brian Medicare as an as an organization or as a as a government entity\nSets what these health plans have to cover\nSo it doesn't matter if it's if it's Highmark\nIf it's ... pm see if it's at now if it's a art but it doesn't matter what the name of the insurance company as they all have to cover Medicare permitted or allowed benefits so\nMhm you've had a great experience with UPN see I'm not sure you would have had that experience with any other carrier my position is always why limit yourself if you don't have to\nJenny thank you very much for calling we've got time for a few more calls after the break I'm Talking with Brian Brian Singer and Steve Hoffman of Medicare connect excuse me ... connect to talking about Medicare drifted you\nCan call you can call now eight six six three nine one in twenty or you can get a hold of them and they've got people waiting for your call literally right now standing by live human beings didn't speak English it's weird\n[laughter] age six or excuse me eight eight eight eight one eight six three three for its Pittsburgh works on Katie KIA arguing hordes memory care\nHigh everywhere I'm crystal are and I invited her to my hotel room to talk about your ...\nYour bowl ...\nTheir mind that at the gutter I'm Talking about swapping\nAnd you know that here twenty thousand American Cancer are searching for their life ... on that for us how we can help it's really really simple all you have to deal with ... then got a gift of life dot org ... phone\nThis is Tom scared for the ... project each year nearly two million children die from preventable diseases each day thirty thousand people die from hunger five hundred each our our children the Bergen project is turning this around\nYou know years ago I was diagnosed with cancer unfortunately um thankfully in remission has been doing well ever since but\nAssume that I'm sixty seven years old Stephen I'm On Medicare and I'm I'm One of these plants moved to pick Highmark for example and I have security blue and I utilize doctors in both networks uh I'm seeing specialists may be at you know shady side hospital and um utilizing the Helmand Center for my cancer treatments which is actually what I did\nBut now I'm On Highmark and it's January first two thousand and Nineteen I'm now going to be restricted Eddie from having that option and that's the point we're trying to make here it's not that high mark is bad or you can see is bad it's simply the simple fact that I Am not going to have access\nTo some of those world renowned doctors and specialists that are out there in this city\nAnd yet there is an option to still keep them\nIn people I Believe that message has not been given you know but I was in ...\nBad Brian\nThis system the system is bad well if I have to or whether I have to or not if the system has me so confused that I don't know and I have to ask the questions that caller's we're asking today\nI don't know if that's the system bad but thank goodness you guys are good because you're streamlining a whole lot of it with a whole lot of different options that\nFrom the sounds of it some people don't they don't know they exist\nAnd they don't and that's because they're being told everything's okay right they're receiving communication in the mail from their current carrier whether it be Highmark or whether it be U. P. M. C. what do you expect them to tell you\nIf you're out there today and you and you can hear my voice just somebody call in and tell me what do you expect time or can you be empty that do you expect them to tell you hey we're going to reduce your network by maybe forty percent you're in a way that way\nThey are kind of ways that way or how much is Allison's of doctors right but it's okay\nIt's not okay\nTo me ... and I'm Sorry uh Brian I'm Sorry I I just I have to just speak my mind it is not okay\nI Wish you could see it is getting pretty wound up I don't know about this and I'll go like asking around you that you care about what you're talking about makes me that much more interested in it it's not a recognition of a business a recognition of people need this and you're making this available I just want people\nTo know the truth we're we're talking about somebody's healthier Eddie ... right you know you talk about priorities in life and you know some people usually will put the maybe the top two would be religion family and you know different order but they're usually going to be it's pop to what's number three\nMy health well I guess I disagree with you I think people would have health they might have family first and\nHealth is at least two two plus because if you don't have held that you're not going to church and you're not here to take care of your family I'd say for a lot of people especially older people health is the number one thing and even more so\nAnd if you're a Medicare beneficiary do you ever want to be put in a position where you're making the second best choice absolutely not right and that's what we're trying to say here is that in recent years people have not had to deal with it this particular year people are gonna have to face that fact\nAnd unfortunately the communication coming out from these individual giants right they're they're not they're not going to sell it that way Steve of course right there are just going to listen this as it's not a big issue and that obviously fire as a simple little bit because it is a big issue and people are going to be restricted an access\nJanuary first moving forward and it's a shame but as a result of that Eddie there have been other carriers that have come into the marketplace and they've been here for quite a few years trying to build up this splits going to create a long term solution for us\nBut right now in the short term it's going to ruffled some feathers and people are going to need to start really looking at this seriously and making some decisions soon\nIf there's anything worse ruffling feathers I Would think it's making sure you're able to see the doctor that you want to see but the problem you have\nIt should be doctors or even write a date and well it should be patient driven right yeah their passion absolutely unfortunately that's not the case today eight six six three nine one ten twenty if you'd like to call now it was starting to stack up again I Want to make sure you know if you don't get through to\nGet in touch with medic connect insurance you can call their number they have people standing by right now\nEight eight eight eight one eight M.
