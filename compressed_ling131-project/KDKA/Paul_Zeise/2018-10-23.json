the case for a little bit when he came back in and he saw it again\nWe're talking tonight about look these family gatherings these events that are going to come up these holidays a lotta times people stress about them ahead of time and I thought why don't we call in the real expert of the ... family the true expert\nMy wife Kristin so Kristen welcome to the show\nHello and thank you for having me so\nI'm Talking about tonight we're talking about the family and we're talking about how to prepare and I mentioned uh that we're having you know both sides of our family a lot of families will say we can't put the side and that's why we have everybody and we love it and\nYou host than you do such a phenomenal job my question is and what I think we could talk about is people get so upset\nWhat hasn't happened yet so what do you do what's your secret how do you get to\nTo have such a great holiday well\nI I think first of all the back of it it's it's understandable that\nWe can tend to have unrealistic expectations are on the holidays I mean we went to the mall this week and they went to ... miles around some parents in their Christmas things happen decorations on account down\nYou know to you know ten nine or ten weeks until Christmas and and so when you're living in the world you you kind of this expectation\nAnd this pressure it's kind of put on you know I I think we we try to do at home as\nKind of make a list of what's important like a mental list of what's important what's really important to us at the end of the day I'm you know it's a family time is it is it baking cookies together is that you know playing a board game or playing cards are\nMaking sure that we keep to those traditions so I think you know first and foremost the kind of center\nI can say I just had a lot of fun and things in always go our way but it doesn't matter because it's the idea of it so um I thought I'd share a story from our wedding we planned and plan for our wedding\nSo I mentioned on air we'd been married almost Eighteen years out that and I know happier the anniversary [laughter]\nAnd uh so I Want it during our wedding right we got you know we're playing we have this beautiful spectacular wedding and we ... we were getting ready to be announced and to make it clear for the listeners my name is Dr Christian county uh and they said\nThey end up getting ready to announce it was coming in and they say congratulations to the new married couple welcome Mr and Mrs Donald Carty which is my [laughter] my dad's day so first of all I thought maybe some of 'em married my dad I wasn't really sure but we we didn't\nLive there and it didn't\nLaugh we didn't sweat it but we just kind of enjoyed that time because we what does it rain really wanted to remember and we still think about how much fun not that day was\nYeah our our wedding isn't us whenever we we plant up until that day and we kind of had a pact that whatever was going to happen you know what's gonna happen and so we plant as much as we could and then when it was there with a tight there he just kind of have to say your hands up and like go and have fun and enjoy it because it's not going to go\nYou know exactly the way you picture the holidays you know\nThis is a good chance the snow on the falling softly outside and everybody's going to comment saying exactly what they were supposed to bring 'em go ahead and you know throw that\nLife usually not going to happen that way you can kind of like you always sailing expectations with reality\nAunt Sally might say she hatred potatoes and that's okay you know [laughter]\nI personally I Would really love those potatoes I got to tell you [laughter] so I think that\nUm you know when it comes to a lotta times grandparents have a better vision grandparents just have a plain old better vision and appreciation of the holidays and I think there are probably a lot of grandparents parents out there listening who really get that who really understand that bigger vision\nAnd I think you and I were kind of ... table to come to that early early on in our lives to say you're right like what what really matters what are we going to want to walk away from this holiday with\nAnd you know so that's huge getting the bigger picture is she might be\nOther than we've had good yeah go ahead no go ahead I mean\nWe've had some we've had some great role models you know kind of I think for all of that I Know your parents have always been you know gracious and put so much effort into everything at night and have as well and I think when you when you when you see that um you appreciate that and then as you start to grow and get all those things become important the\nImportant things to eat when I'm corporate into for your children and for your parents and grandparents in front of the family it's all\nRight I okay I definitely agree with that we've had some beautiful role models to watch and have this happen so it but it is a blessing to be able to let go and I think\nPeople do and I'll come back to the point you made about there's already pressure on your right I I kind of forgot about that you're right they're already we went to the mall and solve that uh the Christmas stuff and there's pressure pressure pressure\nI'm from ... from social media maybe from the media say good out their stores and it's understandable that there is pressure to make this moment perfect but it's not about the moment being perfect I think it's about being present in the moment\n[noise] definitely yeah I can I can see that that would be helpful for first time I wanted to take that and not to take that understanding and kind of be present at the whole process\nSo I think it will be good to think look inside a you get inside your mind because you put so much effort I Wish people could really see the spread what you put out I mean it's it's unbelievable\nI'd uh you get inside your mind because you put so much effort I Wish people could really see the spread what you put out I mean it's it's unbelievable because she makes you make more food\nOr you have enough to feed an army so what what is it that you do because you work so hard how are you able to let go what is it you say to yourself that allows you to let go and really enjoy the moment\nI'm honestly ... you know ... during that time that it's really making that that meant a list of of seeing what's really important and and pulling that and you know thinking\nYou know really putting effort into doing things that I think that people appreciate 'em and now as an expectation of of hoping that they'll notice things or appreciate them but now\nThat I'm putting my right after the end yeah I'm doing everything that I'm doing out of care and love and you know however it's received our you know whatever ends up happening is it's just the way uncalled but making sure that I'm On my part\nI can handle on my side I'm putting an effort and I'm being present and I'm going to that mental checklist of what's important to me and and getting those things and making sure that you know doing all the things that are important to our family\nThat's why I called the expert I needed people to hear\nWhat really happens and then the other piece is the anticipation there's a lot of worry sometimes from a different people and I know this is a lot of listeners out there this is hits home for them but they worry ahead of time and this is what might happen and and and then there's a lot of worry afterwards I made a point earlier that there is only the\nSpecific we've we learned is I guess a long time ago which is we don't want to say we've been fighting all day we had a disagreement that lasted a few minutes the disagreement lasted a few minutes and we don't want to make it more than what it was and again that could act for the holidays I mean life goes fast so these moments to get together are precious moments\nAnd I guess my thought is or the dialogue around it as not having people worry ahead of time for it to be but maybe that just comes back to you talking a little bit more about aligning your expectations with the reality you work hard you let go\nRight where where's your focus going to be you know like you could forget to turn the other night and you couldn't have someone cancer last minute and you could have already had a a a play sitting there you could have\nPeople that weren't supposed to come in the in the same room together all the sudden show up so I think you know again I lining your expectations with reality and make sure that you're not setting unrealistic and not achieve of all those\nThings are going to happen you might have a headache that that you might have you know something something might go wrong and that's okay cut back to the to the root of everything what's really important spending time together or you know things that have to go perfectly for them to be on that show\nAnd I think something that has brought us a lot of peace as well is accepting that people are going to have different opinions and that's perfectly fine to have different opinions and people were going to disagree with each other\nAnd it might be a good idea to not bring up huh [laughter] I'm just sitting there on that out [laughter]\nI think that's a great great sidetracked after the after this or in the coming up we're going to talk about someone who asked about family and politics I'm going to deal with that thank you so much for being on the show I appreciate you being in\nFat and they have it getting any\nAll right thank you so that is the\nReal expert in the car in the family that's my wife Kristin ... ah she's the best look if you want to be a part of the show if you want to call in and talk about uh maybe have some some worry hey this is going to happen and I'm worried this is going to happen let's talk it out it's the number's eight six six three nine one ten twenty\nOr you can email us in the

future of\nFuture generations\nThis is joined fall in love his dog and find out how you can become one [noise]\nHey our sugar land join us as we support da national prescription drug take back that Saturday October twenty seven\nAnd now we kinda live in a world where you are there are a lot of different media that are searching for ways to figure out how people can tune in how can we get you to tune in well we can get you really fired up because if you feel like I'm must know what's going on or else I'm In danger and we kind of lifted the fight or flight response\nSo televisions will grow across emergency watch out watch our town and we see it so much and the reason why is it a lesson that I make a fight or flight response\nSo this is no different than if you're driving down the road and someone cuts you off and you get a fear response that you might have just wrecked\nThat fear response sends adrenalin and cortisol through your body\nNow when you have adrenaline and cortisol go through your body can feel really awful because cortisol is linked to anxiety right so you can feel really anxious now how do we get through that anxiety while we lash out and when you lash out of anger you get so mad at that car\nFor cutting you off you get so mad at that person that you lash out in rage\nAnd now let's come back to this whole media thing we can get your fight or flight going and saying\nLook the sky is falling the sky is falling now there's a lot of pressure to tune in and be really angry at the other side and then there's a lot of us versus them mentality so it's my side versus your side\nNow what can we do so let me come back to Mr hills question what can you material do one of the things you can do is be mindful\nOf your own energy if you bring really angry frustrated energy that everybody's so angry and you're only adding to the anger so think about it as we're all drops of water and we're going to go into a bucket\nWhat kind of water are you bringing into the bucket are you going to be that anger water where are you going to be a peaceful sense of water and look the more peaceful drops of water will think about that in terms of a notion that we have some\nPeace in our ocean some peaceful or waves rather than some chaotic waves so\nYes there is so much anger around politics and I really think it comes down to ego art egos tell us\nI'm right I'm right your sides wrong and not only that but you must believe what I Believe because if you don't believe what I Believe well then what if I might be wrong and that scares me and again when we feel fear\nWould rather be angry so we lash out in anger but what if we could set that ego aside how much more different would that be so\nOne of your your your challenge is figuring out how to make yourself a place of peace so you're not adding that chaos to everything that's out there let's go to the phone lines and you're on Katie KIA radio end thanks for calling the show\nFor and how are you I'm hanging in there Tom I guess I just wanted to add on my heart and then passed away in Twenty years ago\nAnd now I mean my final four four and five\nThat's the way it was Twenty years ago and you know I mean my son for four and five and you know I have cats that are relationship with um my in\nLaws but they have been in my mind very verbally abusive Mm over this time\nAnd I mean to to the point that you know my kids would ask me I mean they were all in elementary school and I'm not\nSure which one of them it was but one of them asked you know why don't we go over there every weekend when they're so mean to you mom\n... you know I mean it was it was so bad that even the you know the elementary school kids were noticing it\nRight right right and you know I mean I I'd have to let\nYou know this this Twenty years of all of their\nBS affect me in that I find that I Am I I I think some of those things about myself ... as I've heard them so many times\nRight right right so I'm usually Ohio you're good good do you still have to be around them as what I Want to know\nI'm not right now\nOkay but I Want to go back to your question you were about to say how do I and my wife how\nDo I get back to who I really\nAm and not who they think I Am\nOkay that's an awesome question let me ask you this if your son's if they did that to your sons and told them negative thing after negative thing for Twenty years what would your advice be to your sons about it\nHow would your son's how would you want your sons to get back to who they are\nUm well if they hadn't been doing that for my son's they wouldn't have been doing it to my son's for Twenty years because we wouldn't have been going over there\nOkay so that showed that tells me something right there that tells me something as powerful um about the you allowed to go on for yourself like you didn't give a ... I Would have liked to empower Jew early on\nA but let's start from where we are now so to retail yourself or narrative to re change that narrative because what they were saying sounds like it came from a place of pain sounds like it came from a place of darkness so\nThe real question is how can you retail yourself the narrative if you'd like to stick around we're coming against a break I Would

interview with the atlas with any time\n\nThis is a motion on managed then I'm Dr Christian Conti emotional\nManagement we're trying to manage our emotions these things can get us heated they can get us into a lot of trouble\nSo I had a chance to speak to some engineers this week and they were brilliant brilliant\nA people and one of the gentleman came up to me afterwards and he said you know a lot of times we look at soft skills as unimportant but the truth is he was a manager had been a manager for a long time and he said I realize that they are extremely valuable\nAnd I said you know it's true because no matter how intelligent we are if our goal is to lead others were going to need to know how to interact how to communicate effectively so it's something we all can continually work on so before the break\nI started to talk about the guy had a question about why is a three year old deliberately going to the bathroom and our pants when she does know better and I mentioned a couple of reasons but I Want to throw one more reason that came to me um another reason is if\nThe child is around a lot of yelling then we have to think about\nWhat does a three year old have control over not much right so the only thing she could have control over\nIs whether or not she's going to the bathroom in her diapers so why is she doing that well it might be from an abundance of stress sometimes if there's a lot of yelling going on in a household\nUm kids that age they feed they they feel that stress and think about it that parents of a young child parents can go back and forth and they can argue and that can be very scary for children\nAnd then what can children do they can't do anything about that so they take control of\nThat's the best skill we can give them the second numb to the number two parenting skill\nWas parent's ability to handle their own stress so think about it if parents could handle stress well that was in effect of parenting technique because eight children are watching and they're learning\nAnd be with you they are seeing an environment that is not chaotic and so they don't need to push to have that control over those moments so that's a really important thing to be aware of\nUh all the time I think it's important to be all the time to be aware of that look we master what we practice if we practice\nLashing out we practice\nJust being impulsive where'd you get really good at being impulsive that's what we're going to master so it'll be mindful of what you're practicing all the time we have attacks from the right automotive tech signed\nThe question is do I see private patience thank you so much for that question unfortunately no I Do not I have\nA career that I Am blessed to have right now I I for Twenty years I had a private practice and I maintained a private practice um\nThis last year my career has taken a different turn I Am trying to impact as many people as possible all over the world so um my efforts are concentrated I have some TV projects I have a new TV show that's going to come out on the travel channel I'll tell you more about that when I can\nAnd I'm also doing um a ton of work in the prison system which I Am extremely passionate about\nI'm also speaking across the country around trying to bring awareness around addiction and I am a professional speaker so I spend a lot of time traveling and speaking um so I don't sit still do a ton of work in sports I have podcasts and this radio show and I write books\nSo I'm a busy man and I do not have I'm not in one place consistently enough to take on private\nPatience anymore but I really genuinely appreciate when people ask I really advocate people get into counseling there are so many wonderful counsellors out there are so many incredible women and men who have dedicated their lives to helping others and counseling and\nLook have you ever go sit down with cancer and that counts that doesn't fit with you\nAny counselor worth his salt to her salt is going to say you know what it's okay not where I'm not supposed to be a perfect fit for everyone I Want you to get the best possible help that you can get so they will recommend\nYou know if if a person insist that you stay if their organization that something to look out for if they say hey if we have someone here that'd be great if we don't hear some neighboring places you know we always get leery when we find counselors who are competitive and trying to keep clients\nBut other than that um there are just so many wonderful wonderful cancers out there\nAnd I always said I never wanted for clients because my job was to help people help themselves and then people would eventually get out there and spread the word and I saw that happen for Twenty years and I love love doing that I actually love doing therapy one on one\nBut at this point in my life now I Am not doing that but thank you so much for that question so\nI Want to come to a very powerful email or for the dollar bank instant access from George\nGeorge said I spent the last few years in the military in the marine corps I Am currently a reservist and intending university it's been a few months since I came back ever since I came back to the real world I've noticed that I've been so easily prone\nMayor reservists and I'm tending a university it's been a few months since I came back ever since I came back to the real world I've noticed that I've been so easily prone\nTo being angry I get irritated really quickly for things people do things that they are wrongfully get away with things that negatively impact others and my initial reaction is to solve it or prevent it from happening\nSo I've noticed though because of my first reaction is has gotten me into trouble\nSo lately I found myself struggling to integrate back to the real world and balance out civilian and military cultures I don't want to keep feeling angry everyday but lately it's been getting worse it's affecting my sleep patterns and my workout schedule George first and foremost thank you for your service what you do and what you've done it's amazing you keep\nUs safe second you have been trained to re act you have literally been trained to react to react strongly and to solve solve problems\nAnd then you come back into I liked the way you phrase in the real world although you were all of it is a real world if we're in the world is the real world and you come back here and now being reactive gets you into trouble so you get all that training and the training was reactor react strongly now\nYou have the discipline you have the ability it's time to retrain the way you go about responding to things so\nFirst of all I Do want to remind you we've talked about this on this show in the past about post traumatic stress disorder and I'm not diagnosing anyone on air here through an email but I Am saying this a lot of times when people come back\nFrom the military they see things that are really horrific and when they see those kinds of things that can produce a really intense feelings in you so I Would definitely talk to someone I Would reach out\nFind a couch or social worker in your area sit down with someone and talk that out because really to me I think so many tougher\nMen and women who are in the military don't want to acknowledge it but I say it's like an ACL ... tearing ACL on your knees and I feel shame to talk about it and I don't think there's any shame to talk about the fact that you were trained one way for a long time and now it's a whole\nDifferent direction so amazing super grateful George for what you do super grateful for what you do and I really want to if I could just really reach in your heart and have you feel this go sit down and talked to someone about it um I\nBelieve and you have confidence in you that you can reach train your brain to be able to be able to say look I'm In a situation now where I don't need to be reactive so strongly and even when it comes to solving a lot of times that a great conversation with a young woman today\nWho was talking about a relationship and I said ... at this point you don't need to solve it oh you didn't need to do is be there for your boyfriend makes sure your therefore validate him but you don't need to solve it for him\nAnd that takes a lot of pressure off both of you is trying to solve things\nAnd say it and then also\nAnd went and depending on how young your children are I think what is one of the best things you could ever do is roll play ahead of time what might come up so you can do that sometimes we'll stuffed animals you can do that with dolls or whatever you can sometimes say hey and doesn't have to be creepy it can be a\nHey I'm don't touch my feet and then you have the dollar cuts the other person's feet and you say no that's not okay and you role model exactly what you would like\nYour child or children to do and you do it in a fun way proactive way but think about this children learn by watching they learn they might watch a TV show and they're going to learn something so why not act that out ahead of time\nWe have found in our family that when we talk about things ahead of time it sets our daughter up for\nSuccess in other words if we're going to go to an event\nShe's ... when when your parents your children are experiencing life you're bringing them all these experiences\nSo I Believe it's our job is parents to guide our children and they're not supposed to come into this world knowing exactly what to do and if we don't prepare them for something with my dad's long standing advice to me has always been what you prepare for what you anticipate is rarely a problem\nSo what you prepare for is never as much of a problem is what you don't prepare for so all the time we have always done this with our daughter we say okay here's the situation this is what you're going into let's think about if the situation goes this way\nIt's on this with our daughter we say okay here's the situation this is what you're going into let's think about if the situation goes this way let's say goodbye to the situation goes that way slap spent Twenty years doing therapy with people doing that all the time saying let's row play let's let's talk about this\nLet's say you want to go to your boss\nWhat do you want to say your boss while I Want to say I hate you okay well let's set that aside [laughter] let's say that in here let's practice that now what's gonna happen there I'm gonna get fired okay is that what you want now All right now let's figure out a different way to say it so let's come all the way back to this question from the tax\nFor the kids and when should they sleep over it I don't think there's a magic age that's up to you I don't think there's a\nA right answer if there is I don't have it but I Would say whatever you feel comfortable I Would definitely invites you to find out everyone who's going to be at that house and as much information as possible look a lot of times\nWhat the unknown is is scary and so again it also has to come with the understanding that I have spent Twenty years specializing in working with people convicted of violent crimes and working a convicted of sex crimes so I've done a lot of work in this area\nWhich obviously makes me my view a little bit more skewed than most people's I recognize that uh my wife is great reminding me of that that that's a you because I spend my days I'm working with people who have done harmed others that I'm probably a little bit more heightened to it than most people\nBut I Would say I would I Would personally want to know where is my child going to be sleeping I Would want to know who's going to be you know who has access to that room I'd like to do all that kind of stuff is going to be there what are they going to do what are they going to bed what are they doing I'd like to know I Want to be involved um\nAnd so that's what I my guess as any parent their rights in about that also wants to be involved and also is involved so I Would say definitely have the conversation if it's uncomfortable\nOne of the best things you could ever say is this is going to be uncomfortable and it's okay 'cause you got a role model that you can get through something that's uncomfortable and it's OK\nAnother tax from the right automotive tech flying from Gabby says is it necessary to work on past traumas or just try to move forward what a great question Gabby so\nThere was an old school thought on this that you had to work through anything right this was an old school mentality this was a belief it was kind of dog my in the field of counseling psychology for many many years you must work through it if you're if you went through it you must deal with it\nBut we found out a probably nearly Twenty years ago now that that not only is inaccurate but actually can cause a great deal of harm in other words you can literally induce\nPosttraumatic stress in someone by forcing them to talk about something that they don't want to talk about and are ready to talk about\nSo here's the thing human brains operate\nIn different ways unique ways some people they need to deal with past trauma and here's my guideline is the guideline I've used through the years if it's still bubbling up\n... as a bubbling up so if they're still abolition there it's still bubbling up and it's coming out in places where you least expect it then yes I think it's important to talk about yes I think it's interfering with your with your life in the present moment so it's worth talking about but if\nIt's not interfering whatsoever and you just kind of someone told\nIn the present moment so it's worth talking about but if it's not interfering whatsoever and you just kind of someone told you hey I think I'm supposed to talk about this 'cause I've encountered that at a time where\nPeople say well someone told me I'm supposed to talk about it because I kind of also had that too it doesn't bother me it doesn't impact my life in any way but they told me I should talk about whether or not say do not you don't have to go there and here's here's again why for some people\nOnce the brain shift and says I'm ready to move on it moves on and it doesn't need to process that\nFor other people it's it's there and you are not wrong or bad for however your brain process is that it's just normal so if the impact if the trauma Gabby of whatever it is\nIs still present for you if it's coming out in President relationships in President moments in your life then yes go ahead and talk about if it's not\nThen it sounds like you'd be good to move forward and be where you are what a great great question it's this is why there's no just one blanket answer for everyone we are all profoundly deep and we all have a lot to us and so that's why\nThis this personal that's why this is ongoing speaking of ongoing this show will keep keep going on eight six six

[noise]\nDawn says in this section\nI have a question for your senior meteorologist\nDo we have to run or more out of gas now\nAnd a bit more here that are interesting to me to the level that officers were undercover for this particular incident I can rationalize in my head why police officers would consume alcohol wow in the line of duty and they're in deep cover where they're trying to infiltrate a gang\nYou wouldn't expect them to be the only sober guys that were there right but that's not the way I'm understanding this particular case\nMhm no and that's why we have an open investigation\nAnd what is it that you are looking to discover well\nThere are a lot of issues that were that that emerged from that the video that people are saying and what we've learned from talking to people and you know you have your usual issue around on becoming conduct you have your issue around the use of alcohol that has to be clarified because as you said\nUnder deep cover you're going to have some kind of compromise to any policy that says you can't use alcohol um but what are those guidelines applied to our Pittsburgh undercover in plainclothes officers or we want to establish what that is I'm looking at the use of force that was\nA parent in this situation whether it was appropriate and reasonable um\nGiven the circumstances or was it sadistic in nature there's\nVideo that shows one of the individuals being held by an officer while other officers\nUm fist strike him in the head like numerous times more than a couple of dozen times I'm so and and we're looking at the ah purpose initially why they were there and the first place this bar is not known to be a particularly rowdy nuisance type of\nUm bar that has clientele that are always in in and out of trouble or disturbing the neighborhood so\nI guess in their criminal complaint against those guys they said they were they're investigating a complain about drug dealing in the bar or right outside the bar\nI'm Wondering if that was whether or not that's accurate is that is that true or was there some self assign investigation going on here so we're just trying to establish why we're there and while they were there what were they doing and was what they were doing appropriate and consistent with the euro policies\nAnd then of course you know how this\nTurned into a brawl that it did um\nYou know how did that happen and the video that's available um helps\nYou know because there's there's a lot of it there's many hours of it so you're able to develop a bit of a context into the engagement between the parties between the officers and the folks identified as pagan um there was a moment there were they were very cordial with one another\nAnd then it erupted so I'm trying to understand the dynamics of that engagement and and and why it ended up the way that it did\nDo you have access to the full video you said it could be hours do you have access to all of it yes have you had a chance to see all of it at this point\nI'm most of it\nWhat will you be doing it as you are going through this I'm guessing over and over again um how long do you believe it will take you just from the video alone to be able to draw any conclusions and will your investigation include any interviews of the suspects witnesses or\nFrom the video alone to be able to draw any conclusions and will your investigation include any interviews of the suspects witnesses or the police officers\nOh absolutely it'll involve all of that um the board mates tonight at six o'clock at banks full recreation center and this will be their first opportunity to review of what we know about it this far and we're asking them to authorize a full investigation\nAnd that gives us until their next meeting which is December December of force\nUm they'll meet six o'clock December fourth council chambers at that point they will review the results of our full investigation which will include the interviews you suggested on the gathering of additional evidence um whatever transpires within the court process involving these folks\nAnd we'll give them that information in December and they'll decide whether to go to a public hearing or to dismiss it\nWhile you're conducting this investigation are there any limitations on the officers that are involved into what duties they are able to perform\nNow that's purely up to the chief of police to determine what kind of a duty there'll be involved in if there would be any curtail men or if they will remain full duty as they are now\nYou mentioned the violence that was brought upon um a couple of the members of this pagan motorcycle clubs and you use the term sadistic you're trying to determine what how were you using that term\n... was it necessary to gain control of the situation or was it just ... I'm a bar fight that was not necessary for any legitimate law enforcement purpose this man was um\nHe was he was hit many many many many many times while he was restrained by an officer\nSo I there's a there's a concern there as to why was that force necessary and if it if it can be determined as reasonable or not reasonable I you know I I don't know we have to evaluate further but um that's what I'm referring to\nAnd do you also then have a heightened level of concern regarding that as apparently one portion of the video appears to show when officers saying I Love being a cop just shortly after the broad does that mean anything to you should mean anything\nWell it certainly suggest that it that that particular officers'\nUm sobriety and his attitude needs to be assessed\nThat did not appear to be inappropriate comment\nComing from an officer was just involved in a very significant physical altercation after having sat in a bar for several hours and you know there's another side to this which is officer safety which is a concern of ours as well\nIf they are permitted to use alcohol what is the limit to that alcohol and is there any I'm concerned about\nIt being unbridled in the sense that these officers if they're carrying weapons which we know they were because one of them kept flashing his weapon if they're carrying weapons and they're driving vehicles and they're doing it in as a police officer a city of Pittsburgh employee\nThat's very dangerous not only to other people in the general public but also to each other\nSo you know there's a lot that we're looking at in

so net next week maybe the only time we can milk you at least in the near future\n[laughter] oh yeah you know what two weeks site you just said that now and I kind of my heart just dropped like seven counties down for so long and it's it's finally here\nOh a you'll be busy that night I assume like running all over\nYeah I'll be at the uh the Conor Lamb election night party that's my assignment\nOkay well that could be a good place to be so let's start with that um are you also you mentioned to me right before we went on other you sat down with Keith Rothfus his opponent or what yesterday\nYeah yesterday at a even parking swiftly so what's going on and Keith Rothfus has had cases I'm very confident right now that that the polls are not are exactly correct again the polls the only two major pieces of polling of said that he is down by double digits but um he really thinks his message of\n[noise] hey I'd I'd be thrilled to debate the living daylights a\nOut of both view on this topic I I don't see this as a referendum on the president um I I Would tend to believe that this is more of a case by case basis because if you look at the approval numbers\nBut then you look at right because of the approval numbers were high he would generally see that trend more towards I guess in this case Republicans but that doesn't necessarily seem to be bearing out at least in the house races\nOkay thanks for your call I think we were just saying that there's some degree of um\nThe local candidate obviously if you prefer one local candidate over the other may not give a ... by the president but at least at the congressional level certainly it is to some degree I'm a referendum on the president as you pointed out or is it is always are usually or to some large degree when it's the midterm in the presence has been there two years\nYeah and and one more thing that's different about this cycle is that I mean it's an every race every ad every speech and every debate you have a candidate either drying himself toward the president directly using his name\nAnd you have the other side of trying to you know label him a Trump supporter label her a Trump supporter and that is something that at least in my experience covering politics hasn't been the case in in past midterms\nAre eight six six three down one ten twenty we're talking about the ah big elections the mid term elections two weeks or from tonight uh so Scott Wagner Mr Gulf shoes I assume that since he threatened to stomp\nOn governor will face a with golf shoes while wearing a catcher's mask and a Facebook Live video\nOr his poll numbers have unnecessarily trick trickled up as a result or at least not that we've seen\nWell he's he certainly had a tough couple of weeks but the problem with this race is that\nUm you're not seen debates and this is something that Governor wolf has been criticized for since the beginning of this race and that's you know normally there are three televised you know full length debates and the governor only agreed to one that one was without trip back\nAnd it went extremely poorly\nI'm not you know he didn't get good reviews either duty I'll extra back oh oh no and he he does he ended up talking about I did that oh well it was more of you know let's try\nTo get the biggest name we can for this dinner because it's a dinner that they do that Congress has dinner and the chamber of commerce who hired Alex correct and Tribeca ended up talking I think someone did analysis and said forty seven percent of the the air time\nWas devoted to him pontificate in about\nThe different issues and you just didn't get it was it was a really bad for Scott Wagner who needed a huge performance that night\nBut the problem with this race is that yes the polls say double digit lead consistently for governor wealth but he hasn't taken the debate stage so you're not you're not able to track this in any way that that really matters\nI mean most of the time since I've been observing politics obviously if you're if you have a significant way there's no reason to make\nSure and he's an incumbent and he's playing the get to the goal line campaign and and that's an approach that has worked obviously very well because it's the same thing chicken or the egg the polls came first and this in this case but\nThe goal line campaign and and that's an approach that has worked obviously very well because it's the same thing chicken or the egg the polls came first and this in this case but\nYou know at the same time as a journalist as voters we should expect you know a number of debates between these candidates especially because this is a legitimate opponent this is a state senator uh you know a multi million dollar businessman\n... isn't somebody who just you know rose up out of nowhere like in the Libertarian Party who wants to challenge him this they should have debates and governor ... should should expect\nNo right I yeah generally speaking as a it'd be nice to hear from them more rather than less right of course\nRight but if you're a governor wolf I mean why would you write why would you do it yeah sure\nAre and how does the battle between um Lou Barletta and Senator Bob Casey\nWell or to be honest with you the the Lou Barletta campaign isn't the happiest\nWith yours truly right now because um I I wrote a story\nThe other day it came out yesterday that um basically said national Republican groups have totally been on the sideline for this race and I looked into the campaign finance reports and found that if you picked for donors from his regular campaign finance report\nThey would have donated more money than every single outside Republican group combined\nUm every single group including the national Republican Senatorial Committee these are groups that spend millions of dollars and they've been completely absent from the Pennsylvania Senate race and it's because the other plane all over the country it's a really tough map but at the same time analyst told me that\nLou Barletta didn't do anything early to show them that he was even worth investing in\nWell why are they matter that you do you think and I say that because I assume oh you're just did was look at the fact that they showed that uh the national Republican there weren't any money into campaign\nRight I mean factually they said that my story was absolutely correct but I mean there's always this I'm behind the scenes war between journalists and their campaigns about you know and it's of course they want fluff up a little bit they want a story that looks at\nYou know the platforms than we do those things that's the thing I mean we do stories about their platforms in their backgrounds but sometimes you have to point out you know rather embarrassing fact but I in the story\nIt's not embarrassing for Lou Barletta this is literally just circumstance I mean this is Republicans don't have enough money to cycle to spend here and a guy who could have been really\nYou know a good candidate somebody who would have given Casey a run for his money just was left alone like stranded on an island\n[noise] have you ever heard of ...

the gas is cheaper\nAnd you know we need some changes in Pennsylvania\nOr John thanks for your call I don't know if that one impassioned campaign speech is going to be much to change things um but I Would assume the answer your first question is you you would distance yourself from Trump if he wasn't popular in your district or you suck up to them if you're a Republican and he was popular in your district\nShore and and just um you know as a matter of fact the campaigns around here I I don't know a single Republican candidate who actually\nHas tried to distance himself from Trump\nJust um you know as a matter of fact the campaigns around here\nI I don't know a single Republican candidate who actually has tried to distance himself from Trump at all I mean even Keith Rothfus doesn't mentioned Trump as much as some other um you know congressional candidates do but he still is live or die by the Republican tax cuts which I mean it was a Trump Administration deal here um\nBut you know to to respond to the caller there I don't really think that people are distancing themselves from Trump around here you you have the top of the ticket here in Pennsylvania with Barletta Wagner fully embracing the president bringing him to town at least on bar let us part and and standing by literally everything I mean in in our letters recent campaign ad\nIt was all about you know um it was actually at Trump's rally it was it was a clip from that and when he said I'm In a stand for the flag and you know you know it was about the only for the ...\nSo yeah I mean I Know candidates around here seem to be very concerned about distancing themselves\n[noise] um and the economy is good although there are many who would argue that even though more people are employed them in a long time many of them crummy little jobs that don't pay that much\nI was recently in the criminal job that didn't have that much until I got lucky to get a a better job or not long ago but I can certainly identify with those who are employed but poor um and if the economy ended up itself\nWas the golden a key to a successful election then the ... the way it wouldn't even be possible at least in the U.S house of representatives\nRight certainly certainly um I ask Keith Rothfus about this yesterday and said\nThat uh you know it's going to come down to November ah who believes they benefit the most from the Republican tax plan if middle class voters think that the tax plans working for the economy but don't think that it's benefitting them personally and if it is benefiting them personally if they don't believe it's because of Republicans that's a huge problem for the GOP but you know\nAt least ... and other candidates I've heard um you know point to these opportunities on programs they point to places where you can pour investment into you know lower performing communities and you know that's their way of saying\nIt's going to get a little bit better here in the future for everybody but for now you know there's a lot of research that shows that have ... and we talked about this last week a lot of research that shows the tax cuts definitely benefited people who are in the top ten percent of the country\nAnd that's what the most people's including the polls eight six six three and I want ten twenty more politics than the other side news radio ten twenty ...\nIf you don't

to see after the age of Trump where we go in journalism where we go in the political discourse I Want to see the lasting effects that this has\n... that's just so bizarre that it's not bizarre because\nThat's Donald Trump moral somewhat used to an hour for not used to at least we can expect it but to say that gang members and middle Easterners are in a caravan coming up here when there is zero evidence that there are I was watching a guy and it was on CNN the other day or maybe or maybe it was MSNBC and\nThe host was asking this Republican uh hey a Trump says there's gang members and a middle Easterners and there aren't any and he said well but even your reporters have said we didn't talk to every one of the\nFive thousand people so we can't literally a thousand percent guarantee\nThat and I just thought that free to kill us\nThere's no evidence that any of them are there there's no reason to believe therefore that there is anybody there\nYeah and the if the burden of proof is on anybody the burden of proof is on the president of the United states the burden of proof is on the person who makes a claim saying that you know there are people here meaning that he should\nHave seen evidence to prove that and he should you know give tax payers the same evidence that he has that's why we care about it that's why facts matter and you know that's why\nOh give tax payers the same evidence that he has that's why we care about it that's why facts matter and you know that's why the spin machine coming out of the White House um is the way it is just two weeks before the midterms\nYeah alternative facts I guess you can read enough to alternative facts um\nSo do you just pay any surprises I mean somewhere across the country there'll be a surprise but uh in Pennsylvania or does it all seemed pretty predictable\nIn Pennsylvania it seems pretty predictable and that\nThe house races are going to be very impactful on the national scale I mean it's going to help Democrats a lot here with a lot of pickup opportunities the the Senate and governor's race with a double digit leads for the Democrats in both cases\nI you know not many people are able to pontificate and say one way or another how the challenger is going to come through and pull it off\nIf I were to pick a legitimate upset\nIt would have to be and and this is you know again I'm not in the business of making picks but in the fourteenth congressional district in Westmoreland County in that area\nUm you have a Democrat running their ... we talked about a little bit last weekend and also loved her name because it was so much fun to say and the name of her Republican opponent guy reschenthaler Russian hum you know maybe ...\nHas such an incredible amount of support and Westmoreland County that she's able to run up the vote totals a lot there and the only way that I could see\nGuy Russian Fowler not winning would be that he didn't put the enough effort into his campaign because he thought Republican territory gonna come through for me so even then that's a stretch\nGotcha so you're saying if there's any possibility of an upset that's it but you still wouldn't pick that up set\nTo happen yeah yeah sure you know what also if you want to consider the rough is lamb race if you want to consider Ross is winning and upset which I don't think it is I think both of them have a shot at this and it for us this wins that night I'm going to thinking to myself\nAll right yeah I mean he's an incumbent he is well known in the area um that that wouldn't be a miraculous upset to me but if you consider that that that also has a very big chance of happening\nIt does you're saying\nI I Would say so I'd say it's not impossible that rough as could win and European no definitely not definitely not as the battle of the the congressmen it's about the incumbency has a lot of money he has a lot of support he has a good campaign that are at him or he Keith Rothfus a key profit okay yes I'm I'm not saying that that's going to happen I'm not saying that the polls are wrong but\nUh you know in a race like that where newly drawn territory with a lot of questions facing you know\n... only been in Congress for a couple of months Conor Lamb ran in a in a special election that had national attention I mean how are these going to impact the election we're not going to have all the answers until the results coming in\n[noise] ah but apparently they are a number of Democrats are in Pennsylvania said why do I have a chance to uh when democratic congressional seats\nYeah yeah they do um a couple of women as well which is big because Pennsylvania is never had or not never had doesn't have a woman and the congressional delegation right now I'm there will be one I think it's in the sixth district to a woman is running against a woman so that also has one really good news for Pennsylvania um but yeah Democrats have an opportunity to pick up a couple of seats here and\nI'm more being named among probably the two most important states or in the country\nFor congressional races in terms of the Democrats need to pick up enough to take control the house\nI hear a commentators and analysts say the ... the Democrats are gonna have a chance for a significant blue wave the young people must turn out and there is some skepticism that they will\nThey they got to turn out or their registering in record numbers all over the place they register to record numbers here in Pennsylvania um people under the age of thirty five now outnumber those over the age of sixty five\nIt was all over the place they register to record numbers here in Pennsylvania um people under the age of thirty five now outnumber those over the age of sixty five\nAnd you know after the Parkland shooting a you know it it energized young people all over the country to not only registered to vote but you know have a movement of\nOf thought and have a movement of advocacy and you know a lot of Democrats thinks that that's certainly going to translate yeah here in a couple of days but it's I mean if the Democrats are going to have a huge wave\nIt's going to be because of young people if the Democrats are going to have a moderate sized wave\nIt's going to be because you know this was this was going to happen anyways I mean this is all the stars have aligned for them um but you know the key will be there there are a lot there's still a ton of old voters you know forty four percent of the Pennsylvania electorate is over the age of sixty five\nThey care about issues that the candidates and the Republican Party are are hammering home like Medicare Social security\nSo I mean it it could end up being like that where we get the results and we're like oh yeah I mean people over sixty five showed up and the and people didn't again [noise]\nTheir habit or let's do one more southern with Julian route shall we we shall a dean from the
