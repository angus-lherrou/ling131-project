extending this to seven o'clock\nUm because you want to make sure we got everything covered a dancing really is here with me now are you are out you were out in squirrel hill earlier\nToday we then I I was stony and obviously my background you know is a is a sports guy out you know we did we dabbling news a little bit but the magnitude of this story I think it requires an all hands on deck and uh I got two squirrels hill at the corner of a\nA Marie avenue and uh\nIt was a quite the scene of reporters kind of converging on the scene\nAnd I actually uh before I I got to where reporters had had converged I I did see a number of a city state uh officials kind of converging I was where I wasn't supposed to be and I was kind of shoot a way out of that area and you were able to obviously see\nThe concern and the trauma on the faces of uh the leaders in the ... you know what's going on and they they know what's going on and I guess the the biggest thing that I took out today stony is looking into the eyes of\nUh guys like Keith Rothfus Conor Lamb Congressman Mike Doyle um boy that was a\n... it was a heavy heavy day and you could tell that obviously they the magnitude of of what has happened or has not been lost on them a including um a hit his rich or the public safety\nIt's happened ah has not been lost on them a including um a hit his rich or the public as safety director the city of Pittsburgh um he was particularly I think move by what exactly occurred today\nYou know I saw that in you know when he said I've seen your airplane disasters and things like that and and he caught himself a couple of times you realize wow that must have been quite a carnage inside um that's in a\nGod as he was delivering I guess his first update earlier in the afternoon or probably happened what around one thirty or so you know um you could tell that he was\nA I don't want to see deer in headlights because I think he did remarkably well considering the circumstances and what had just happened to ... hours prior but uh I was literally standing right next to him at the front row seat and he\nYou know the the lip was quivering and and the eyes were starting to well up because uh uh apparently what he saw and what he had been told is it was uh\nExtremely extremely gruesome inside tree of life and that's a tough\nPosition you know for somebody like his route to be in or anybody of being at that time because you want to tell the story that that's being that that's happening\nAt the same time you want to exude a certain amount of confidence but at the same time you're a human being in that stuff touch\nAnd you know day overtime developed a thick skin they deal with a lot John a day in and day out basis so it takes a lot\nStony to rock their world and today I can say a unanimously across the board or you could tell that the armor that they usually have up as leaders it was pierced and it was appears to severely\nNow what was the um you you are there are in an interesting um position or you know in that neighborhood why the violence it hits had ended but still there was all this going on you know the various houses and the uh upper long Marie ah what was that life\nWell it's it's a surreal scene because parts of Marie avenue with the breathtaking architecture yeah ... hill does provide\nIs usually the backdrop of a movie with mature trees lining the streets and slate in title robes and three thousand square foot brick homes that are three stories high\nOr that or you know were built in the Nineteen twenties that people just marvel at yeah ah\nAnd then to go ahead and take the the adjacent home in put police caution tape yellow tape all the way around that really I think he is he is a sobering sobering slap in the face and then to see\nA number of armed guards with assault rifles marching by that doesn't write down Marie avenue or something obviously that his Pittsburgh or seen are kind of quaint little town it it it really is a is it really really hits home that are nobody at all is immune\nA but as news continues to come out of this story or we will keep bringing it to you well into tomorrow morning as well and certainly with Larry in\nJohn on Monday I'm a\nPoll Rasmussen is in the newsroom he's he's been called in on special duty and he's been here as rose Ryan Douglas has been for most of the day today a Paul you had a a report early on that I thought was very revealing when we were still\nTrying to figure out what the what what the final tally was going to be of of those who have lost their lives and you were talking about\nUm this website that the shooter had been on it originally had been talked about him being on Twitter but you cleared that up very quickly ... what what what have you found about\nBefore I Do that stony I have some breaking news to pass along the leaders arrived just minutes ago President Trump has just told reporters who will be traveling to Pittsburgh to\nRespond to synagogue shooting there's no details are available yet but he is going to come to Pittsburgh now she's in Indiana now so that's not that far away yeah a civil will pay close attention as soon as we find out what when and what's going on well we'll give that to you now are the ... you're talking about of if these posts were made\nWas a gab dot com G. A. B. B. S. dot com and it's a it's it's it's in its presentation if you go there and look at it the format is like Twitter is very much light sweater and Bowers of Robert powers the alleged shooter\nOn his profile on his\nPage there would get there he opened back in January twenty Eighteen said Jews or that\nRebel hours the alleged shooter on his profile on his\nPage there would get there he open back in January twenty Eighteen said Jews are the children of Satan so we know he's anti Semitic and they'll gather was able to put out a statement that said they were disgusted by that they'd be activated the site\nOr and they they made sure that they we account was verified they matched the name and the shooter's name which was you know\nGiven to them by the authorities sign and then they contacted law enforcement after suspending its so what we're looking at online now is an Internet Archive of Robert Bowers postings on gab dot com it's a website called Web archived dot org and you can look at some of that there if you want you\nTo give you some idea it let's get an X ray of\nOf of the kind of thinking that's going on here about ... posted mostly\nUh things that were ... you know placed on this foreign by others I see so he wasn't doing from what I can tell at least recently he was doing mostly re posting not anything original of his own\nAnd like he posted before he went to the synagogue ever allegedly went to the synagogue this morning so but here's an example of a of a re posting\nThat it uses language I can repeat on the air a lot of this uses slurs or or language that's just not you can't repeat understood\nJews are waging a propaganda war against western civilization\nAnd it is so effective that we are headed toward certain extinction within the next two hundred years and we're not even aware of it you are living in a critical time in history where the Internet has given us a small window of opportunity\nTo snap are people out of their brain washed so there's all fits into this larger anti Semitic view that there is a Jewish conspiracy\nTo destroy American culture western civilization and in particular white people\nAnd is there is are these his words or is that our ...\nWhat I'm saying if someone else's which is the ... over and over and over again you'll see posts that denied the Holocaust that the they say that the Holocaust didn't happen that six million Jews were not\n... we're not ... the murder you know wiped out in the second World War you'll see posts about how President Trump is a puppet of a of the Jewish lobby you'll see posts that ... that you know you don't talk about the Nazi movement\nAnd and neo Nazis and he was all over this and yes he was it was that so this is why uh and so much of what you see posted here is not you can't repeat\nYeah because of this lawyer is ... is terrible yes lawyers that are used in the uh the language that is you do you see\nThere's a posting here that he re posted a\nAnd one of the things that by the way that really animated Bowers according to what we're seeing here is is that\nIs this immigration ... and in particular refugees being brought into the United states by a group that he had posted against just this morning a group that\nYou know their main goal in in their uh on their website is is to help people be relocated away from war some certain ... certain kind of peril yeah you know people who are in\nIn need well are you talking about the the Hebrew immigrant aid\nSociety that is exactly right and this is the group with which he had a problem or a beef right before the shooting he said HI a as the the group we're talking about likes to bring invaders in they kill our people so he thinks that people are being killed by refugees and he says he can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered\nAnd I'm going in and so that that was the last posting on gab dot com from a Robert Bowers\nWe know Paul why he chose this particular synagogue\nThe on gab dot com from a Robert Bowers\nDo we know Paul why he chose this particular synagogue no and then I had been able to make no connection between\nH I S and this particular synagogue I Do not know if there is one I haven't been able to find one yet and he kind of the national Shannon so he wasn't exactly in the neighborhood I think Baldwin as long as Baldwin now but you know it's\n... it's a I guess it's just a a general thing with Jews period I don't know that it's you know anything specific he may have been animated by the refugee question yeah the issue of ah had hit and it may have a a a link to immigration for all we know yeah but uh and he was angry with the president he didn't feel that President drifted\nA article that I read not too long ago also I wanted to throw this and we picked up a good uh reporting work in the Tribune review a few minutes ago you know I read where a\nHe has no criminal history and Pennsylvania according to go on line records ... did have a traffic ticket in twenty Fifteen in Butler County that he pleaded guilty for and he was cited in cranberry township for unlawfully operating a vehicle\nOr without identification Marcus I'm not quite sure what that is\nAnd he does not have the political party affiliation on his voter registration according to this article and the Tribune review so it really doesn't seem to be political in nature is most of it is you know just hate and yeah racial yeah\nWhich is so very very dangerous and as you say on that on that website there are also those that are are are are re posting and reading all those other things\nAre and who knows who who else reads that stuff and goes okay or they think they might be next to take action like this which is terrible\nWhy one of the other things that occurs at the same time though is is that the people who were otherwise unaware of this kind of thinking yeah really how many times in your lifetime of you had a conversation with anyone\nThat would even remotely be like these postings that we've been discussing study I mean we you know it just doesn't happen so not a lot of people don't know about this and it's you know it can be helpful for people to be to be aware of it and to know what what kind of speech is out there and that there are places in the Internet where it's allowed to flourish well\nAnd you know it it's one thing that I don't think we we we fully realize when we're listening to ball Rasmussen doing the news or or or anybody you when you're when you're researching the story you get into some of these things and you start reading some of this stuff\nAnd you know you do have to see that to understand what your story is going to be about but some of those words that you just read today are chilling you know they are I mean those are very very deep felt angry moment\nI hear from a historical standpoint it's important to say that these are very similar things to what was being said in Germany thank you when the Nazis were taking over yeah and these were the things that were the the kind of epithets\nAnd stereotyping and lies that we're being told about the Jews and I think that that that you know needs to be\nWe we we can never forget that I think that we were very now I Would also like to say stony I just happened to be a patron down at my Twitter feed here\nAnd our friends that channel to Katie K television had posted a picture of a few minutes ago\nThat absolutely makes me feel\nSo hopeful you should see the intersection where this vigil is taking place\nIt's thousands and thousands of people there is the front of the post Gazette tomorrow that's for me you can't there's no room in the intersection if you wanted to drive through the intersection right now you're going nowhere there are people from everywhere standing there at this vigil this is really that's Pittsburgh\nThe intersection right now you're going nowhere there are people from everywhere to standing there at this vigil this is really\nThat's Pittsburgh really good stuff to see and what was it you were saying a lot of people standing with umbrellas because of the ... a lot of umbrella as of yet but there's I mean there are thousands of people gathered for gosh this is really good stuff\nWell that you know and that's that's what\n... as tragic as this is you see humankind come together and say okay that is terrible we're not going to accept that we're not going to stand for it and and they're they're standing for all those people that lost their lives that's wonderful\nYeah we can draw boundaries we can draw a line in the sand and say you know no ...\nYeah yeah ball thanks a lot I appreciate it man you bet talk to you later Paul Rasmussen or doing double duty today and we are are carrying a the information toward you ... you know I'm ... ... ... oddly enough ironically enough there was the last week on this program\nI was talking about a story that appeared in New York Times this would be a couple of weeks ago now I'm by a a professor at Yale that talked about\nFascism and how how how very quietly it creeps into a society and his poll said it\nTo the people who lost loved ones today\nUh I think really says something and I you know we we criticize him\nA but at the same time when he does something like that you go okay I Know a lot of somebody said never let a good catastrophe go to waste I Know that's that's politics but look at these Indiana he's in in ... in Indiana now he's got air force one a little literally fly over Pittsburgh the ice saying let's touchdown\nOr and and get him over a whether he'll go to squirrel hill or where he will go my guess is he will\nUh and that will be pretty impressive or if that's if that is indeed what happens with President today but it it's it's good that he's involved in this uh because this is not this is no small thing as you obviously know\nThis is this is a tragedy that I'm most cities could not indoor um this is ... is a tough way to\nDo that but anyway um they had this we had to press conference today at four thirty I'm actually about the time it took off and um\nI I think we've got pretty much most of the story the thing the people we should really pray for the people that are in the hospital that are being uh taken care of now which was very surgeries of Paul Rasmussen is uh just walked in the studio against something which you gotta feed for five\nTo own a or the president is on Twitter now talking about the shooting today at the synagogue and he said condemning the attack calling it an assault on humanity and he's calling on Americans to unite\nTo conquer hate a pair of Twitter posts within the last few minutes he says all of America is in mourning over the mass murder of Jewish Americans at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh we pray for those who perished in their loved ones in our hearts go out to the brave police officers who sustained serious injuries\nThis evil anti Semitic attack as an assault on humanity if we'll take all of us working together to extract the poison of anti Semitism from our world we must unite to conquer hate\nAnd as you know earlier he told reporters that he has to be coming to Pittsburgh he didn't say when the details are not clear yet I see\nI see I Would think you know I mean he literally flying over here but that good for him you know\nSo the president is that have been on Twitter I guess he's on air force one making the Post's yeah maybe he's on his way back from Indiana to Washington right now I don't\nKnow yeah he's probably listening okay because we don't know but ... that's great that he's that he's become so involved in this you know and and as you said this is in terms of the gravity of this tragedy is the biggest you know we've seen in the Jewish community for ... for certain\nAt a there is not an area in the United states that isn't touched by this yeah buddy especially here in Pittsburgh with the with the history of that this particular congregation is\nAlmost a hundred and fifty years if I have it right\nYeah well and you know and that and that's true I mean I I\nThis particular building up almost a hundred and fifty years if I have it right yeah\nWell and you know and that and that's true I mean I ... I Hope this is misunderstood it was not just a synagogue that ... any would be so bad but here you are in squirrel hill right where this there is a great history there\nWell squirrel hill as so many of the people who commented today\nHave talked about how squirrel hill has become more of a melting pot and Pistole sure and and how you see different you know communities emerging in squirrel hill it's not a ... it doesn't have a single identity as it's no longer Pittsburgh Jewish neighborhood yeah it hasn't been that for decades\nAnd so it's a great place to live it is it is a it's a wonderful player who has it and I enjoy going there I think that ah\nThat ah the turnout today his proof of the ... of how just diverse squirrel hills become the turnout for the vigil tonight is the ... the response is in the thousands yeah\nYeah that says something and I don't know that that's just specific to the community there I gotta feeling people have come from all over his Berg this afternoon they so let's get down there you know\nAnd you know about all like I also want to share that you know on social media people who I Know here at work\nHave posted a that they've been in this synagogue that these are these are friends of mine who\nUh we've we've followed one another on Twitter they've been in the synagogue they are not members of that congregation they're not Jewish yeah but they've been there for ... for varying events this is a a a more than a synagogue it's more than just a a Jewish church this is a gathering place\nFor people of all faiths who have come to help celebrate different events in their Jewish friends lives weddings or as we were talking earlier today a breast was taking place yeah uh so it wasn't just a it wasn't just their Sabbath day where they were having Shabaab there was also heroin\nOn it yeah yeah yeah and and you're right it really is a Center for the community where a lot of wonderful things happen\nAnd some other notable synagogues or nearby sure\nYet her well and and you know is it this this vigil which originally started out and remains very somber but yet people are giving speeches people are singing songs people are are are are showing their spirit in this whole thing\nAnd it's a it's a great response yeah city as a quickly rallying and I think that we saw the beginning of that in the tone that was set at the news conference at four o'clock\nYesterday there was this there was this single no that was founded across law enforcement and and leaders in public safety and I would also like to say I think it was interesting that the two most prominent leaders were not heard from\nAllegheny county executive rich Fitzgerald and mayor Pittsburgh bill poodle both stood back and allow the governor to be the the the main political leader on the scene and they turned everything over to the people in law enforcement from that point forward and then the doctor from UPN see yeah and a symbolically that says a lot\nIt took the politics of it it was like these are the people that are important in a situation like this having the medical community heralded for the worst that they did the police for the work that day and did incredibly well\nI'm pretty good and the governor's remarks were oh we're brief and an end to the point right or a strong reaction and quick action on the on the flags at half staff and good for him\nSo I think that they set the tone and people have been kind of on the same page you know in their response I think that the people in squirrel hill in and around the Pittsburgh area are\nFor the most part on the same page I Would imagine that Ninety eight percent of us who are more than that now are are ... you know United in our reaction to this thing and and our feelings about this thing\nJohn would imagine that Ninety eight percent of us who are more than that now are are ... you know United in our reaction to this thing and in our feelings about this thing and how we're going to respond to what happened was a dancing really that was saying tonight we're all from scroll hill ... somebody you not to let let right [laughter] yeah uh and and\nUh\nDo you have it I think one of the thing he said I think it's sometimes it's it's too bad that we have to have a tragedy\nOh my gosh arrest all pulled together but you know I out in the newsroom and in in in the coming and going to that I've had on the Internet and the things that I'm looking at I'm not seeing a lot of divisiveness yeah I Know you've seen a couple\nAcross the screen here and a half of that it has a newsroom yeah you know with the with some of the people responded but they're they're in the ... the smallest minority yeah I'm not seeing as much of that in the in the news or certainly not on my among my Facebook friends and certainly on my Twitter contacts that's not happening\nAnd most people you know if if there's any resenting the sound is shock that oh my gosh ... how did this happen and then it's you know our people okay and what what's going on and now I I I think you know the way the community has responded\nIt could have responded in a completely different way in a violent way a but it hasn't so that's a that's a big thing and I I Would imagine there will be a quite a moment at the Steelers game tomorrow\nWe had a we had a really a tragic thing happened today and I would like to just proclaimed be one of the first to say that our response is a one of our finest hours I've been a Pittsburgh are now you know spring resident for just a little more than twelve years\nAnd I'm really proud to be a citizen here I Love the way that our city is rallying after something this awful and this is the worst thing that's happened since I've been here yeah well it's a\nGood sitting in his room with you [laughter] I'm Glad to be here [laughter] like I said is it calling it's an honor to be on this station serving this whole city at this time at a time like what we're going through\nYou

here on Katie K as well usually are on the weekends but we had to change some things a little bit to make sure that everything got out\nWith you ... you know sometimes you like the package stuff and say okay we'll have this coming up and then we're going to get into that and then we're going to do this\nWell this is ... this is alive story is an ongoing story so\nBut as John was saying in the in the producers a room you know you can't plan for anything you just use the phone rings somebody comes in and says we have so and so this we got the president that needs to have this thing put on Twitter these kinds of things happen when we're trying to cover it for you\nOr who live and will continue it through tomorrow ... coming up in just a few moments to take you through the evening um and

you to be my therapist tonight\nWell I don't know if I have the skills yeah you do what message would you share with us I mean to give you\nSome um [noise] I'm a member of the Jewish community and\nActually the synagogue that I go to not really one of the large one of those in a in ... so we're about a half a mile away and apparently now here's the thing I'm a member of a sudden a guy with reports that I've spoken to orthodox Jewish people on ... bought\nOne of the things are concerned about is two things actually are especially now but first of all that day\nThat we try to limit as much as we can uh our uh evolved with technology a big cause of various elements of Jewish law\nOkay but wait a minute what what what does the different types of Judaism have to do with what happened today\nWhat I Want to say is that because as you said in your intro ... communities\nNot necessary the same as the community affiliated with the synagogue\nI don't ... they weren't unity as they were they were human beings that went to pray\nNot only that the Jewish community as a whole ... even though like you were saying that didn't necessarily a wouldn't necessarily know everybody there I don't know heal right in the orthodox Jewish community of people were saying phones all after the you know we're prayer service\nAnd there were service at the um the a\nMemorial service that started I think it's six o'clock there will be there there was singing what message would you share with every one because we're home certainly at a time like this I Hope it's understood where all the same community where all the same bomb Ninety\nSomething that I heard from a chaplain for World War two many years ago ... Toronto\nAnd it stuck with me and it's it's a it's a a it's a well known setting a needle tests that we refer to it as a Tara mhm\nWhen Aaron some ah died in a tragic accident and uh the rabbis pointed out he was silent airing did not say anything in there and of course with the spoke spurts of promote Aaron was always wore audible or for at at at times the Moses and the rabbi states when evil happens\nWe're we're in a way were shut up shut a shot up and stuff so that we we feel we have nothing to say and that's that's just the way it is\nYou feel like you have nothing to say when will one will go away when we feel like you have something to say because of that [noise] that at some point I Can't imagine somebody deciding I have nothing to say in it sticking to that for the rest of their lives about anything\n[noise] I have a good question I mean it ... it I think you know it sounds so trite but it's very hard to say something now without it being insensitive that you even mention it in your intro\nThat a lot of things will be shed politicization they have\nVery hard to say something now without it being insensitive that you even mention it in your intro and that a lot of things will be shed politicization may happen not necessarily intentionally and so many people will feel it is the right time you know it's just the right time for that\nWell here's what I think they I I I think I agree with ... with most of what you said my some of it you can use me which in a weird way it was their beauty so thank you for that\nI Know what I said if there's somebody that you thought of the GED and talk to and I talk to not taxed see face to face not I am\n\nThat's that's if you get nothing else from tonight take that between now when when you got to go back to reality

a point in our community what would it be that they were what to say\nAnd I imagined in saying that they don't want to allow this ... that there are lot cards that are that I'm In the way that we think about each other we as catching it will be make it\nCame from taking our community if we make it to you know I Am getting older and I think I think in fact when hey I thought what is that lack the\nAs I practice that make it a free for the cat\nTo ban member to be remembered yeah and\nDo what do we learn from what you're talking about Cindy Cindy\nWas it different worlds that\nCindy you're on your phone is cutting in and out real bad here\nPeople we don't want to let those people have died\nThen\nDon't embrace the bitterness is what I think I heard I wake up this doesn't sound stupid

I meet and then you and I talked when we walk away from each other\nAnd then I'm going how would you remember that Cindy appreciated ... what message do you have for us\nEach six six three nine one one of your duty to a radio dot com or text that number\nAnd I'm\nIn Freeport Adams thank you for calling on your own Katie cayenne high\nYou know no problem and I hear your voice you know it's an exact or how long I've been [noise]\nIt's hard to put into words I'm Crying all day and I don't have any direct affiliation with\nThe people that all ... says the city today but I I'm a product of a marriage where my mother was ... getting their father and mother got married my father was Jewish\nOkay it was a strange household household growing up but I got the best and the worst of both worlds\nHow gotcha [laughter]\nGoing going into something where there's a feeling we're going to do and my father passed a twenty four today than going through something today like that's basically in favor of this one or two of ... a barrel was only a couple of blocks so\nWhat happened today but um my message really would be that um this was a sense with active hate and our differences make us who we are just because you're different than somebody doesn't mean you need to have to um\nDid there was an active shooter inside the building\nThe gunman is in bad condition\nWill argue about the legal system here in the coming days no doubt but we're tonight what's the message math in Pittsburgh thank you for calling your own Katie gay I\n... I say my message is first of all thank you to those officers who ran into the synagogue to cage that animal finally\nIn to know that the law enforcement community and those officers they look to see was a synagogue or a Catholic Church or a Baptist church or a school building they ran in there no and they may lose their life but to do the right thing and stop\nThe active shooter they went and I guess my message would be that\nThat will happen time and time again and we're not going to stop or to get keep ...\nThank you would confuse me a little at the end but then I told you earlier than my brain spin adult yeah what what went on in terms of the police response is utterly heroic anywhere you would look Matt in the south hills\nThe the police response is utterly heroic anywhere you would look Matt and the sound tells your own Katie\nHey hey hey\nSorry to hear all about news ah everybody out there um my message would be a just a ... look to learn anything from the civil act from this person but it's a waste of time I think what we need to do is\nJust concentrate on during good each day and they're good for others and do some good actor on the community and just try and make yourself better each day\nSo just don't even don't don't don't even try and learn and understand it learned that this is an annoying learn about ...\n... I think he was crazy whatever he whatever he was thinking ahead it was it's just crazy man I don't know if they were going to be able to understand it and I think was probably just concentrate on doing good\nSpend your time positively instead of trying to figure out something that you don't think you'd ever get figure it out just ...\nYou I think it's been on what what is that as as beyond comprehension of maybe we can study alone and figure out a way to prevent other guy that's great I'm not good but let's just trying to go to\nDo good every day a little bit yeah\nMatt I appreciate it I understand that logic but that's where I kind of get into trouble because of started buying logic and I say when I Want to figure out because it does it does whatever the problem is if it's a problem let's figure out why what's going on and pick\nMatch there is there are some things that are on fixable I don't I'd like to disagree with that but I don't know if I can Sean into random hello buddy hey man\nI'm this was a rough one today [noise]\nI had there are a lot of people that want to scream myself included but that little boys in the back of my head says don't scream it's going to just startle and you're going to lose the focus I'm trying to keep the focus and I'd like to think that focuses on love and on positive things\nBut it's only eight needs to be talk through to even start to whittle away to that\nThat's the reason for my call was um [noise] needed to actually let people know with physical forgiveness is\nIt is not letting go or excusing anybody from the consequences of their actions\nWhat it is though is letting go of the hatred the bitterness and the poison that you will keep in your heart and ended up ruining your own life\nSo there can be retribution just don't hang onto the bitterness that cause you to seek retribution\nIt's a legal system that will take care of the retribution your job is to not let this man destroyed more than he already has\nA new harboring resentment and bitterness and hate in your heart is going to destroy you\nAnger is murder big gun you gotta let it go as hard as it can be sometimes\nCan you have her again you can you purge is and can you can you let it go with one swept screaming spell or something\nSometimes you can and other times it may take years to finally a sick feeling may kill an angry you're sick of feeling that this guy keeps hurt me every day over and over and over again whenever you get fed up with it you can let it go Sean\nGuy gets hurt me every day over and over and over
