your call Mike you have any thoughts on that well as usual\nWhen Anthony's airs sharp guys are smart guy he makes a lot of good points but there's a lot to unpack there so\nAs often as the case with Anthony I'd agree with some of the points you make and I disagree with others Anthony I Would disagree with and the ... point for example that to me too movement\nAnd I'm paraphrasing when he was

which we've experienced in this country so that's one I think the me too movement\nWon't be needed any more I so I have to disagree with Anthony on that but he makes some good points about when Democrats should fight when they should not fight I Would make the case the Anthony that I think the Democrats had an obligation as a party to stand up against this nomination\nAnd it's not just about is these accusations by the way the vast majority of the Democratic United States senators took a position against Kavanaugh because he's wrong on labor laws\nAnd he would got labor laws that are would negatively impact average working people he's wrong on environmental laws he's wrong on the issue of choice you can go down the list\nOf this particular issue was important it should've been

R. A. K. E.

yet what about technology games of the highest level and at that point are a number of people realized that\nNeo will head sitting formula that could be helpful\nAnd we know that could be helpful to not an autistic kids but other kids with learning difficulties\nNot any new country but also in Australia and in fact right around the world\nThat is so interesting I Love hearing that were you you find someone that can use technology and it opens up their entire world and probably completely changes and you're like wait a second we're on to something here we just started actually scaling this in other directions tell me about that [noise]\nWell after that a set of ... which was as I said it was just a a mobster an event or we didn't engage with district Seventy five in New York City which is a ... non geographically defined city across the five boroughs of New York [noise]\nThat has twenty six thousand special needs kids and we started to deploy\nIn a number of schools and we got the same success we got we got past suffocation because of the guys went with the platform and then once we're able to engage the kids we couldn't educate them but also we have very powerful analytics on the back of the platform which you might as well as the education determine the level of independent\nInstruction that the child my to me so who are in a regular class she would find that the\nLargely the students are on a similar level students in many cases we deal with a vastly different diets and vastly different vastly different levels\nAnd the consequences of that is more often than not played left that has no education equity a huge digital divide he's he's getting bigger and bigger [noise]\nSo what we've found that we can do is we can analyze these children we can have the educators can work with is they cannot have individually curated programs for the children and most importantly they have individual reports for each of those children\nHow to assist the child is ... ... if you don't have some form of technology so we're seeing in all things Jonathan technology today and education is applying even a bigger role\nAnd the fascinating thing is that\nIf you can take a child\nThe payments to independence\nIs a pain followed the cost of that changed as a tenfold economic benefit lots of that child\nI never even thought about that way but that's absolutely true and I didn't use improving the quality of life I mean you're bringing people in the fall like ... lessening not divide and its technology to doing it and thinking about all the ... you're collecting on the back and how you can learn from that and it sort of climate to other students and then helping to students that are currently in there\nAnd that's just amazing stuff today are what are you doing here in Pittsburgh widens any Pittsburgh\nWhere we are very fortunate actually to be here in Pittsburgh because there's a couple of reasons from first of all is obviously a technology in education Center for the U.S [noise] uh but uh most important thing is ... ... residents here in Pittsburgh so that gave us the opportunity to spread out brings beyond New York\nAnd and come to work here in the in Pittsburgh and wear a developing a team here to work with chicken and special million to slow learners environment\nThat is fascinating so glad to have you here in Pittsburgh\nAnd sometimes it's a cool drawn to bring you that the accident and bring you hear us as part of this or do you think you're meeting with some some legislators and elected officials while you're here and it's all around us were connected you connect all kittens has an issue that you guys are part after you talked about that\nOne of the issues that we have is that\nGovernments are any here in the U.S that run around the world tend to be slow\nPut funding towards education so special needs to hang over the past we've created a connector keeps a program or to make to create awareness that with the provision of technology the prevention of um\nAppropriate funding these two kids can become\nIndependent they can become meaningful\nFour members of society and connect the keeps his season awareness program that we fucking driving\nLuckily were directing that at a philanthropic funds corporate sons and most importantly politicians\nAre great place to start because they're the ones with the dollars and they see we're we're the resources need to go and to really get educate them on the importance that technology is what can actually make this happen it can scale as quickly as well to tell me about that\nBut we live in the world today and they bondage that are\nPretty well everybody just sort of you go to has a\n... Internet connections\nThe costs are technology became becomes cheaper and treat but not any that are caught activity because we use a lot of play pool so we can get real time data from these kids will so we use a lot of platform so that they should put that on the platform on her [noise]\nWe used to collect and that really turns out we didn't use that real turned out to work with the educators to further improves apply polling adjust the platform so it's a it's a circular pattern of slick team or the other kids enjoying the platform and that's the most important things or they will enjoy the platform because they were on a journey and those activities that they can they do\nFrom place to get to the next part of the journey so they're instead of odds to keep moving through the journey signs on the money of sunshine repairing the daughter and the second term when adjusting their learning program and the technology that has become a cheap and Niger today you can buy a tablet for basically a few dollars that platform works on that\nWhether it be a a ... or the or a laptop\nAny platform or whether it be the big with as far in the area so has the platform works on that\nThat is so cool the idea that it comes across all the platforms and the best of all the kids don't do learning they're having fun there being engaged that senior you have some good going on to people want to learn more about the new world that they want to learn more about that connect all kids what's the best place for them to go and they will they'll go out with a K.\nRight ... and you knew or dot com or to get\nVery cool stuff to once again looking to Pittsburgh so glad you're here visiting us and so glad for that you're setting up some practice here in Pittsburgh and that we know our our tech

with the Shirley hey you\nKnock on the Internet and the cool [laughter] or hot however you want it you know because a lot of people do have on your team\nOr so there's a mix of of technical people who have computer science backgrounds we've got some people that have more of a mechanical engineering background and then of course uh we have people in our team that have business backgrounds who can go and sales for instance ... fields um as we joined our team about a year ago he has experience leading a\nBe it'd be sales sales and he's helped set up national installation networks\nOh that's great generally what we're trying to have that experience that you don't have the bring him in to do that for you\nSo that the corps founding team was technical and of course we can make things but we needed some support with somebody right and experience and so when Bob came in and it was really a great fit for us that's the way you manufacturing we are manufacturing in fact most of our manufacturing has done here in western ...\nOut after the here man how are you doing contract work\nWe sit with so we have only a manufacturers here um contract manufacturers here uh\nYou know most of

there than it actually if I wasn't going to solve it for everybody I was at least gonna suffer from the first\nCompany never started this is my first company yes and what have you learned what what have you learned about this\nI mean everything I've done has been a learning process or you know I think one of the things I was most worried about coming into it was just that I hadn't done it and I didn't know really anything about it and ... yeah I've learned over time that it's okay not to know you just kind of got to go to run into it and figure it out could happen\nRight say that's probably built up your confidence\nOh yeah definitely and I know I I'm an engineer and so talking in public with something that was not my uh\nMy forte working at a [laughter] but now you're like a stand up comic oh I'm not I wouldn't go that far [laughter] but I I've definitely found myself to becoming a lot more comfortable with that yet and I feel\nThat rate so that's a surprise right definitely yeah that's a big night so do you do anything for fun\nSometimes I actually uh I was just camping a couple of weekends ago so it was a lot of ... an awesome thing you know being in the the nitty gritty of a technology come a sometimes nice to go out where you\nCan you can bring a little bit yeah did you did you really let loose well there was no service there so\nI I actually remember Audrey we were talking to Joel Johnson from boxy face to go he was like not to take like a few we can just get on my bike and just kind of ride on the Boulder and slang that just because\nI mean I get to in my head and the access to it anything that comes up and immediately think about it and this way I Can't I mean I can think about it all I Want but I Can't do and\nSo you went to the ... year program right that's correct that was probably really crucial to helping you guys get off on the right foot tell me about that\nAbsolutely so well first that at the University of Pittsburgh we participated in pits ah accelerated program which is the blast furnace\nExactly and ... is that right yeah and the hot at the last one is ready for ...\nAnd that was one of our first kind of experiences working with you know other entrepreneurs that had experience where I'd done things like this and so of course transitioning into gear they actually provided some more funding for us you know it was really great to be

working there as well too so you really are immersed in an ecosystem in a culture they're like getting a company off the\n... one of the things I always say that I really appreciate it about being an off year was being right next to all the other companies because you're going through the same thing with them you know especially the companies that have products similar to ours you know I could go over and ask them like hey how are you manufacturing this what did you do how did you get approval for\n... exactly yeah it's so hard to do it alone having that proximity and if I'm Around you but I
