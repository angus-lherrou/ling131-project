that we have in this country\nIt creates the opportunity for more people to do things like like what we've seen last week with the attempts for for the bombing in for the shooting\nBut moving on to

I don't miss a special for farmers from Gabby very holiday train display from the McKee's port model we rode club and fireworks\nMy story so I Hope that you already see the connection to trash a sister Robin ... is a visionary founder and chairperson of leadership links think she's a graduate of the U.S Naval Academy and Gordon gun will see a logical seminary the\nTaj you use a regular for outreach magazine writer at ... ... excuse me this you alliance and blogger at a sisters\nJourney she's a former Marine Corps officer\nIs Twenty years of leadership and mentoring experiencing diverse settings including the military federal government church seminary in non profit sector she uses her advocacy work for anti human trafficking efforts\nTo pursue equity for women and the impoverished the time she was encouraged to live her truth to her village of family and friends\nIncluding her daughter actually their husbands or on to she says about herself\nI Am somewhat of a pariah the matter where I go within the American church but she has learned to find peace in the presence of God the\nLoan broken in healed is the way she offers yourself up to God that Josh your sister Robin said welcome to amplify\n... for somebody to happen to be here\nOr tell us a little bit about why you have a chosen to link your life in the story we're going to be following with the story of Moses and the exodus\nShow our shores so for African Americans particularly African American Christian um different narrative of accidents have been one of information and want to hope for centuries really I'm working with why that is really the way of our favor and [noise]\nAnd um you know we had so many candidates like the people and foreign and if you anti slavery and yet so many of them died without a guide and they still were full and they were hopeful because\nWhen they learned about this the ticket and that narrative and if I Believe flies that guy could deliver\nAsia life out of slavery and who lost their they can deliver on and so any day there was a expectation that guy will come and live down out of the bond with this is by Harriet top man I'm having a ... vote because he was really operating and\nYou know that that they drew from Mara tests and so I'm from ... when I was thinking about\nWriting my story and really go round it had an affair the passage is what they want to change in light of what was going on in our in our country code ... and also into also share that African American I'm getting to some extent\nRight and so the story of Moses as you point out as a part of our shared history and that he was born into a marginalized people grew much like you have ... and most like like others have er um specially the Jews today in our in our country but\nYou also point out that God wants us to courageously speak in response to the current issues\nBut you also point out that God wants us to courageously speak in response to the current issues of our day what convinces you\n[noise] well I just look at um I I think\nPart of that is grounded in just the character of God and I think so often we only look at certain aspects of guys nature of who God is and um I think for a lot of times I'll theology um has missed the element of God band right just ... and maybe not so much that\nBut not certainly not speaking to his righteousness from a position of justice that guy is a a right to judge in God is the one who takes all things along in a in this world and makes it right\nAnd so much for what he's doing and telling him revealing the narrative is telling his redemptive story how he take something that is wrong which is the original family the engine assisted me and how he's really telling a story and sharing with us and inviting us even\nAnd to his word to experience and the boss sales how he makes it the right of course that combination for us with the\nUm with the mission and purpose of of Jesus but also with the work on the body in the Holy Spirit that seems to work in the U.S until Jesus returns and so um\nI think to me it's very clear when he made a viable\nUm that that is the work that God is doing that he is John in light where they're starting to say he is providing freedom where there is\nBondage um that he is um you know restoring everything they have and making all things and um so I think that's that's a wonderful open embracing the truth and the Bible um but for that to happen\nThat guy's judge um his his at and his character has nature of justice must be realize and as people who belong to a guy that we really are invited to participate in this world that God is doing in the world\nInto ... important for us to tell our story I mean today everything is about story to tell your story because we were really doing is sharing our troops and when we're connecting our life with a with Moses exodus teaches us you point on\nAbout what God is doing in the midst of the people group to accomplish he's real on earth and he heard the cries\nT Boone intended to do something about it and so God chose to use most zoos but he also ...\nAbsolutely I mean that's definitely a bit of what things about this story that you know God and he can use anybody\nBeen yeah can you anybody and I think you know so often when I hear this package\nJust preach about the exit his narrative um the summer in conclusion that most of us are such a great leader when he didn't start out that way or you know the wilderness I Would I Would submit that the look and they stick your head is what made him what turned him into into a great me to babysit when it started out that way and so um I think it's an encouragement to us\nUm that God can ... anybody I think that's very very important for the other thing is is that\nYou know if not you know our lives these stories that we have in their lives that we live it's not just about um where are we going um it's not about how we thought anything but it's really about how we\nFinish in how the president how we are I'm able to persevere with the guy one of the journey and what it and be open to what it is he's teaching us a long way so that we can actually walk into that leadership and walk into that purpose\nOne of the journey and what it and be open to what it is he's teaching a long way so that we can actually walk into that leadership and walk into that part that they have called us into\nAnd you began even early in your life to experience the pain of the entire black community and 'em\nKnowing that pain in the history of islands are and how they it has shaped the American the African American narrative has it affected how you read the scriptures you point out that we want to see God\nTo be aware of reasons presidents but so often we miss him because\nWe're evaluating the wrong things in the wrong way that we we are not to respond or to treat other people as their sins deserve we must not seek our own revenge tell us a little bit about\nHow would use the God's Grace\nCan be at work can work within our pain in our in our weakness\n[noise] I think when we are experiencing moment of pain and the weakness is Barry ... get distracted and to me\nNo lie that God is not with us that he is not present that he has not mayor they can get the care and I think that\nYou know what the grace ten is when I have been in my lowest point in life that I was looking for guys right and so in looking for God I was able to see\nThose moments and not all the time and not as anything else someone with what he's he has another like when I was looking for God and when I was speaking to his\nFace I was able to witness I'm how he was showing up even in those dark moments\nAnd when I was able to witness that then that time to some extent um that pain again not by obey all the time but it gave me enough hope to continue and why and and it turned that pain into living gratitude\nUm and so that has been something that experience where my journey just looking for a guy even in the valley\nI'm part of that is what's happening in Pittsburgh that was the ... of these eleven people or the hope is that we collectively as a community will become stronger\nAnd um yeah hopefully then uh I didn't hear this yet but I'm sure it's happening this being said in the Senate ... we will rely to go more to turn\nTo God Moore you point out that the truth is women are the unsung heroes of the world your mother died when you were twenty which you first experience God's Grace to her loving sacrifices or she's an important part in his book tell us a little bit about your mother\nOr my mother when Sally and she was the oldest of five\nThem to be isolated I feel like they're carrying the burden away all by themselves and so part of part of my that was part of my motivation and inspiration for Saddam disciplined says well and that you know we want it to raise up the next generation of leaders but we also want it to be a source of support and encouragement\nFor al ... and so when I think about leadership links\nUm our core values links that would have found five core values of love\nInspiration network knowledge I service and so we're very intentional in building that networking and we're not just talking about professional we were talking about communities like how we are indeed sisters and brothers for each other how you pray it in a scene for each other or we support each year for each other how we show up in jail there and so I think that's something that we have to um start\nSinging to our leaders is that we have the responsibility and this is not good for us to be alone\nUm and also to encourage and support in model for them how best to do that so we can all be healthier and holy um in in that realm or is that everything\nGoes wherever you know you write to when we come face to face with God we also come face to face with ourselves\nWe become aware of our own ... weakness pride in human limitations it moves us to does are less of me in more of God and it opens or understand need to consider God's way of working in this world\nYeah just to desire less of me and\nMore of God and it opens our understanding to consider God's way of working in this world so we must be president with God if\nWe are ever to know our purpose and you found out that your purpose\nWas to become a disciple of Christ in a leader of people and and we we've become aware of that now is a Christian you ride raising one's consciousness is\nA spiritual pursuit that leads to write choose actions explained that ... that little bit for us as a Christian raising one's consciousness is a spiritual pursued that leads to ride two sections\nI there's a lot of injustice happening in the world and of\nCourse when the ... and the ... cat address all of it but I think that um if we are attentive I'm Indian guy can\nReveal to us um his righteous anger about their and tested it the physical do than justice if they want to take action on and So Apple that when we have Chris says that they do they're not um they're not\nTaken a stand against anything right and I mean we have to have some question about our theology and about um what it is like like if if our theology is just about individual to salvation then then I Would submit that the only part of the gospel\nAnd so we're not living out the whole class and so I think they really need to\nBe challenging our sales particularly to I'm asking are we attempted to like how if God breaking and how the Kindle guide breaking\nAnd to the kingdom of this world to\nRestore it every day and someone mentioned was praying and taking the type of how to play because your kingdom come there will be done on\nEarth as it is I have and and so I wanted to be asking a question how it came down to break in four and a guy back and forth to the kingdom at this world and and what a guy has got to be a part of that work in so I find that a lot of Christians um\nA lot but some Christians are not attentive enough to the things that don't concern them or their family or their people group or you know those people who have like them at like ... you know have the same status\nOf life economically or ethnically or whatever and so there is a blind spot\nAnd um what other people that are not like am I feeling is sending a while and as a lever that's Christian I don't think they have that luxury and if we're taking that I'm lecturing than that I think we really need to be challenging I felt about you had to be fully understand the whole project is taught\nYeah you're right we all need to wake up knowing argues area and facing tragedy basing tragedy for doing that here in Pittsburgh make us more coming to his people becoming conscious and demanding justice was\nNot the the revolutionary acts of a select few in a society\nDeep and lasting change will happen when we see the sacrificial in strategic actions of a unified body of justice seekers working together to demand\nJust and and that\nComes in almost any problem we're having in society and and your strongest conviction toward advocacy use that God once people\nIn society and and your strongest conviction toward advocacy use that God wants people to live freely and that's what the story of Moses but didn't Moses stood up to ... to\nPharaoh fat and he expects us to do the same doesn't me\nYes absolutely absolutely that somebody has to stand up to Barrow and and why not us and I think so often they don't because of our fear right yeah\nAnd you believe that uh well let's let's let me leave that window but that means than that God is the only one worthy of our trust which means we need to always find ways to stay close to God's\nAbsolutely absolutely and and that whole oh\nGod the only one way of our truck hit the only one worry about Russia\nYou know I've gained so much of a injustices\nThat we really want to get to the class of the matter is built on our forces of security and and um things ways that we want to control our lives and society in front of people and we set up ... to make us more comfortable and um and and when we when we think about that\nFor every one of them some time now that we have to consider all the the idol in our lives do things can worship right whether they be our job will our wealth or our economy for our nation or you know what Africa things politics you know what we put out and\nThat's the very thing that we worship and so um I think they're very happy to\nThink about you know if she says is the thing is if the lord in our life then how does that make a difference in how we live\nSo you write for many years God has been teaching me to trust him alone\nThis news also fundamental lesson God talk the Israeli allies do not put your trust in say row the government and its systems we cannot put our trust in houses or cars or land we cannot put our trust in jobs or money\nI Know now that I Can't even trust the motivations are intentions of my own heart without God's word and wise counsel and so you've learned of from the story of Moses to trust on the on the word of God haven't you\nYes sir [noise] and they and\nWhat are some of the red sea moments to which you refer to in your book you said um we're we're talking of course what happened when Moses was crossing the red sea but uh we all have such moments so we\nWe all do we all do and I think what we want to ... the moment is that they're they're huge right they are huge and the thing about whether or not we costs\nIs going to determine the trajectory of our life now we have an option of going back for what we know what you're comfortable even if it's\nBad for us [laughter] and we have a choice and you know and and uh we have a choice of that we have a choice of trusting guy to do something\nAbout Iraq is so we can get to where he wants to\nTake and so for me that read the ... I mean I've had many laughing moments but I think for me that was going off to college you know it's a Naval Academy whether or not it's going to leave my home state of faith to have a comfortable for gold collar schools um I think it with another man I thought it was\nWhether or not it's going to leave my home my favorite place to have a comfortable on gold collar schools um I think it with another man I thought it was you know what\nBranch of the military I was going to serve and and how long I was going to stay and who I was married and what job I was going to take and ... going on there and so they're all these\nCourt in a life changing the stations that amazed and uh the ... of those things that are right in front of us it's kinda like a cost mood way or the guy to do something about Iraq Iraq for us to take that step and if the fearful that\nBut that that that one step is going to determine that the fact that we have our life\n\nIn a chapter six the title is he's about deliverance true says freedom comes to those who demanded\nWhat and what what do you mean by that [noise]\nI'm sure and and I haven't biting funny but that's a quote from Dr Martin Luther king that basically ... and that might be his\nSomething to be here I'm going to be on guard against something after over the ads on the ... at the ... with animal might and so I think that's part of his book and I think again actually you know even when we think about the\nSet up to maintain good order and discipline that you know the police splits with apple well you know that that that the whole system of police have set up you know ... and ... ... ... at least in the south and what we think about the cats run away\nYou know and so this whole idea for white people that that was set up to protect\nYou know there may be set up for people to keep them in mind it but he that consistently you know throughout history of anti ... those two reality that is what we have to give ya\nOkay we're

the calling like I mean the the family did\nJust killing black people because they don't have anything else to do and I kind of feel like sometimes that's the narrative of the list as being perpetually in it and I think the same time you know a particular and let me think about some of the\nInjustices of of of black people you know getting shot by police which is happening more and more you know the the ... sign I think and look in the black community is that the the people again that their title their role is that we're here to protect you that's why you're here that's what you're supposed to be here for\nAnd because there's not a benefit of the doubt because of my skin color\nBut the the question is not um let me see the ... the thing is shoot first and then ask questions later and so when the violent retaliation called for that type of behavior posturing\nUm the conversation and you know ... if you are um the punishment the victim of saying you know the person got shot well what their history if I ask if that matters\nAnd or um the community response of well why they're doing that and their own community um but there's a lot of why did you shoot first\nWith without asking the question right well I'll given the opportunity to raise your hand or put that down you know ... and ... and a lot of times it's not even a a weapon light you know and so I I didn't\nAnd I'll put that down you know ... and ... and a lot of times it's not even a weapon lite\nL. and so I I didn't that nobody really have to but again at that the narrative then that's all you hear one whatever news station and watch whatever newspaper you read or whatever you know friendships ... family circle you have\nBeen that the only narratives new here and so you start to think that that is the reality\nAnd then it becomes with those people in them over there and I just know in my life and and with my training back on the bench with position of being and because it's too easy to um not have compassion when we're looking at the ...\nAnd and if it's often them and if a or B him as a nation of people that are different than us and we think we're seeing that by that's what we're looking at right now and in Pittsburgh\nThey people that are looked at as less than men for less than important\nAnd they'll be where we have a right to respond violently to them but if they were to retaliate and violence and the narrative ships in a while while they behave that way and not the first act of ... that was perpetuated against them and their community\nYou write about remembering that it can bring us to a degree of a shared history and we know that we need each other are you in the fight tell\nUs what about you your visit to Rwanda was a obviously was a very important moment in your life\nMight alter my first time to the continent of Africa and I went with a group of African American women\nAnd he was invited to go on that trip through a ministry called Africa new life which is a little wand and ministry I managed to live our belonged and um that was bird out of the atrocities of imagined notices genocide and so that unfortunately in the millions of people that\nDied in ... a lot of ... children and so I'm past the friends of that the bread has to Charles their brothers\n... wife um ...\nUm they were motivated to again provide a place of safety ... education um for these children it and that's how that ministry of birds but what struck me by that country\nIs that they\nThey do not hide their story than being they're not they're not um [noise] they're not bound by that single story because they have\nChosen to space the reality of our wildlife and that was actually not blonde us first genocide but based on back in the leadership of the country in the church in that country um\nThat they had this model never again never forget\nNever forget never again and so they're very intentional about remembering that than they are genocide memorials all over the country is a place where people come to lament\nAnd it's a green their loved ones and also talk they have been very intentional in what they call the Greek of course where the community is involved in the justice which requires if there is to be any\nPart and if you will of um a perpetrator\n[noise] that that person must confess there than to the community and asked for forgiveness and the family of the victims are part of that process was buried with\nDumped of work on that and we have not seen in our country ever hardly right and so um for me like they're not even the foreign to themselves by their tribes\nA lot of work on that and we have not seen in our country ever highly right and so um for me like they're not even the foreign to themselves by their tribes [noise] um you know what we know let's say to the to stand trial which was you know the ... the the to travel by killing each other\nLike they're not refer to themselves by those tribes and the war I'm ... how are their outlet uh parents that they are with far to themselves as wide\nBan and I'm ... and so this is Deborah togetherness of reconciliation has really taken place in that country but it's only happened because they were honest about it\nAnd they were willing to confront the fans and they're willing to say how can we typically just and with that and not just faking peace than let's get over it already has stopped talking about it which is what we do a lot of in our country because of their\nYou know there were shamed by the history but they're saying this is what happened\nAnd this is how we're going to confront it and deal with it and this is how we're going to come up from the ashes any from after that that that's it we're going to come up from the ashes better people I'm not going to do that together at the community and I\nFeel that we can learn so much from them but that first ad is like that confession that honest I'm not just from one group of one individual but for the\nCountry the whole issue has done and\nTo me it was just very I'm very much a learning learning point for us as Americans\nWhy do you believe that uh there is hope we're holding on to\nBut you could stop us at home [laughter] I Can't go to the lab up an old writer and I'm\n... and ... and really like I Believe the Bible separate I Believe in in the Bible as they were telling me that changed us up at home and if not for that at least I don't have anything else right now we don't have anything else because the reality is that we'll just keep distorted\nOther so we're all of that to me that [laughter] you know and so I feel I feel\nVery strongly that my like my stage it their intangible it was something to me and um and I just believe that Jesus as if I'm blessed that open up and she says that's the way he offers a way forward damaging to\nTake place and being very alive and on and the press that light that we as parents and now not just an afterlife\nYou write them so thankful

time for that\nUm you raise the question directly in your book how often do you pray here asking you reader how often do you pray and you indicate\nWe learn from Moses the same thing we learned from Jesus the secrets to humility is praying and waiting for the father's instruction prayer is how Moses conditioned himself to respond to holy\nGod it's like you said it throughout the program prayers are very much a part of your life and all that you do and who you are isn't it\nAnd not very loving and so I'm ... died an average of a more complex than\nAll these ... how we draw the will to us in the gospels\nIt's more complex than what we sometimes owned up to I think that's a lot of great mystery that if we don't understand that just spiritual but physically as well but what we see is that he was always a truth teller and then he left owing showing compassion and love to different types of people\nYou just mentioned the concept of love and it's as we get to the closing chapters of your book one is titled the truth is love will lead us home how is it that love heels\n[noise] rough hills uh I I think it's important to us\nSo it's just kind of value that kind of how they think about love too because you have if not just an emotion and I'll love it but a choice of a choice\nAnd so when I think about again here ... than that and love is or the or their sacrifice and the way to win laid out on our lives for our brother ran for other people which can model I can model that way for us\nUm that that a lot of hearing from our fitness which for thin right and so to a great stand because I'm baby believe\nThat I can be formidable in a way that might be uncomfortable\nBack and forth giving away he prayed about this I'm In a way that may be uncomfortable that I can make a choice to love people even my enemy which is ... how could you could cause us to write I'm In a way that the of uncomfortable for the for love if somebody just an emotional scale\nAnd and what I find is that when I'm doing those things um\nHeroes calm because I'm quoted at God and when I get closer to God he craves for me to draw closer and to love my neighbor it's better\nThan you point out that you write about love redeem czar broken is that loving yourself means being honest with God and others about your struggles\nA nearby wilderness experiences I've discovered that the people I Love need to see the real me within unveiled says they don't always have to understand what they do need to see the glow when I experienced the glory of the guards\nWithout me wondering if that bright miss is going to blind them and I need to speak honestly when the lights starts to deal with are wondering if the lord has left us\nWe may not be afraid God touches us in the darkness and\nHuge healing be transparent he's\nThe only way we can allow others to take the redemptive journey with us now and as Henry now and reminds us that quote laying down or\nTo take the redemptive journey with us now and as Henry now and reminds us that quote laying down our lives means making our own safe and doubt hope and despair joy in sadness courage and fear\nAvailable to others there's ways of getting in touch with the lord is life staying connected to God is something we learn to do together\nWe especially need the support when we've gone through a dark place when we are taking a new journey for when we don't know where we're going for what to do\nAnd there are different there are difficult moments of course when indeed love does feel less and um and then by\nGod's Grace you you point out we can take right actions to determine a new way of loving and a new way of forgiving that's necessary for some of us isn't it [noise]\nAbsolutely absolutely absolutely it from a\nBetter you know what we choose to hold on for\nAnd and now I I think we have a choice of whether they can have better and I'm angry and a vengeful way and I'm Glad to help her family and and do phone um they they they have their own [noise] and uh we have a choice of loving and the\nMakers steak or something like ... and can than these language but if they're going to do the work of ... which is a very\nChallenging um accent but when we can take those accent and make those choices those actions produce food as well\nYou're right I don't know whether Moses ever for gave the Israel lights for breaking is hard\nBut I Do know that learning to forgive is principally linked to our capacity for love when our hearts grow coal toward loving God ourselves and others that's when bitterness\nSets in bitterness is not good for us because it could easily turn into losing it\nCan cause us to give up on people\nAnd quit or kingdom were so when we do the abuser when we've experienced tragedies we have to be careful about allowing bitterness to over ... do we\n... ... ...\nAnd so you learn all that the man that Islam and yes right well we all have it\nIn that way and and and low fat you know but my heart\nSo break from all the things that you know that I'm Serious I mean as I feel\nI I you know when you wrote a whole ... you know I I don't want to say that I'm not comfortable with right and in fact study at all of it and I and you know looking at Moses I'm\nYou know it it it it is it's very inspiring and it ended up with a lawyer they also heartbreaking of how\nUm how his story in that in that he was not able to enter a problem if I had a couple of here and what so hard for so long you know an African guy can can it can go and I know\nI'm not going to allow you to cover this one game\nYou know if it's a ... you know for me if I Want to and to some extent of not letting those emotions that anger which may be invited over to take them because um [noise]\nYou know you could do foolish a mark\nOh shit that anger which may be righteous over to take me because I'm you know you could foolish a mark and they don't want to think that I\nKnow it's sometimes godly just right to the brink of success and then for one reason or another chooses someone else to\nTake the next step and I think if the people who found themselves in the position of coming to the brink of something a ... and sometimes it's a test because God has now something else more important for us to do\nThe kind of leadership that can't be found all the time that the person who walks in the success or has it easier\nThan the person who has to know begin something all over again and I'm\nFrom what they learned and and specially what they've learned from their relationship with God through that struggle that God is always there are even when you don't see him even when you don't hear him it so that the struggle that you find yourself engaged in becomes the\nMost important lesson in your life that you've probably never will have to get it last forever it\nNever it never goes goes away I'm chapter Fifteen you say truth is beauty can come from ashes how could you come from ashes\n[noise] that's a tough lesson\nThat's a tough lesson and um if not all the beautiful light away\nAs I Want to say that you know I I've been talking a lot with people about the world and ... and a tickle going how will go to move the wilderness experience\nAnd so the reality is if you go through the building as bad as if there is a promised land there is something else on the other side and we know that even when I got to prepare people for ministry that's what they saw live\nI'm left motive or ... or eventually they're going to look at forty days and so we see that God juices do some very difficult experiences in our life that sometimes feel like death\nYou prepare us to prepare us for leadership and prepare us for that very thing that he has to do and so what I Want to say about how ... how can any company ashes\nBut I Want to say that the F ... who just hold on and do some some about theology is wrapped up very well for me but from the black on black church is in the phone from saying you know so they're the song it was just saying I'm like it's in this is probably like either from slate they hold on just a little while longer\nHold on just a little while longer hold on just a little while longer everything's going to be All right and so the idea that if they just don't quit\nAnd he just don't quit that God has to be better for you on the other side and so the beauty is I think about you know I wasn't that bad that even you know one example would be like in marriage where I went to ... and the temptation wants to quit\nIt's a day and age is technology and everything else identity politics which is now being practice on both sides of the aisle\nIs unfortunately working\n[noise] Ryan went on to say we need to figure out what we're going to do\nTo stop it\nHow do we get to where we can discuss something and then not then be filled with a hatred as we disagree with somebody\nHave we\n... has that been lost and gone forever\nIs that what's happened now because granted you are always going to have the trolls on social media that for whatever reason ... nothing more than discord not to mention whatever foreign elements may decide that they want to get involved and all they want is the discord\nAll they want is the fighting back and forth\nBut we can't change them but we can change us and whether or not we're going to engage on that level\nSay right they're coming up the social media page that

peace and less hate it would be great to be great if ah that would be the result of a terrible massacre and a squirrel he'll\nHe'll get medical frontiers tonight we're talking about of seizures epilepsy and we're very fortunate to have a two experts in the studio this evening\nA first introduce a doctor Janesville oriental good evening Dr Miller into very good evening it's good to have your back and he's been a medical frontiers a ... a lot and um he is they they neurologist and he's also the department head of\nThe department of neurology at a Ellie may help network and and the next to primarily what's Allegheny General Hospital and epilepsy ah we we've done a lot of shows on epilepsy in it it's a fairly common knowledge is it not\nIt's about one one point five percent of people in the in the country of epilepsy\nAre actually about eight or nine percent of people will have a seizure in their life a single seizure in their life but most of those people don't go on to develop epilepsy mean every currents seizures but the prevalence of epilepsy in the population is about one and a half to one after two percent of people okay and it it all age groups\nDoctor ... first of all tell us what about uh her directions was a different prove or uh do you think that uh are there for\nMe [laughter] yeah I worked for you know are there are some seizures that are on the ...\nIf you look at women with epilepsy about forty percent of women with epilepsy will have their seizures usually around the time of their ...\nYeah that's what happened to me and yet\nThe sort of official term is kinda menial epilepsy all that means is they're related in time to their their their ... their ... and there were so far mono flux obviously that happens with a with their ... so ... just basically is pro just around us to stop their their men's he's from occurring\nUm and in there is some ... forty percent of women will have seizures around that time but\nStep of era even if you can stop their periods from occurring the majority of them don't it doesn't change their seizure frequency of may spread it out\nSo instead of having all their seizures in a couple of days around their men sees they may be spread out about ... over the months more but there is a small group of people that with a ... shot or with for just throw in the world for just around actually has a very dramatic effect on their seizure frequency an improvement\nSo that does happen and we do try that and some people it doesn't work as often as you would think given the hormonal nature what seems to be the hormonal nature relations for the seizures\nBut it doesn't work and most people but in some people that actually does work in the works very well so\nIn our current hot weather made it worse and yeah\nSo if you were very fortunate to be in that low percentage of people that are that are really work out or other questions Dr ... some of those or turn out of the ... things that we call turn of the medications like mistletoe and\nThere there there's a lot of things that you would be sort of it are talked about on the Internet or talked about in books that are that are supplements dietary supplements the problem for most of those is we really don't have a lot of evidence one way or the other so\nWe don't know you know did they in the long term do they help people do they are they did the debt what seriously hurt people in some ways we just don't know that so certainly we have a list of medicines that we know the effectiveness of it and don't work in everybody but we know the side effects we know things like that\nSo there there's not a harm in trying supplements by and large but you want to be careful because most of them we really don't know long term what they do they certainly on something that would replace conventional seizure medicines and\nI'm Sorry to hear that\nWell you know if it works in one person or two people were three people it may not work in a foul direct ... and ... that's the problem and what we're saying October is without good scientific studies we don't know whether those medications could be affected in a larger percentage of people\nI think I added her running for president of the country\n[laughter] okay October well you have a good week okay All right uh\nLet's go to ah to Jason in wide oak\nGood evening good either you could if you're on the air\nI'm trying to keep this simple I\nHad sort of cedars about seven years ago I didn't realize what was happening right away luckily I had somebody witness ended up at the hospital when an ambulance you know woke up I didn't know what was going on um\nI only had a couple of the time coincidentally a friend that I have a sleep study and it made me think about\nOn um I only had a couple of the time or coincidentally a friend that I have a sleep study and it made me think about what one of those sleep study places that turns out of a hardly even I'm sleeping at all\nI got to see pop machine um it seemed pretty much solve the problem I used the ache or used to fall asleep on the chair all the time but I just thought it was ... the\nI ... a lot of famous for a living just seem to fit you know my lifestyle I figured I was just a busy active person but the day after I have a sleep I'm asleep out machine for the sleep out here the next day all my muscles quit heard it\nUm when I had the first cedar put me on medication you know lost my driver's license all that stuff\nAnd at the same medication of either the number one in the meantime for seven years I've had these are as they're called ... just said very strange kind of feelings of track them I Can't uh isolated to a certain day of the week because different sleep patterns through the week\nI Can't isolated I mean the thing I eat or any of those things but I've had these are as\nUm the seizures of not really occurred [noise] other than those first couple of months\nBut I still have some neurological kind of activity I'm just interested on what more could do it just says well you're not having them that's that's good [laughter] so stay on the medication but I Wonder if that's the right thing or what else I could do\nOkay first of all Dr ... do you see this in patients with sleep apnea as a cause of seizures and what about these are O's that is having no\n... people with sleep apnea because they don't get enough oxygen and sleep they can have seizures but sleep apnea and in of itself likely doesn't cause seizures but in people who are prone to seizures they could have more seizures when they have sleep apnea\nSo if you have a history of seizures and you your sleep apnea gets treated and hadn't been treated that can make your seizures better but it usually isn't a cure for seizures in general because it's not entirely\nCause and effect can contribute to people that have seizures as far as the ... is one thing to always think about is it I mean a couple of things if people want let's say you had seizures seven years ago you're now seizure free for seven years you could actually start to think about coming off medicine at that point because you may not need it\nBut with your as the or suggest that the problem isn't entirely class and it didn't go away entirely because the ... are kind of a warning that this could still happen to you there are people though that just had once they're on the medication they just have the or is the warnings but they don't have anything that goes past that they don't actually have the seizures\nSometimes the horror as can be hard to treat they can be hard to get rid of entirely and so the question is how much medicine do you want to take to try to get rid of these when they really are just warnings and then a lot of times they're not in their not harmful in and out of themselves\nSo you don't necessarily want to get over medicate and just to try to get rid of the ... I think the or is tell you you ... you still need to be on medicine to prevent a full blown seizure but sometimes it's hard you don't want to chase the or as to the point where you're over medicate and you can't do what you want to do during the day because of medication side effects\nSo you want to hit a balance between not too many or isn't certainly no seizures and the risk of being over medicated\nOkay does that make sense to judge\nYeah that's good information to go forward with our procedure\nOkay thank you okay thank you very much for the call appreciate it okay yeah so\nA lot of a ... a lot of the\nTreatment for the seizure disorders is to find out what medication works and then if they're on the side effects and so on but\n... seizure disorders is to find out what medication works and then if they're on the side effects and so on but also being compliant with taking your medication and the the follow up a whole important is that the doctor butler into\nBut when if you if you look at people that are controlled that their seizures are controlled so they're doing well seizure wise the most common reason in that group of people that they all they have a a breakthrough seizures they haven't had a seizure and twelve months now they have a seizure\nThe most common reason is they missed their medications or one of the things that's been done now is that a lot of the medicines now are made and formulations where the pills dissolve or twenty four hours so there they only have to take them once a day\nIt's the same medicines as they used to be but the pills are different\nThat's been a boon to compliance it's easier to take medicine one time of day you could take it as soon as you get up you can take it just when you go to bed you don't have to carry it around so you you don't have to remember it and also unfortunately people will seizures not uncommon they have memory problems and just taking a medicine but it is hard if you've been on antibiotics for a week\nAnd by the fifth day you're missing the antibiotic so it's a hard thing to remember each day but it's very very important and sometimes people have to understand even if they miss one or two doses that can be enough to cause a seizure okay\nSo compliance is very very ... and you also need to follow up here for the er physician because somebody has a season or chronic medication you like to see them a couple of times a year or at least\nYeah depending on how they do we usually see them anytime anywhere from four two to four times a year\n... okay and uh the more compliant they are ah they're happier you are and hopefully the the ... works [laughter] happier they are right okay we're going to do is take a break here shortly but you can get in touch with us and Israel while we're out in the break you\nYou can ah that'd be ideal time to get in touch with us eight six six three and I won ten twenty remember that number also is the right auto mode of text line eight six six

the fact that rainy\nStimulation of for seizures uh how do you decide you between you and the patient as to whether to use of bagels stimulate or the branch simulator or whatever\nUh so that is actually a topic I think of discussion in in the epilepsy community or the owners simulators and he brings to properly treat the same type of people to people who don't have a seizure focus meaning a spot in the brain where we can identify the seizures are coming from\nA and a big on her simulated in and do you bring simulators are probably about as effective as well you know one another big honor stimulus probably a little bit more effective um and then there are responsive near simulators which are\nA stimulated devices where you have a seizure focus or where you put an electrode basically next to that seizure focus and the stimulation is designed to to break the seizures OK\nOkay very good well let's go back to the phone lines and go to Carol in a ... year on year\n[noise] I think Dr Larry and he took care of my many years ago I'm getting an eye on land to get the lieutenant with the navy and had to agree at age ...\nWell that's great thank him for his service thank you okay and\nOkay and how was he treated how was your son treated girl\nHe would put on and I said her medication with this team\nAnd how was he treated how was your son treated Carol\n... foot on Asia eradication Kelly with Dr Larry on T. V. a cat that okay okay\nSo he was on medication for eight years and was he's seizure free for those eight years\nI'm ... I'm On that Dr malaria into a medication that he has grown a little bit and find the whole time\nOkay well Dr ... thank you for his care and as you said thank your son for his service I mean that's so he must be doing pretty well because he passed all physical requirements and so and to be in the surface\nBut sometimes it does the um there's seizure there's types of seizures but there's also what are sometimes called epilepsy syndromes so Carol mentioned there her son had a condition called benign romantic epilepsy\nOr the ... there's a certain part of the brain that there are landing Fisher it means the seizures began in that region but the benign part is most of the kids that have this it'll go away as they age we say they outgrow it but there's something about as the brain matures this goes away\nSo usually as they get older this will read Mitt it will it will go away and you can go way off of medication but they do need to be on medication usually in the beginning because they can have seizures that that tend to be in sleep I'm but I'm Glad it's a very nice story there's a kind of stories we like to hear again graduations\nYeah well you can be very proud of him Carol give him are best for medical frontiers okay yeah okay thank you very much for the call a doctor of league of ... what\nDo you see out there you're you're young and your your your practice that only been at age and a four months but I'm a I'm sure you're starting to get very busy and what do you see out there in the future of from a nurse surgical standpoint and talking about seizure disorders are primarily\nWell there's a couple of things I think from the clinical side one of the big problems with a seizure surgery is that a lot of people just don't know what the options are\nUm seizure surge has been a long around for a long time and you know it's the area is absolutely a nursery that I got into because it offers a be a very good chance to cure people of their problem uh and so you know\nI think in the future I think ah identifying more people who are potential candidates or is it is a big thing\nUm there are newer technologies that are coming out so now do you bring simulators were just FDA approved recently in the last a year or so or for use in epilepsy um there are ... that people are doing to a blade seizure foods I\nUh and so there are a lot in a lot of new things are out there but uh the main thing is I think for the future and trying to get people are identified who are good candidates for surgeries okay\nAnd increase the awareness than in the medical community you know okay Dr Boulder and hope it on the medical side of ... and I know back in in um a medical school you know were there were similar Santa Barbara told ... I think we're too [laughter] but but now there's\nA there's a lot of different drugs that have been developed for epilepsy\nRight there the there's been a sort of a plethora of drugs over the last Fifteen Years actually surprisingly\nWhen you look at how many people were controlled but their seizures with the older Madison's newer medicines there's not a tremendous increase the amount of people that are controlled um statistically says about one third of people still are very difficult to control the advantage of the newer medicines over the older medicines lowest they have left side of it\nTroll um statistically says about one third of people still are very difficult to control\nThe advantage of the newer medicines over the older medicines lowers they have less side effects\nOr they don't sedate people as much they don't cause thinking problems quite as much um they don't have as many drug interactions if you have to be on other medications these drugs don't interact with them that ... as much\nCertainly still try different medications if people really do a breakthrough seizures are seizures you can't control it doesn't mean you can try another medicine you keep trying them the one thing Dr Lisa and to reiterate is there are people worried that if there's a certain amount of seizures in the medicines are working\nThere clearly is that the epilepsy surgery or the stimulated devices is clearly underutilized we still do you know there's a point where if the medicines don't work\nUm you really need to look to see is there something beyond medicines that would work\nAs far as the medications there's always medicines in the pipeline that are being developed now sometimes the medicines maybe a little more specific for certain seizure types that's a little bit different than it was where most a lot of the medicines were what you call broad spectrum they worked or not for various seizure types now are looking a little more specifically at a given seizure type\nAnd trying to to sort of Taylor a molecule a drug that that will fit that seizure type that's ... that's one of the things that's in the offing in in his new\nOkay lose his medical frontiers are
