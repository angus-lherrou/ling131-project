I mean I\nPart of the work that I Do I I Know there is false allegations I mean as a lawyer all you do in court is one side says one thing and sometimes it's the other side says the diametrically opposite thing that's what courts of law are so when people say well what do you mean you didn't believe it I mean\nWe don't believe people all the time we see people you know either perceive it wrong or make it up or just out and out lie so\nUm that's the courts of law or or forward to try to determine tried to try to determine to get at the truth and if you can't than the jury has to decide\nBack on the subject of ambassador Nikki Haley leaving the United nations dino in the car has some thoughts do you know\nHello hey can you hear me got\nLike a fairly I I think I can hear you I'm I'm calling about and I I haven't heard this on any of the uh TV CNN or MSNBC I don't watch Fox\nBut I'm a chance that may be what's going on at the White House with a missile Haley is that she made the I'm In line to take over as a running mate for Trump when he writes in two years\nSo should have done ten ... if the polls don't look good\nWell I heard that as a theory gender oh yeah you know that would help him with the women vote\nOr I see what you mean I mean I have no idea whether there's any credibility that theory but I heard I did hear it somewhere I'm One of the new channel so it's apparently a ruler floating\nYou wonder if they would leak that or if they I mean if the Democrats would come out and say hey let's look out for this if it happens it could cause a little tension between defense or office and the White House\nOh there you go do you know thanks so much for your call I have no idea whether there's a shred of credibility to that I don't either it's an interesting rumor although why would you have to leave now to be able to do that she could become you want to mess it up right into a sure vice president child he would dump pants but then I didn't think you become president so right I don't think he would dump Pence and less for some reason\nAnd Pence isn't allowed to do anything so I don't see how you doing anything up you know what I mean there was a scandal involving ... well there's not going to be [laughter]\nProbably not yeah yeah I don't think that's going to happen yeah he's he's the only guy who's not abusing government travel or you know he's just hanging out\nYeah I think he's just being vice president us oh never mind the\nCabinet thing in whether he's a believable or credible he's he's on the court he's writing to be on the court if Clarence Thomas can survive so can read a lifetime appointment\nAlthough I felt like the best evidence against him was his name was Brett Kavanaugh because that's the exact name you choose central casting if you're going to have a preppy guy accused of sexual crimes his name will be Brett Kavanaugh has anyone ever that Brett Kavanaugh hair cut but that's really lousy evidence in ... I think\nMaybe the evidence in my head it's like come on these Brett Kavanaugh of course he did it anyway having said all set you know like dash ripped rock that's allowed at all in stone that very much very similar ... was [laughter] it is in my head okay\nUm so where are we now I I'm Talking with a guy cuts my hair today\nWe're on different sides of the er Kevin uh\nOf the Kavanaugh issue but what I Wonder is where are we on it as my personal belief that men are definitely falsely accused sometimes you just gave me an example two seconds ago\nUm and I didn't ... myself and possibly that happening someday God Knows but there are more women who have legitimate claims whether or not you think a ... doctor Ford's allegations are credible and do some speculate that it's a setback for women because look she came forward got put in place and\nNo no I don't see it that way at all I think that the culture has made a chart are gargantuan shift with the me too movement it was a coal lessons of facts with Harvey Weinstein and and and ... and and that that the time just being right\nSo women now for the first time are demanding that we've been heard and people are willing to listen so I think before people were to women were demanding it but people were willing to listen and we're gonna have to keep demanding it I don't think\nIt is a set back I I think the the difficult thing is that when\nAny take away this allegation anytime you make an allegation against another human being there has to be some proof your if if there's only one witness\nThat of the victim that's proof but then the other proof is the uh\nA perpetrator alleged perpetrator saying he or she didn't do it then you have to bring in all these other factors then you look at the credibility the motivation the bias their body language or how they stand up on cross examination that's what we do in courts of law\nSo it ... ... ... it\nAs a lawyer who lives in the in the realm of due process I Will never say because a woman says it so it has to be so because we can't get there you can't have any group of people that are a hundred percent believed and never questioned\nThat's not a democracy that's not the rule of law\nAll those you know many people were completely or the Democrats were complaining that there's a bunch of long list of people at the FBI could've interviewed but they didn't because the White House limited scope now then again they might have been here all those people not found Jack ... who knows\nWell I think it can't for me it came to a point where if it was clear that the Democrats in the house did not want a conservative appointed to the court because the court was going to permanently shift for the next couple of decades\nYou have it on the other hand they were going to get one even if he makes ... was there\nThey were hoping that they might be able to pull the reverse is a technical term a reverse Merrick Garland if they lost the Senate\nOh ... Trump would have to be pickier in ... yeah ... if it carried onto ...\nYeah they were they were kind of trying to do anything they\n... did you see it I don't think we talked about this yet 'cause well when you were here I kept playing somebody don't ever get Trump just mocking uh Christine Blasey Ford at a big rally or in the mid west\nSo you know you should never have mocked her it's just you know ... you know I feel about all of his antics in that way it's all wrong it's unprecedented shields undignified\nBut I Do think the Democrats made a mistake and the way they handled it there's a lot of people have been critical about Dianne Feinstein and the leaking of of Christine's for\nAlthough we don't know for sure she looked at over seven\n... well yeah I'm not accusing her but how it was late because\nI felt in this one scenario that there is it because it was so poorly handled\nSo poorly handled and it was in such a political context that they're ... there's it was a backlash I felt like culturally men and women were saying wait a minute we want women to be heard we don't want sexual assault sexual abuse and rape but we also don't want\nA mob scene and people falsely accused and people ram rotted and as we all know who this guy used as we've often discuss I thought Al Franken was that the receiving end of Marlboro\nYeah I agree in retrospect I thought Frank and got a raw

the Washington Post who's in charge of the fact\nChecking a deconstruct the article and refused statement after statement including the fact that they're in this report that makes me scratching my head even if you I mean Trump didn't write this in in in somebody on his staff did\nI don't even know what to say about this some of the hyper links that are in the article link to a ... something that totally refused the statement that the lake is supposed to support\nRight right he he says this topic and then he highlighted so you can read the background and the background refuge what the point he's making in the piece yeah yeah\nI I I I mean I'm I'm I'm calling kind of in astonishment and a little bit of despair because\nCouldn't imagine that we could ever get to the court or something like this would be acceptable acceptable from anyone in government let alone the president of the United states and I'm thinking to myself\nIf you don't support Trump this is just another break in the wall so to speak if you support Trump you're probably going to say at the Washington Post liberal rag which is uh\nYou're not print things we know to not be too whether it was a letter and editorial a column or an op ed\nI'm so I I\nI Would I Would kind of dispute that the John and I I mean I'm not disputing what you're saying ...\nDisputing the premise because I have read op eds in all the major papers where the opinion writer twisted the facts or used a unsupported facts and got away with it so\nBy buttons maybe not to the degree of these like blatant and frequent why no\nNo no no no like like maybe a fan right like like ... like like something that may be became and accepted a name in the end of\nThe political world being laws it was a lie that was repeated so often that people began to believe\nYeah\nUh yeah I Know you're you're right about that um and I I'm sure they give people some wiggle room because they can't because they got to give them some wiggle room because there are some facts that are just beautiful on bumpy you know what I mean they aren't necessarily\nOr from fact I don't want to call them alternative facts but you know what I mean\nYeah right I mean some some things are open to interpretation but I but I I just\nIf if I'm to despair about anything at the moment I just spirit the lack of media media literacy and the country ... since we've introduced social media as one of the prime uh access points to news rather than going direct to the news source\nIt gets degraded the quality of of of of a lot of the news that people read\nAnd I I mean I'm I'm just a little bit puzzled I mean I I have the ... the good fortune of having gotten a good education on understanding how the media works and I can't suppose that everyone's had that advantage I'm ... I mean you clearly have because that's that's what you did for a living\nBut the fact that there are so much that's put out\nWith this with a ... that easily challenged but still accepted by a large on she people was really distressing in a you know I think it bodes very poorly from where we're headed [noise]\nUh yeah well everything for its really poorly to where we're headed it seems like we're heading down to spiral and horrible knows that just keeps getting worse by the day\nOkay John well ... thanks for talking pleasure talking to you have a good evening\nTo you too Steve thanks very much excellent point it is it is ridiculous that the president can write lie after lie after lie after lie and of course he didn't right he's not literate enough to write a bunch of complete sentences and actually made up and up and he's he's barely literate enough to write a hundred and forty character tweet here's Joseph on the south side how ...\nHow you doing John I was interviewing a chance to watch than Carter a lamb and like he's Ross was said on Monday\nI Apologize I did not and I meant to and then I didn't get around to and I forgot to DVR so give us a review\nWell if I was you before I I'm like a little statement a you ought to get a copy of it at least the audio ... you might want to play one or two questions show\nJust to inform the pay was thank God they would enjoy it I feel like gee do I was very good very Conor Lamb excellent I told my buddy today I he's the most exciting candidate I have seen and have you back history I was a history major in college he\nReminds me of John Kennedy this guy is sharp and white and one of the commentators tried trip him up in the ... won't foolish\nUh-huh how my excellent debate if you're a Democrat and you believe in a in a shared wealth or calling me he had a he has\nYeah he has a plan and Conor Lamb to Social Security and Medicare I I don't know about Medicare for sure but I Know for sure so sweet Shorty okay so the year Twenty one hundred\nAnd all they do is take the Dutch is from the top one percent okay 'cause there's a ... a hundred and twenty eight thousand dollars right\nAfter a hundred and twenty eight twenty five thousand dollars you don't tax anybody for the uh but when you're you're in a top one percent making millions and millions of dollars are going to take your money and\nBuilding back our Social Security fund which is being used by many many cases or the wrong reason All right thanks\nThanks Mitt pre shit [noise] uh yes\nConor Lamb does seem to be an extraordinary politician in terms of his raw political skills the ability to communicate went along with people he's a good looking guy the ability or he's very telegenic\nUh his soundbites are easy to understand and Ross says uh by contrast at least from my limited exposure a is just stiff\n'em I think that lamb has had in most polls but it's still tight enough that it seems to me it's anybody's ballgame although I'm sure ah the lamb folks were heartened by the fact that the national Republican\nParty took their money out of the race cars apparently they don't take that Mr office [noise] he's going to win\nMeantime this from CNN senator Heidi Heitkamp as well liked to North Dakota Republican opponent in the state's US Senate race representative Kevin Cramer even as a television ad saying as much I like Heidi who doesn't like Heidi said but he adds I don't like the way she votes in Washington\nThat's the dynamic of North Dakota the Senate race I Can't maybe personally like in the state but the Democratic party isn't president Donald Trump North Dakota by thirty six points and remains usually popular or the state is so critically important\nFor determining the Santa control and the twenty eight or mid term elections if I kept loses in November the path for Democrats retaking the chamber becomes increasingly difficult polls do put high kept behind Kramer\nWith one month ago North Dakota nice as it's called here has taken a backseat to bare knuckles politics\nA ace reporters Steelers insider Eddie bullshit\n[noise] other examples reports ed ... of players being disciplined for violating the conduct policy without being charged\nOr in Tampa Bay James Winston suspended for the first three games this season for allegedly groping a ... driver and forty six [laughter] sorry not funny at all I just I hadn't heard about that\nA another example Baltimore quarterback Jimmy Smith was suspended\nFor the first four games of this season for what the ravens publicly explained quote the NFL found evidence of threatening an emotionally abusive behaviors by Jimmy toward his former girlfriend that showed a pattern of improper conduct our players behavior was inappropriate and wrong\nAnd report said Bush had another example of the league imposing punishment without actually a crime\nI haven't been proving an accord law a Dallas running back ...\nServed as six game suspension and twenty Seventeen after a year long investigation into domestic violence allegations though he was never charged the New York times explained that the NFL used statements by a former girlfriend devalue its along with photos of injuries he's accused inflicting upon her to justify the suspension\n[noise] do the Steelers have a responsibility to do anything about this or do they just wait for the league to meet out punishment\nOr how much do you get to police bad behavior or should you police bad behavior by bending people or suspending them or you should you just let the league handle that and your job is to win football games and as long as he's not being too odd around the practice field or the\nUh stadium on game day let them worry about it I don't know the answer that question\nThere's no indication reports that he would shut that the league is investigating the alleged incidents involving brown merely monitoring them\nAt this point NFL teams in this case the Steelers\nAlso can self report any incidents in which they believe one of their players or other employees\nMay have violated the league's policy Steelers have no comment a Mike Tomlin said he did discipline or a B\nFor missing the Monday workday ... September seventeenth\nAfter the Steelers last of the chiefs the coach declined to specify what that specify that is how he he refused to specify or specify oddly enough a with specificity what the incident or what the punishment meted out exist it up\nExist it up\nA brown issuing a statement through the Steelers apologizing for threatening tweets saying I made a mistake and judgment with my tweet last week and I apologize for that he had threatened ESPN writer Jesse Washington\nAh wait\nTill I wait until I see you burrow we going to see what your job like he tweeted after he objected to an article written by Washington and he also called there'd be shut a racist which is ridiculous if you know it'll shut\n'em because that we should have reported that one day in the pre season Browne was limping off the field\nAnd Bush it to my knowledge according to the reporting I read it did not allow mean to imply that he was necessarily injured didn't mean to imply that he wasn't injured was merely reporting a fact\nThat he limped off the field sometimes players is you know of a hard practice they're going to live off the field but really they're just fine sometimes they're actually injured at least to some degree and that's why they live off the field so any reporter worth his salt\nAre witnessing that site is going to report it not because it necessarily means anything but just in case it necessarily means anything\nAnd then we shots in the sports writers in the NFL hall of fame as a writer he's\nHe is a veteran awesome report or as we have many in both the print and broadcast industry in the ...

religious freedom Restoration Act and then that states themselves can pass their own so they're they're quite variable\nSo what do we know about how they impact sexual minorities I Know you've done research based out of the state of Indiana\nWho I've been to now we haven't had a whole lot of research on this specific form of the law I'm there have been previous research studies looking at\nUm for the potential effects of marriage equality on a ... um health outcomes but no one has been able to really look at this rate and Restoration Act\nSo we're we're just now learning we're seeing a very similar pattern of what previous study that found looking at similar sort of laws that we think we'd have a link to overall though being protected minority population\nSo there was this twenty Fifteen law in the state of Indiana there was a controversy all highly debated in the media a lot and so you looked at perhaps what the impact would be on the on the wellbeing of sexual minorities how did you do that\nSo we look at the association um and we use data from this very large survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and prevention call to behave or with factor surveillance um they do a survey it's the largest public health survey that we do in the United states\nAnd every state um public health officer for the ...\nAnd then there's the ... the CDC so we were able to look at data from Twenty one states across the country that\nThese Twenty one states elected to include measures about sexual orientation and they're in their survey um we had data from Indiana and a lot of other states including its nearest neighbor's Ohio and Illinois I'm so it gave us this opportunity to look at\nHow people responded over the course of the year of twenty Fifteen\nAnd and I asked you earlier ... to try to define that religious freedom laws and and also how do you know a ... how do you know about people's wellbeing is this kind of like self reporting did they did they say ... in other words report how they view\nYes it is a self report survey item um we use the measure called unhealthy days which is a a CDC measure of basically how many people say that they're on how many number of days in the past three days has their physical or mental health and been not good essentially are core\n... and what did you find as this debate was raging in Indiana\nSo we thought in other twenty once they said that we had Indiana was the only one which the section minority um sample their rape or the proportion of people who are saying\nThey had unhealthy days kept going up over the course of the year and eventually that really diverge significantly from what heterosexual people in Indiana for recording so if this was something that was the topic to Indiana we would have expected to see a similar rise in heterosexual\nPeople in Indiana and we didn't see that right right if it was a seasonal or regional effect we would expect to see it and it's near the neighbors of Ohio in Illinois and we didn't see it there either\nI have to ask you we all know about the impact of discrimination and and and a similar kinds of you know public a reaction generally speaking the sexual minorities already have higher rates of of poor mental health what they would even self report as as being poor days\nYes we have there is a very long history of studies that have looked at multiple ways that we measured mental health and people I'm In the literature pretty much agrees that affects minority people have a very high burden of corn mental health compared to heterosexual people\nThe
