and\nI was pleasantly surprised at the diversity of Pittsburgh and how wonderful it welcoming\nEverybody is in this city and even\nMore so than\nMost places like Philadelphia or or your it is truly a melting pot\nYep it and it's not a city it's a collection of small towns pushed\nTogether and that's the\nFeeling I got when I moved here to Tom I came here sight unseen and it was like this isn't a big cosmopolitan city they're all of these different little groups altogether and everybody is so groovy and he I mean I don't know if you walk down the street and squirrel hill\nThat's a cosmopolitan an area all manner of every kind of humanity every day and I love that about this place when I came here because where I came from that wasn't the case\nWell I Am proud to call Pittsburgh my home\nAnd they said he is a melting pot it is resilient if there is anything I've seen\nFrom everyone here is that\nEveryone drives and everyone strives to do it together\nAnd as we say ... years whenever someone passes away we say made her memory forever be a blessing and that's all I can add to thinking about the weather people that lost their lives later memory forever be a blessing and Michael Marvin Gaye only love conquer hey\nTom thank you for calling tree shaded if you're new to the city and you need help understand onions or give me a call and went through the same thing they did was like wait one\nMore texture coming in my friend had an apartment and squirrel he'll great place to deliver bizarre plenty of nice stores enjoyed each visit they're nice people squirrel hill rocks man as as a community and that's one of the first things I noticed when I came to Pittsburgh I expect we'll bits were big city it's not a big city\nIt's a collection of small communities all real close together and it's wonderful bright from downtown to beaver county you go to Fifteen pounds it's tremendous only twelve but with my police forces Katie gay radio\n\nAnd everybody will get to those things\n\nNeed to figure out a positive somehow to look at before we all get to those things this text just came in ignorance is bliss\nI don't know whether that's in reference to but in general I absolutely agree with ya that's why I've been so happy so loan rich in shale or thank you for calling your own Katie KIA Hi\nPatty hey thanks for the uh thanks for the show push it with um yeah I I think they know Pittsburgh pretty well having been here my whole life and having spent twenty five years of my life ... you know just blocks away from me I'm\nA firm the a horrific scene today I'm going I fear is tomorrow when that list comes out and oh I'm sure you're going to be people that live to [noise]\nYou know who I've come across like go I'm fearful of it that's just the reality of of of the tragedy um I I guess the one of the other caller your calls back mentioned uh Mr Rogers Fred Rogers yeah know Fred Rogers Fred Rogers live two blocks from that a\n... yeah that was that was his neighborhood I Know\nYeah yeah I live two blocks from there just ironic that you bring up Mr and how'd you get the one I guess the one thing I I Hope comes from all this and I I'm not optimistic I'm when I was at the uh the vigil this evening it was a wonderful wonderful a display of you know just the neighborhood and and just all different backgrounds\nAnd when I was at the uh the vigil this evening and it was a wonderful wonderful a display of you know just the neighborhood and and just all different backgrounds coming together\nIt's up to us we want to drive a wedge between between Democrat Republican we're gonna do it if we want to find a way moving forward sensible way moving forward as a community\nAs a society as a people because if it's a one thing we can all agree on whether you're whether you're a Democrat or Republican or somewhere in the middle if it's one thing we can all agree on as a civilized society is a good no place for this\nAnd and where does this hatred come from I'm In my I'm In my middle fifties you and I are about the same age I Believe and I've seen a lot you've seen a lot\nAnd I'm tired of it and I'm just I'm tired of the the eventual outcome in situations like if these horrible situations it today it's two days later and we're right back at each other's throats\nOne side of the hours fighting for this and blaming the average nine years already blaming the man in the White House right now we've heard that to me it's despicable\nIt's every bit as despicable as if somebody were to blame President Obama for what took place at Sandy Hook it has no more President Obama's fault is President Trump's fault it's the societal issue or is this hatred\nCome from and that's the one thing that the young people today and old people like you and I feel we can all agree on let's find a way to address this this I Can't even describe it other than hatred is evil\nAnd let's figure out a way to figure out a way to put it to bed once and for all as best we possibly can and I don't\nThink the solution is going to be bickering amongst the two parties the leaders saying we can't have this you know we can do that because you know what both sides are right and both sides are wrong they were getting nowhere and we have to find a way\nI mean I have I have children in their twenties that I I read about every day every day in my life ... the least thing I have to worry about is whether or not they're going to walk into a place of worship\nWhether it's in South Carolina Pennsylvania whether it's over ... and get blown away for grandchildren going into a school and getting blown away or a shopping mall indiscriminately\nIt makes no sense and I really hope that again what we can all come together on here as it as a community and as a country is that we have to find we have to find the answer to what drives individuals that\nJust drives individuals to all of a sudden just going off the deep end and what are we doing as an individual and what are we doing as a Republican or as a Democrat\nTo to to dry as as as a news outlet to to in any way instigate and I know it it it it it's a question it'll never be answered\nIt there's so much more to it then the the more I noticed how close is going to wind up to forty eight hours\nFor um the the instigate part human beings don't need anybody\nTo tell them to do some evil to figure out a way to do something I mean just some human it's that human beings the caller earlier talking about evil\nUm I Do know this is\nYou and I have different opinions about whatever the subject is we spend our time yelling we're going to get tired of yelling and move on to something else\nThen whatever it was so important we yelled about previously ... and then we move on when you yell et cetera\nAnd then whatever it was so important and we yelled about previously mine's not important and we move on\nWhen you yell at sets up a necessary and point to the yelling when you

the\nComparison to Hitler and Mr Trump is not based on anything that is it's disgusting or Mr Trump defending himself\nA and the best analogy that I can give you something that a jak grass Mrs throat doctor ... is an economist who's been on this program many times\nAh and all you have to do is think about some of the things that Trump has said you can decide whether these defending their so sounding like Hitler and every time somebody makes that comparison and one of the reasons that have resisted doing it\nOr is because you think about what Hitler did during and after world\nWar two but there were things that went on before World War two when since immigrants or people of color are\nTrump's enemy within just as a Jew was considered the immigrant that had invaded the German nation who was not part of the ... uh and should therefore be expelled while the enemy without a where\nThose countries who dared to assume military superiority think of Iran and what they're trying to do right

what happens um it's not it's not that much news in Las Vegas I guess they have\nOther concerns but uh I I again I think that's another thing that says something about how people are getting ...\nI'm sort of um insulated from all this if it didn't happen\nTo you um you shrug it showed us [noise]\nWell I think or we have to focus on is the cancer and the White House you know if you take a look just two\nDays ago the Monday started with reports\nOf voter suppression in Georgia\nAnd throughout the week they talked about Indiana\nKansas on ... Texas Florida all of a sudden this past Monday Trump ... the script they called on solving nationalist what ... it was a very next day\nBombs start popping up all over the place\nAnd that took the focus off a voter suppression and the show the murder\nOn Thursday in Kentucky to African American folks or murdered by a white racist\nAgain you know it's horrible and then yesterday we have that happen all\nAnd I don't want to say this was planned a charter was Monday when he call himself a nationalist\nAnd what you have as a fellow who they're racist believe he's a racist and the terrorists believe he's a terrorist and that's what we got [laughter]\nI I'm having a hard time keeping up with you I I I don't think I have criticism of President Trump for declaring that he is the national news\nUh when I don't think that that's the specific trigger a that made all of this happened uh with the with those bombings or what happened here in Pittsburgh I think America is I send them opening monologue last hour is a violent country this is not the last we're going to hear of a mass shooting\nA and I think what happens is when the president talks about a beating up people or\nOr would he would do to somebody or what do you want somebody to Jack up somebody then I think that a lotta that sets the tone for what happens but I don't see in the direct line between him saying I'm a nationalist\nAnd somebody jumping up and shooting a bunch of people in Pittsburgh is on the line is longer than that the traces back to\nBy the jumping up and shooting a bunch of people in Pittsburgh this on the line is longer than that\nThe traces back to how he says the tone and how Democrats have fallen in line a arguing within the same way and none of it's going to stop given the comments that I'm getting here uh from the text messages\nWill also was after the shooting biased comments and by as accidents are a slight ... baseball game on criticized the Dodgers manager for how he handled the pitching staff\nBut again I ... I Know you're in Las Vegas and so I won't criticize you for not\nFor missing opening monologue but I talked about that in the part of that\nUh that really a impacts me\nIs that he says we are going to go on with our lives and it's not gonna let us mess up our schedules and I think that that's true I think that that's what exactly what's going to happen in America if you wait for ... people are going on with their lives the NFL played all their games today\nNobody did anything but Hyundai is for a minute before the games for these poor souls who lost their lives in Pittsburgh yesterday\nNobody again ...

lives\nAnd then I don't know how can we are cast down your guy you are right Larry yes you are I I and I tell\nYou what you do so much for so many thank you so much\nAnd we thank you very by sometimes I Wonder if I knew enough for anyone saying true\nI'm Matt and Greensburg rights at the dollar bank instant access center Chris\nThe caller calling about white guys with advantages over everyone else what kind of advantages that she talking about I'm a white guy my father was blue collar I went to public school and enlisted in the military I'm not setting the world on fire but I'm doing well for myself what advantage that I have that anyone\nOf any other race did not have lady just sounded racist Matt in Greensburg well back you've probably never heard of the concept that she's talking about called white privilege or they've\nSo many studies and TV stations have even done things where they sent people into rent apartments are and if it's a black couple their towed all know there are no more part unless it's just been taking white couple goes in right after that and they say oh yeah we love to have your application\nOr others have brought up with Donald Trump is done I think Anthony brought it up or putting the codes see on an application for the apartments that he was raining and not a a reading to those people\nAnd so you're being everybody takes us personally but even because you're blue collar are you still have white privilege\nYou may get a lower interest rate when you apply for a loan to buy a car a blacks historically have been charged higher interest rates they've been discriminated against in getting those same kind of blue collar jobs that your daddy hailed\nUm my father was a cook in the navy when that's all they let black people will be\nWith things have changed in this country I tell you all the time my older brother a joined the navy uh and became a three star admiral so things have changed but you still have white privilege\nUm you don't recognize it because you don't see a you don't see it and all the things that you do each and every day\nBut it comes to you whether you know it or not\nUh you don't see it and all the things that you do each and every day but it comes to you whether you know one or not\nThat's how you've had an advantage and so uh she's ... and it's kind of out of context when Kay talks about the the people in Chicago because they do called and asked me that all the time where where where where there is who's raised them why they killing people like this\nAnd so I I think she takes that same needle in most of the gym you\nTo say why these white people all the mass killers why these white man they ban every advantage Jews raising them\nAnd so I think is a valid question to tell you the truth\nOr because we hear it all the time from when black folks are killing one another who's raising them\nUm so that's what she's talking about you may not understand that but it's happening All right we're going to take just right we'll come back with more of your calls\nAnd e K afternoon news always find that line is there any potential for him facing any kind of a legal challenge if they're going to be charged with perjury I don't think so and\nThe why of all I'm a ride I mean as a DJ\nHey this is Richard Bessie inviting you to get ... to ... dot com\nBust Marcia Hughes radios hen buddy [noise]\nKatie KIA I Want

talking about the votes in the ... vote in a non voting a lot of people you know because the press had a delivery out there you know everybody was sure that she was going to win\nAnd then when she didn't win the press like you're a\nPortrayed itself is making a mistake that data no but I think that they had just a misled people purposely now\nWhat do I vote now no one a while to keep the vote
