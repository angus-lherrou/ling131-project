of his brand and I'm a huge fan of it especially now that they are in beaver county so when my time comes I Will not have far to go to set up residence that excites me I've been talking about economic development with the shell petrochemical plant and everything else it's going on around me and beaver county\nAnd win saint Barnabas jumped in and bought the tusk plaza which I still believe is a crown jewel as far as a destination in beaver county and the region\nBecause the population is growing in and around that part of bright and township in beaver and also that Seventy six thousand square feet Michael Baker their former corporate headquarters is now\nA part in Saint Barnabas that just goes to show we are definitely headed up word and onward Mr rowdy let's begin with some great news for saint Barnabas in my region but more importantly we are I Believe starting to go back to where\nGood jobs matter and we're seeing evidence of that evidence of it with all of the investments including what saint Barnabas recently did in beaver county good evening\nGood evening Robin it is a great story saint Barnabas is really happy to be in beaver county and we we believe in favor we uh we think that a beaver county is is has great potential to grow a you know it's been some tough times there what once was\nA lot more people living there it's down to about a hundred and sixty eight thousand and but we think that that we've reached bottom it's just going to start going up we bought a hundred and Seventy five acres or Neal beaver or the Baker Michael Baker headquarters\nAnd we're going to put together a plan\nIn right now while you're healthy and didn't charge is a perfect time to find out about this great program with no waiting period no paperwork no claims forms no hassle but one caviar that you have to be healthy in order to join\nTake a lot of the guesswork out of planning for your future he was perfect for my wife and me could be for you to Longwood at home for one to aid to six sixty one ten eight to six six\nOne long zero or go to long one at home dot org\nAll the way you can take it with the ... the head and listen to it any time [noise]\nAll right just because I promised Anthony before the top of the hour he wanted to ask Mr rowdy a couple of question Jim Ronnie right now with this on the disc of the two to Pittsburgh news line for my head of the Republican Party Allegheny county\nThe county's first chief exec longtime businessmen entrepreneur or an incredible resume is this the party that he knows the conservative party with the twenty plus ... trillion dollar debt and their mission as far as entitlements doing away with things like Medicare and Social Security\nNow Mr rowdy I simply said a they'll never do away with the ladder and that has always been a scare tactic of the Democratic party and as far as the debt it wasn't this president that got us in this debt and we have not had a balanced budget since Bill Clinton so your thoughts about where we are as a country and let's let's face it\nCharity begins at home the state Harrisburg you got the governor's race you got the incumbent wolf\nYou of course got Mr Wagner who is a kind of doing it WWE impression the other day a little smack down talking about getting on a catcher's mask and a ... a a mask and Gulf spikes you got Lou Barletta trying to unseat a guy who is really been\nIn there for a very long time and obviously has a very familiar name and the state Bob casey and you've got this raw fish and a ... as I mentioned earlier him trying to hang on to that seat Conor Lamb also a congressman challenging him winner take all Seventeen district so there's a lot of things happening in this election right now\nBut how much longer is going to take before we do away with the old stereotypes and stop making every Republican supposedly not liking union labor and not for public schools and not for growing the tax base by manufacturing and giving it all the corporate America\nHave we gotten to that point or is that message still not clear enough for the voter that this Republican Party is more about being progressive and moving forward as opposed to what many people believe the grand old party to be Mr rowdy\nWell there's no question that the debt Anthony\nIs that the caller yes Anthony yes he's right about\nThe death of we've we've got to do something about it and the fact that we've ignored it\nNor did vote for Democrats have ignored it and the Republicans that that are in office or or ...\nOr ... and the last uh met a straight Republican administration let the let the debt grow also uh we've it's going to come back and haunt us we need to do something but nobody's got to get rid of Social Security or\nOr uh or Medicare or Medicaid or those those things are they need to be changed some of them is it's not a perfect\nSystem but uh it's it's the the the two parties have got to start working together this divisiveness that we have been fighting each other and being so uncivil is we'll\nNever get anything accomplished which we did a lot when Ronald Reagan was president and Tip O'Neill was was the speaker of the house Democrat and Republican and they would make deals and they may deals that made the country grow and and uh they they would fight\nOn the floor all the time and then go go have a drink at night and figure out how they were going to solve the problem we need to see more of that\nWe need to see people that can work together and not it's not about gesture party\nToo many politicians today make a decision based on whether or not they can get reelected how does that decision helped me get reelected not on what's the best thing to do and we've got to stop that and it really has to come from both parties\nAre there are some good Democrats or there's some good Republicans and there's some that are not as responsible as they should be and so we need to it's it's hard to tell him a campaign because everybody's telling what they're telling you what they think\nOr you want to hear of but uh I I hate these divisive campaigns\nAh then and they all go negative and that's all you hear they're not telling you anything that they're going to do they're not telling you how we can make their country better of the state better or community better\nThey're telling you about why it their opponent is such a bad person and that's we somehow we've got to get beyond that\nNeed to get to the issues and that's why I was so kind of disappointed in many of the debates and I've heard that whether it's the moderator commentator or the candidates themselves they just don't stay on issues and there are so many issues out there\nAnd I remember when you told me and I really that's been my monitor if you you know create jobs you really eliminate a lot of the problems that have been really troubling this country and that's why I Believe that this vote is so important let's turn to business here very quickly the deaths of ... co founder of Microsoft\nYou at one time worked for the great Ted Turner and I must tell you recently watching an interview\nWith him or not only a on a network television show but also a a HBO special that was hosted by his former wife Jane Fonda\nSaddled up in a a ranch in Montana on his horse funny looking a little older and and and not so um how can I say he's swashbuckling as we once did\nBut I can still see the gleaming his eye and I still have such admiration for him and people like Paul Allen and it kind of gets back to what you know everybody is so concerned about this corporate tax cuts I've said this there will always be those who lead and if we're able to be on that same train with them\nWe will all really prosper in the end the world needs more people like that and we were talking about Chuck betters you obviously on a smaller scale in our region but explain to them\nIn but explained to the audience why these mavericks these men and women are necessary to keep the food chain going in America gym\nBecause they have vision it's very hard for a lot of us to to visualize what's gonna happen in the next five years in the next ten years\nBut people like Paul Allen and Bill Gates and Ted Turner had vision of they knew what was going to happen in industries like cable and TV [noise] long before anybody else I can remember Ted Turner coming into my office\nAnd telling me he was going to put our television station WCBS on a satellite and being the signal all over the country may be all over the world and I said we\nCan do that that's not a very good idea and [laughter] and\nYears later I can remember I was in Pittsburgh and and he called me and we were on the phone and right in the middle of the conversation he said you know I'm worth five hundred million dollars of course\nThe day's worth several billion but then it was five hundred I said is that what you call it no I called to tell you I made four hundred million I was doing things you advise me knocked [laughter] so he had a vision that was remarkable\nI I've never seen anybody they could figure out what was going to happen when he bought the MGM a film library for one point five billion dollars back in the days when billion dollars it was a lot of money and everybody said well he's crazy that he'll go broke for sure\nWell that film or very today is probably worth Thirteen billion dollars\nA but he he figured out that what we were going to need was a lot of content\nAnd so it's the same way with with ah anybody I've built they built a is a good example or he's the president of saint Barnabas\nAnd he took over a nursing home that ah was about to go out of business and today that single nursing home with probably fifty forty or fifty employees we now have seven campuses eight hundred and fifty employees\nAmazing they were serving one point five uh a thousand people a everyday residents independent living in nursing homes or assisted living a rehab\nA ... and and he's the ticket from absolutely nothing and that organization when we buy things today we pay cash we we have no debt Anthony would really like\nSafe on it because if he's concerned about the debt here's a company that's grown and grown right and we don't have a penny of death well\nThe thing that I Love about saint Barnabas they got that hastened the deck that happens to be you and you won't need a paycheck anytime soon but I'm sure you enjoy a good meal from time to time Mr Romney always a pleasure you know my love and respect for you let's do it again real soon okay\nRob thank you so much and thank you for all your help and beaver county\nIt's only the beginning I promise you have a good night you to\nDairy goes the great Jim Ronnie to just listen listen and listen incredible journey incredible story one of Pennsylvania's sinus an icon we'll be back stay with is good evening\nBottom line here and you know then go on to talk about and I don't mean it can't be colorful I don't mean you can't\nYou know go after people who disagree with him not talking about that\nAnd and but I think all politicians have that with the dialogue has to be dial back I liked that dialogue dial back [laughter]\nVery good hey on an international notes the Saudi Government ... or ... or ... or ... and that ... story journalist ... guy falls ... follows politics talking about the president\nSupporting although denying any business interests there and how most presidents turn\nAway when it comes to Saudi Arabia because of the economic impact of that country meaning OPEC ... what's your it's what do you make of all of this\nYet well Saudi Arabia remember is ally in a crucial area of the world make no mistake about that along with Israel but having said that there isn't any doubt that\nThey're they're not at ... I mean look at the policies they have towards women and others in their society I mean it's brutal there that you know we're not talking about a\nDemocratic Republican republic there [noise] uh I Do and there isn't any doubt given all the press accounts if something happened and that the Turks are involved in an investigation and I'm not I'm not at all\nUh I mean I Would say let's get the facts before we reached judge which I think that's the point the president is making\nIt's making a the problem is he seems to be more sympathetic\nThen he probably should be given their history and given the fact that what we know now and it's like complete the investigation you know for sure what happened\nBut there isn't any doubt that the government of Saudi Arabia or you know ... ... as brutalized its own people and that gives way the argument that you know what happened to the journalists ... what happened to him we don't know is you know the latest\nAccount was that well he might have been it might have\nBeen killed in an interrogation that went south I don't know if that's what you hurt your your your than it is\nYeah latest theory\nYes I Do I did hear that now we're going to get some of the issues in this campaign and and I want to spend the entire second segment talking about jobs but to give folks an idea of why this next topic is become\nSo polarizing in and just about every election grassroots you know the state level national level I mean it's it's big let me just share this week and this has been trending for like the last half hour on CNN\nAnd just bear with me nearly five months since ABC's much publicized accidents Roseanne a revival from its lineup the network on Tuesday today\nVermeer the Connors a half hour spin off of named around the fictional family of Roseanne Connor Roseanne Barr the first episode Dan John Goodman Jackie Laurie Metcalf in rows and children are three weeks into dealing with the aftermath of a sudden death\nFrom what they believed to be a heart attack when it doesn't take long horn for the truth to come out Roseanne the character the fictional character died as a result of an opioid crisis and so that just goes to show you you know um [noise] this opioid situation in our country\nHas become such an issue that they've even found a place for it in a fictional setting which is this family the Connors which is a spin off of the Roseanne Barr show\nSo I guess this is a major issue and it's one we're all talking about right\nThere isn't any doubt about it and here's what's interesting we talk about the polarization and the big differences between Democrats and Republicans I Do think and you know they get appropriate money in this year state budget\nFederal government has put money out I Do think that's one area where Democrats and Republicans can agree\nIt is a huge crisis it by the way gene bar the president of the Pennsylvania chamber of business and industry is on record discussing how significant this is\nIn employment in jobs where once you get you know you do this testing people who might otherwise be employed can't be employed because of the opioid situation it is a major problem with work force in you know with employment\nAnd it's something that we need to address as a society as a whole you're absolutely right about that\nAll right we'll take a break we'll come back one more segment of Dr Terry Madonna coming up next hour we're going to be focusing on some of the brand new product for the fall of two thousand Eighteen from a tea and tea when James defeat joined me in the disk and to the

decades that's my personal opinion show how someone really kind of navigate through the very stormy weather\nAnd rough waters when it comes to the right candidate who's going to create jobs ah so what what should people look for that just forget about party lines but let's let's focus on the candidate\nWell first of all what I Would do would be to take a look at a record getting into a number one of the biographies of the candidates\nAnd you know some people came from you know they might have been a a high school teacher we might have been a coach it might have been in some areas of the economy where they didn't produce jobs because it wasn't the nature of what they did\nBut I Do think it's helpful if you I I always go and do a big search or their biographies let's start with that number to get I get\nI get on I Would get online and I would look at their website and look at their positions what is it that they say they will do to create jobs and but basically there are some differences\nBetween Democrats and Republicans not all Democrats and Republicans but you know essentially Democrats are more likely to want to use the government\nHelp prop up and promote economic growth\nAnd creation of jobs Republicans and I'm speaking generally now they're they're exceptions generally Republicans want to use the private sector and want to reduce regulations want to reduce

candidate is now legal in Canada but there are\nNow here in Ontario you can only order on the line from a government possessed no more than thirty grams and consuming in public is still banned so all

considering in Ontario [noise] there are no this country will talk about that coming up after news with rose in just a moment\nRight now it exists but only in the shadows\nNow let's talk about the potential for industry here with the legalization of marijuana initially everybody thinks of just being able to smoke it maybe go with edibles or something else\nBut there's also an entire other industry they can go along with the production of marijuana now that it's fully legal or across Canada some of it they've already taken advantage of with like with the what they have legal in ... that we do not\nKnow exactly ah sometimes I'd um we tend to ignore the hemp industry because it's not as exciting it doesn't have the uh uh you know\nSome of the stereotypes are associated with it a hemp is industrial it doesn't have the AC it can't get you high but the potential commercial and industrial applications for a hemp crops that's one of the reasons that we have a pilot program here in Pennsylvania it's one of the reasons that a Senator Mitch McConnell pushed\nA and passed him a bill through the Senate and Canada as fully exploring you know that industry as well which can produce food products oil products a fiber of the the potential is incredible and that's really I think going to start to get our law law makers of tension locally\nHere is Katherine Porter she is a candidate a bureau chief for for the New York times\nCannot advertising team anyway Ken had sports figures or anything that they will think it's cool I'm In advertising\nAnd to what extent is that significant do because ultimately if you're going to make it legal then people are going to want to see some really strong limitations that are put in place in order to try to limit the exposure to minors\nYeah I think that makes sense it shows that are where a candidate committed to responsible adult use a you know and I know that all the number of your listeners probably remember some of the aggressive cigarette\nMarketing or from twenty or Thirty years ago with Joe Camel and Marlboro points and things like that and you know that\nIt clearly had a ... a correlation or was directed at a certain demographic and I think that uh the cannabis industry is very wise and appropriate to say wait a minute we understand that there are practical limitations because this is for responsible adult use\nOnce again Katherine Porter she has a bureau chief for the New York times in Canada has\nSome places you can walk down the street and smoke marijuana in places that it's illegal to smoke cigarettes and other places and other products as you have to do it only inside\nAnd that's something interesting to point out that although it's illegal there are those limitations as well\nYes and that's something that's similar to Colorado you know it's like a lot of people go to Colorado and they're surprised to find that\nWhile they can you know as a non Colorado residents a purchase a marijuana products but they can't openly consumed them there isn't a a a lounge or a restaurant or something for a a people to consume so that\nFor lack of a better term growing pains that I think that we're going to continue to to move through a as we de stigmatize cannabis use and you know start to treat cannabis use the same as any other uh recreational use\nTo what extent can us citizens go to Canada and consume marijuana\nYou know there are no rules restrictions are in Canada for a American citizens going over but by God don't come back with it because if you cross the border with it you know that is something that's violating a U.S federal law and could potentially be very very serious especially\nThey're very serious especially if someone is trying to bring back you know any amount of quantity uh uh other drug test of whether or not us citizens could face retaliation domestically uh I'm hoping that that's not the case that would be a level of a big brother intrusion that I think we would all five yeah apart\n... one of the things that's been brought up earlier today they could be a deterrent for some Canadians to even use\nThis for recreational purposes is that as you cross the border into the u._s. you may be asked about any potential activity that you would be engaging they will be illegal and the United states and that could prevent you from being able to gain access to the states\nYou know that's again a type of ridiculous prohibition that comes with\nThe war on cannabis or or a can of as being illegal and unfortunately what that saying to that the Canadian tourist is hey you know I'm Still a second class citizen I still have to pretend\nLike I used to pretend that I don't smoke marijuana and I'd check off the the appropriate box on on the farm

[noise]\nTime and you know with me today Randy Davis and I'm reading off a business card right here\nI see are empty and that sort of find reverse mortgage professional he's assistant vice president residential lending a dollar bank and Randy we are talking about reverse mortgages tonight yes absolutely thank you very much for stopping by and being a part of this and I\nI Want to invite everyone if you have any questions at all regarding reverse mortgages you are welcome to call here's the number\nEight six six three and I won ten twenty eight six six three nine one ten twenty and real simple we there's a whole lot of information that you alternately need he could find out what kind of money when you can have available to you by calling in and giving what information Randy\nWell if you're over sixty two that's good if the price of your house what you think of what a price for it if you have a mortgage on it or any leaves a home equity loan or just that information there we can start off and find out what you may be able to qualify for\nOkay and if you have any other questions regarding reverse mortgages\nA please take this opportunity to call and talk to Randy Randy is one of a very select number of people around the country when it comes to his level of certification and\nWell you reverse mortgages not do into the last one lives in the house so in the last one passes away they don't live in the house anymore\nWe don't know in the house that's the big misconceptions they stayed on the house so we're going to give the state up to a year to sell off the property pay off what they do it on the reverse mortgage any interest and they keep the rest\nNow if they're upside down if they use all the money early and they live very long they could do more in a house in the house was worse because of the interest building up over the years\nIf that's the case then the states not responsible for the difference it's government insured it's called a non recourse loan mhm you can't file deficiency judgment against anybody against the state so at that point we let the estate just they can walk away de loop foreclosure they just don't get any money\nSo I always have that conversation with people if you're not concerned about leaving your adult children or somebody else\nOr your home a reverse mortgage may be a good idea if we worked out the numbers that sound like there was something you might want to do a but if you want to leave all the equity to your dog children or a friend or loved one or you probably want to stay away from a reverse mortgage 'cause you could actually if you use the money it's a bet you're going to go over the over the value of the house over the years\nThat initially reverse mortgages were for individuals who um came across a hardship and it would be difficult for them to stay in the home is that still being used in that way today\nThat's definitely still being used that way today but what what else has used it was it in the past was a standby line of credit\nFor emergency reasons or for financial planning\nA studies have shown there was good articles in in a lot of a recent news ... news\nMagazines and articles about uh\nIf you can combined the line of credit with your retirement portfolio\nSo you have a recovery for probably the two hundred thousand three hundred thousand you combine that with the two or three hundred thousand are a lot of credit of course your money's going to extend further out in your retirement I'm not a financial planner but I Know the whole key is not running out of money and and the line of credit helps a lot of people not run out of money\nIs so much so that this is a good idea that there are many investment advisors now the you personally have taught this too yes that they have come to you to try to get a better understanding of this so they can help their clients retired\nThat and I'm Glad you said that because it used to be I had to track them down but over the last couple of years they've been tracking me down and they see me out because they want to know about this uh\nIt's funny I have one running right in front of me on the computer from a financial planner where the house was worth three fifty and and this fellow needed some extra funds he was starting to run out of money at the Seventy five years old he had some money left but not a lot\nSo at his age it's a it's Seventy five he was getting a hundred and forty one thousand dollars in a lot of credit that he can dip into when he needs to he doesn't have to take any of it but it's there for when he wants to take it\nAnd he could take it out monthly if he wanted\nIf we wanted a monthly payment yeah this is a good that's a good question because if he wanted a payment we would pay him eight hundred and thirty one dollars every month they wouldn't have the line of credit though but he would have the eight thirty one and that eight thirty one would never run\nRun out as long as he paid his taxes on the house and lived in the house\nAnd there are there are limitations of how many times you can draw money out on the line of credit\nThey do limit you if you had a hundred and forty one thousand you would be limited eighty thousand the first year they don't want you to have access to everything they're afraid he might take it all out and I\nDoubt here's what I'm thinking if I have a hundred and forty thousand dollars available to me in a line of credit and what you mentioned earlier that my line of credit will grow was right\nFor the amount that I Do not use that is correct then what if I wanted to pull out a thousand dollars a month ... out of my line of credit\nYou can take money out anytime you want your limited eighty thousand the first year\nOkay so I could take it out every once a month I Want it to her once every couple of weeks they write a line of credit now not limited at all when it comes to that but I was thinking what's nice about that as I can take the money out once a month but then what remains will continue to grow on an annual\nBasis church right let's look at the one here with a lot of credit was a hundred and forty one by the end of the first year it's almost a hundred and fifty that's quite a bit of growth and when you're absolutely a in three years or grew to one sixty almost one sixty nine\nSo that's a substantial growth rate insurance\nAnd a ... as a result of that continual growth of what is available to you if you take out the um line of credit at an earlier younger age when you're generally healthier as it grows over time ten years down the road or whatever it might be and you don't have the help that you once did\nThen you have this really big amount that would be available to you is it possible that that amount will be greater than what you could have qualified for a few would have gone and got a reverse mortgage at that load her life that later date\nActually you would be better off by applying now is if you if you work out the numbers ... what's been happening and people that apply to a year ago and went apply now they're actually getting less money now because they lowered how much you can get\nA and there's talk they may do that again they may may right they may increase there might be they may change their principal limit factor ... mortgage insurance they might increase that they might lower again how much you get out of these so people that way to the year or two a actually got less money when they fly now\nAnd if you do the numbers are and you have that line accredited will actually grow more for you than if you waited a couple of years and applied\nOkay now this idea of having fewer dollars available as can now as compared to a a couple of years ago what is the argument behind having fewer dollars available\nWhat do you mean what's the ... the argument from making from the government standpoint of telling you how much you can have available ... ... why they're doing that is why are they doing that\nThey have to look at a brine Montgomery a just had to look at it\nAnd you have to do a projection over the next Thirty years it's F. ha stop doing business is there enough money in that pool there's billions of dollars in that mortgage insurance fund but is there enough money in that pool\nIf a lot of these go belly up if they had to answer is no and he thinks that answer\nMight not be no right now are\nYou may have to decrease what they get because you what this is a negative advertising was what they're trying to prevent us from going upside down where the government has to come in and pay that insurance mhm\nSo that's all they're trying to do is protected and that's why they loaded up back October a second last year okay they lowered it by about twenty percent but that's just to try to protect and keep the program going because you know it's an important program for people\nAnd needs to be financially solve it\nDoes yes it has to has to be competitive financially solvent that's what they're trying to do with that adjustment they made\nIt all to mentally the government's exposed for the amount\nThat you say that there's two hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nHundred and fifty thousand dollars in debt on a home that can only sell for two hundred twenty five thousand dollars sure they're only liable for that twenty five then\nYou're never responsible for more than\nWhat I Know some of the government's standpoint they're only on the hook for covering a twenty five thousand as far as maintaining a level of solvency\nYeah so ... so that's why they ... they reduced it and that's why they're watching the program they just want to make sure it solvent they want to make sure it's good and they wanted to be here for a long time for people\nAnd they also want to make sure that this is right for the person who is getting into that after a while have safeguards they\nMight what's financial assessment it's almost been three years now\nAnd a financial says but you have to sit down and make sure people have enough money left over for a couple or enough money left over for a single individual or if they don't then you have to ask wrote for taxes and insurance and that ask grow a for this gentleman here uh when the three hundred fifty thousand house\nHas asked ... if you didn't qualify would have been Seventy one grant so if if he didn't have enough money coming in the door we could say well you know and your credit wasn't good we can hold back Seventy one thousands still give him Seventy thousand and a lot of credit but now he doesn't have to worry about his future taxes assurance be paid 'cause we're going to take him out of the reverse mortgage\nAnd for people to do qualify that's a lifesaver for them because they're like wow okay I was having a hard time doing that that's why I got behind a little bit my taxes if you're going to ask her own for me that's wonderful mhm I don't have to worry about losing my house now\nRight now it's a fantastic position to be yes what's really nice is that for anybody who's looking at a reverse mortgage a there are a number of different safeguards that are in place to ensure that this is really the best thing for you at this time and one of the great things is that\nWhen you're dealing with dollar bank uh it's it's different than dealing with just about anybody else that's out there\nWho were full service banks so if I feel that a reverse mortgages that right I'm going to be the first one to tell people a a maybe you need to look into a home equity loan and we have great home equity reps we have great mortgage wraps a and I'll be the first one of the tone that need to do that or sometimes I Need to tell them that you know may be moving is the best ideas on your situation\nReady Davis is what is he is a sort of find a reverse mortgage professional assistant vice president residential lending a dollar bank more coming up in a moment\nWhen you want a spot that burglar when he's case in your home or after he said asked John who's blink camera alerted him a burglar tried to break in while he and his family were home or Shannon who's blink camera caught a thief stealing packages both times blink video clips were sent a police to help convict the crux\nBlink motion activated indoor and outdoor cameras are wire free set up and minutes and run on to double aid batteries that last up to two years\nAnd the live feed option legit check in from anywhere using blink smartphone app so you know when your kids get home from school they'll contracts know subscriptions totally affordable and blink works with Alexa\nBlink camera systems are back in stock and right now they're Fifteen Percent off that's right Fifteen Percent of all security cameras\nAnd you can do that there's you know some people call it a a reverse mortgage a long with a choice of a payment or no because you can make a payment you don't have to make a payment okay so if you want to make a payment concerned about keeping the equity down you can do that\nWell people who are asking questions about payments they're trying to figure out in their mind okay if I'm never making a payment then how do you get your money back and how do you make money\nAre we make money what's the loans cause we make no money up front we make money when the loan closes then that's based on the interest that you used over the years and some people it's a little bit some people it's a lot I mean how they use\nSo theoretically there's this long term investment that dollar bank is making in this house and these individual that's correct so if you're sixty two and you're eligible for this and then you lived to be one hundred to\nWe haven't made any money on that loan you know\nDollar bank isn't making a dime for forty years till the loans paid off is ultimately paid for that is right now for that individual that has it\nDead or when that time comes they need to no longer being in the home they could come from somebody passing away once they have one right mhm it could also come from an individual who then goes to a nursing home right how long would they have to be in the nursing home\nMe for the home would have to be very\nCommon question a lot of people asked because some people go to nursing home for three months or five months 'cause they get hurt and they worry about what's going to happen if they ever reverse well here's the real uh once you're in there twelve months consecutively in a row then it becomes too and the reason they made that role is if you're in there for twelve months most likely you're not coming out\nBut a lot of people go in for a month or two or three months for rehab and things that's\nIn rehab and things that's fine you go back into the house you reverse mortgage still continues you still get your monthly payment of your line of credit available to whatever you have set up it's the key is when you are in their over twelve months that are oh okay then we would work with with the whoever your contact person isn't talking about getting a house on the market or whatever you need to do to do that now\nIn a number of people also concerned about leaving a debt obligation to their children\nYeah the house was the only collateral for the loan your adult children can have a million dollars and assets a million dollars in the back\nUh we can't touch that houses the only collateral so only one or two things are going to happen when that last personnel longer lives in the home the state's going to own the house\nAnd then they're going to call in and find out what they do and the reverse or if they know they could put her on the market will give them a year to put it on the market sell the house pay off what they keep the difference if its upside down they know there's no sense keeping an eye on the market paying for taxes paid for utilities they can just walk away do move for closure because they're not going to get any money\nOr they did its purpose they're they're they're the other people use up all the funds I'd\nJust for clarity purposes deed in lieu of foreclosure\nThat means in the rare case where you owe more than the house is worth when you passed away and your state gets ... and they go well you know they are two hundred thousand this house is only worth a hundred and fifty so I Can't sell it for a hundred and fifty and pay off the two\nI'm just going to walk away it'd be done with it not responsible\nThat's deed in lieu of foreclosure okay although they do need to clean it up a clean up the house if it's going to be a deep blue okay but that's good 'cause they take out everything they need the furniture and everything else whatever they want ... and there's a clean the house up in this ... the bank will do that and they sign a document yeah and if they're back takes it over and therefore handlers you're if you're done\nGood times you sign can't touch throws what's\nNow so no other assets so let's go back over this for a second you have a one hundred and fifty thousand dollar home right there is that\nNow a loan of two hundred thousand dollars that is owed on this home for they took it out early lived long they are more\nRight yes but at the same time they also have other assets let's say another half million dollars in other assets house was the only collateral period so that half million doesn't get considered whatsoever\nNo sir never the houses only collateral for the loan that's government short ah you've probably heard me say this many times the first reverse mortgage done in Nineteen sixty one mhm but in February I think it was February fifth of Nineteen eighty eight President Reagan signed a bill that added a layer of insurance disease that protected them\nSo that's why they got a bad a\nLot of misconceptions about reverse mortgages is the first one was on a Nineteen sixty one it was a two eighty eight Nineteen eighty eight to President Reagan signed a bill that protected people\nAre so then when the first one was done because of the housing and economic recovery act a back then they were short\nAnd they've been and there was safe and viable options for people use ever since ... uh there's only been a couple of things they had to fix like non barring spouse issues and they have fixed them\nOkay well we'll talk about that as well coming up for those that way to say I I Want to leave the equity in my home to my children then it sounds as though reverse mortgage may not be for them\nI just had that exact conversation today that's that was their main goal there they're struggling to get by their in their eighties uh but they really don't\nThey didn't want the help I could give them because they really wanted to leave the house the children as well then that's your choice if you're if you're a K getting by the way you are you will leave the house the children you won't have it they won't have any money out on they'll get the whole thing and ...\nAre really well here we are saying that people think this way from my perspective at all due respect everybody's there for the seniors but for me unless the child wants to live in the home\nLive in the home all of a child's going to do is sell the home right and I'm having a difficult time with this aspect to well that's the we why would I Want my mother and father and to struggle to barely get by and live on scraps most people don't\nKnow if they could live a much ... much more comfortable life just so I can get money later\nMost adult children one mom and dad to do that they wanted to take care of themselves so they don't have to worry about them but some of the mom and dad's take the kids went past but they really don't but they need to have that conversation that's why I told us that the older couple of times you wrote that'd be talk to your children ... she was no I said well you're making some assumptions you really need\nTo talk to him talk about where you think of it because you're struggling and you need to struggle when you have a house without any money on right now we can help you you know and I think there'll be happy to do that especially if you do a lot of credit where you only take out what you need is you needed a\nThat's an ideal situation yeah honestly payments to yeah but they're they're really from the old school they just wanted to leave the kids the
