of our values than there is any way\nI Can't tell you the number of people who have reached out to me from the Republican Party who have said exactly that um I've got and I literally [noise]\nProbably hundreds of requests and comments when people asking me to join the the walk away movement that they've started where they're trying to recruit Democrats and the um you know labeling Democrats as ... and the mob and things like that as the president likes to call them um\nI can tell you that I thought long and hard about it and at this point I have no intention of leaving the Democratic party I think my my values are coming growing up in the inner city of Boston and a very a labor central household and I'm a recipient of many of the social programs are out there\nI think that's a I'm comfortable staying at home with the Democratic party but\nYou know as I think more and more about it uh for the first time in my life I might start to think about casting a vote for someone who might not be a Democrat just based off of start to look more issues on where they stand\nA I was such a staunch Democrat in the past but I think is going through something like this definitely opens up your eyes to what's what are the ... what's the other side saying and can we find common ground so maybe that makes sense on some issues at at I disagree and others um but I think at this point I'm staying home with the Democratic party\nWho you've been in the hot seat because of this what do you think the tone in ten or ... debate now between Republicans and Democrats\n[noise] well I think it's it's really it's been nasty for a long time but I don't think I've ever seen it this bad\nUh I was telling people that in the time that I was in the position and I would feel phone calls from people at the office\nI'm just the nastiness and the tone that you would get over the phone calls and then it would translate to tweets and posts and things like that that you see on social media\nAnd it's so easy for people to put stuff on social media and and hide behind it um it's almost cowardly as I said earlier or you can put something out there and you can hide from it but it to say it in public or things that they might tone it down a little bit but\nJust the the tone of in the discourse that use here between the parties\nIt's really nasty and it's it's just it's just ugly there's really no other way to say it's just that really ugly place that we find ourselves in our national politics\nOr you know you you've been part of this right now that nasty tone or what do you think needs to be done to tone it down and if you will\n[noise] well unfortunately I Will be one that says that I think it starts at the top when you have a president of the United states who stands up there and and bullies people and cause people out on their looks and a mocks people for disability and things like that\nI think it it sends a message down to the supporters that it's okay to do that when when you offer to pay people's legal bills if they get arrested for doing something dumb at a rally I think it sends a bad message um\nYou know whose lives are already mom rewrite while the other side might not like President Obama but he was probably one of the class is man as a class as presidents we've had a long time just the way he carried himself with dignity and respect um I I Would choose that as a president versus what we have now any day\nSo um what do you think is going to happen with the midterms are they rarely two weeks away um ah what do you think is going to happen people who predicted a blue wave\nBut do you think is going to happen with the midterms are they rarely two weeks away um ah what do you think is gonna happen people predicted a blue wave of blue air time ah now people are predicting a red wave in a ... red am died uh what do you think's gonna happen you follow politics for some time [noise]\nWell I think at the end of the day I'm as I look I think we're probably when I say well yes and the Democrats I think will pick up the house I think we probably or come close but I don't think we're going to pick up the Senate um I think you're right it was kind of funny that we have a a blue wave and red\nTide uh I I think in my opinion my my best guess is a usually there's a twenty five thirty five forty\nAnd bought a house seat swing in the midterms I'm at right now I think it stands up is two hundred and thirty five Republicans on something like a hundred and Ninety three um Democrats with a few vacancies in there and I think the Democrats are running strong\nUm I was a little nervous about the cabinet bump I think that as a a real issue I think that's something that you can see and you can hear whether it's social media talking to people there definitely was a a a rally cry that on the Republican side that they got together around calving on like in the Kavanaugh hearings\nBut unfortunately there's just going to be too much time in between the hearings and election day and the Democrats will get back on message um and I think in the end of the I think will pick up the house\nI I just wonder what message to the Democrats than you know a ... they they seem\nDiscombobulated to me I I don't see a in twenty twenty or any front runner for the president say\nUh I look at all these races or nationally that are that are so close um I don't know if they have a firm message is going to appeal to a their base as much as President Trump has a firm message that is appealing to\nHis base even though he's using I think outlandish reasons to

Mansour query\nFor sure and Matt you know you're exactly right um I've said before about a rookie on the political game and I understand that when you're an executive director of any organization in regardless if it's political nonprofit or otherwise\nThat you buy except in that position or you become the face and some cases of that organization you become the speaker for that organization I'm the only ... and I agree with you\nAre the only thing I can I can say is that I was not the executive director when we made that post we posted that that post on Facebook on July second I took the position of executive director the day after the Labor Day parade which I Believe was like September for\nA had I been in the executive director and we probably would have taken more cautious too um because of the position not that I Would not have supported the family at all I might have done it in a little bit more of a private fashion maybe I Would have done it as a a targeted email or something like that\nBut I just need to say that the post was done long before I even considered or probably was considered for the position\nUm so I can understand the sensitivity of the issue I just want people to keep in mind that this was done prior to me except in the position then I probably would've given it a little more thought had I been in that position because I Do understand the role they play when you're an executive director in a public figure out the ... such as the Democratic party\nAll right let's go back to the phones Sean and to read from your own Katie K with mark ... senior\nYet [noise] excuse me a link you guys' opinion on something and that is you asked what can we do to tone back and make it more Seville\nYou know when people actually get along again yeah\nWhat the the two of you think whether you're a liberal or conservative or libertarian what about actually teaching the constitution of the United states in high schools again\nWith what I mean by that is lately I have watched both sides not just one but both sides use the bully pulpit very very well and in doing so they're violating people's constitutional liberties\nAre we just wash professor forwards right to privacy violated we just want you to judge Kavanaugh's rights of innocence until proven guilty violated and this is becoming common place\nAnd I think if you actually understand what your rights are and everybody else is around you are a lot of this stuff will have to calm down on the ... right now people just don't know any better [noise] what do you think about that\n... you go first [noise] well Sean Sean correct yes\nCorrect is okay yeah Bush on\nI think you make a very sensible point um and it it might almost be too sensible or one of the things that I have always advocate it is I truly believe that we should make the general election a national holiday\nIf we weren't to do that then possibly we start to teach it and teach about it I'm In the elementary schools and we start to teach more civics um and people understand the liberties that they have 'em and just the freedom of voting by itself and and how powerful that could be\nA most of our holidays that we celebrate get taught that the kids are taught why we why we have the day off a and it should be more than that more than just a day off that should be something that it's celebrated as another beacon of hope around the world\nIf they're taught why we why we have to pay off a and it should be more than that more than just a day off that should be something that it's celebrated as another beacon of hope around the world of the United states is um this caravan that it was coming laws\nThere's only one reason in my mind why they're coming here it's because we're the we're the greatest nation on earth and that's why they want to get here but if we were to make it a national holiday and it was taught in school says you're saying that the constitution is taught in school\nMaybe we would see a higher voter turnout or maybe we would see a more educated voter um and then in doing so maybe you would see a less civil discourse taken place and more people sitting down talking at the table and and just hashing out and coming to a sensible solution to some of the nation's problems\nA son or my position is I often sit here and talk about what I learned in my eighth grade civics class was that was back in the crow magnet near us so I I'm always amazed that that people are are not informed about the constitution or what our personal rights though the bill of rights or any\nOf this information is out there and I think that we\nDon't care about it because we don't know about it so I think that you're right if we if we were to look at the document that the founding fathers put together\nNo matter what their background though nobody called me and tell me about who was a slave owner anybody that like that\nIf we looked at it that all men are created equal and lived up to those kinds of things we'd be much better nation that's the reason I strive to do that as freedom from resenting Mr salvage here who can talk about how he was treated as a result of patriotic pose\nAnd all the rest and I think that he should be heard a and everyone else on and that's what I think uh any parting words from user\nYeah the your guest was done wrong no doubt no alright thank you Sean thank you so\nAre we have to just break we've got one more segment with Mr servicing will ask you about something he brought up a that I'm caravan of people who are headed toward our southern
