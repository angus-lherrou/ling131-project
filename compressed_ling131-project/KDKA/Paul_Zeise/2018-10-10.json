you'd think you'd think the mayor is less of the Christian for supporting this petition\nWell he don't like what are the Christian beliefs because that's what they're falling hair a Christian belief in but do do a lot of ... it was the reason\nBut wait a minute wait a minute my Christian beliefs and I've been told my whole life I'm a Christian and I went to the meetings my Christian believe is gay or straight don't matter one bed because we're all sinners regardless of our sexual orientation so it never met a hill of beans ...\nOkay but but do do that as a white chick fillet\nBe a sports are big cause of the Christian based uh beliefs and little business right that's the only reason\nI don't think that's very logical if I'm the mayor and I had somebody willing to pony up money for us in a band\nThat's what you're saying but I I I just\nHad a problem now wait a minute if he had a problem with that he'd had a problem with it before when this expanded sponsorship got started rather

you are well how how does a park in Israel affect your life\nWell I'll just say that's how much they love Trump and Israel and they have a park after I'm\nActually a park is pretty much the cheapest real estate you can build and tribute to somebody monkey bars are way less expensive than buildings\nGot why Israel but we don't have one in America that's what the difference here ah\nSo the Israelis in by building a park or more patriotic towards America than Americans because we haven't built a park\nOr they just walked Donald Trump or they there's real loves fall Trump that's all you know\nOkay they put it this way it is why I'm a I Love Trump there next to ask a person whether they like or love Trump mhm approach to usually apply after Trump's support or they don't say they like they say I Love Trump they all say the same thing if you don't like Trump to a trial\nBut what we what we eat a lot of Trump is Trump treats America like he treats his own family he watched the best for both of us is doing everything he chairs\nSo I'm going to get the years so I'm going to get the UN gig instead of his daughter\nWe should get out of the way we shouldn't even be apart we shouldn't factor we

issues when it comes to economy them and they've been losing people in droves and even though there are some similarities when it comes to the steel industry to Pittsburgh Pittsburgh made the adjustment with education\nAnd high tech and medicine\nAnd they capitalized on what they had really gone the medicine and the education and Youngstown just doesn't have that available to them and in Pittsburgh was able to a benefit more from the Marcellus Shale a little bit in Youngstown but not to the level that this region has been able to [noise]\nBut at the same time you have to be careful

that this wouldn't happen\nWell the president is involved in laws have their politics doesn't even close to being true or the government spending has been going up and up\nOr rather remarkably under President Trump because there have been no cuts to domestic programs when it comes to spending he wants to spend more on a defense and is so the government is spending more and more and more\nWith that he also spurred on the economy by having tax cuts come into play\nThat has also played a role not only in the economy but also in what's happening on Wall street too\nSo with that and you have deficits\nThat are rising back to the level of where they were in the peak of the recession\n\nAnd eventually you get to where the deficits are going to matter\nSo although the president because he's president when the numbers are what they are the president's get credit for those numbers but there needs to be an honest assessment looking a little bit further than that and saying how are we getting these numbers and are we truly behaving fiscally responsibly\nAnd I would argue that we are not\nYou're not being physically responsible as you're expanding your deficit spending and you continue to live beyond your means and if the federal government was a household\nWhat the federal government has decided to do is bring\nIn less money work less and spend more by borrowing more money

back in power they're all about deficit spending\nAs much as anybody else's now they preferred through tax cuts in defense spending where Democrats are more interested in social programs and infrastructure but deficit spending deficit spending isn't it and\nFiscal irresponsibility is fiscal irresponsibility\nIsn't it and if you want to have\nDon't you have to have the willingness to then

of residential lending a down a bank Mike good to have you thank you it's good to be here interesting story that was out this past week or a survey that was done that showed that Pittsburgh ranks number one in the country\nFor the ratio of student loan debt to mortgage debt\nAnd the issue of the number of people who have more in student loan debt than they have\nA mortgage debt and what's really curious about that is two things one there are a lot of people who have quite a bit of debt for it you know overall Pittsburgh ranks and the top twenty five in the country\nBut at the same time uh Pittsburgh also ranks as one of the most affordable ... places to live\nAs compared to countless other cities or around the country so um we're talking about both of those issues one getting a mortgage for affordable housing now and why it's so attracted to so many people and then to the idea of refinancing some of that student loan debt\nSo that people can get it back down to affordable interest rates and get it down to one particular payments and save a lot of grief aggravation and hopefully\nTreasuries to keep the price high in the field slow\nThey have the paper that off over the last two or three years and now we're at the point now where they're virtually buying no treasury so now the treasury market has reacted more significantly by selling off raising that yield\nWhich did spill them into the\nStock market and as we're seeing right now\nSo I'm In and whether there is a core inflation issue but if you have a very strong economy there has to be inflation in there I think they're just hedging against it right now now our mortgage rates and it was announced widely this week Fannie Mae the mortgage Bankers Association we're seeing interest rates have gone over five percent\nFor the thirty year fixed rate mortgage and worked for point seven five percent so we haven't hit that threshold so and then as we typically do we we wait and see what happens with the market before we move intra day like some lenders do around the country or that there'll be moving in mortgage rates during the day as the market moves with it\nUm but we we like to keep a more stable environment that's better for us and better for our customers so we're still four point seven five percent\nWill probably have her here unless there's some strong movement and the ten year treasury\nAnd the near term but certainly still a very good interest rate we got complacent with interest rates in the threes for a long time they've been into the mid forces here now they're starting to go the other way which is something that everybody anticipated mhm um and it's still you know when you look historically we're still at a point where interest rates are\nAre very inexpensive and more relevant and once the market takes over versus the fed propping it up with buying treasuries and mortgage backed securities then you'll see interest rates where they're supposed to be\nWell let me ask you this just at a point of curiosity ... with us said no longer buying as aided in the past and you just mentioned it's virtually that during much of anything at this point is there to talk about them selling yes what they purchased\nYeah that would be the next phase if they once they start to sell at you you could see more volatility and the bond market that doesn't mean the bond markets gonna shoot up to some high number like four or five percent of the ten year treasury\nAnd more keep my mortgage rates aren't tied to the directly tied to the ten year treasury but that has been the benchmark for the last as long as I've been in this business\nSince the late eighties that has been the benchmark for\nMonitoring the direction of mortgage rates has to look at the ten year treasury it's really based on mortgage backed securities and the secondary market where the pricing ultimately comes from mhm uh but that you know that it doesn't mean that will happen it just means we'll see begin to see more volatility as they unload their portfolio overtime and\nThat that really hasn't taken hold yet either so we could see\nYou know a couple of years here of rising interest rates\nWith a thirty are fixed it a four point seven five what are we looking at four Fifteen Fifteen\nFifteen Fifteen or four percent okay in this the first time I think we said that\nIn a long time four percent on a Fifteen year absolutely it's about one or three aids off it's all time low which is doing five eight so it's a four percent right now and and the curves very tight so short term rates catching up to the longer term rates and so it's almost flattening a little bit um\nWhat are we looking at if we were to do or say Fifteen year home equity loan\nFifteen your home equity loan you're probably in the high force I mean when I probably a year and a four point six four point nine range mhm um and that's going to depend on how much you're borrowing and the loan to value so that it varies some\nUh but it it's you know it's all relative and we've seen course or things like home equity lines of credits the tide prime those has gone up as prime went up\nUm in September so we're at five and a quarter percent of the prime right now\nNo of and once again choosing between a Fifteen year fixed rate and a Fifteen year I'm home equity loan\nThough a lot of it depends on how much are borrowing and whether or not it makes sense to go one way or the other based upon closing costs that there are with a conventional mortgage that you really don't have at that level with a home equity loan\nRight exactly it really comes down to exactly that closing costs than when you look at uh the closing costs on your standard mortgage um many of those costs or fix not all of them are a percentage of your loan amounts some are but the majority of them actually aren't\nSo if you took that number and looked at a fifty thousand dollar loan as a percentage of that loan it may be more cost effective to do a higher interest rate on a home equity loan\nAnd not pay the closing costs are have very little closing costs because when you look at the we look at the ... how long does it take to repay so if you had an interest rate of\nBorn three or four percent and versus the interest rate a four point seven or four point eight percent how long would it take\nTo recoup those closing cost if you're paying for first four point seven\nAnd it can be a long time on that loan amount because that the closing costs you're paying let's say there are two thousand dollars is much higher percentage on a fifty thousand dollar loan of your overall financing costs than it is on a four hundred thousand dollars on a so you're going from you know four percent up to half a percent in in cost\nSo on the higher loan amounts that can still make more sense to pay the costs and you can finance those costs into your lungs is not a check your right out of pocket you can if you want but you're not required to\nYou can finance those into the loan and so we look at the economics of it how long they're going to take you to recoup that costs which has long term we pay the least amount of interest with total cost\nOn higher loan amounts that makes sense to look at a mortgage on lower loan amounts typically below Seventy five you're looking at really doing a home equity loan first linked position if you're looking for a Fifteen year term or less\nI mean now as individuals are trying to weigh all of this out it can be a bit confusing and a bit of a struggle to do that on your own ... said this is a good time to call dollar bank and talk to someone and have it all explained and make sure that you're really comparing the things that you ought to be to see what's\nFor you yeah exactly and we will help you through that we can we can help you with you know said looking at the payments how much it costs exactly are going to be for you and figure out what is the best option for you in our loan officers consistently do that um if you're looking to refinance and and we're actually seeing about thirty percent of the applications coming in today are still refinancing\nA mess with your typical mortgage maybe twenty or thirty year mortgage\nI'm we're still seeing refinancing of first mortgages on the home equity side as well so it's still something that's occurring it's still very good interest rates compared to what you might be paying now\nAnd now and that's where you start what what is your interest right now is it worth the refinancing down to this interest rate\nI mean if your interest rate on a thirty year fixed rate mortgages five percent it's not worth refinancing to four point seven five it's at six percent six and a quarter ... very much worth it and I end the phone number to call this eight hundred three four four five six to ...\nThe information you need as well available at the website dollar dot bank if you have any questions You're welcome to call an eight six six three nine one at ten twenty eight six six three nine one ten twenty\nAnd when it comes to refinancing people refinance for a whole lot more\nThan just what the interest rate happens to be sometimes you refinance because well you just have to mhm right there are a family experience or divorces that take place other life occurrences it's quite possible that the amount of debt that you otherwise wouldn't it collectively put together into one payment\nIn that total amount of what your refinancing of credit cards and cars or whatever\nCould be substantially more than what you have left on your home on your home loan so it makes sense to the written refinance all of it under one lone once again\nYeah absolutely a consolidation type of loan is very common um and and you need to look at that and I have had cases where a customer had no mortgage on the property but had over eighty thousand dollars another debt now so we restructured in into his morgue and save tremendous amount of interest ... lower the payments dramatically\nAnd was able to then you know use that as tax deduction which still does exist you still get tax deduction for interest on a mortgage\nI'm so those kind of benefits far outweigh the thought while my house is free and clear that that was the financial accomplishment and it certainly is but not at the expense of having additional debt somewhere else at a at a higher interest rate or or very high payments on the short term that that you can't afford that doesn't\nThat doesn't accomplish anything ah so by by using your home equity to refinance weather's which a mortgage or a home equity loan out to consolidate that is probably one of the number one things we still see today\nUm especially if if it's some credit card balances that may be Thirteen Fifteen twenty twenty nine percent\nNow you see all of that I'm Still existing today\nAnd maybe you you're the equity wasn't in your home we've seen home values rise over the last two to three years maybe more equity in your home now that you weren't able to do some of that maybe three years ago and now you have the opportunity and the interest rate today is still very good for for that situation\nI'm Mike Henry is with us more coming up and just a moment\nRemember thinking mom had ice in the back of her head like or a superpower was spot in trouble before it happened well now it's time to protect our home and family and spotting troubles way tougher\nThat's my parents' trust blink blinked video cameras are motion activated so placing them around your home it's like having ice everywhere\nBlink cameras or wire free set up and minutes and run onto dubberly batteries last up to two years Bree in technology\nPut a blink camera on your

smartphone app so you'll know when your kids get home from school\nStill has rights to that property and those cannot be in the bank can't be subordinate to those rights\nSo um there are situations where if you're not divorced yet you're still participating at some level by signing some documents to release your rights and then released the deed so if you're still married and you transfer the deed than there's there there's no taxes associated with that either if you're divorced there could actually be tax associated with\nUm the deep transfer as well if you're you're dating and into one name but it is something that that you can do um we see it often\nAnd um it it's a it's considered a refinance of your existing mortgage into one person's name and the question I'm asked most often is can't I just take my husband or my wife off of the mortgage got were getting divorced so I just want them off the mortgage and you can't you both signed for that loan\nUm and so you're both obligated to repay that long we can't remove a bar where the only thing we can really do is refinance into one name would go with today's current interest\nRight yes theoretically if you could just remove one name well why couldn't you just theoretically removed but I guess that's true\nYeah yeah absolutely yeah so that that helps with the logic there yes\nSo you have to go through the process and fortunately dollar bank you guys\nUm have experience with this know how to go through all the paper God 'cause I Know what I went through a in order to get a refinance on at my house uh back in New castle when I was going through my divorce and other complications because there was a state of involved in everything\nAnd I thought I brought to the table something that nobody could possibly take care of and you did and they didn't use the well to me that you were able to do that so I encourage anybody who's listening right now if you think you drift situation is one where\nAre you don't think you can get to help you need a dollar bank is remarkable in their efforts and I learned that at first I thought I got that kind of treatment because well I mean do you know [laughter]\nAnd then I
