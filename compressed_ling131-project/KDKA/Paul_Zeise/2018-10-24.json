talking a little bit about this I watch the Morning Joe program on MSNBC Scarborough Joe Scarborough is a conservative Republican I'm Sorry he was a conservative Republican he's one of the few Republicans with a conscience who have left the Republican Party because of the ... ... foolery and now now lives of Donald Trump\nBut he was a conservative Republican and still are often looks at issues at least I Believe that\nAnd they're both intense a Trump critics but there were once kinda sorta at least semi friends with Trump and have since definitely depart company so they're very hard critic and I'm watching them hammer Trump this morning\nAnd even I and I hammer Trump all the time and even I'm getting tired sometimes at a hearing people amateur up because I feel like when I have no idea whether it does any good because it by this point most people either love him or hate him\nI think it's hard to change minds but then again there is that group of people so I'm told in the middle called independence and I don't know how they're making their decisions on who to vote for\nBut\nI continue to believe that fact matter yeah when I hear that says like on that Morning Joe

just\n... in ... in ...\nAnd we just don't even care whether it's true what does it matter here's the latest example of\nOne of literally thousands of out and out lies\nTold by the president of the United states remember what all politicians would lie but they did it sparingly\nAnd sometimes when they got caught in a lie they had to admit it and say I misspoke or new information has come to light\nRemember that\nThis guy just lies as much as he breeds\nSo\nHere here's an NPR fact check with conservative news outlets glued to the caravan of Central American migrants making their way north through Mexico toward the U.S border Trump suggested there's something more sinister than desperately poor families looking for a better life\nHe tweeted this\nSadly it looks like Mexico's police and military are unable to stop the caravan heading to the southern border of the United states criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in let me repeat that lied criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in\nHere's the thing about Trump's assertion that criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in\nHe has absolutely no idea whether it's true there is not a sin of evidence that it is true it is clearly a why he is telling in order to spreading fear and panic throughout the United states of America and try to bolster his base and save the midterms\nAre by the way he also treated I have alerted border patrol and military that this is a national emergency must change laws\nUm\nIs it okay with you that Donald Trump hasn't zero evidence of criminals and or middle Easterners being mixed into the five thousand people in the caravan heading allegedly the southern border\nDo you care that he lives do you care that he make stuff up does it matter to you that he is stoking fear with zero evidence of any reason\nTo be fearful have we gone past the point where the truth matters at all or are we just stuck in our little tribalism\nAnd we already made up our minds

or I don't know something that that would really surprised the conventional wisdom journal outside the norm yes\nYeah I think ... the times are so fascinating so interesting and to some degree there is I think ... more uncertainty then I Would normally fill in a midterm election so I agree with you I don't think it would be surprising in of all we had one really outside the box\nElection or the population of particular state or ... particular congressional district\nSurprises all the conventional way right right and also caters wouldn't surprise me at all\nOr how about Florida though um [noise]\nThe the African American mayor of Tallahassee who's running for governor has a few points a lead at least most of the polls I've seen but I don't know if that's helping him or it's just a coincidence or what Bill Nelson as you know the Democratic currently holds the U.S Senate seat it was being challenged by Republican governor Rick Scott\nOr even Bill Nelson was up a viewpoint to the poll I saw it he hasn't been pulling that well at least I don't think the last few weeks\nIs not really in the last few months and I think both those numbers were very encouraging and it seems to me from the data I'm looking at and from the articles that I'm studying very closely in Florida that they're really helping each other that there is a generic\nJen I friend is your boyfriend late blight

minority what might beyond joining us for political analysis [noise]\nSo I was getting frustrated all over again with Donald Trump not that that doesn't happen every twenty men were yeah it's hard to believe because we wanted to CBS News casts he was quoted as saying\nThat it was outrageous or some uh such reference to the killing of Mr because she'll be the a Saudi Arabian\nColumnist who was a un American resident a and a columnist for the Washington Post and as you well know was murdered by about Fifteen Soviet sub was one of them are reportedly at a bone saw\nUm [noise]\nAnd he said but he asked the crown prince and he asked the king and they strongly denied it and I'm just dumbfounded by this notion that as long as somebody forcefully denies it therefore they're denials are totally believable\nWas not just somebody of course not Dr Ford who testified in front of the United States Senate committee or that person he did not find credible that per\nSe right even though I strongly asserted yeah even though she strongly\nAsserted even though she made her case in public in front of the\nEntire American public he didn't believe that case but he believes Mr potent when he says I don't know anything about it I have nothing to do with that he believes the crown prince of Saudi Arabia when he denies that he had anything to do with it\nAnd he believes the Korean dictator who says I'm getting rid of the nuclear weapons so it depends on who you're talking to whether he believes that or not and there's a very clear pattern here of course\nI just every time I hear him say that I then they strongly denied it they strongly denied it like we're all supposed to go oh well if they strongly denied it [noise]\nUm and of course who would admit why would put in the mid to him that he interfere to the twenty sixteen elections why would the king and the crown prince admit to him that they order the murder of ... if they did it\nThe obviously they would just strongly tonight\nYeah random never caught red handed I mean even then they probably would even then they would continue to uh and and no one understands that more clearly and better than Donald Trump himself when you're even when you're caught red handed you continue\nStrongly denied but most disappointing as his willingness to simply repeat those denials as if they're fact to the rest of the American people\nMost disappointing as his willingness to simply repeat those denials as if they're fact to the rest of the American people when\nEven at best ... worse depending on how you look at it there's a large percentage of the American public that doesn't buy one moment of this nonsense that Saudi Arabia is selling about the murder of a journalist and so for the president to actually act as their P. R. agent\nIs morally indefensible are outrageous on every level and in my view not good for the long term interest of the United states even the short term international interests of the United states is not just Saudi Arabia the rest of the world is watching what are the standards here\nThat you're willing to present to the world\nAnd if the standard as as long as the crown prince says I have nothing to do with it Mr President you're going to go out and repeat that to the rest of the world that's not the standard in the country that I Believe we aspire to and should be on a daily basis\nAnd as long as ... as he strongly denies interfering in the ... elections and Kim Jong un and says to nuclear programs completely shut down\nYeah but Dr Blasey Ford who ... again testifies in front of the United States Senate committee in front of the\nAmerican public in front of the world that person who makes an assertion he can't believe that integrates ridicules makes fun of\nOr let's go to the phones here is bill in Pleasant Hill is on the subject of Saudi Arabia Hi Bill [noise]\nHow're you doing good\nAnd what's the big deal about the Saudi guy I mean he wants to assist\nHe was a journalist and when you start killing journalists that's definitely a dangerous precedent it could lead to many other journalists and secretive truth being killed\nFor citizen ... killed here eight states every day\nI don't know [laughter] okay\nWhatever you're smoking or send me a case well I just\nI could've left them on there and really killed him some more but it just seemed like fishing a barrel I dare say journalists were killed and yes the usa everyday ... which means of course that he's\nAn idiot [laughter] I by the way for point of clarification for those other radio land journalists are not killed in the United states every day I think that's a fact that it's worth making here on ... why do only American citizens count why is it that the lives of every other human being on the planet are irrelevant\nBut if he's American citizen well then that matters a video and I was just going to\nMake that point ah he um yes was a human being doesn't that count for something\nRight in one of our alleged allies Saudi Arabia is now killing human beings only because they criticized that person criticized the Saudi Government that's the issue and that's the standard\nAnd by the way a for what this is worth\nAnd this is not a um [noise] the compelling point as we're just arguing but he has two children who are American citizens rather example two adult children who are American citizens he was a reporter he was also a resident\nLegal resident of the United states no it's not a citizen a reporter for a national publication who criticizes government who was then a exterminated eliminated assassinated and murdered by his own government\nThat has to mean something to the American people it should mean more than it has to the president and I have to tell you as as I've listened to and watched a variety of administration officials if I hear\nOne more of them say this is a terrible situation this is awful were into this whole thing\nOf them say this is a terrible situation this is awful were into this whole issue is horrible or some\nRice on the ballot at yeah statement like that this is a terrible such a it's a terrible situation that's the best we can do\nYeah Trump said it was a fiasco is if all along with knowledge that we can just move forward\nWhere it's a terrible situation I mean no\nIt's an act of violence by a government and there should be a price to pay for that you look\nAs we said before on your show John ah the Republicans like to set up a strong man the strong man as well we have to be able to talk to this government Saudi Arabia because there's such an important player in the middle east\nAnd and at the far end of the spectrum and therefore we should do nothing no there's a whole lot of things in between there yes this is a government that we must deal with and the reality of politics international relations is that this is a government we must deal with\nWe can chew gum and walk at the same time we can make a case against Saudi Arabia that this is not a standards that we will accept\nYou were going to pay a price for that even though we continue to deal with you we continue to have diplomatic relations we continue to have issues that we do agree on at work on but it in the meantime this is an embarrassment to us because you are supposed to be our ally in that region\nWe're not going to stand for it and you're going to pay some significant economic diplomatic price for murdering a journalist in that Turkish embassy\nBut notice how what I Am sure whether Trump follower that last caller picked up on what Trump said early on he kept saying that was not a citizen well he's not a citizen I couldn't even figure out why he was bringing it up\n[noise] um but these people pick up on his talking points and they they buy it he is he's leading like a new generation of people who have no morals whatsoever\nNo question about it and I understand they and understandably there as a segment of American people that take their lead from the president United States or the our history has been full of that\nBut this is a president that's certainly in my view has been leading them in the wrong direction that he leaves with hate that he leaves with division that he leads with divisiveness\nThat he shows them that that's the path we should take and he says that who he implies who cares and then writes he's not a citizen\nCarrying West Virginia's on the line and we'll get to his call for being on the other side news radio ten twenty ...

to that bait and spit it out\nOr he took the fight to them I think in a very important and significant ways and I think it makes it that good historical point I also agree with his\nPremise that this is a street brawl this is a street political role\nAnd and I mean it metaphorically of course without any violence whatsoever but metaphorically this is a street fight and Democrats need to understand

like every single outlet is saying one monolithic thing not even close [noise] and it gives you another question was how would you know the economy is doing\nYou have a former FBI Director uh Eric Holder a congresswoman Maxine Waters a and a a George Soros the Democratic donor among others are so these devices were discovered a beginning\nA earlier this week yesterday and then today uh many of them um [noise] uh being discovered the one that was intended for the Clinton house was actually intercepted by the secret service before was delivered to the house and then of course the big news is the one that was intended for former CIA director John Brennan\nInexplicably sent to CNN headquarters she doesn't even work for them not even as a consultant\nBut nonetheless it was enough to force so that network to abandon ship for awhile and broadcast from the street\nThey just didn't know whether or not it was intended for them or if it was intended for him they\nSpecifically address to John Brennan ... air of CNN\nAt their Columbus Circle address up there which\nIs the one if you Google them that's that's the address that comes up at Brennan has never worked for CNN in fact he's a contributor to NBC of all places\nIn the rain and so at this point I I ... the analysts that are ... who do consulting regarding this is there a belief\nThat um these packages were triggered to be able to explode and is there any indication as to why none of them apparently didn't\nKnow there's been no full explanation a yet as to why those devices did not explode a they did do according to our sources contained unnecessary ingredients to explode or whether they were put together correctly or not that's another thing to be determined\nUm but in any case the FBI treated them very very seriously\nAnd all of those devices now been removed the FBI labs for further investigation to see if they can determine\nYou know why they didn't go off number one number two is there any evidence we can lift off those things to determine who might have sent these things um and ah you know moving beyond that but ah now we're very very fortunate that nobody was injured or or and or or killed in any of these incidents\nAnd very clear statements in opposition to these uh packages or by the president by the vice president by the speaker of the house Senate majority leader and many others to\nThat is true and the president was very forceful in saying that look we need to come together as a nation we need to unify to say that acts of political violence just cannot be tolerated to which\nA number of his skeptics have been saying during the afternoon while we hear you Mr President we understand those words but forgive us if we\nHave a little bit of skepticism given some of your rhetoric against some of these very same people who receive these devices hum you know so uh uh on on one hand they say they appreciate the president for what he had to say and it was the appropriate thing to say and it was the correct thing to say but uh you know actions\nAnd words sometimes don't match up and I think that's what some of his skeptics are saying this evening is that uh you know let's see a little bit more than the words let's see some actions from here on out he's going to hold a campaign rally coming up here very shortly in Wisconsin within about another forty five minutes\nWe'll see if that rhetoric changes at all\nOr one more thing if I could before I let you go is there any concern for other members of Congress others maybe even at the White House regarding\nBefore I let you go is there any concern for other members of Congress others maybe even at the White House regarding packages being shipped at this point\n[noise] well we don't have any way of knowing at this point and the governor Andrew Cuomo said look he says I won't be surprised if other devices war to turn up and the natural course of thing so I think there's going to be a very heightened sense of security you'll see that already around the capital you see that\nA around certain government officials right now and I think they're going to be looking at all kinds of packages and mail coming in and just to make sure that we don't have a repeat but at this point\nNobody's ruled out that these were the last of the devices today\nNow I Do recall joining us from CBS News in Washington bill thank you very much for your time banks ventured out alright\nThere's also a lot of political hey that is attempting to be made by those who are not\nThe party leaders themselves not that people who are holding

I think more than interest rates certainly\nIf people are looking for home when rates for foreign threes versus four point seven five I don't think that's a major deterrent I mean certainly some level it is um but but overall the ultimately prices will adjust based on that\nOne option you know hire a contractor find a property lot and build on it I mean that's still very relevant today even some of these numbers are coming looking lower I still think that's a very good market for the next foreseeable future is straight\nStick built home that we call it where you're starting from the ground and taking the loan and and using functioning their mortgage to finance that\nUm are certainly if you're looking at a property that like we talked about the maybe\nI'm almost not habitable or or need significant upgrades\nUm we offer mortgage financing for that as well wherever we call that a renovation loan mhm where you can combine it with a purchase\nAnd borrow the additional funds that you would need in order to do the rehab even if it's something that you can't move into\nSo if you're looking at a property maybe that's a very low cost and is vacant and you know nothing's operating in it needs totally get it but the frame is basically good we can offer a mortgage where we can you you get a contractor he\nGives us the uh um he gives us the\nBids for all the work that needs to be done and we give that to the appraiser along with the sales agreement and say what is this house worth with all of this completed\nAll the work done and they give us a value on as we were alone up to Ninety five percent of that value so you have an acquisition price which is the purchase price and we used alone to the clothes on the property and pay the cellar and then we ask grow the additional funds needed for the\nUm for the rehab or the implication of concern\nWhat let me ask you this let's say you buy this piece of property for ten thousand dollars and you want to put one Ninety into it 'cause I didn't get the one Ninety into it financed and my ten thousand that I used to buy a lot in the first place or the existing house would that then count\nYeah as long as the after improved value so after all the improvements are made is two hundred thousand and then you would have a total acquisition cost of two hundred and ten thousand being for the purchase of the home a hundred and Ninety thousand so yes you could use ten thousand as your downpayment that'd be Ninety five percent of two hundred thousand okay the Ninety a hundred and Ninety thousand but would be used for the improvement\nWould you have to do it as all one purchase in order to properly qualify for a mortgage could I go in and actually and say you know what I'm interested in getting that property I Want to buy it I'm going to hold it and then then afterwards\nCome to you and say okay here I'm ready to move on this now I'm ready to go ahead and begin to build process could either and still get that loan in order to improve it and still qualify the same way\nYes you you could do it either way now I'm ... you might want to know you qualify before you've acquired the property for sure you could pay cash for their property and income in and say here's my contract here's what I wanted to do as far as ... as far as improvements we require that there is\nOne contractor mhm not multiple you can't beat her own contractor so we want somebody who's experience either home builder or home improvement builder\nThat we know is going to oversee the project can make sure that work gets done in a timely fashion and get completed as per the specifications that you were given so it meets the plans and\nSo if it was a large projects like that we may divided into four or five different draw us and so we'll send the inspector out so let's say the first one is gonna get\nLike that we may divided into four or five different draws and so we'll send the inspector out so let's say the first one is gonna\nYou know get all the interior framing done and dry wall um we'll ... we'll send an inspector out to say that is complete this completed per plans and specifications and where he released the money to the contractor and at different phases go we keep doing that but we send out an inspector to make sure that it is being completed\nUm and so that protects you ... and also protects the bank you know that it's not being done correctly and is this something uh\nUh they're not shorting something that should have should have happened otherwise\nNo that's a great idea because one of the frustrations that I hear consistently as people who decide to go with the home remodeling route is it they'll get somebody\nTo pay them and then the work takes forever to get done\nAnd it sounds as though the system that you have in place with these draws that are available upon inspection that you're making sure that everything is done in a very timely manner and there is that continual incentive for the contractor I finish all of the work in order to get paid\nRight exactly and that's exactly what we do on a construction on if you're building from ground up\nUm ... we have an builders are custom to it it's a six or seven draw cycle including an amount that we hold back at the very end to make sure all of the worst complete before I make the final payment okay so we have a good system and people are very knowledgeable and understand the process\nAnd builders we work with um some we do several hundred homes a year that they know exactly what how the process works and how to manage the contract during the the building process\nSince we're using this property and the scenario of two hundred thousand dollars in borrowing one hundred Ninety\nAs we're going through the build face interest when do you start paying interest on that one Ninety and as a kick in in a graduated level as the draws her then paid\nBut it it really depends we have two different versions one is that you start making normal mortgage payments immediately and the money's citizen in escrow for larger projects we can look at\n'em doing it like a construction law where you pay interest on the loan as the amount has drawn so if you have a two hundred thousand dollar loan and your first straws fifty thousand dollars really just pay interest only on that fifty thousand during the construction period then there's a second draws say another fifty thousand now you have a hundred thousand dollars\nAnd you're paying interest only on that as well so it is the payments increase as you're building\nIn interest only payments and then once it's completed you start your regular full mortgage payments but it is considered one loan and one closing so if it was a I just like a construction zone okay if it's like a six month period of building let's say you'll actually have three hundred and fifty for\nA month left on the full mortgage payment as opposed to three sixty if you're doing a thirty year that's three hundred and sixty months okay we start the first six months of constructions and you have payments for three hundred fifty four months\nI hung out with this I'm writing now this scenario the individuals renting they want to own a as they're renting they have to continue whether things being completed right\nNow they can afford everything easily\nWhy they're no longer renting but if they're going through this bridge face for six months whether renting and they're dealing with this mortgage issue for the construction [noise] well what are the qualifications what is the approval process in order to ensure that they can get the property and at the same time be able to keep on renting where they are now\nYeah it's kind of interesting because if you're renting we don't really include that us from your debt to income ratio um and if you're building a new house okay if you own a house and have a mortgage we do because that ... the only way to eliminate that mortgages\nThat is from your debt to income ratio um and if you're building a new house okay if you own a house and have a mortgage we do because that ... the only way to eliminate that mortgage just to sell the property so we do qualify you with both mortgage payments the old and the new if you have an existing mortgage\nOr what we look at is what will the debt ratios be what are they before and what are they after so there's this compensating factors that you're going to be selling the house and and built in the moving into the mind you're building so we have more flexibility on the debt to income ratio is there is a limit their that's possible you wouldn't qualify we\nCan't go super high but we go higher than we normally would knowing what the processes that you're\nGoing to sell that house and move into the new house\nSo we'll we'll have more flexibility on the debt income and we look and see what it's like okay after year after your house is sold and you're in it\nAll right I'm Mike Henry is with us he is

of\nI I Would say you know in our market it's between one fifty and three hundred thousand maybe a little closer to fifty that seems to be the uh when they won those sounds go for sale they they're sold quickly if if they're in good condition and their price correctly they saw very quickly as you get hired starts to slow down\nOkay well under that one fifty mark that's a perfect range for

a little bit more how did you buy a house and only one person has their name on shore well only one person on a mortgage on the you can both but you can buy a house together and do people\nAre and only one person beyond the mortgage the person who is not on the mortgage can be take ownership of the property but they also signed the mortgage which is the instruments securing the the loan they don't sign the note which is the agreement to repay\nThey do signed the mortgage which their subordinate in their interest to the property to the bank so if for example if that\nIf there were two people on a property together and only one of them is on the mortgage\nThat loan went into default the person not on the who's not the borrower can I say well you can't foreclosed 'cause I own this house\nUm you can't foreclosed on me I wasn't obligated to pay the debt so they have to sign the mortgage which subordinates their rights to the banks of the bank but could for close if it ever came to that now so you can um purchase two people can purchase a home and only one of them being on alone and there are there are some\nLogical scenarios for that especially if it comes to credit or interest rates are you know if you have one bar with it\nOne of them being on a loan and there there are some\nLogical scenarios for that especially if it comes to creditor interest rates are\nYou know if you have one borrow that has the better credit score and enough income to qualify you might be have a better interest rate the typically both people are on the mortgage because they both want to build that credit and have a mortgage on their credit poor profile but there are certain certainly scenarios where it makes sense for them not\nHow can you ask someone to a mortgage at a later date or do you have to refinance did make\nThat you have to refinance to make that happen um and so it would just be a new alone you can't just simply add somebody to the to the point\nWhere they lead qualify you you just mentioned a couple of upsides to the idea of doing this are there any concerns\nUm well if you're the non borrow him and the other bar or doesn't pay for the bar where it doesn't pay\n'em then you run the risk of losing your home and you never obligated to pay a mortgage no you you know that going in that because you're going to sign documents you know releasing your rights to that property in the event of a foreclosure so you're you don't have first lean over the mortgage lender\nOkay you know a possible okay if a person a is the one who obligated themselves to pay back the mortgage person be a is an owner position however their subordinate to the bank right\nCould person be make the payment at first in a decided to stop\nIf somebody was making the payment nothing will happen as long as the payments and being made on the mortgage nothing you you won't go to a foreclosure situation\nUm so it doesn't really matter who makes the payment mhm it could it could be somebody not living in the property if my kids were to buy a house and I wanted to make their mortgage payments or I could do that and I know ownership interest in the house\nOkay I'm Sorry I was using a scenario where you have a couple and the one decided that I Want to al ... and I'm gone and the person who's left doesn't have\nThe obligation to pay the mortgage but they're the one who's there living the person who actually has the legal obligation to pay back the mortgage is living on the other side of the country right the ... who's living in it can stay there keep on making the payments if they can afford to do so and not have to worry about refinancing it back into their own name\nIn theory no um 'cause if you're an owner of the property and you're paying that mortgage no you're not getting any credit for it if you tried to apply for new mortgage within its viewed differently um so there's there's some pitfalls to that especially in that scenario that is a common scenario where they'll be one person on the mortgage but to people on the property or wants to simply living in the property\nThe other one decides to leave and potentially stop making payments you do see that maybe we've we've talked about foreclosure here that\n... number one reason we see for foreclosure is to force a somebody doesn't want to make the payment for whatever reason so it it there there's that would be something where it ... you could stay in the house as long as you were still making the mortgage payment um\nIf they need to consult an attorney about their interest I mean if you have somebody who decides to leave and no longer be a part of this anymore but their name is still on\nThe property they are still lifted owner and you decided you're going to end up paying in order to be able to stay they could come back and claim ownership rights and next thing you know they get the value of the property in Sherry and what it is if you've been paying and all this time\nYeah yeah you're both you're both still on the property only once obligated to pay the mortgage if you're worried about equity you're staying in the house or somebody wants to hurt somebody then yeah at that point that's where you get to and and you know we can maybe get a lawyer and the only solution that really is to you really would be buying out that person\nPaying off that existing alone and you could use a new mortgage to do that\nOkay All right let's get back on that rabbit trails [laughter] and it was a fun one to\nA person paying off that existing loan and you could use a new mortgage to do that okay All right let's get back on that rabbit trails [laughter] it was a fun one to be very interesting and it's very real I mean that out Oh yes ... I'm sure there are people\nWho are listening right now and say Oh yes I live that situation\nYet we have cases right now we're ... the the more typical is where you have a couple of getting divorced and one is leaving one wants to stay the other one doesn't want to help make mortgage payments or are they want their equity other property so it's it's a very there there there's always a transaction then our pipeline were that that exact scenario\nOkay let's go back to the the first time homebuyers\nAnd their retina more program the dollar bank has to offer I tell you what because the clock says we have to pause here for a moment second we will do that and we'll come back and talk about\nFirst time homebuyer programs with the uh uh ... no more program a donor bank if you have a question You're welcome to call eight six six three and I won ten twenty you can text us on that same line and you can also send us an a dollar bank is an access that kitty K radio dot com\nRadio and\nKatie Hi this is less\nHey our sugar land join us as we report DEA national prescription drug take back though Saturday October twenty seven\nIf you don't get rid of those on user expired prescription still clearing up your medicine cabinet they could end up misplaced stolen or simply misused\nProtect your family and the community and let ... prescription drugs out of the wrong hands keep them safe clean 'em out take them back find a collection site near you do a take back dot com\nRemember thinking mom had ice in the back of her head like or a superpower was spot in trouble before it happened well now it's on us to protect our home and family and spotting troubles way tougher\nThat's my parents' trust blink blink video cameras are motion activated so placing them around your home is like having ice everywhere\nBlink cameras or wire free set up and minutes and run on to double A. batteries last up to two years brand technology\nPut a blink camera on your front porch to spot package sleeves and wonder alert you if a stranger is looking around the yard\nAnd parents loved links live feed auction electric checking from anywhere using your blink smartphone app\nSo you'll know when your kids get home from school\nBlink camera systems are back in stock and right now the Fifteen Percent off that's right Fifteen Percent off all security cameras visit blink protected dot com slash radio for offer details that's blink protected dot com slash radio like as an Amazon company limited time offer terms and conditions applied\nIn this week's playing great deals at Walgreens like buy one get one\nFree on hundreds of vitamins and supplements the healthy stay healthy get ready for that big game with sixteen ounces blue diamond elements regularly nine Ninety nine now just five Ninety nine card living for a sweet deal select Hershey candy bars just two for one dollar with card get great deals on the essentials you need right here at your neighborhood ...\nTrusted since Ninety One not supplied land restrictions and he listens apply seats are for details\nCrushing candy today today you start playing vaccine today's first day of the rest of your life these crazy ... but it's been raining\nOf ...\nCrashing candy and indeed\nAt the apple app store Google played to download for free\nHey sugar land joined that we report on a national prescriptions I Hope that guy Saturday I ...\nIf you don't get rid of those and user expired prescription still clearing up your medicine cabinet they could end up misplaced stolen or simply misused\nProtect your family and the community and talked to prescription drugs out of the wrong hands keep them safe clean 'em out take them back to Iraq to fight near you ... ... ... dot com\nGoing into this dire by borders are designed yourself why they say six three and I bought it and then\nThat's why I'm six six three and I want ten buddy or you can email us ... dollar bank has access to getting a dot com flash back to the dollar mortgage our news radio ten funny ha\nI may as you know along with Mike Henry senior vice president of residential lending at dollar bank and before we get to the uh first time homebuyers I had this text that come through and I want to make sure we addressed is how much is the monthly payment\nOn a thirty year alone for a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home now what they don't mention is what they're putting down on it\nUh so I I Would you oftentimes have said that the typical down payment is at ten percent do you want to go with that number", "show_name": "Paul Zeise", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "24"}
