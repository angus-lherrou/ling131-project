manage money without question out a way\n[noise] this is emotional management I'm Dr Christian car the welcome to the show tonight we face addiction we face it head on addiction is a powerful topic\nAnd my guess is that there is not a list are out there who hasn't been impacted by addiction at least in some way\nAnd tonight we're going to deal with it so if you're struggling with addiction yourself if you have a loved one who's struggling with addiction and you'd like some insight around and how to speak with your loved ones because that's also really really challenging then give us a call the number is eight six six\nThree nine one ten twenty or you can email us from the dollar bank instant access at Katy K radio dot com or you can text us at eight six six three nine one ten twenty on the right automotive text line that's the best deal in Pittsburgh look addiction is gripping it's gripping\nI've set in the past and I've used is kind of as my tagline that there are two kinds of people in the world there are people who have issues and and dead people in other words we all have issues we all have issues but here's something equally as per found we have a tendency\nTo minimize other people's problems and maximize our own and look I mean this way if you were all in this together so in other words if\nYou stop your toe you know it's a big deal to you but somebody else like whatever you subject to do\nFacing things is inside of us it's inside of us we were not designed to just run from things we want to go through it\nUnfortunately there are times where we say I don't feel like going through it so I Want to rephrase that and say we are designed to have the ability to go through and face whatever we need to face it's not always easy\nBut often times the biggest part of the obstacles we face when we want to confront something like addiction\nThe often the biggest obstacle is what occurs in our minds so we build up barriers we build up walls\nWe build up obstacles in our mind we think I Can't say that because so and so will say this I Can't approach so and so because I don't want to offend so and so instead we don't face it and that's when things build thinking about how many problems in your life have build have been built upon\nAn unwillingness to simply face them\nI say the the young people all the time I I Would do a lot of work with a sports team so I Will tell that the athletes I say look if we have a problem and it's you know the size of of let's say let's say one rocket me give you a visual effects the size of one rock so this problem between two people is the size of one rock\nIf somebody pools and another person now it's the size of two rocks you pull in another person out three rocks so we build problems up rather than just facing it while it's the size of one rock if we can be quicker to confront what we need to confront\nWe can really make a difference\nBut again part of the challenge is\nHow we confront others and that's where we'll theory for me comes into play this is why teach people to lead with compassion because if my goal is to interact with people simply to tell them how I'm right and they're wrong then yes I'm going to elicit defensiveness\nBut if my goal is to genuinely communicate care and compassion and love\nThen there's a good chance I can do that by being straightforward with someone hey listen I've been noticing that you're you've been different recently\nI've noticed recently that you seem to be struggling my heart goes out to you I Want to be able to understand what's going on with you I Want to provide a safe space\nWant to provide a safe space for you oftentimes people don't reach out about any subject about anything whether they're struggling with depression addiction anxiety people do reach out for fear of how others might respond\nBy what if we could create\nA more compassionate universe a more compassionate environment you might say that's idealistic we can't do that no but you can I can I can change myself you can change yourself\nWe think so much I Need to we don't have to change the whole world we didn't have to change ourselves we have to work on ourselves so imagine if you could make yourself a safe enough space\nParents asked me this about that young children signed a lie to them why would they lie to me I don't know why they would live where they would lie because they don't want to get in trouble\nWhat if they if your goal is to teach children to be honest then you have to create the type of environment that allows them to feel safe enough to own up to what they did that doesn't mean don't punish them not in any way\nAbsolutely be consistent but do it in a way that leads with compassion that the goal was to teach says the goal was to share when we lead with humility things change so I've noticed something in my forty four years on the planet\nI'm sneaking in that I'm forty four years old to my birthdays and a couple of weeks so I'd rather just be on on on on air saying I'm forty four but\nSo yeah forty four years I've I've learned something and and I've learned that\nThe older I get life really isn't as complicated as we make it life is not as complicated as we make it people I I Do a lot of work in the prison system and ah I'm In the prisons in ... talking to people all the time about peace\nSo I asked and they made the other day I said I Want to I said I Want you to imitate me give me your best imitation of ... I'm good I can handle whatever you want to throw me I had no idea what she was at that me\nAnd she said oh I'm Dr county I Want you to have peace and I said hey I'll take it I'll take it if that's your imitation of me\nI Will take it I don't care if I have a goofy voice in your mind what I care about is that you see that what I'm really about is peace\nWe want to get good at the piano what do we do we practice playing the piano if we want to get good at peace we have to practice peace if we want to make ourselves a safe space for people to talk to to come to to feel safe to open up to then we need to work on ourselves\nIn wiping away our judgment and instead of thinking I Need to prove to the other person that I have the answers instead say\nI Want to prove to the other person that I'm here with you\nI'm here with you I might not have the answers but I'm here with you\nAnd I'm here with you tonight that's why if you want to call an eight six six three nine one ten twenty or you can email us on the dollar bank instant access at Katy K radio dot com or Texas or eight six six three nine one ten twenty on the right automotive text line so we're getting some\nEmails and some tax but well welcome to call in and talk about whatever is going on if you're struggling with addiction if you have a loved one\nWho's struggling with addiction give us a call\nThis subject of addiction is so powerful I heard something the other day that I Want to share with you and I really want this number to to just just to sink in for admitted more than a hundred and forty four Americans die as a result of an overdose\nEvery day that's the equivalent\nOf two sold out seven forty sevens crashing every week in America\nThat is beyond sad we know someone who's struggling with addiction\nAnd and here's the challenge that we come to this is a this is one of the part of the problem we associate saying well\nSaying well addiction is all this is just a party there just out to do drugs and just have fun and just just just let loose and that's what it's all about so who cares if they get hurt who cares if they're struggling because they're just trying to party\nFirst of all I Would like to start with\nWhen did it become inhuman to want to maximize pleasure and minimize pain I'm pretty sure that's the essence of human beings right we want to maximize pleasure and minimize pain somehow we convince ourselves when we maximize Pfizer and minimize pain it's okay but when others do in a different way it's not okay\nBut I Want to go talk about addiction not in terms of thinking this is all about oh I just want a party or I just want to fund that's not where addiction comes into play\nTo understand neurologically something happens here's what I Want to start with\nIn your own brain when you struggle with judgments and you get let's say you're irritated your ... your irritable your agitated and you say well\nIf I just came to you and I said well just dump irritable just do be agitated you'd be like well I Can't and now I'm getting more irritable and agitated with you\nIf I told you to just stop doing it you couldn't just stop it why not well because it's physiological\nSo maybe sometimes for instance let's say you're hungry if you're hungry listen this is kinda cool your hunger is located in a part of your brain called the hype both elements the high profile um is is centered in the middle of your emotional system in her brain so have you ever had that experience of anger because you're hungry and you're angry\nAnd what what's happening is you're literally steeped in the center of your emotional part of your brain\nSo when you're angry to somebody's just say to you hey just stop just not being angry right now is really difficult you can't just stop now when we come to look at addiction I Want you to also think about it in terms of hunger\nWhat happens in addiction is something called hijacking and we're going to talk about this coming up but the brain literally gets hijacked\nAnd imagine if your brain is hijacked by something we're not judging somebody for that\nLook if you want to be a part of the show eight six six three nine one ten twenty or you can email US dollar bank instant access a K decay radio dot com or text us an eight six six three nine one ten twenty on the right automotive textile addiction impacts so many people and I have no doubt that you know someone\nOr that you\nAre struggling with addiction yourself\nWhat I Want you to hear from me there is zero judgment on my part my part is not about a judgment my part is about helping you find\nSolutions that's what we want to do on the emotional management show is find solutions that's why we do it here on Katie K radio this is emotional management I'm Dr Christian

security cameras visit blink protected dot coms\nMaybe she got a smaller part here and there and every time one of the things my wife and I would say to her was if you have one line if you have one word then make sure you put everything into that one word to that one line\nAnd if we think about on the stage of life\nIf you get a chance they're seven billion people in the world we're not going to see all of them but whatever people you do get to talk to whatever people you are in front of if you can put your best into that it changes something now you might not be able to make people do this or that\nAnd that's a helpless feeling at times until we surrender to the idea that we're not going to make people do anything but what we can do is surround people with love we can surround people with love\nAnd that that's an important that's an important thing to know\nSo I Want you to understand to what happens with\nYour brain if you're getting burned out from seeing people who are struggling and you don't know like why why why is this happening you're getting frustrated getting agitated\nWell something called empathic distress empathic distressed when we have empathy distress\nWhat happens in our brain is we literally are feeling for the other\nThe other person and we're taking it on so much that we're experiencing the pain that they are they're they're they're experiencing and now that happens that can burn I saw that can make it feel agitated irritable and then all of a sudden we become judgmental we become defensive and it's because we have something going on neurologically as well\nI Want to talk more about this we're going to go to the phone lines where to go to Josh Josh you're on ... radio emotional management\nYes I've been dealing with the addiction is a two dollars a third I've been\nAn ID I'm I've been forced to try to self medicate and try to wean myself off it's tough just curious to um to get a recommendation even trying to find a proper doctor even help you get off\nNo absolutely first of all I appreciate your call I think this is something that is um I really appreciate your call because it takes courage to be able to step up and say yeah I have been struggling with this for some time and I haven't wanted to reach out so that takes guts and I'm just the you know I'm definitely odd by that I\nAppreciate your calling in and look there are the first of all I Want to give I definitely want to give this number to you for addiction policy forum they have the addiction resource center and we'll make sure we have to step up on Katie K uh\nAs well but I really want you to take this down it's one\nEight three three three oh one help which is one eight three three three oh one help or for three five seven ...\nThey're there to be able to help provide those resources this is a national organization so they're not like with one is not like one particular company they're there to help you find resources in\nYour area so wherever you are they they'll be able to find whatever it is the best possible help for you there but here was go ahead go ahead Josh\nToday show I guess the first time it was the ... right away it's like you're hitting everything right on the uh like uh going through this stuff my main concern is at all we're finding out I don't want this held against me going forward [noise]\nUm I got off the opioid but I think the agents that\nYeah you know it's what ... what happens is we we when we it is literally changing and I think this is important for you to know it's literally changing the neuro chemicals in your brain so we get to a point where we go I\nIt's you're not wrong or bad like if anybody out there and he has any chance of a judgment for it then you have to understand that that judgment come from a place of their own neurons firing a certain way so yes it is tough to get off of but here's the great news and this is something that I really want to jump on is\nIt is possible to get off and it is also possible to rebuild those neural networks with out that so that's something I Need you to know it is possible because I think sometimes we go into and we say wait a minute if I Do jump off this or if I jump off that Suboxone than\nWill I even have a chance to be okay again and\nI always say this is Josh I don't know if you if you knew the show I talk about this all the time but any kind of emotional struggle that we go through\nThere was always a beginning middle and end to that emotional experience so there'll be a beginning part where it's a little bit tougher there'll be a middle part where okay I'm getting through it and then there'll be an end point where you'll be like oh my goodness I did because let's think about how you already made that transition off of\nYeah that was that was the ADA just became anybody's ever\nAnd that the Israelis shove is it becomes a financial burden yes most\nPeople and you know once I stopped eating my prescription and then it's well I'm not ready to stop taking these because I was hooked within three months of being prescribed them I was hooked\nRight it it got all the me in a way that I never saw coming\nYeah and that's the thing I this is why I get so passionate about wiping away judgment because the truth is this is neurological ... it is literally we can see if we did a brain scan would say oh my goodness Josh right here is where some of your new neural networks just connected this is why this path is there\nSo we don't judge somebody for being hungry\nSo we don't want to judge already for for for struggling with this because your brain is basically saying the neurons are saying hey feed me this feed me this\nYep I'm really grateful you call about this go ahead\nI mean there isn't a day goes by you know that I'm off I haven't had a opioid in for\nTwo years now fought three a day goes by or I don't think about you know I mean I could go right back it'd be hooked on it but we could have gotten past that I'm not hooked on laws but no boxing and then going to find a doctor tool actually listen to you\nAnd I\nHad some issues are trying to find a proper doctor I go in to talk to one doctor it's like the guy to listen to what I'm saying I I went in there down on taking X amount that want to take a thirty it prescribe it three times what I'm taking already ...\nI'm going what are you hot [laughter] you know the long way to get off to stop not get hooked on ...\nI think that's it no I think that's it that's why I Want to give the number out one more time just to make sure you have to it's one\nEight three three three oh one\nH.

I mean there are no words to talk about the pain and the and then for the sorrow to last you're done some super sorry about that I think you ... when it when what you'd the message that you tell people what is the message you want people to hear\nThat there is recovery that there is hope um my my goal is to get all people to work together to work with the air out of the lions clubs and their rotary clubs in their churches and get people involved um we can solve this problem by working together\nUh I Know that are in my travels I speak to a an awful lot of ... organizations that have no real funding that are doing it out of the goodness of their health hearts because they lost someone uh you know someone in their family or or a neighbor or something\nAnd they have no funding they have no money so they they get out there and they and their you know they're doing the best they can ... with a no tools\nWhile that's so true and to me like for it really moves through me as you say there is hope because we had a caller earlier Josh who was struggling and said you\nKnow he's dealing with trying to get off and he's at a point where he's looking\nFor that resource I gave him the addiction a resource center number but there is hope and I think that's the encouraging piece that people's brains do recover they can bounce back and I think a lot of people aren't aware of that\nPut

addiction tonight we're facing addiction head on on the emotional management show on the disc Institute of Pittsburgh news lined with me tonight is Doug Griffin who is the New Hampshire state chair\nOf the addiction policy forum continuing this conversation\nDoug I mean your words are really powerful the work you're doing is that's genuine that's that's real life and I one of the things that you said to me before the break that I just love is there is hope I so many people struggling with addiction don't believe there's hope\nBut they definitely is yeah definitely I think that's huge\nI take a message for your listeners that is really important um if you if you have a child that is a suffering substance use disorder and you know it\nUm it's kind of like when you first have a baby yeah you walk by the nursery and you're kind of peak in at night to make sure that they're still breathing while it's the same way when you have a child with substance abuse\nDisorder and you walk by their room and\nYour peak in there just to hear them breathing and then it you know if you haven't face it before it's it's difficult to imagine that stress but uh I Would recommend that ... that they would get no locks on and have it in the house um\nThere's there's nothing wrong with with having to um to save your child's life or if it's a great thing they have it by your night stand if you have a child that's got a problem\nAnd talk a little bit about the locks and just to just give us a brief overview real quick on the\nOn the locks on a will win win you a overdose um your your your brain basically tells you buy a slow way way down so you're you're barely beating heart is barely beating and when you're when you use the nasal spray or the injector of locks on um it's it's just uh\nOur favorite pubs ... a a a housing and um and in a house and it says on one of his poems prepare for ill and not for good so we need to be prepared for what might come and so I think that in the locks and it's so important to have\nOne of the questions that comes up is um blame because so many people will say they blame themselves and\nThey take this on for me this is really something I Want to eliminate because when I have found time and again is that people when they live and shame they act on it a shame for me it's not about blame what\nCould you talk a little bit about that well\nYeah I I think you always have to be looking forward you can't look backward you know a specially if you face the loss and you can't sit there and keep thinking well if I had done this I put it on this we should've done it it's crazy you know get busy and help somebody else out you know that's what they could do I'm\nA blame is it's it's hideous you know it it can drive into you know depression\nAh ... there's no need to sit there and tell yourself apart about um something that you could have done or something you should be doing just do it you know if you if your child is still alive or someone that you love is is suffering and has a problem get involved with with the community get them get them ... some help you know\nA face it head on don't skirt the issue face it head on\nThat too it just brings all the way through me that goes all the way through me because I really wholeheartedly believe that and I think that the past is gone we cannot get one single second\nOf the past back the only thing we have is the present moment and what we're going to do from here forward so I I'm really kind of all on board on getting rid of blame it is not about I think what happens is a lot of times for people when they have they they're lost their lives and they're in pain\nAnd so when you grab on to things like good and bad right and wrong and blame then\nWe get to have a sense of something to target and ... and put our anger to where to put our sadness toward but the truth is is not doing any good it's really not\nIt's destructive definitely destructive and and\nThen that other thing you hear them you know they have to hit rock bottom that's crap you know if if someone was uh had cancer which wait until they were just about dead before you did something for them no I mean when you need to do you react today you know try to get them into treatment today don't wait for them to hit rock bottom that's a that's a crazy thing to do\nAgree I definitely agree with that that is\nThat's the lesson that is good for every one I really want our listeners to hear just not just about addiction about everything in life we don't need to wait until this idea that's a myth of rock bottom because why you you you hit the nail on the head you're exactly right you're not going to wait or anything else until it's not bad we wanted as soon as we see some things off\nThat's when they have the conversation and how do you recommend people what would you say 'cause we're talking a little bit about this before the break how do they begin that conversation\n[noise] um well it could it could say or other drugs in your school you know because you and I both know that the kids in school no who is using where they're getting it\nYou know who has it on and that day you know but they don't talk about it there's a code and all the schools in America it's like ah it it's unbelievable and again you can't practice code so you could you could begin the conversation by saying I I heard there was a lot of drugs over in the school and such and such a county or are they in your school\nYou know and and it gets all open up a little of the time I have a pinball machine in my house and that's how I was I was able to talk to my kids over a game a pinball we just kind of skirt the that the question for a minute and then we could get into talking about or whatever without them having to look me right in the eyes they could talk about it you know\nYes so that's a really important that's a really important thing to a key to highlight is it doesn't have to be we sit down and we put the hot lights on you in this interview lights and no we're we're getting a\nIt's in no we're we're getting out to the microphones in the video cameras and were interviewing you in this\nYou know this hot situation no it's it's let's be doing whatever we're doing playing a game of basketball play in a board game being together\nAnd then just bringing it up like and again there's no right I and that's what I ... I really want lessons to hear that there is no right way it's not like oh this is the right way that's the wrong way it's getting it out there because one thing I think is I have found effective is is I call myself on if I'm ineffective\nWow I Would have liked to set it differently but now that it's out that is really what I Want to talk about um\nI I Wish there was a better way for me to say that there's not but here's all I'm going to say and I'm going to have some verbal diarrhea here and just say whatever is on my mind [laughter]\nThat also you can ah had the kids' friends over the house get to know your kids' friends you know there's new friends in the group there's that's a flag you know there's somebody that they don't bring home a shame to bring him to the house or are they they're starting to go to someone's house that you don't know a little too often column on it and say hey why don't you invite Joel over for dinner tonight\nYou know having game night yeah I think game night as a great thing no matter how I mean my kids I still have gained like my kids are in the thirties at all it's it's a it's a great thing\nIt really is and it's true we ... we knew this shine light on it and say\nHere we go let's talk about it you have sort of a new friend and you're so tell me about this friend told me about it and anything that is seems to be like I always say if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it's probably a duck\nIt as a parent to have a sense hey my child seems to be off it's okay to say hey I Love you you seem to be off I'm not sure what's going on as no accusations I'm just saying you seem to be off\nAnd when we as long as we rely on behavioral observations I feel that's one of the best way to get around fight or flight response I say hey honey I noticed that you seem a lot more tired recently tell me what's going on I Want to know what's going on\nYeah I I think if you do things with your kids um take him to a ball game take their friends would go to each go to the ... and go for a cap and go camping for the weekend\nGet to see them you know over a few hour period of time and then you can tell if they're safe\nDoug thank you so much like this is absolutely unbelievable to have you on to share what you have shared with us tonight Doug Griffin New Hampshire state chair of the addiction policy forum\nHe has genuinely shown us some really wonderful things and we're going to keep giving the number all night for the addiction resource center\nBut thank you so much for being on with us tonight\nThank you very much that God\nThis is emotional management on Katie KIA radio I'm Dr Christian country tonight we're facing addiction head on and coming up\nWe're going to talk more and really bring the point home emotional

dot com\nBut instead of shying away from it it's okay to just say listen I'm Sorry I Am so sorry to see that you're struggling or that you're in that type of the situation or that you had that kind of pain so to reach out let's not stop talking about it as Doug mentioned he would love to see pictures of his daughter\nHe would love to see that I mean that's this is your your your your family and the other message that Doug gave and I think this is the message that is my goodness do I want to reach in your hearts and have you feel and that is there is hope\nSo I Want you to call in there is hope\nLook the addiction policy forum\nHas the addiction resource a line and it is one eight three three three oh one help so that's one eight three three three oh one for three five seven if you or a loved one are struggling with addiction please\nTake the time to call them I got involved with the addiction policy forum\nBecause I met their founder Jeff nickel just one of the most incredible human beings\nAnd she and I the moment we started talking we hit it off I I have dedicated my career to approaching people with compassion wiping away judgment you something Doug said earlier about let's we talked about blame what what uses there\nUses that it's gone what are we doing with a blank let's work from this moment for what can we do from right here right now [noise] so when just when I first connected we were talking about how we set aside that shame set aside blame let's just get education let's shine light\n... theory is based on conscious education and compassion I think where we shine light we can change things\nAnd I think that's really difficult for a lot of people so many people we again it comes back to this and I really want this to\nI Want you to hear that it comes back to being a child and thinking we had good guys and bad guys are this makes sense a plus B. equals C.\nAnd along as eight plus me go see our world makes sense but then we get immersed in this universe when I grew up hey we're real certain that there were nine planets in the solar system\nNow now here we are all these years later and we understand that maybe there are eight planets and in five dwarf planets one of those dwarf planets series is actually bigger than Pluto\nAnd my goodness there might be a moon on the outside of the solar system we have things that we don't even know about it our own solar system let alone a galaxy with\nHundreds of billions of stars and billions trillions of two trillion unit are two trillion galaxies\nI just think we live in a world that so enormous that it is silly\nIs really childish to try to bring the world down do it's just black and white either or good and bad and when we do that when we do that we ostracized people we push people aside you're wrong for this you're bad for this\nInstead let's not try to find one isolated target for anger let's not try to find one isolated target\nFor our sadness for anxiety instead let's recognize that there are multiple factors\nAnd we're one of them were one of the factors that contribute we are creating the content\nOf this universe imagine that you are you're a writer in the story of the universe right now you're still you're a writer you're an author and the story of what the world is right now so what are you writing so think about it from this moment for the next time you gossip I really want you to hear this\nYou're contributing gossip to the world the next time your negative I Need I Need you to hear this you're contributing negativity of the world what do you want to bring to the world the past has gone we can't get it back I said this earlier\nWe've gotten to a point where as I get older I see that it's not about making things complicated it's about making things pretty simple we master what we practice we are where we put out there so we're going to constantly put out\nJudgment negativity anger that's what that's what we're creating in our world so if we can set that stuff aside now I understand again ... I I I come back to the reason why people are judgment of the reason why\nBecause people become judgmental because they cling to what they've always known which is if I can get an easy answer hey this is the bad guy\nHey it's this is the problem that's why with event happens when people struggle with a opioids we say opioids are the bad guy but the truth as some people survive on opioids and are they need that to get through their lives\nAnd instead of thinking either or one side or the other let's think about balance to think about education\nThe case in let's think about what we can shine light on addiction impacts the whole family it could be impacting you the other piece of Doug and I talked about that I think is really important to shine light on is this\nWhen you want to start a conversation so one of my favorite professors was a guy named Dr Nikki Khanna he was awesome so I was talking to he was in the fields like fifty years psychologist awesome guy one day we were talking in the\nMiddle of me talking he said you know what you're gonna have to say that again I just started daydreaming I missed what you said [laughter]\nHe said he said it's I'm a human being human beings daydream sometimes I thought that was awesome I thought that was so self aware I'm like you're right that's okay it's not right or wrong good or bad human beings they dream sometimes sometimes we need to just call ourselves hey I don't know how to start this conversation\nBut here it is hey coming up after the break we're going to talk more about this addiction this is emotional management I'm Dr

TV and what was really interesting about this debate is that it seemed as though they did their best to run to the middle\nA congressional hearings in the house of representatives\nOn Brett Kavanaugh on whether or not\nHe told whether he lied or told the truth to the Senate whether or not a doctor Ford was a write in her accusations as you know there are lots of lots of uh\nThe gesture and that the FBI did it for a job and not question a lot of other witnesses while at the Democrats take control of the house\nThey showed the Judiciary Committee will have the ability\nTo hold hearings on issues like that\nBut ah Conor Lamb would have nothing to do with that he basically said that he did not support\nFurther investigations are with respect to Brett Kavanaugh that this is the end of it well that just sounds like Donald Trump and so ah the fact is that\nFed lamb again was showing that he was in the end of his party and that he was going to pay much more conservative positions Venice parties all can rise asked him are you are\nA Bernie Sanders Democrat um because I asked him specifically about\nPre college tuition and things like that programs like that that come from the Democratic left and Conor Lamb said no I'm a Conor Lamb Democrat and once again said he does not support programs that are not eight or so he was doing everything he could have to get a metal a Republican case right\nIt's a process of course have been and continues to be a very strong deficit hawk conservative and uh I uh I'm In watching how he answered questions I think he wanted to stay away from home\nAnd the excesses of President Trump's as much as he could punch still maintain his conservative credentials it was an interesting debate really watch\nThe thought it was kind of curious that uh he commented that he didn't want to get into the habit of commenting on everything the President Trump is said on Twitter or otherwise that alone could easily be a a fulltime job and it sounds to me as though\nFor if I could use a sports analogy here nobody wanted to come up with a bulletin board material for the other team\nWhere they people can go back and say look at what so and so said and we're going to come down hard and motivate my base it was almost as though they were both trying to figure out ways of making sure the opposition wasn't energized to come out and vote against them\nYeah I think that's a good point remember this seventeenth congressional districts and we'll remind everybody that north hills of Allegheny county part of the south hills a Quaker valley olive beaver county\nAnd cranberry part of our county this is a district that voted for President Trump\nBy two points over Hillary Clinton so it's a fifty fifty kind of district mhm are clearly there are Democrats who support President Trump in this district and for Conor Lamb he needs those Democrats so he does not want to appear\nTo be anti Trump in the overall and yet he also needs is democratic liberal base and particularly women who\nWere a mainstay and his election is very narrow three tenths of one percent victory over Rick struck home last spring\nAnd uh you know most of this district is brand new to land it's better known to raw fish but ... doesn't have sort of a star quality that Conor Lamb got by all that money that was spent last spring and so it's been perceived to be a bit a pill\nFor ah for rock says in this race\nWere there any clear divisions ... things that absolutely separated the two of them\nWell I ask one question that was clear and that was whether or not a whole top like town hall meetings um you know maybe that's not a big deal for a lot of people a roster says how much the telephone town meetings where people call in and can I ask him questions and responds but he has not held any public\nTown hall meetings where you physically show up and he says that's because democratic left wing extremist groups resistance groups ...

Eddie growing the reason tonight works out perfect plays because of the conversation I had this afternoon with my doctor\nAnd then I came in and I realized I'm going to get I'm going to get more opinions because my doctor for the first time you use the word that I've talked to Dr Sean Ritchie about Dr Ritchie welcome again good to see it good to see you thanks for having me I went to a doctor\nAnd was telling my doctor my GPA about this thing and my butt and he goes and sounds like neuropathy\nI Know that word and you've heard it once or twice I heard it once or\nTwice Dr Sean Ritchie of neuropathy treatment centers of Pittsburgh\nYou can get a hold of them by calling their two locations\nThe phone number is Seventy four nine four o nine thousand the two locations wet spurred on what spurred main road that's twenty five Ninety One wet spring ... road and in late trove on Nineteen oh one\nLeading near St but I'll be honest with you Dr I've listened and we talked about in Iraq but the ... and I could have sort of apply some of the things you described to\nMy ancient body what I call it like that but\nAnd there are a little reluctant because all they have is medicine likely or a cat and a rotten or a gap and and that's just a mask or it's just something that's going to end the pain unfortunately they don't have anything that will it will fix it and make it better so [noise] two thousand Thirteen\nOkay I ... this is Barry Barry new stuff new deck on when it comes to medical it takes a while to filter down this is new technology right and I can do it's\nNatural it's safe it's FDA approved it's noninvasive it's actually painless you sit there and you don't even feel a darn thing that's the best part about it the second best part is that is designed to re grow the nerves so\nUm [noise] how it works is there's two technologies one is what we call low level light therapy\nLike therapy you sit in a recliner chair it's in the ... system that wraps around your feet mhm your calves interrupts the generally starts at your toes start to feel the numbness maybe all of them started to go than the ball and the whole bottom\nAnd the tops any ankles and works itself up to the calf and if it even makes it there and then it's up to the knee and then it stops and when we start to fix it\nAnd re grow the small nerve fibers it goes out the same way I came in so all you do is come in you sit down and require Cher we apply these lights the U\n... audio handed me so you apply the light so ... is a glue or a and no no I mean is a district that\nI guess not apply gets we re wrap this low NATO claimed booty system around you it's just so these black booty systems that looks like OK and we pushed the on button now you don't feel anything and it goes through very specific frequency of light\nNow in the past there's been light therapies ...\nPaintings light therapy yeah but there's a very specific um errors in for adults or violate there's um seven different frequencies that this whole system goes through in twenty minutes and when it does that\nIt creates a chemical reaction in your superficial layer now this is a very superficial disease and so the laser therapy people say that sometimes is laser therapy will help you right that's great\nUm technology for deep rooted stuff you've got arthritis is good for that you got some trigger point she got sinus I Do see got shingles I have one of those lasers and I've used it for everything [noise]\nUm but it's not good for superficial stuff so with that the light therapy is the exact opposite he only works on the superficial where where your problem is with ... so\nWhat the lights do is it creates the production of this thing called nitric oxide nitric oxide is produced in our body when we get older is that we don't produce that as much that it is proven than nitric oxide does one thing it creates visas\nIt creates ... violation or capillary ... ... and now the cap laser where all the oxygen and ... feet tissue to keep it alive\nWhen we lose that production those capitalized get tight now you don't have that permeability you're not feeding tissue so when that happens things can die or you can't keep it alive\nSo this system creates the production of nitric oxide now we get permeability now we get a chemical reaction occurring in the superficial layer of your skin and now this all starts to re grow these nerves\nSo since two thousand Thirteen we've been doing that as of November of last year I had a some new technology and I know we've talked about it Eddie in your ears always perk up because you like the thought of what a this magnetic therapy is all about\nOh well that's something I it's really interesting to me to see the technology advanced because that existed and when I was playing sports and I I use that\nBut not near as specific a treatment plan as what you talked about when you bring up the magnetic treatment and the lights up is completely cool to me talking about healing ...\nRight yeah that's exactly right and\nAnd it really works but the we've just added that too so the first part as we dilate the vessels to create an influx of nutrients to go through so that's great but now we have this other thing called blood flow when your blood leaves your heart it goes into your arteries and then you're capillaries and then she range and back\nFourteen percent as the arteries\nEleven percent as the veins Seventy five percent of that entire flows through your body is in your capillaries now that's where oxygen feeds or ah the cap player's will lead oxygen and nutrient feed your eyes your tongue your muscles your leg minutes every ... every thing in your body is fed by that\nThat pass away from your heart all the way around them back is\nNinety two thousand miles in an average human Ninety two thousand miles of circulation in Seventy five percent is capillary so that shows how important that is\nWhen you talk about the cap I I'm envisioning going from a river to a stream to a brook and it getting smaller yup but\nAlmost all of the ... the the blood moving is getting moved through the smallest of the options\nRight and that's where all the oxygen feeds everything now the magnetic therapy is designed FDA approved it says it improves the circulation through the capillary system to Seventy five percent and improves it up to three to four percent\nUntil a new company came out with a brand new patented sine wave you know there's like ... it's a patented sine wave that can um increase up ... up to fifty percent to think about that if I can open the capillaries\nAnd then turn the faucet on through these capillaries right now we not only get an influx in whether it's in your hands on your feet now we get an influx of nutrients through that whole tissue and now creates this chemical reaction in your body in a way to re grow the small nerve fibers how cool is that and that's Seventy five percent\nSeventy five percent of your book is through the capital\nAnd by you're talking about the increase with the amount of\nThe magazine therapy will do that now we put an intense version around your feet okay I'm In your hands if you have it there but you also lay on a mat and the mat will do this through your whole body if you go to my website it's really cool I'm Mary dancing dot com ... if you scroll down and you see a little green video hit the play button\nThere's free they're storing to tip 'em before and I'm doing and then at the end of eight minutes ... look at the difference in the blood flow there now\nNow that after one treatment of eight minutes or less for the next twelve to Fifteen hours I think of the magnitude if I can do that for the rest of my life now my blood flow slows down in my circulation slows down as I get older when I'm fifty some of these things just sit stagnant for ten to twelve minutes I appreciate\nYou looking straight at me when you said that diet [laughter] you're right Diane don't want to say that but you're right\nBut that's just what happened I mean I was with me as well and if I can turn that on and thinking about doing that every day for the rest of your life thinking of improving your blood flow fifty percent from here to for whatever by doing the treatment each day what an amazing thought\nWell I mean it's mind boggling just said the technology because that's interesting to me but I also think about ah the quality of life it's coming back that what a lot of people was just assumed okay that part of it's gone right right and\nLike I said back in two thousand Thirteen when I got started with is I never Eddie thought that it would work as well as it did in fact I took six patients\nThat had this and I said you guys are my clinical trial and I need an honest opinion and we went took them through the whole program and by the end all six patients got better I mean close to a hundred percent better but not always a hundred percent better but\nIt was amazing and they came from all different aspects I mean some people at chemotherapy and got it right better get it\nCholesterol medicine cause it all the time I'm a broken down back maybe back surgeries or you know maybe knee hip surgeries I get some orthopedic said have referred people with knee surgeries Ryan end up getting this interrupts the in that foot and it just works it works really good\nWell what you're talking about is making people's lives better and it's the easiest that could possibly be non invasive is a big word for a lot of people\nRight yeah and this pain was actually you almost feel like nothing's happening and then all of a sudden you get up and you put your foot down and it feels different if it was like it's maybe your foot again\nDr Sean rich you may have my perfect treatment plan when that whole doing nothing thing I knew that I'm Talking to Dr Sean Ritchie neuropathy treatment centers of Pittsburgh the website is Mary dance then dot com you're\nListening to Pittsburgh words on a um ten twenty Katie KIA\nReal patients real stories from Scott and Christie I care associate hey it's Mardi Gras and we're here today talking to Judy hiding she certainly you're like me Judy I'm not a fan of glasses even though I have them you didn't like them yourself did you\nI hated wearing glasses but things got to the point where I just simply could not read wrote science\nThere's so many folks that have cataract surgery but you went with a different approach what did you go with and why\nI went with the multi focal when I went to see Dr Christie he had not only very knowledgeable people to talk to but also a pamphlets and things to look at the home run absolutely\nFabulous [laughter] it's it's big isn't it is like a miracle either the eyes of a twenty year old I'm twenty\nTwenty Scott and Christie I care associates vision for life to learn more about multi vocal and laser cataract surgery [noise] go to Scott and Christie dot com or call seven two four seven seven two fifty four twenty\nAnd then they will activate are simulate um\nCenturies so it'll do ... things called thing sharp things just to see what you're feeling and that gives me an idea of where you're at in this whole neuropathy game\nOnce I figure that out than what we do is we take in the other room you fitness recliner chair and we put the beat up and we uh put the near ... booty systems on you right and you sit there most of the time you get to talk to somebody else is going through exactly what you have 'cause a lot of these people think there\nThere's not many people out there that have this and there are alone soldier unfortunately there's not because\nThere are ten percent of Americans that have neuropathy that's like over thirty million people there have thirty three million people yes that's that's amazing and a lot of these people think they're a loan out there 'cause the doctors don't want to talk about it because I don't know what to do about it so\nOnce we do that mhm we treat you the program that we run is anywhere from twenty to thirty visits okay depending on your severity but what I Do and this is because\nThey've come in skeptical I started a skeptical\nAnd so I Do a trial run the trial run is eight visits now that's for the patient I Know if I diagnose you with it that it's a good portion of your interrupt they will go away but I Want you to feel it I Want you to get acclimated with the program here to talk to people feel comfortable at the office\nI'm so during those eight visits I Want you to start saying they\nWhen I go to bed I put the sheets over my feet and I can't stand it I had to keep the sheets of well now you are able to do that I Can't walk around in the house without socks now you can ah all these little symptoms that people generally get those walking on pedals hey they're not those pebbles are getting ...\nSchools are getting smaller the pillow the swelling that restrictive the tight feeling a range of motion the color things are starting to change so then we know that it's worth to continue I don't want to waste anybody's time if they're not going to get better I Know that there are some other programs out there that they want to send you home with technology\nWell that's my next question as easy as it is to sit there and get the booty on you\nSeen ads for I I can order this at home and it's got blinking lights as not the same thing and all isn't\nRight right it's you get what you pay for I Know each set up of my equipment is thousands and thousands of dollars and these people that are sending your home\nUm I I just learned that the one guy is selling this ended nine therapy\nFor thousands of dollars and there are only a hundred dollars for the lights and and he sent you home with them and there's no guarantee there's no accountability you can't sit there and talk to the patients say okay what are you experiencing that laser that I talked about like people come in and they have arthritis to their older right\nHey let's do that I had a patient come in and and um she's on her eighth visit and she's she just told me this was yesterday that she's eighty percent better but outside of that on her back she had just this quarter sized itch and she's had this it's forever okay and I'm like OK\nLet's pull the laser out we had this little laser and I'm like let's put it on\nAnd you know that if she had been the doctor after doctor that like it's a nerve you can't do anything chiropractic adjustments won't help but we try this laser and she said for a good day she goes it was hardly there so we get to try all these different things I have all kinds of different therapies at the office interrupt the I Do have a program\nI'm In a corporation home therapy stuff to do but\nI'm accountable I I Want you to get better and I'm gonna do anything I possibly can and get you better\nOn the fact that you're giving the eight ... ... you know basically those eight visits you're gonna know and a visit and she was eighty percent better yeah find my dumb math that's ten percent better with each visit\nRight right now she was a good ... I mean she did good ... ... she's like I Walk around and she has a cat and she's like I feel the cat litter on the ground she goes I Know I'm getting better so those are things that people say and I that make me go it's worthy of continuing let's go\nUm she's an exceptional case right and there's people that get five ten percent better you know they just feel\nUm like recently I'm trying to think of some pages the one they had to grab onto the railing and they get upstairs and she's flying up the stairs and she's only under six visit and she's not even using a railing now so these little things we know is working and unfortunately if she would have stuck with\nOther therapies she would just be increasing her meds\nLet's see that's the scary part you talk about people come to see you and they're skeptical right I Would I Would imagine there are also coming to see you skeptical or not they might be desperate\nAnd for me a sense of desperation would include I don't want to take ... if the meds aren't going to fix anything I don't want to numb the problem I Want to fix the problem\nRight well that's that's exactly right you don't want to take measures I always give the analogy if I'm sitting there punch in your in your arm and starts to hurt so you started taking some Tylenol right to defend the pain\nWhy keep punching you so you're ... you're on gifts or more sore and you pop more Tylenol instead of taking a Tylenol why don't you stop me from punching you and that's what we do we try to find a way to get those nerves to regenerate\nAnd then all this on pins and needles the burning usually those type of pain will go away first and um this is a little slower and feeling some kind of the people that have their sharp stabbing pains I'm In that burning\nEarning the pins and needles they'll start to feel that much quicker\nNow you're describing exactly what I went there today Dr Sean Ritchie is my guest with neuropathy treatment centers of Pittsburgh\nThe website is
