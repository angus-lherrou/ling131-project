a part of this show the number's eight six six three nine one ten twenty or if you don't feel comfortable talking you can email us ... dollar bank instant access that Katie K radio dot com\nOr you know myself I I I Would beg to differ I think one of the greatest things about us as human beings is we have an essence there is an essence about us and that essence is deep\nThat essence is so much be on and just the things we do in everyday life\nAnd to get to know our essence to go deep inside of us to really understand what's going on in our psyche and our minds that takes a lot of exploration it takes courage to to be able to look at your life and say I want to do things differently or I don't like how things are being done right now\nAnd look the world's caught up in chaos there's a lot of chaos you gotta admit we use on on the television UC conflict left and right you see anger left and right whether it's in politics whether it's in events that are happening around the world the world can become overwhelming and so how do you navigate through that\nI think a lot of times we take it for granted so I was I had some pretty uh intense stuff over the last couple of weeks that I was helping people navigate through and I deal with\nUm people who are struggling in some of the darkest places they've ever struggled in in maximum security prisons\nAnd I was working in particular with someone who was doing some really really graphic intense self harm and the nurses were getting kind of frustrated they were kind of losing compassion for this person because they were bandages person up and then uh this person would continue to hurt herself\nAnd it would be over and over again and so obviously if you're one of those nurses who's working really hard trying to help someone and that person is just ripping off that bandage and then re injury\nTo understand for any of us so we say well if you're going to hurt yourself why should I care why should I even care so\nI was working with some nurses and I was watching them get really frustrated with this one person in particular and I said\nYou know this struck me this struck me the other day I was I I came into a a a really bad situation and I try to be mindful of what I paint a picture and what I put out in the universe I Try to put out unnecessary details that don't need to be there but I came into a really\nA difficult situation where a woman was a an inmate who was kind of just laying there trying to not not responsive but she was purposely being not respond so she wasn't actually injured\nAnd so eventually she came around and she became you know she kinda rivers responsive and then said you know you know I was doing this kind of wanted to get you I wanted people to be I wanted to see if people actually cared\nSo she was OK physically but this is what was going on with her psychologically and I said when I when I walked away I thought\nYou know what I just watch someone who look like they weren't going to get back out now here in my brain is processing that someone might not get back out now if you're looking at a ... a human body another human being\nWho looks like they're in a position that they're not no longer alive and you're watching that that impacts your brain whether you believe the impacts your brain or you don't the reality is that is that it does impact your brain\nAnd so I share this with one of those nurses when we came to this woman who was dealing with south farm I said I watched this woman and I realize that even though maybe I'm not a ... outwardly emotional because I've been doing this for Twenty years\nAnd my job is dealing with some of the most intense crises you can possibly think of literally the most intense crisis you could think of and that's what I've been doing\nFor my entire career so emotionally outward I might look cool as a cucumber\nAnd I might even feel cool was a cucumber as I'm dealing with things because I'm constantly exuding love but here's the point just because I think that I can handle something doesn't mean my brain is handling it\nAnd not doing some sort of impact\nSo I said to these nurses I said every time you were watching this woman harm herself\nIt's impacting your brain you're seeing a really tough\nPhysical situation and just because you're used to seeing tough situations doesn't mean your brain's not being impacted by it\nSo watch this we have a three pound brain doesn't matter how tough you are doesn't matter how experienced you are at the end of day you have a three pound brain and if your brain takes in images\nThat are scary if it takes in images that are intense than your brain is processing those images as if you're involved in that situation\nSo fancy word we have a pre motor cortex and the pre before\nSo and we have a motor cortex is the primary set of our movements motor movement pre motor before we move we think about movement so in other words when we watch situations out in the world when you watch intense situations when your children or grandchildren are playing video games and they're playing violent video games\nTheir pre motor cortex is firing as if it's there is if it's experiencing that\nAnd here in two thousand and Eighteen we understand that the brain is impacted neurologically physically by the things that we watch so now let me tie this back into this woman who was hurting herself and these nurses that were getting exhausted what happens is you may ...\nBy the things that we watch so now let me tie this back into this woman who was hurting herself in these nurses that were getting exhausted what happens is you may come at someone with a tremendous amount of compassion and love\nBut eventually what happens is what's called psychological tolerance so just the way if you a drink a beer\nAnd you might feel something the first time you drink a beer as you as you get older or you develop a tolerance it takes more and more of that same beer to get you to feel the same way\nWith the same is true in life in terms of psychological experiences maybe you experience something and it's pretty intense and then you do that enough and eventually that doesn't get you rattled\nBut that doesn't mean that it's not impacting your brain in some way and so being mindful about how images impact your brain\nSo when you're watching the news when you're turning on the television and you're watching constant arguments when you're turning on the television and you're seeing the tragedies and you're getting first hand vision of those tragedies\nYour brain is being impacted by that now you might say what's the big deal I just flip the channel I didn't I didn't it didn't bother me I was okay with that but here's the thing you have to remember that we were not designed\nTo live in front of a television so our brain on a deep evolutionary biological perspective doesn't watch let's say the intense flooding that are occurring and then see oh that's fine because remember just because you weren't there your brain is processing that\nNow watch what happens from this and this is why song about learning about yourself on this show tonight if I'm watching these tragedies if I'm watching this intense stuff and my brain is processing it as if I'm actually experiencing it\nNow all the things that come with trauma like agitation irritability being short with your loved ones\nThose are the very same things that we would expect to see for someone who experiences of trauma physically\nWell now you might be doing that and not even realize that the things you're watching are playing a role in why you feel agitated and why you feel irritable and can you imagine if you could come back to your loved ones and say\nI find myself being a little bit more irritable and I see myself being a little bit more agitated with you and I really want to apologize I Want you to know it's not you I think I've been taking in a an awful lot\nSo how do we even get to the point where we can recognize what we've been taking in well it comes by\nReflecting it comes by reflecting comes by stepping back and and really taking a good hard look\nAt what we're taking in day in day out one of the things I wanted to do with this show is remind everyone I Want to remind you to be mindful of what you're putting in near foreground what are you putting in your mind\nIs it news that people are you watching constantly fighting as it is it movies that are violent you know for young people are they watching video games that are violent because whatever your brain is seeing its experiencing whether you believe it is or not\nAnd once you realize that you can really start to choose what you got to put in front of your mind if you want to be a part of this show and you have questions\nEight six six three nine one ten twenty or you can email us of the dollar bank instant access\nAt Katy K radio dot com or you can text us at eight six

treats today Walgreens trusted since Nineteen oh one [noise]\nHere's the piece to be aware of maybe you're not asked\nMaybe you're not asking to go back to nine eleven and relive that horror that we experience on that day but when we're watching it on the news all day long I guess what we are we are experiencing it again I'm\nWhat I kind of chefs are in our store for answers the way I Am\nWe saw I say ... ... more of a New York city falling apart not going to last year and a lot of what the Pentagon experience out of that was by design but I really still it was just on what we carry on but\nYeah I mean I think where when it comes to understanding that the world of the media is going to you know there are obviously there's gonna be a plan to the way things are unfolded now I'm not talking about like some great giant conspiracy I'm saying that obviously\nIn any and I am [laughter]\nWell I I think I you know I had a definitely a respect everybody's perspective but I think that our where wherever it is the reality is ... you can there's going to be an intention by the way the media delivers whatever they deliver because at the end of the day a business is business so being able to grab people's attention is important\nInteresting how we ... we ... we our businesses or ... or staring various directions you know it's really spark a lot of thought process certainly for sixty one and a half year old guy do I get\nAnd I definitely appreciate and I appreciate you call in and\nAnd then be and being a part of the show thank you George I think it's a great great point that George brings up um that when we we we see those things and that happened that was true around nine eleven in fact I was actually in a prison on that day this year not back when it happened and I was a couple of the inmates\nWere watching this and they had a visceral reaction and then I was there and we process that we process what happened but there was no faking it I kind of watch this visceral reaction as I as a ah had seen\nOn the television when they saw that on the television it was pretty it was pretty profound so I got a ah on the right automotive text line there is a question on um why should we give compassionate people who hurt themselves\nIf they don't respect themselves why should I ... I don't know if this is like almost identical to what I had referred to earlier\nBut I kind of even alluded to that even when I was saying earlier the truth is people who are struggling need our help more I think they need our compassion more and here's something that gets confused a lot\nI think people have this and I understand why but there's a ... there's a misperception that when we say that we are going to give someone compassion that that means we're going to give them whatever it is that they're seeking\nAnd there is a difference between being compassionate with someone\nAccepting who that person is\nAnd condoning what they do so I don't necessarily need to condone anything someone does to have compassion for who they are because again to come back to that essence I Believe people are much deeper than what they often show the world just think about you think about your own life\nHave you not done things and thought gosh I Wish I didn't do that have you not done things impulsively and said\nMan I Wish I could take that back and get that moment back\nNow imagine this because this is really a a powerful concept to understand there's something called asymmetric insight fancy where here's what it means we have a tendency to believe we are really deep and mysterious but other people really shallow and predictable so\nA fancy word here's what it means we have a tendency to believe we are really deep and mysterious\nBut other people really shallow and predictable so we think we're arguing with someone and they don't they don't see what we see we just say well they're an idiot they just don't know if they saw what we saw they would obviously take our side\nThe problem with asymmetric insiders everybody struggles with it so we all think we're deep and mysterious and everyone else's shallow and predictable\nBut what if we weren't what if we could imagine and be mindful of that concept of asymmetric insight said that the next time we get into a disagreement with someone instead of rushing to say that they just don't understand\nWe lead with compassion and realize that maybe they have something to offer us that we haven't seen entirely\nYou see one of the great things that changes anger one of the great things that changes conflict is humility a lot of anger stems from ego a lot of anger stems from the need to be right the need to prove ourselves right\nNow what do we really get by that is anybody really have a headstone and says hey here's so and so this person was right five thousand six hundred and eighty two times that's not happening and at the end of the day there is no award for being right in fact the only real consequence\nFor needing to be right all the time is usually pushing everyone in your life out of your life\nBecause it was all about okay I'm right I'm right I'm right okay but you're not really comfortable to be around so you want to ask yourself something I've asked young people for a long time do you want to be right or do you want to be happy 'cause oftentimes it's needing to give up the idea of I Need to be right\nThe question is why do we need to be right and there is an answer to that we need to be right because when we're right\nWe feel like oh look I'm valued I'm a valued member of society and people are going to want to have me around\nAnd I think that that's the real deep seated reason why we want to be right because if I'm valued then people are going to need me and I'm not going to be abandoned\nAnd I I kind of have a really cool evolutionary thought about this thing about ten thousand B. C. if people are out there in a in a show surviving in the tribe and up in a in a group of human beings and if they're ostracized if they're kicked out of that group than not meant death\nSo we have such a fear of being abandoned that we want to say look I have value to this group so there are a couple of things that emerge from this and let's talk about some of them coming up but one of them is that we want to be validated but the other one is that we want to be valued\nHey this is emotional management you ought to be a part of the show eight six six three nine one ten twenty or you can

that's the best deal in Pittsburgh\nLook I think for me I get really passionate about what I Do because\nWhen you watch change happen when you're able to literally be in the room so I usually get really excited I played football when I was young and you know throw the football a touchdown pass that was a great feeling right the crowd and Rob this is this a wonderful feeling\nBut there are other ways to get that feeling that feeling was a sense of accomplishment like OK I worked hard for something and then that unfolded but what I watch through the years is that feeling is not just I'm a relegated to sports it's in any aspect of life\nWhen you can put your heart and soul into something and watch it come to fruition it's pretty awesome\nAnd it doesn't just have to be you doing it it can be you watching other people succeed and I've got a lot of joy from now when I get to watch people get self awareness that they previously never had it's really kind of fun to watch because you under like for me I see that there's a whole pack the whole world is going to open up\nOnce you really start to step outside of your cave and see the world differently and open things up so I I really am passionate about what I Do I work with everyone from uh people who are struggling on the inside the inmates in prisons and maximum security prisons to about top athletes\nUm to just people who are struggling in life with any issues so we've got a question here from the dollar bank instant access which is um from Ron ... says why do pro athletes who get paid to play sports\nDo dumb things out of anger to cost their team run I think if I knew the answer to that\nThan I think every coach would like to have that answer but actually I Do know the answer to that so I think coaches do want that oh wait that's why I consult with professional teams\nWhy do athletes as we often times think somebody's good at one thing that they're good at everything else so if someone's really wonderful at their craft and they've worked really hard to become a master at their craft and football let's say\nThey might be excellent at what they're doing but that doesn't mean that they've mastered their mind they may have mastered their body they may have mastered a certain part of that sport but that doesn't mean they've\nFor example there is to be really great at the sport to have an edge you have to be able to be willing to really throw yourself out there and that means operating on an instinctual level at times\nSo let's take a linebacker for instance a linebacker on on the defense in football his job is to tackle people and he needs to operate on instinct he needs to know he needs to be able to read the play definitely prepare\nRead the play as much as possible but ultimately it comes down to instinct can you trust his got of what's gonna happen now if we're operating on an instinctual level what else happens on an instinctual level wealth napping out\nKind of not operating in the world of being thoughtful we're mindful but operating on that base instinct so a lot of times the athletes will lash out even though it costs their team because they're not looking at the bigger picture\nThey're focused on that impulse of immediate\nNeed for whatever that is\nNow as much as I Would love for us all to sit back and just sit in our own world and say see these athletes are losing control\nWe have to look at ourselves first and foremost because just because the athletes are on television and we can actually see them and we can watch the mistake\nWhat if someone would have been at your work the other day\nAnd they watched that you lash out at someone else or what if someone had been in your family in your household and had cameras on\nWhen you lost your patience with your loved one now what does that moment was amplified look the reason why I really advocate for people to wipe away judgment is this\nIf we were really able to walk in other people's shoes if we were really able to live in other people's lives I Do not believe\nThat we would hold the same level of judgment for them\nOnce we really see what's going on now a lot of times we say well I've been through a tough things and I didn't do X Y or Z but you've been through tough things with your own um mind with your own intellectual ability with your own life experiences so sure you've had a tough life but you didn't have that person's life\nWhat you really realize\nThat had you been someone else you would have operated differently you can wipe away judgments so why do these pro athletes lash out for the same reason why you lash out for the same reason why you mess up we mess up in life all of us because we're human\nAnd we hadn't mastered our emotions sometimes we allow our emotions to get the best of us now maybe you allow your emotions to get the best of you when you're hungry when you're tired when you're stressed out well let's think about what that happens neurologically when you're hungry when you're tired when you're stressed out you're operating in a primal part of your brain\nWhen does football players are on the field and the pro athletes are out there they're operating from instinct in a primal part of their brain understanding is awakening it helps us to not judge people\nSo if we know that other people operate or or ... lash out impulsively because they haven't practiced mastering that emotion enough\nAnd we know that we do the same thing instead of spending any time judging others will probably be better served learning what we can do differently ourselves look\nI have this to say about judgment could you imagine if someone took a snap shot of your worst moment in your life and\nBut I have this to say about judgment could you imagine if someone took a snapshot of your worst moment in your life\nAnd they really looked at that worst moment and then the entire world got to see it and then on top of that everyone commented on it and again this is a snap shot of a moment in your life\nNow you may one hundred percent very well be a cat and we are one hundred percent accountable for whatever we do in life in every one of those moments but I'm not sure at least I haven't met yet that person\nWho would really want the worst mistake\nHighlighted for the entire world to see to criticize\nSo before we jump on a bandwagon to criticize people who have made mistakes and we get on our high horse and we give ourselves excuses to be on our high horse well this person did this or this person did that\nI think is really important for us to be mindful of what we bring\nTo situations I think that's the of the most important to be aware of what we have done and when we do that we really can take away that need\nTo judge other for why they might act impulsively\nLook if you're going to park your car you can either go head first or you can take the time to back in and that's a metaphor for life if you\nDo the work out front and you take the time to back in at the beginning it'll be easier for you when you pull out to leave at the end if you go head in first is going to be tougher for you when you some time to leave if you put it in the work out front on how to change change can happen\nIf you want to be a part of the show show eight six six three and I won ten twenty or email us ... radio dot com or Texas at

powerful and those emotions are going to ebb and flow and what happens is one way or another those emotions ebb and flow there will be the impulse to pool others into feel that pain too\nBut one of the most conscious ways you can go through this pain which you end up feeling you know when you go through pain consciously\nYou can't it's not tell you it's going to be easy but when you go through pain consciously you won't have the additional regret for the things that we all have done in our lives when we've lashed out unconsciously at others\nSo the reason why it's important to not react on those impulses toward a anger vengeance type stuff\nIs it'll end up hurting you down the road you'll be like oh why did I Do that you know I was I was in pain I didn't need to do that but that's really where that stems from his pain\nOh definitely I been through many many many many many months to tears and crying and anger and it hurt and you know it's just\nIt's devastating if a guy that I didn't want to do with myself you know and like I said I think a therapist and she's absolutely fantastic and he's helped me get through you know my day to day and he just recently convinced me that that that this other person doesn't even exist that really helped me alive\nOh that's wonderful that's great see I think are such a it's a it's such a a gift to be able to go and talk with counselors um and there are so many wonderful counselors\nOh that's wonderful that's great see I think that's such a it's a it's such a gift to be able to go and talk with counselors um and there are so many wonderful cancers out there that can help you get through it and I think that's a testament\nTo the reality that you can get through tough situations that the reality is that couples go through difficult times and they can go through things like in a ferret actually come out tremendously stronger afterward um it takes a while to go through that hurt\nBut when you do when I'm not saying it's always right to stick with that person 'cause I don't know but if it is right to stick with that person then\nCouples can absolutely because I get this question a lot\nCome out significantly stronger from that because they learn okay this is what kind of had us drifting apart this is what had us both contributing to the relationship not being where is and now here's what we can both do to get it back so if it's the right person and you choose to work on it I Want you to know that yes you absolutely can get stronger through this\nUm and that being said there are also times when it's not the right person you say well no this um the I Need to learn this and not the right person and move on but to be able to have a therapist talk talk you through that and have somebody to bounce ideas off of that's excellent\nYeah yeah well thank you very much for your but\nDefinitely Sherry thank you so much for calling I I really want everybody to notice like even if you could listen to the tone of Sherry's voice what an ... like when she first called there was a lot of\nPain there was a lot of anger there but even toward the end like you could hear the ... the difference in the tone of her voice she has every right in the world to be extremely angry to be extremely hurt\nOr she is entitled to that that is one hundred percent a legitimate to be hurting but the beautiful thing if we can use the word beautiful through pain is that she will learn and she is learning you can hear\nYou can hear that she's learning from it and not making that impulsive choice to bring others down it's really\nIt's very natural for us to want others to hurt when we're hurting\nAnd even though that's natural it's not healthy and an only adds to the chaos of the world let's go to the phone lines on

these you kinda differ ultimately to what do those who are experiencing the grave US law is what would they prefer so a lot of talk back and forth over the past couple of days\nAbout whether or not the president should come here is the welcome to be here there are Jews who were Democrats there are Jews who are Republicans conservative and liberal and varying positions and all the way through in between\nAs well but the president did decide to come today in the rye the few hours ago\nAnd I'm very interested now in an assessment of bond that the president's visit there were many people who were concerned that this would turn somehow into a a a political opportunity and I am now turning to Adam hurts when he's the director of\nMarketing with a Jewish Federation of\nGreater Pittsburgh is joining us now on the disc Institute of Pittsburgh news line and I walk on the kitty K radio good to have you on that I think very much for having me\nAnd my guess is is that you heard from a number of different people within the Jewish community expressing their views about the president coming is there any way of giving an assessment as to where\nThe majority of them happened to lie in at least in the contacts that were made to you and your offices\nThat's interesting you ask that uh we actually recently did a study of the Jewish community\nThat just got original greater Pittsburgh has a foundation and the foundation funded a study that we know from that study that a Jewish Pittsburgh tends to be on the liberal side which is I guess true that's very as a whole so\nA on in terms of number of registered Democrats are registered Republicans you see a lot more [noise]\nI actually heard a\nRelatively even numbers of people on both sides but I think part of that is that most of the people in the Jewish community really are focused at the moment on MORNING and on ... carrying for those who are most in need and not on the politics\n... the president um he is not like any other president to say the least\nAnd it's an interesting thing is that he has tremendous solidarity with a nation of Israel a he and Benjamin Netanyahu very very close very very supportive of the nation but at the same time there was an organization with\nVery strong Jewish roots highest that was originally created to help Jews relocate as refugees now wants to help others do so and then you have this pull back and forth within the community in my close\nNow without a doubt or your you hit right on the mark and we definitely you know we've I heard from people who are extremely angry that Trump came and I heard from people\nWho were elated that Trump came\nYou have to understand that uh the idea of supporting refugees is not just part of Jews history it's actually part of our Jewish tradition or there is a central principle of the Jewish faith which as welcoming the stranger and that principle underlies the idea of\nMaking ... ... actually it is I think I heard the director of the highest say this week\nOnce the Jews were refugees so uh we were helping refugees now we're helping refugees but that's a cycle that's occurred throughout Jewish history as sometimes Jews have been misplaced and the Jews have outs\nJews who are refugees resettle and how other people who\nJewish history as sometimes Jews have been displaced and then Jews have outs other Jews who are refugees subtle and how other people who are not Jewish resettle\nAs well ... and if I may or as a Christian and for those of us who are and recognize the Old Testament the Old Testament is very clear and its

provide insight I have to say that\nUh I was similar to a lot of a chosen Pittsburgh today I think you know that there were funerals today ... for some of the eleven people died\nI was really focused on that\nBut I Do understand that ah\nThe president that some things that I'd say ... or or traditional on it and I would like to ... understand so as an example but it's also\nA typical Christian traditions to lay a wreath but people may have seen the president and the first lady a with a tray of rocks putting rocks down\nOn that's actually part of the Jewish tradition when visiting cemeteries and and and I think that's in keeping with the Jewish tradition to bring\n'em blocks from the place where you've been and place them sort of as a marker of remembrance on a grave marker of of people you love and uh I I think that there was an expectation that the desert be very fraught but I Will tell you\nAll the whole I think more people were focused on the unity and not focused on politics or
