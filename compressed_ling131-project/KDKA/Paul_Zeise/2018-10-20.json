I'm sure he was tortured and killed but you know life over there is not for\nThe uh the fit of blood I mean you know the ... you got to be thick skin to there'll be over there it's I don't see a lot

before he became president\nYou know and and the last night look you know the Saudis about one of our best allies in the middle east\nThey have been one of our you know one of our more uh you know another nation that we could talk to at least get some leverage or some of the other crazy circus atmosphere it's over there I mean it's it's a no win situation as far as I'm concerned\nBut it ain't

the ah\nSaudi business but I I happen to flash on a a strategy that we might be able to take advantage of a ... as we deal with the Saudis and foreign policy\nAnd we can bypass Trump in this whole thing if you know about how the Saudis were a given kingdom status they were\nIn this whole thing if you knew about how the Saudis were a given kingdom status they were basically\nA bunch of sand pirates and that's no joke they were just you know a pack of thugs in the desert in a in fact I think even Mark Twain wrote about them where the ... you know everybody going to mecca would have to pay tolls\nAnd then when we were warlords yeah back in the day back back back in the day yeah\nAnd they were pirates and they would uh you know if you had to make your ... to mecca are you there was a pretty good chance you'd run into these pirates lady there steal everything you've got or you know leave you had in the desert or make slaves you your children or whatever [noise]\nAnd the British when they figured out that there was oil out there and then gave king status to these pirates\nAnd then uh they set up the ... the ... which were the crazy cult or of the ah Islamic religion there was barely a fraction of anybody that belong to the ... because they were so stupid and crazy\nBut the the kingdom of Saudi Arabia was given king status by the British\nAnd so because they had the territory and they wanted the oil and after World War two they were forced to give up their of their status or their colony\nOh they were absolutely lied to by the British and hung out to dry\nYeah absolutely yeah so now let's force the British monarchy to retract their their monarch Ikle status take back their the Saudis king status either that or will go after the British monarchy\nOr so we get we've got a win win opportunity here\nIf the if the Saudi monarchy or is in jeopardy of sick a success or failure at this point\nWhat so let's go after them a ... you know ... in they they have no deserving right to be considered chosen to God that's you know that's how the scam of kings work they claim that God puts them in charge\nRight and and uh so now live vine prominent\nYeah let's give the British the chance to take back their the divine Providence of of the Saudi a king status\nWhile but here's the deal David it won't work for a couple of reasons one Great Britain ain't getting involved in any thing that they don't got to get involved in right now they got enough we can and squabbling with Brexit and number two English soccer league the season's going on nobody's going to
