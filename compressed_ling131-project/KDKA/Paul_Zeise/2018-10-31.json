to happen between now and then because I think it's going to turn into an absolute bucket a hammer it's\nI think I'm going to be honest with the idea I think I think we're on the cusp of some\nSome major major problems in this country and and when you look at a country like for instance like Greece and they had forced austerity on Greece and people were mad people were rioting you haven't seen anything yet until we get\nTo 'em now you're right and okay you're talking about does ... you're talking about unrest you're not talking about economic situations like the forest austerity with grace\nBoth because look you know all these they there was a there was a video somebody did a man on the street thing the other day\nWith grace both because look you know all the they they there was a there was a video somebody did a man on the street thing the other day and they were talking they said\nWell we should open up the borders of all these college students were all for open up the borders letting this caravan and\nYou can't take care of all I could shut eye rescue dogs I have several dogs that I went to the pound every time I go to the pound rescue a dog I say boy I'd like to take home every single one of those dogs but I Know I Can't because I Can't afford it\nWell by now here's here's the argument to the other side of it I Will I'll buy into the austerity thing\nAnd if that's the case the point that it's going to cause problems if if there is going to be more Halliburton and a little bit\nIt's gonna be the fact that there ain't money for that but the corporate profits since the tax break went absolutely astronomically through the roof and people say well you know there's no one employment there's no unemployment because everything paid so low you have to have three jobs that's where the austerity parts gonna come in I honestly\nDan to be completely want I don't think most people are paying attention to the\n[laughter] they should but\nI I think there are much more visceral opinions going on right now\nAbout things that are just cut to the court we are talking about life and death\nI don't get the impression people are looking at the tax breaks for the I mean that's that is the reality of those tax breaks and another reality regarding money real quick since then brought it up when the president said during his campaign where we're looking at a middle class tax cut\nFrom where hey [laughter] 'cause the deficit is higher than ever and the second part of that is a the legislators aren't in session to pass it\n\nAnd if you want to talk about the money side of civil unrest that their that their reasons you could say look this is why that's why but I don't think\nWe're even looking where we're looking at that as a country right now we're screaming at things because of behavior\nMuch easier to get way been out of shape because of behavior and perceived behavior than it is to stare at a ledger with a bunch of numbers but if you want to they're not particularly good either on the subject of civil unrest and the immigration\nThe [laughter]\nThe hum automatic citizenship for people born in the United states\n\nIs being talked about because Mr Trump in an interview said he plans to sign an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies of non citizens and non authorized immigrants born on us soil\nI Believe the first clause of the fourteenth amendment covers that\nAnd people say well you know he should change okay here's the problem if I get to by executive order your race part of the constitutional amendments\nI'm going to hang on to that a racer and I'm going to get the other one's Paul Ryan already said that yeah you you can not in birthright citizenship would be an executive order\nAnd that's

I disagree with half of that I don't think anything that I mean God help us or something happens where I think it will change people's ideas about boating in the next week\nBut at this point I at this point I don't think\nI don't think there's too much possible that's going to change people's minds when they come to boat now well the first part of that where you said you didn't think anybody would get mad\nIf it went the other way I absolutely disagree with you because I saw just as many people yelling about if my mirror meets that guy I'm going to be here is\nIf they were both in a no win situation and had they thought it through it could have been handled a little bit more smoothly on all fronts\nOkay if I said that they wouldn't have gotten mad I misspoke okay I just don't think they would've you know punish the man the voting booth but this is where my question comes and mhm so I sincerely think that the governor and the mayor or just had strong feelings and sentiments\nAbout uh the president's behavior that they believe that he has been making incendiary comments\nAnd ending divisive and even being a demagogue so I Believe in ... this is my question um it's about using social ostracism says Asian\nUs young ... yeah I'm\nAn alienation as a way of discouraging for punishing socially unacceptable behavior so I'm shutting off stress of the nation that goes back as is it from the beginning of time mhm mankind on this planet\nYeah but what so what so you're yeah but so you're listening so you're ... I personally disagree with you I think you're given at a whole lot more credit\nThan the thought process that actually took place but you're talking about being shunned in ostracized mhm [noise]\nThere's so much worse in the world and you can only be ... and you can only be ostracized if you allow yourself to have that happen\nWell I mean what else are they gonna do that's the only tool they have available to them\nBy approaching it in the way that they approached it in a sense that did not put politics in their\nCourt above the dignity and solemn occasion of all of the funerals coming up\nWell it it depends on what you think is the most effective and the most important if they think it's more important to send a message is Sean somebody because their behavior is socially unacceptable and uh then that's just a you know this Asian you have to weigh\nThe you know the ... the decision and and do what you feel is right um so basically my question to you is\nIt ... should a politician\nOr have that uh you know means available to them to Sean somebody if they disapprove of their behavior\nYeah when I have the means to ... by humans Sean anybody you want I'm thinking of Dwight ... case route and the office Sean and Sean\nBut here's the reality if you shorten someone\nAnd they don't care it has no effect if you shorten someone it might be a legally be easy to squint and see that you now made it politics in your shining of the other person\nIf the president comes in on Thursday\nYou now made it politics in your ... of the other person if the president comes in on Thursday this is a lot less of this kind of discussion\nBecause by Thursday and then the first thing I thought was you want to show your respects show your respects after the ... and after deserve is\nBy by all accounts how it was handled and and the behavior was what you would expect and what you would want\nEight six six three nine one ten twenty [laughter] nah I okay this is where my brain

minute wait a minute have you been drinking\n[laughter] two more years old\n[laughter] All right All right [laughter] no no not any bigger than any other Tuesday I maintain and write on\nExactly but no I I I personally believe the Trump shared a way that both are they I'm no fan mhm oh get clear on front but here's the thing okay now this is what I picked up over the last few days is when\nHe originally put forth a plan to come here on Tuesday mhm was it was cold by by nerve to do that but I'm not going to have the staff to provide for you and the generals\nI worked for funerals going on today plus I've got you coming down I don't have the manpower\nTo do this and as a result I Would do request you do it in another time and Trump just ignored him you know well\nBy the I'm not I'm not defending now and I'm a I'm not defending it what you're saying is correct but\nHave you at any point in the er into Donald Trump presidency gotten the impression that if somebody request something different than his current plans that he's going to change his mind certainly not a Democrat requesting you to do something different [noise]\nRight right you're right you're right and but I think the thing about it though is you know he came here in his words to show respect to the families and he's just back to the city [noise] okay well the city just ask you something to do\nAnd you know what would I how is that showing respect\nHow how are you guys by coming here today where you were told it could be the worst possible time for you to come here how you showing the city in these

with hundred acres men are joining us on the disc Institute of Pittsburgh news line titled thank you very much for your time thank you\nDo appreciate it's getting K radio news time is six forty one earlier today I had an opportunity to talk to Bruce and Kobe a key is professor of law over at St Vincent college and I wanted to talk about a couple of things one was the presidents\nAnd is this issue of the fourteenth amendment is it possible with the stroke of a pen for the president to actually change any aspect of this and here's ... was his response I Would not\nBe surprised to see the president signed the executive order if he does it will be immediately challenged\nBecause the president simply does not have the final authority to interpret the fourteenth amendment final authority to interpret the fourteenth amendment and every other provision of the constitution lives in the United States Supreme court\nAnd so what he believes that clause of the fourteenth amendment says\nNow what's interesting too is that I was asking him about this yesterday if you had a chance to listen to him I had him on around five o'clock the one issue that people are focusing on very hardly on the fourteenth amendment is subject to the jurisdiction there of and the way\nHe says\nThat applies issue anyone that's here\nJurisdiction there of and the way he says that that applies to anyone that's here\nThat is here as say a I'm a diplomat diplomats are not subject to our laws you've heard diplomatic immunity right well they're not subject to us so their children that would be born here are not\nUs citizens others and he also said that they were envisioning the possibilities of even a military being here for whatever reason that would be maybe a invading military they obviously does that will be born here would not be us citizens because they were born here of their occupation\nNow when it comes to a military sense however um others they're subject to the jurisdiction of their cars military that would be here as it invading would that be subject to our government laws I mean it'd be a completely different issue it'd be a military thing completely uh everyone who comes into this country\nWhether they call them undocumented or you called them illegal they're subject to every one of our laws I mean think of a law that an immigrant legal or illegal isn't subject to\nEvery single one of them so how could that cause not apply to them doesn't make any sense and besides if it's going to be challenged immediately\nAnd it's not going to go anywhere then what's the point oh that's right there was an election coming up\nIn less than a week also uh we talked to Bruce ... about the governor and his issue of uh wanting to see the maximum punishment brought down on the shooter from Saturday but at the same time in this state\nYou can't get the maximum punishment by law by law it is the death penalty but he has a moratorium on it\nI'm just surprised that he said he wanted to maximum punishment by law considering he's not willing to allow that to occur on a state prosecution basis\n\nYour reaction send me a text eight six six three nine one at ten twenty eight six six

said access getting paid on complex getting back to the dollar mortgage our news radio funny ha\nWelcome back to the dollar backed mortgage our minds you know along with Mike Henry senior vice president of residential lending a dollar bank\nAnd like you were mentioning about how dollar bank is a four point seven five percent right now when the thirty year fixed rate mortgage where the national average is five percent maybe a little over five percent in some areas how is it the dollar bank is able to be a market leader like\nThis well first of its it's by choice as much as we can um but we're mutual savings bank and what that means is we have no stockholders so we're not required to\nUh you know worry about the earnings were going to give back to the shareholders we can pass along the the income savings to our customers in the form of lower interest rates and better deposit rates so mortgages ... is a big division of dollar bank and very important loan for us to have been as as a mutual savings bank\nUm that's part of our mission is homeownership and savings so um that is something in the forefront that we feel that it's good for the community to offer competitive loan products and so by not having to share revenue the shareholders\nUm we can pass that along to customers in the form of lower interest rates and we'd portfolio a lot of our loans what does that mean that means we're not selling them to another investor so example\nYou know there is some activity we do with Fannie Mae the thirty year fixed rate may be sold to Fannie Mae has an asset but you're we're still servicing your loan that that is transparent do as a consumer\nBut any other loan products we really put into our portfolio so we're making that decision to hold that loan for the term\nAnd that is how the bank makes money off of the interest rate in Russia for that matter to a consumer well we're going to have a concert we have a mutual investment here as opposed to us\nYou know giving you a mortgage and selling it some someone else or we're going to make sure you're in a product that you can repay um we're going to be servicing you're alone you'd be able to talk to us daily if you want to do or ... what are you stop at a branch they can look up you're alone\nUm you you're not going to be pushed around to different lenders and have problems with us grows and things like that will always be able to to help you so you know we have obviously a vested interest in that mortgage debt that is not something we just simply originate sell to somebody else\nEven though you're very aggressive when it comes to interest rates and you're also very aggressive and helping people get mortgages where they may have been told no someplace else right but at the same time you have a very low default rate and you have a great confidence in the loans that you make the people in their ability to repay and not get them into\nThe very low default rate and you have a great confidence in the loans that you make the people and their ability to repay and not get them into a loan that they can\nRight exactly and that's done by this good underwriting we never have strayed from good underwriting and that is qualifying the bar or a boat that's also helping you structure the loan to be approved finding options for you that\nUm that that will work you know maybe there's an obstacle there that we try to find a solution to help you qualify for the mortgage so it's working with you on structuring the transaction and combined with underwriting fact underwriters we'll\nWe'll look at all and come back we'll maybe it'd be better if we did this and we're doing that usually up front with a loan officer but many times you underwriter will make a suggestion\nWhy don't we do this and that way I can approve this slum so\nYou know we're looking at all the details of every line is not of you know it's not a machine looking at is not a factory where we're just trying to get as many loans through as we possibly can we are looking at every loan to make sure\nThat the ... loan for you\nAnd that you will be able to repay this loan but we offer a hundred percent financing we offer three percent down alone so we always have and that's never really been an issue we didn't we didn't participate in the subprime mortgage business and so we've been able to sustain a mortgage portfolio with a low default rate the entire time all the way through even today\nWe're about you know I'd say\nSixty Seventy percent lower than the national average on an even the delinquency like a thirty day late so it's a very low um our actual charge off or you know to go to foreclosures below a ball point four percent or something like that are on tier\nWe hold all these loans so that's a very low so um that the advantage to a consumer is that you're not going to be put into alone just simply to get it through the factory that maybe it's not best for you or that you can't afford\nYou know and you talk about being a aggressive in helping people get into loans I was speaking with a friend of mine over the weekend and they were concerned about how much money that their child in the family that that that the child in the in the in line and the grandbaby know how much they were paying and rent\nAnd now they don't have great enough credit in order to get a loan and they don't have a big enough down payment and as we're talking I said well knit credit score north of six hundred oh yeah\nA couple of thousand dollars in the bank oh yeah what did you know that dollar bank has programs perfect for them if they're in the income level and had no idea that's one thing is I Love about dollar bank is that you are so helpful and people who believe they're stuck renting and can't get into a home making their dreams come true yeah\nAbsolutely you you should never tell yourself no um and we have seen every scenario it's not you're not going to tell us or show us anything that we haven't seen before\nUm and it's as though if you have a a small down payment or your credit score is not as high as you know seven forty or an eight hundred we have plenty of loan programs in fact\nOur average credit score on our F ha loans is like six Seventy\n... below six eighty is still considered in\nIn the industry kinda marginal or a little bit below good credit I'm we're seven forty and hires considered excellent credit\nOr we offer if ha financing with credit scores is low five eighty\nSo if there's a good good ... factors that help approval on credit score is not the ultimate um if you have a very low credit score you your options are limited it's going to be a little bit harder um and so we have a program to help you improve your credit score or through our credit counseling within the bank\nAnd we're the only banks that have inhouse credit counseling so we're going to help you if that's if that's a barrier right\nYour credit score through our credit

self employed or we need to see a history of that income to calculate an income so that's a little bit different but they're coming out of college getting a salary job we can use that salary to help you qualify\nNow what about those who are beyond the first time homebuyer or they had been doing this they know what they want and they don't want an entry level home they're looking at a home\nThat is maybe north of a half million dollars what's different about what their needs are as compared to maybe those who are first time homebuyers or even the majority of the people that come and get loans with you considering that\nThe the average loan amount as everyone wonders Seventy five thousand dollars\nYeah and and really at this year as a very low year in the industry for first time homebuyers in it represented about thirty five percent of all people buying homes applying for a mortgage for first time homebuyers while that's sixty five percent of them weren't so they may be are you doing and selling their home\nBuilding a new home or buying a higher price Tom\nSo it's a different scenario there we have some equity that you're hopefully that you have in your current home when you're selling it using that equity as part of your down payment and closing costs\nSo it there's different structure different options you start to look at if you have that larger downpayment our average actually is as close to ten percent down so we have some customers who are putting fifty percent down or more [noise]\nUm and then we have the other you're five percent down so you're mostly looking at conventional financing rarely would you see F ha used when you're moving up in price especially anything higher than three hundred thousand or four hundred thousand\nUm we we look at you know it was a fixed rate good for you or maybe an adjustable rate does not when you're talking higher loan amounts the adjustable rate mortgages starts to look attractive\nAnd they're not the kind of adjustable rate mortgage we're going to have a surprise some day in this giant giant payment or that you're not able to afford in our most common or most popular I should say is the five year farm we ... we offer three or five year and seven year\nWhen those are thirty year loans but they're fixed at a below market interest rate for you to three years five years for seven years and three and the five because of the yield curve are basically the same so we were really looking at a five or seven\nSo the interest rate on a five year arms today is three point eight Seventy five percent so if you're four hundred thousand five hundred thousand or even higher that's a very attractive interest rate or for the first five years of your alone\nAt the end to five years it does become a one year adjustable meaning it can adjust each year\nBut we do have caps on this mortgage that it can't go out more than two percent in a year and no more than five percent over the life of the loan and that is based on the one you're liable or which is due to change here in several years to some other index but\nAh is the one you alive or plus two point two five percent so it's possible if interest rates were to stay relatively low the may not even experience the adjustments um so that's there's ... it's not always going to go up\nInterest rates were to stay relatively low the may not even experience the adjustments um so that's there's ... it's not always going to go up that's not always a given 'em\nWell help people understand something why would someone go with a adjustable rate mortgage instead of having that confidence and assurance of having a thirty year fixed rate mortgage\nWell first of all we rarely does anybody make all three hundred and sixty payments on a mortgage that's Thirty years you're probably doing something either\nMoving buying a new house\nOr downsizing refinancing the average life of mortgage is still around eight years in the United states so people have thirty or loans that only the key for maybe eight years on average\nHarry\n\nKind of effect they can't contain all this free on in these before", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Paul Zeise", "city":
